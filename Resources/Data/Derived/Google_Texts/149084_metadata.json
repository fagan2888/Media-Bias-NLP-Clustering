Rick Perry, who still aspires to be president and is only recently returned from visits to England and Israel, headed to Iowa to speak at a Polk County Republican fundraising event.\n\nAs the AP reported from Des Moines, \"This time, there were no satellite TV trucks, media throngs or fawning Republicans awaiting his arrival. But Texas Gov. Rick Perry's return to Iowa, where he left last year a defeated Republican presidential candidate, sounded very much like a potential candidate reintroducing himself and appealing for a second chance.\"\n\nSome more from the AP report:\n\nAs he weighs whether to run for president again, Perry returned Thursday to this leadoff presidential caucus state for the first time since his flameout during his first White House bid last year. His arrival was much more muted than before.\n\n\n\nxxxxxxx The stakes are high, given how far and fast Perry fell before.\n\n\n\n\"Making a first impression a second time is hard, very hard,\" said David Carney, Perry's chief strategist as governor and in his 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nPerry's speech wasn't new, but its closing was lofty and serious. He also seized on America's contempt for Washington, especially in light of the partial federal shutdown last month. \"We've got to turn away from Washington to find the answers.\"\n\n\n\nA full year before those caucuses, rumors spread about a possible Perry campaign as Republicans looked for an alternative to front-runner Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nWith folksy charm and an outsider's pitch, the conservative Perry didn't get into the race until the summer of 2011. During his first Iowa visit that August just after announcing his candidacy, he was smothered by media and photo-grabbing GOP activists as he moved from table to table at a Republican banquet in northern Iowa.\n\n\n\nIt was a relatively late arrival into the campaign that hindered his ability to simultaneously raise money, build an organization and prepare for looming national debates.\n\n\n\nHe ended up introducing himself nationally with shaky debate performances and infamous \"Oops\" moment when he couldn't recall one of the three federal agencies he had promised to eliminate as president.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, after accusing federal officials of forgetting how to lead, he laughed at the now-famous gaffe.\n\n\n\n\"And believe me, I know something about forgetting,\" he said.\n\n\n\nPerry finished fifth in the leadoff Iowa caucuses last year and quit the race two weeks later.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let us pause here to recall, via Double Down, the very engaging new book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, just how large Perry loomed the first time around.\n\nRick Perry\u2019s pulchritude was beyond dispute, but it accounted for only part of of the Republican fascination with him. Born in the West Texas town of Paint Creek, rasied in a house without indoor plumbing, he was folksy and swaggering at sixty-one, a natural populist who boasted about packing \u201ca Ruger .380 with laser sights and loaded with hollow-point bullets\u201d and once using it to fell a coyote that crossed his path. Lone Star State liberals mocked Perry as a nimrod; the late columnist Molly Ivins dubbd him Governor Goodhair. But since 1984, he had stood in ten contested elections \u2013 for state representative, agriculture commissioner, lieutenant governor, and governor \u2013 and won them all. Having secured this third statehouse term in 2010, Perry was the longest-serving governor in the country and in Texas history. (note: Rick Perry's Pulchritude would be an excellent name for a band.)\n\nHalperin and Heilemann write about how, on the eve of the first \"toe-to-toe\" debate between Perry and the man he had, at least temporarily, supplanted as the front-runner, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, at the Ronald Reagan Library, Perry had succeeded in getting into Romney's head.\n\nHere, for example, an exchange between Romney and top adviser, Stuart Stevens. (For Stevens review of Double Down, and another book on the campaign, The Gamble, at The Daily Beast, go here.)\n\nDon\u2019t let him psych you out, Stevens said. You\u2019re so much better that he is. You\u2019re gonna kill him. Don\u2019t tell me that, Romney snapped. He\u2019s a natural. He was great at the Iowa State Fair. Give me a break, Stevens said, his voice rising. He\u2019s an agriculture commissioner who went to an ag fair! He's an accidental governor! Just go out there and be the hunter! You keep telling me this race is all about jobs and the economy, Romney retorted. He\u2019s got a great jobs record in Texas He\u2019s got a great narrative. Don\u2019t underestimate him! He\u2019s the guy George Bush thinks is an idiot! Stevens said, now shouting.\n\nRomney, the authors write, came out of his debate in Simi Valley feeling more confident about his ability to defeat Perry.\n\nBut for Romney\u2019s strategist, the memory that stuck from the evening wasn\u2019t what took place on television. It was something Stevens said he\u2019d witnessed on-site before the debate. Perry, clearly in pain, requiring help from two members of his security detail to get up a short flight of steps. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with him,\u201d Stevens told Romney. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Mitt. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cbut I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nDouble Down lends strong credence to the view that it was Perry's very painful and difficult recovery from back surgery - which left him unable to sleep well or to maintain his essential jogging regimen - that did him in.\n\nReporting on a crucial debate in Orlando, they write:\n\nThe morning of the debate, September 22, Perry\u2019s team learned he hadn\u2019t caught a wink the night before. In the holding room, (Dave) Carney and (Rob) Johnson girded for trouble. What they got was a disaster.\n\nIt was the debate in which Perry defended in-state tuition for students who were not in the country legally.\n\nPerry had been copiously prepared for this attack, which had come up in Tampa, too. And the start of his answer, touting this commitment to border security, was uncontroversial. But then Perry went further, blurting out a sentiment that none of his aides had ever heard him enunciate before. \u201cIf you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they\u2019ve been brought there by no fault of their own,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have a heart.\u201d For Perry\u2019s advisers, the debate was now effectively over. Providing in-state tuition to the kids of undocumented workers was a defensible position, if not popular one among Republican primary votes. But calling those who disagreed heartless was an act of political suicide. Perry wasn\u2019t quite finished committing verbal seppuku, however.\n\nSeppuku is a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment.\n\nNow back to Rick Perry in Iowa 2013.\n\nFrom one of several reports in the Des Moines Register. (There is also a gorgeous photo of Perry and his newish glasses accompanying this story. I know I've been making a big fuss about how much the glasses in every way enhance the governor's look, but that's because I don't think you can overstate how good they are.)\n\nThe best chance for Republicans to retake the White House is by working together and \u201cfinding our middle ground,\u201d Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in Iowa today. Perry was the conservative\u2019s conservative in the 2012 presidential battle.\n\n\n\nWhen he stormed onto the Iowa scene as a big-footing latecomer two years ago, his tea party beliefs and ability to connect with evangelical Christian voters were considered to be among his best assets for stomping Mitt Romney in the fight for the GOP nomination.\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s no shortage of that kind of conservative in the 2016 crop, and Perry\u2019s strategy for outshining the others is centered now on rebranding himself as the guiding spirit of the Texas economic success story. xxxxxx\n\n\n\nAsked about the debate du jour on the rift between the tea party wing of the GOP and center-right, establishment-leaning Republicans, Perry answered: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a purity test.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that most Republicans do fall into the camp of, \u2018Listen, if you don\u2019t win, you can\u2019t govern.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t make any difference if you\u2019re here or over here in the spectrum. I\u2019m a big believer in that. Let\u2019s win the elections.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut which kind of Republican might be more successful winning the presidency in 2016? A tea partier or someone closer to the center?\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of them have a better chance of winning by themselves,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI think it takes all of them working together. I\u2019d rather have a half a loaf than no loaf. And so, finding our middle ground \u2013 listen, I\u2019m a big believer that most Republicans, most conservatives don\u2019t think that the answers are going to be found in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her report in the Register on Perry's speech - recorded for posterity by C-SPAN - Kathie Obradovich reported:\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry delivered a brief but harsh tongue-lashing to the Obama administration and Washington politicians tonight in a 13-minute speech in Des Moines. Perry skipped most of the usual preliminaries and shoutouts to local politicians, failing to even mention Senate candidate Matt Whitaker, who worked for his Iowa campaign. He did, however, profess to enjoy his time campaigning in Iowa in 2011.\n\nxxxxxxx\n\n\n\n\u201cI have some really fond memories of campaigning here, competing in the Iowa caucuses. The only thing I really regret is taking a really big bite out of that veggie corndog at the Iowa State Fair,\u201d Perry said.\n\nxxxxxx\n\nPerry poked a bit of fun of himself as well. \u201cOur leaders have forgotten how to govern. And believe me, I know a few things about forgettin\u2019,\u201d he said. Perry was apparently referring to his \u201coops\u201d moment during a campaign debate, when he forgot one of the three federal agencies he wanted to eliminate.\n\n\n\nPerry made all of the rounds today in Des Moines that one might expect of a potential 2016 candidate. He met with business leaders, Gov. Terry Branstad and attended a private reception before tonight\u2019s dinner. He did a bunch of media interviews and was energetic and engaging.\n\n\n\nTonight\u2019s speech was frequently interrupted by applause and it seemed to hit the right note with this crowd. It was not, however, the attention-getting, memorable event that will have Iowa Republicans hankering for a Perry reprisal. While most people appreciate brevity, it seemed like Perry missed an opportunity. He was scheduled for about 35 minutes, live on C-SPAN. He didn\u2019t come close to making the most of his time.\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay to shake hands and talk to people afterward, either. That\u2019s the sort of omission that Iowa Republicans notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in the Register, Jennifer Jacobs did a 20-minute interview with Perry that included \"a speed round of lighter qusetions,\" in which Perry revealed that his greatest phobia was snakes.\n\nPerry: Whats the old movie line? Snakes? Couldn't it have been anything but snakes? Was that Indiana Jones? I think it was. I hate snakes. It's a reason to run with a pistol.\n\nAlso:\n\nQ. Can you describe yourself in three words? A. Father, soldier, statesman. Q. Whats your favorite music or favorite band? A. I've got to say my favorite band is The Who. I'm a child of the 60s. Q. What are one or two of your worst bad habits? A. I've pretty much tried to give up all my bad habits. My wife would tell you my bad habit is, put down your iPhone and pay attention. Q. What do you do to unwind after a long day at work? A. From time to time, go sit out on the porch and have a Shiner Bock.\n\nGood morning Todd, how are you?\n\nOn Friday morning, Gov. Perry, still in Iowa, appeared on MSNBC's The Daily Rundown with host Chuck Todd, the highlight of which was his reference to Todd as Todd - as opposed to Chuck - in both his opening line, above, and closing line - \"Thank you Todd.\"\n\nHere is the Huffington Post's report\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for this:\n\n1) Knowing he was on hostile turf on MSNBC, Perry was trying to signal his disinterest or hostility to all things MSNBC, including the full names, or correct order of the names, of its talent. Maybe he was trying to subtly get under Todd's skin. 2) Let's face it. The man has two first names. He must, by now, be used to being called Chuck when he should be called Todd and Todd when he should be called Chuck, though I must admit Todd Chuck doesn't work nearly as well as Chuck Todd. 3) Perry was confused.\n\nMeanwhile, next up for Perry for President 2016 - South Carolina.\n\nFrom Katie Glueck at Politico:\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry, fresh off a speech in Iowa, is going to another early 2016 state next month.\n\n\n\nHe will head to Spartanburg, S.C. for a winter dinner and conservative banquet on Dec. 3, the South Carolina Republican Party and the Spartanburg County Republican Party announced on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRUZ GOES HOLLYWOOD\n\nTed Cruz had his Tonight Show debut Friday night. Here it is in two parts, 1 and 2, in what added up to about 9 minutes of air time. It was fairly serious discussion in which a skeptical, and what I thought a very well-prepared and engaged Leno, challenged Cruz on Obamacare, the government shutdown, his father's pronouncements, social issues, the tea party and the importance of compromise\n\nCruz: My view on compromise is actually exactly the same as Ronald Reagan's was. Reagan said, \"What do yo do if they offer you half a loaf? Answer, you take it and then you come back for more.'\" Leno: I don't think Ronald Reagan could get into the tea party today. Cruz: I don't think that's right at all.\n\nBased on the applause, the audience seemed divided in their opinion of Cruz.\n\n(This post has been edited to correct some typographical errors.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "None", "og": {"url": "http://www.statesman.com/weblogs/first-reading/2013/nov/09/dotting-his-is-back-israel-rick-perry-does-iowa/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/11/09/f9/e0/cruzleno3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gov.
