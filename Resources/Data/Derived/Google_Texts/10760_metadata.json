Texas, the case in which 26 states are challenging the Obama administration\u2019s authority to grant temporary lawful presence for up to 5.5 million illegal aliens.\n\nThis will be one of the biggest cases of the Supreme Court term ending in June, both for its legal and political outcomes. Here is what you need to know.\n\nAt the most basic level, this case is about stopping yet another President Obama end-run around Congress. In accordance with its constitutional authority, Congress has established an elaborate immigration scheme governing which aliens may enter the United States, how long they may stay, and which aliens must be removed. Obama and the Democrats do not like Congress\u2019 immigration scheme, but they lack the votes to change it.\n\nObama\u2019s solution to his immigration proposals\u2019 lack of popularity was to simply ignore Congress. On November 20, 2014, at Obama\u2019s direction, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memo purporting to lay out a new form of immigration relief called Deferred Action For Parents of Americans, also known by its acronym, \u201cDAPA.\u201d\n\nLegalizing and Subsidizing Anchor Babies Under DAPA, certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States could obtain temporary lawful status if, among other things, they have a child who is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. In other words, for the first time, the Obama administration brought the \u201canchor baby\u201d concept into practice in the United States.\n\nThese two statuses come with a host of federal and state benefits. Under the DAPA program, a successful alien applicant gets two things from DHS: \u201cdeferred action,\u201d which confers temporary lawful status, and work authorization. But these two statuses come with a host of other federal and state benefits, including Social Security retirement benefits, Social Security disability benefits, Medicare, the Earned Income Tax Credit, state driver\u2019s licenses, and state unemployment insurance. Setting aside the federal costs, the states (or, rather, the states\u2019 hardworking taxpayers) would end up paying millions of dollars because of DAPA.\n\nSo Texas and 25 partner states promptly sued to block this plan. The preliminary injunction hearing before the district court took place on January 9, 2015. We\u2019re barely past one year later, and already the Supreme Court has agreed to resolve the case. That is an extraordinarily fast pace for a very complicated case. Legally, there are four moving pieces to this, and any one of them could be the deciding issue.\n\nOpposition Based on Procedure and Substance The states\u2019 argument is goes to the heart of the matter. First, Obama and Johnson cannot simply will into existence new federal programs at any time they choose. Congress, in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), required federal agencies to use what is called notice-and-comment rule-making when they promulgate new substantive rules.\n\nObama and Johnson cannot simply will into existence new federal programs at any time they choose. Put another way, the executive branch can\u2019t announce new programs of its own devising without first asking the American public for comment and then responding to those comments. Johnson did not utilize notice-and-comment rule-making before creating DAPA, so his memo directing DHS to create DAPA violates the law. This is what is known as the states\u2019 procedural APA claim, and it is the basis of the district court\u2019s ruling in the case.\n\nSecond, the states also have a substantive APA claim. This argument, which persuaded the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, is that Congress never authorized DHS to create DAPA in the first place. So, whether DAPA requires notice-and-comment or not, DHS cannot create the program.\n\nThis too is indisputably true. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) creates several forms of immigration relief, including temporary statuses, and when it does, it does so by name. For example, asylum, adjustment of status, cancellation of removal, the visa provisions, waivers, and conditional statuses are all explicitly provided for in voluminous statutory text.\n\nINA is a fractal monstrosity decades in the making and unmaking, but DAPA is not in there. Nor is the Obama administration\u2019s newfound authority to grant work authorization to anyone it chooses. Congress specifically prescribed the groups to whom work authorization should be given. DAPA recipients are not one of them.\n\nA Constitutional Question Over the President\u2019s Job Description Third, the states are making a substantive constitutional argument under the Take Care Clause. This claim deserves special note because neither the district court nor the Fifth Circuit found it necessary to rule on it, but the Supreme Court ordered the states and the federal government to brief it anyway. This idea is that by ignoring the expressed will of Congress, DAPA violates the constitutional command that the executive branch \u201cshall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n\nDAPA violates the constitutional command that the executive branch \u2018shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u2019 Over the years, the courts have been loath to resolve Take Care Clause challenges, but if the liberal wing of the high court resolves the statutory challenges in the federal government\u2019s favor, it will have no choice but to address the constitutional challenge.\n\nThe states\u2019 Take Care claim goes like this: not only is DAPA not authorized by Congress (that\u2019s the substantive APA challenge discussed above), DAPA is in fact directly contrary to the expressed will of Congress. Congress explicitly provided that a U.S. citizen (or lawful permanent resident) child of an illegal alien could not be the basis for legalizing an alien parent\u2019s immigration status until the child turned 21 years of age unless, among other things, the removal of the parent would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the child.\n\nCongress wanted it to be quite difficult for aliens to leverage U.S.-born children into lawful immigration status. DAPA ignores this policy goal and grants lawful status regardless of the age and hardship restrictions established by Congress in violation of the executive branch duty to take care that the laws of Congress be faithfully executed.\n\nJust Change Your Laws and There\u2019s No Problem For its part, the Obama administration\u2019s major defense is that it need not have a defense on the merits. The administration has mustered only half-baked theories (not to mention outright debunked claims) in response to the states\u2019 procedural and substantive arguments. Instead, the administration argues that the states do not have standing to challenge the DAPA program in court.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s major defense is that it need not have a defense on the merits. Its theory is that Texas (as well as the other states) is not harmed because Texas need only change its laws that provide driver\u2019s licenses, unemployment insurance, and other things for people who the federal government deem lawfully present. That way, the federal government argues, Texas can avoid the cost of paying for the freshly legalized DAPA recipients.\n\nBut this argument goes too far. It was not Texas\u2019 preexisting laws that altered the status quo; it was the Obama administration\u2019s unilateral and unlawful implementation of a new immigration relief for illegal aliens that gave rise to Texas\u2019 injury. Moreover, the Obama administration just won a lawsuit it brought against Arizona when that state tried to deny driver\u2019s licenses to the newfound beneficiaries of Obama\u2019s immigration largess.\n\nPrime Presidential Election Positioning Do not be misled by the claims of Obama and the Democrats that he was forced to act because Congress would not. This is not an area in which Congress had been silent. To the contrary, Congress\u2019 immigration scheme is comprehensive. Even though Congress delegated authority to DHS to administer specific forms of immigration relief, it did not leave room for the agency to create new forms of immigration relief. That is Congress\u2019 role alone, and by usurping that role, the Obama administration violated its statutory and constitutional duties.\n\nThe Obama administration violated its statutory and constitutional duties. This case is also not about a government policy of prosecutorial discretion versus a strict policy of deportation. The states have not challenged DHS\u2019 prosecutorial discretion to not prioritize the removal of certain illegal aliens. Instead, this case is about whether DHS can grant benefits in contravention of the immigration scheme established by Congress. The grant of benefits is an affirmative agency action, and under the law there is a strong presumption that courts can review agency action.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 07:39:34 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Twenty-six states have sued the Obama administration for directly contradicting law and inflicting taxpayers with millions for illegal immigration.", "title": "The Skinny On The Supreme Court\u2019s New Immigration Case", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shutterstock_355423769.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-26T07:46:41+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2016/01/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-supreme-courts-new-immigration-case/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Twenty-six states have sued the Obama administration for directly contradicting law and inflicting taxpayers with millions for illegal immigration.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shutterstock_355423769.jpg"}, "title": "The Skinny On The Supreme Court\u2019s New Immigration Case", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Law", "tag": "anchor babies,DAPA,deferred action,Deferred Action for Parents of Americans,Executive Action,executive orders,executive overreach,illegal immigrants,Illegal Immigration,Immigration,Supreme Court,United States v.
