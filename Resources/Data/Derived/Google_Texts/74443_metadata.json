Wade, which greatly restricted abortion laws.\n\nObama\u2019s statement was as unapologetic as it was grotesque, celebrating an abominable procedure that ought to be outlawed \u2014 not glamorized, as the left does with it. Before you accuse me of hyperbole, be advised that Democratic National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz wished Roe v. Wade a happy 41st birthday. \u201cHappy\u201d?\n\nObama said, \u201cToday, as we reflect on the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, we recommit ourselves to the decision\u2019s guiding principle: that every woman should be able to make her own choices about her body and her health.\n\n\u201cWe reaffirm our steadfast commitment to protecting a woman\u2019s access to safe, affordable health care and her constitutional right to privacy, including the right to reproductive freedom.\n\n\u201cAnd we resolve to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, support maternal and child health, and continue to build safe and healthy communities for all our children, because this is a country where everyone deserves the same freedom and opportunities to fulfill their dreams.\u201d\n\nNo one is trying to interfere with women\u2019s autonomy over their own bodies, except when another body and life is involved. It is sheer sophistry and misdirection to argue that abortion opponents are on a crusade against women\u2019s liberty. This formulation conveniently \u2014 and repugnantly \u2014 factors out of the equation the innocent child involved.\n\nIt is dishonest for Obama to couch this issue in terms of women\u2019s health. Most pro-lifers, in fact, acknowledge an exception in those rare cases when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Women\u2019s health isn\u2019t the issue, and pro-abortionists know that. The only thing interfering with a woman\u2019s \u201cchoices about her \u2026 health\u201d these days is Obamacare. If maximizing health care choices were what is driving Obama, he would repeal Obamacare.\n\nNor does abortion have anything to do with privacy under any stretch of the English language; I don\u2019t care what the misguided Supreme Court said to the contrary in 1973. No amount of rhetorical legalese on \u201cemanations\u201d and \u201cpenumbras\u201d can pollute our common sense into believing that a woman has a right to terminate the life of an innocent child she is carrying as a matter of constitutional privacy. No wonder some people have contempt for lawyers.\n\nObama has the audacity to talk about safe and healthy communities for all our children? Aborted babies are children, and Obama and his pro-abortionists are not making any of them safe. Indeed, since Roe, an estimated 55 million babies have been snuffed out in the name of women\u2019s choice and health and now children\u2019s safety? Now that\u2019s chutzpah! The number of babies killed in abortions in New York City in 2010 (83,750) would fill the seats in MetLife Stadium, where the Super Bowl is scheduled to be played this year.\n\nBut perhaps the most offensive sentence in Obama\u2019s statement was the last one, in which he attempted to fold the right to abortion into the American dream. Has he no shame? No amount of presidential spin will alter the irreversible fact that 55 million Americans were never given an opportunity to fulfill their dreams. How could any human being believe that preserving legal protection for other human beings to terminate the lives of yet other human beings is giving them an \u201copportunity to fill their dreams\u201d? Are some people so dark-hearted that they consider killing babies an opportunity to fulfill dreams?\n\nIt is high time that people who can still find their moral compass through the nihilistic morass that is corrupting our culture start speaking out and quit allowing the left to turn our values, our language and, yes, our sanity on their heads. Postmodernism and moral relativism will lead to the destruction of all three, as the late Malcolm Muggeridge prophetically observed.\n\nSome other civilizations, Muggeridge noted, were destroyed by external forces, but Western man has \u201chad the unique distinction of training its own destroyers at its own educational institutions, and then providing them with facilities for propagating their destructive ideology far and wide, all at the public expense. Thus did Western Man decide to abolish himself, creating his own boredom out of his own affluence, his own vulnerability out of his own strength, his own impotence out of his own erotomania, himself blowing the trumpet that brought the walls of his own city tumbling down, and having convinced himself that he was too numerous, labored with pill and scalpel and syringe to make himself fewer. Until at last, having educated himself into imbecility, and polluted and drugged himself into stupefaction, he keeled over \u2014 a weary, battered old brontosaurus \u2014 and became extinct.\u201d\n\nDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author and attorney.
