Former governor Rick Perry, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, responded during a speech at the American Principles Project: \u201cHe is right! We are crazy!\u201d he enthused. \u201cWe\u2019re crazy about jobs, we\u2019re crazy about opportunity, we\u2019re crazy about liberty, we\u2019re crazy about the Constitution!\u201d Charles Murray, the libertarian American Enterprise Institute scholar who hails from Iowa, weighed in by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of Texas as the place that is still most like America,\u201d pointing to the self-reliant, can-do spirit the state still represents. Florida governor Rick Scott also joined in, noting that he has often cited Texas as a tax-cutting role model; then he joked about out-dueling Perry as a jobs generator.\n\nWhile the recent 50 percent drop in oil prices has taken some of the bluster out of Texas\u2019s bragging, the state\u2019s stats are still beyond impressive. Last month, it created 45,700 new jobs. Most of them were in parts of the diversified economy that aren\u2019t related to energy. Texas continues to see solid job growth in trade and professional services as well as in the hospitality industry.\n\nIndeed, between 2007 and 2014 \u2014 the period covering the recession and the slow recovery that followed \u2014 Texas created 1.4 million net new jobs. During the same period, the rest of the nation wound up losing 400,000 jobs. The falling nationwide unemployment rate is largely the function of people\u2019s exiting the work force entirely.\n\nSmall wonder that in December, Canada\u2019s Fraser Institute ranked Texas first of all the states in its level of economic freedom, as measured by the size of government, taxation, regulation, and the rule of law. Texas Public Policy Foundation Director of Policy Chuck DeVore says the study\u2019s findings show that \u201cTexas\u2019s having America\u2019s highest level of economic freedom is a strong confirmation that prosperity and freedom go hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nDevore notes that critics of Texas often cite the fact that the jobs Texas creates often are entry-level \u2014 about 6 percent of the state\u2019s hourly wage earners earned minimum wage in 2013. But that figure has been consistently dropping and obscures the fact that Texas is much more affordable than many states for those on the bottom of the income ladder.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has the third-highest cost of living, while Texas has the second-lowest,\u201d says DeVore, a former California GOP state legislator who relocated to the Lone Star State. \u201cA low-wage worker sees his money go a third further in Texas.\u201d\n\nOne could even say that the high-tax, high-cost model of California and other states is a form of class warfare against their poorest residents.\n\nThose at the top of the corporate ladder clearly recognize Texas\u2019s strengths. For each of the past ten years, CEOs polled by Chief Executive magazine have rated Texas first in the nation for economic-development climate and job growth. What is the secret of Texas\u2019s success? Rick Perry isn\u2019t shy about sharing his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s all about four points,\u201d he told me. \u201cFirst, don\u2019t spend all the money. Second, keep the taxes low and under control. Then have regulations that are fair and predictable so business owners know what to expect from one quarter to the next. Finally, reform the legal system so that frivolous lawsuits don\u2019t paralyze employers who are trying to create real wealth.\u201d\n\nRichard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Board, told me that Texas has really benefited from the reform of its once-corrupt legal system. Texas has put curbs on frivolous lawsuits, implemented the first-in-the-nation system under which the loser pays all court costs in many lawsuits, reformed medical-malpractice law, and elected judges who are much more respectful of the rule of law.\n\nRichard Weekley \u2014 the co-founder of Texans for Lawsuit Reform\u2013 credits former governor Perry for resisting calls for watered-down reforms that wouldn\u2019t have addressed the core problem. \u201cPerry sent a signal that he wanted real reform and would stand his ground,\u201d Weekley told me. \u201cSoon the medical lobbyists playing footsie with the trial lawyers were gone, and the obstacles to real reform started falling.\u201d\n\nThat said, Perry has shown less success in areas where he hasn\u2019t focused his attention or priorities. Far from reducing subsidies to business, he has embraced them as a form of development aid to entice firms to move to Texas or expand if they are already in the state. He\u2019s had mixed results with the subsidies. Greg Abbott, who succeeded him as governor, has reined in Perry\u2019s Texas Enterprise Fund after reports that some of its deal-closing money to relocating firms went to entities that hadn\u2019t applied for the funding or that were not required to directly create jobs.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend much time in Texas to conclude that its residents think its story should be known nationally and that the country would benefit from having Texans at the top of the federal government. Three of the last nine presidents \u2014 Johnson, the elder Bush, and George W. Bush \u2014 have come from Texas, and it\u2019s no surprise that the 2016 GOP primary field will have two Texas entrants, Perry and U.S. senator Ted Cruz.\n\nExpect to hear a lot of bragging about Texas over the next few months, along with a lot of trash-talking from liberals that the \u201cTexas miracle\u201d is a mirage. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true you can\u2019t explain miracles,\u201d Perry told me last week in Washington. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we have in Texas. We have economic recovery, and the lessons from ours should be picked up by every other state.\u201d Indeed, the fact that states such as Illinois, Massachusetts, and Maryland all defied their blue-state habits and elected Republican governors last fall shows that voters are concerned about how far they\u2019re falling behind states like Texas.\n\n\u2014 John Fund is national-affairs correspondent for NRO.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article has been amended since its initial publication.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sun, 2015-02-08 18:00", "sailthru.author": "John Fund", "description": "Last week, everywhere I went in Washington it seemed as if the country\u2019s cultural and ideological divisions came down to a debate over the state of Texas and whether or not it was \u201ca crazy state\u201d or the \u201cplace that is still most like America.\u201d\n\nCongressman Alcee Hastings, a Florida Democrat, started the rumble during a House committee meeting by saying that Texas\u2019s refusal to join Obamacare\u2019s exchanges made it \u201ca crazy state.\u201d He then refused to apologize to Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican who challenged him.\n\n#ad#Those became fighting words.

We have economic recovery, and the lessons from ours should be picked up by every other state.\u201d Indeed, the fact that states such as Illinois, Massachusetts, and Maryland all defied their blue-state habits and elected Republican governors last fall shows that voters are concerned about how far they\u2019re falling behind states like Texas.\n\n\u2014 John Fund is national-affairs correspondent for NRO.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article has been amended since its initial publication.", "card": "summary", "title": "Is Texas \u2018Crazy\u2019 or Is It the Real America?, by John Fund, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Is Texas \u2018Crazy\u2019 or Is It the Real America?", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Is Texas \u2018Crazy\u2019 or Is It the Real America?", "keywords": "John Fund", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Is Texas \u2018Crazy\u2019 or Is It the Real America?, John Fund, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "John Fund, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10a9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWell, it\u2019s true you can\u2019t explain miracles,\u201d Perry told me last week in Washington.\nRichard Weekley \u2014 the co-founder of Texans for Lawsuit Reform\u2013 credits former governor Perry for resisting calls for watered-down reforms that wouldn\u2019t have addressed the core problem.\nFormer governor Rick Perry, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, responded during a speech at the American Principles Project: \u201cHe is right!\nTexas continues to see solid job growth in trade and professional services as well as in the hospitality industry.\nIndeed, between 2007 and 2014 \u2014 the period covering the recession and the slow recovery that followed \u2014 Texas created 1.4 million net new jobs."}
