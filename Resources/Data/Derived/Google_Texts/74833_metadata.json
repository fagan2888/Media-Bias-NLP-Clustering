But the trend can also provide significant benefits to providers of all varieties, according to the article.\n\nTo start, the expansion of provider roles will likely lead more clinicians to take advantage of federal incentives that allow them to create and stay in independent practices. These practices serve as a vital check to the trend of hospital and health system consolidation, the article argues. The strength in numbers and increased focus on preventive care that result from expanded practice scope also will give providers a better chance to embrace value-based payment models that can ultimately boost their bottom lines.\n\nA recent Health Affairs study backs up these predictions, as its findings suggest that healthcare organizations might be able to increase productivity by adding more non-physician staff members, FierceHealthcare reported.\n\nScope of practice expansion can also pay off for patients, as one nonprofit organization recently noted that nurses play a major role in improving outcomes. The trend also has fueled a rise of specialization in the industry that allows providers to \"double-down with a focus on outcomes, interaction, professional collaboration and prevention,\" according to Healthcare Finance. Furthermore, an increase in primary care practitioners can lead to more one-on-one interaction between providers and patients, and can be part of the solution to the long-troublesome issue of increasing patients' accountability in regard to their health outcomes, the article states.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNebraska latest state to expand nurse practitioners' role\n\nMore states expand authority for advanced-practice nurses\n\nExpanding roles of nurse practitioners stir controversy\n\nAMA: Nurses aren't our equals\n\nStaff makeup plays key role in hospitals' productivity\n\nPhysician assistants step up to fill holes in healthcare system\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "As\u00a0many states expand the role\u00a0of\u00a0advanced-practice registered nurses\u00a0and\u00a0nurse practitioners, there's plenty of reasons to welcome this latest shift in the healthcare landscape,\u00a0according to\u00a0Healthcare Finance.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As\u00a0many states expand the role\u00a0of\u00a0advanced-practice registered nurses\u00a0and\u00a0nurse practitioners, there's plenty of reasons to welcome this latest shift in the healthcare landscape,\u00a0according to\u00a0Healthcare Finance.", "title": "Expanded scope of practice may boost patient outcomes, transition to value-based care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/expanded-scope-practice-may-boost-patient-outcomes-transition-value-based-c/2015-04-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "advanced practice registered nurse (APRN),American Medical Association (AMA),Care Delivery,Healthcare Consolidation,HR & Workforce Management,nurse practitioner,Patient Care & Outcomes,primary care,scope of practice,value-based payment", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2552\"", "article_summary": "Scope of practice expansion can also pay off for patients, as one nonprofit organization recently noted that nurses play a major role in improving outcomes.\nThe strength in numbers and increased focus on preventive care that result from expanded practice scope also will give providers a better chance to embrace value-based payment models that can ultimately boost their bottom lines.\nBut the trend can also provide significant benefits to providers of all varieties, according to the article.\nThese practices serve as a vital check to the trend of hospital and health system consolidation, the article argues.\nAs many states expand the role of advanced-practice registered nurses and nurse practitioners, there's plenty of reasons to welcome this latest shift in the healthcare landscape, according to Healthcare Finance."}
