Within this northeastern farming area lies several state wildlife areas and additional tracks of walk-in hunting land, all managed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife.\n\nWith 14 days left in our eastern slope pheasant season, hunting participants will see two key benefits: First, you will have few additional hunters, even on the public lands, and you\u2019ll see plenty of birds; and second, for those who want to knock on doors for private access, you\u2019ll find area farmers more amiable in allowing access than during harvest season in the fall. As testimony to this, for the entire day we saw no other hunters except two duck hunters in the Tamarack Ranch wildlife area, and of the three doors we knocked on for permission, we were allowed access on two, with the only turndown coming from the owner of a field full of pheasants but also occupied by cattle.\n\nIn all, we probably saw more than 200 pheasants, with the majority flushing far out of shotgun range. However we found sufficient \u201cholding\u201d birds to send each of us home with at least two roosters.\n\nOur hunt found us on both public and private land, and although the birds were spooky and flushing at distances far beyond shotgun range, there were plenty of opportunities to enjoy a good hunt. I joined retired veterinarian Ron Manus and retired banker Darrell Beck, both from the Longmont area. Both hunters brought their respective dogs, Shadow and Bette, who covered a lot more ground than their masters, who were trudging through 12-24 inches of crusted-over snow.\n\nBeck reported seeing more birds this year than in the past. CPW wildlife technician Jeff Mekelburg agreed the pheasant numbers were above normal levels and the majority of hunters he had surveyed were seeing good numbers.\n\n\u201cWe had good spring moisture and good pheasant hatches,\u201d Mekelburg said. \u201cFor the final days of this year\u2019s season, I\u2019d try the walk-in areas between Fleming and Haxtun, and for a state wildlife area, consider Red Lion. For future seasons, we are doing a project on the west end of Jumbo Reservoir, which should be a good pheasant hunting spot in the upcoming years. I get many reports of large pheasant numbers in that area, which will only get better with the habitat improvement work.\u201d\n\nWe still have ducks to hunt in many areas of the state for another week; Canada geese until Feb. 14; a conservation snow goose season that will run until April 30; and a spring turkey season that starts April 9.\n\nEasy crock pot pheasant\n\nMix 1\u00bd cups of water with one packet of Lipton onion soup mix and put in crock pot. Add pheasant breast down into the liquid and brace with quarters of two cut-up potatoes along with chunks of three carrots and one medium onion. Season all with salt and pepper (or Tony Chachere\u2019s creole seasoning), add a bay leaf, cover and cook on low for six to eight hours. Use the liquid as gravy for the potatoes and over the fine pheasant meat.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Good pheasants still to be found in Colorado", "title": "Good pheasants still to be found in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/good-pheasants-still-to-be-found-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 367, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_CC9_BNSP17OUTHUNTINGp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_CC9_BNSP17OUTHUNTINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T20:54:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:15:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe had good spring moisture and good pheasant hatches,\u201d Mekelburg said.\nFor future seasons, we are doing a project on the west end of Jumbo Reservoir, which should be a good pheasant hunting spot in the upcoming years.\nThree of us tried a late-season pheasant hunt near Crook, about 30 miles northeast of Sterling, last week.\nBut there\u2019s still good hunting to be had.\nWithin this northeastern farming area lies several state wildlife areas and additional tracks of walk-in hunting land, all managed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife."}
