The groups behind the report say taxpayers are left to foot the bill for this \u201cmassive subsidy for excessive executive compensation\u201d because of what they call a loophole that allows all performance-based pay to be deducted from corporate income taxes.\n\nRelated: The Real Story Behind Rising CEO Pay\n\nThat provision was created as part of a 1993 reform meant to discourage excessive executive pay. The law capped the tax deductibility of employee pay at $1 million but allowed companies to still deduct unlimited amounts of \u201cperformance-based compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Walmart gets a $104 million tax break for giving its executives outrageous pay packages, the rest of us pick up the tab,\u201d Frank Clemente, executive director at Americans for Tax Fairness, said in a statement. \u201cWith this tax loophole, the bigger the executive bonuses the less Walmart pays in taxes. This is truly one of the most perverse loopholes of all time.\u201d\n\nThat so-called loophole has been the target of tax reform proposals from both Democrats and Republicans. Closing it would generate more than $50 billion in tax revenue over 10 years, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation cited by the Americans for Tax Fairness report.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Walmart\u2019s pay practices have come under fire, of course, but critics have more often focused on what the company pays its associates, not executives. Yet the retailer\u2019s executive compensation plan has also recently faced criticism from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a firm that advises investors on proxy votes, and CtW Investment Group, which works with pension funds sponsored by unions.\n\nThe criticism of Walmart\u2019s pay, and the tax law that allows such deductions, comes on the same day that employees and union organizers with a group called OUR Walmart plan to stage strikes in 20 cities in an effort to pressure the retailer to raise wages. The protesters want the company to pay its associates at least $25,000 a year. The strikes are timed to coincide with the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting taking place on Friday.\n\nRelated: The Man Pushing CEO Pay to the Stratosphere\n\nCritics, including the authors of the new report, say Walmart\u2019s pay practices subject U.S. taxpayers to a double hit: Not only does the company get to deduct performance pay for executives from its taxes, but it pays it workers so little that many of them rely on public assistance programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Americans for Tax Fairness estimated that Walmart employees receive $6.2 billion a year in taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\nA Walmart spokesman said that $6.2 billion figure is incorrect and based on flawed methodology.\n\nThe company pushed back more broadly on both the ISS recommendations and the tax report. A spokesman said that it\u2019s important that the company be able to offer competitive pay in order to attract talent. \u201cISS\u2019s own analysis shows that Walmart\u2019s executive pay is a low concern and aligns with the company\u2019s performance,\u201d the spokesman told The Fiscal Times. \u201cOur financial performance during fiscal 2014 was below our expectations at the beginning of the fiscal year, and our executives\u2019 pay for fiscal 2014 reflected that performance.\u201d\n\nThe company questioned the details and motives behind the report from Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cThis is the same group that put out a similar flawed report last year, based on promoting their agenda rather than on the facts,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cUnlike some companies, Walmart pays billions of dollars a year in U.S. federal, state and local taxes, helping to fund education, public safety, and infrastructure improvements in the communities where we operate. Walmart is a pay-for-performance company. Our executive compensation program has been developed in the same way as other companies across America, and it complies with the federal tax laws.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The groups behind a new report say taxpayers provide a \u201cmassive subsidy for excessive executive compensation\u201d because of a loophole that allows performance-based pay to be deducted from corporate income taxes.", "title": "Your Tax Dollars Pay for Walmart Execs\u2019 Bonuses", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/04/Your-Tax-Dollars-Pay-Walmart-Execs-Bonuses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Walmart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/04/Your-Tax-Dollars-Pay-Walmart-Execs-Bonuses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Walmart.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The groups behind a new report say taxpayers provide a \u201cmassive subsidy for excessive executive compensation\u201d because of a loophole that allows performance-based pay to be deducted from corporate income taxes.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8a4\"", "article_summary": "Over that same period, the report finds, Walmart got $104 million in tax breaks for $298 million in performance pay awarded to eight top executives.\nRelated: The Real Story Behind Rising CEO PayThat provision was created as part of a 1993 reform meant to discourage excessive executive pay.\nClosing it would generate more than $50 billion in tax revenue over 10 years, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation cited by the Americans for Tax Fairness report.\nAmericans for Tax Fairness estimated that Walmart employees receive $6.2 billion a year in taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\u201cWith this tax loophole, the bigger the executive bonuses the less Walmart pays in taxes."}
