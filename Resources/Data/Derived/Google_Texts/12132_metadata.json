Now 51 months old, his recovery is by far the weakest since the Great Depression.\n\nAt 2.8%, real growth in the third quarter was higher than expected, a rarity. But the latest government data also hinted at weakness, as consumer and business spending slowed.\n\nIn short, the strong growth everyone predicted at the start of the year is a no-show, just as the previous predictions of prosperity just around the corner proved false.\n\nIt also means that Obama\u2019s recovery \u2014 now more than 4 years old \u2014 remains the worst since WWII. That\u2019s despite the fact that, by this point, half the previous recoveries had been interrupted by another recession.\n\nHad Obama\u2019s recovery been only as good as the average of the past 10 recoveries, the economy would be $1.3 trillion larger. That\u2019s $4,038 for every person in the U.S., or $10,451 per household.\n\nAnd had job growth been just average, there\u2019d be 7.3 million more people with jobs today. That means 64% of those now looking for work would be employed.\n\nThe only things that have shown strong and steady growth under Obama are excuses.\n\nFirst, he blamed Bush, saying that recoveries from financial crises are always longer and slower. But Obama based this claim on research by two economists who even liberals now dismiss as unreliable. Other studies show crises produce stronger, not weaker, recoveries.\n\nThen blame shifted to the allegedly insufficient stimulus, as though running $1 trillion deficits four years in a row wasn\u2019t Keynesian enough.\n\nAs the tepid recovery lingered on, Obama\u2019s excuses became increasingly desperate. In late 2011, he said \u201chead winds\u201d such as the \u201cJapanese tsunami, the Arab Spring\u201d and \u201cproblems \u2026 in Spain, Italy and Greece\u201d were to blame.\n\nA year later he was still pointing fingers at \u201cserious head winds\u201d such as \u201chigh gas prices\u201d and \u201ca crisis in Europe\u2019s economy.\u201d Then, Obama blamed House Republicans for their push to trim spending, although federal outlays remain well above historic levels.\n\nNow it\u2019s the days-long government shutdown \u2014 even though it\u2019ll likely end up lifting overall federal outlays.\n\nFunny, but Obama never mentions his own economic policies \u2014 tax hikes, regulations, ObamaCare, the war on coal \u2014 that have deadened what should have been a strong rebound from the deep 2007-09 recession.\n\nAs long as those remain in place, Obama\u2019s recovery will continue to underperform.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recovery: The latest GDP report shows that President Obama's policies continue to weigh down the economy.
