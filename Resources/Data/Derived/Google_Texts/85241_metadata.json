Time for all the familiar clich\u00e9s, misused or mispunctuated tho\u2019 they may be, and time for the meaningless \u201cXXX of the Year\u201d lists.\n\nBut who are we to sniff at such treasured traditions? For people who deal with words, the \u201cWords of the Year\u201d lists can be interesting, if specious.\n\nAs we said at the beginning of 2012, the picks for WOTY are frequently so fleeting that many \u201cdo not survive much beyond the year in which they were singled out.\u201d In 2011, for example, dictionary.com, which picks a WOTY because it \u201ccaptures the character\u201d of the year, \u201cregardless of its popularity or ubiquity,\u201d chose \u201ctergiversate,\u201d which means, effectively, to flip-flop. It has not yet caught on in popular usage. This year\u2019s dictionary.com selection was \u201cprivacy,\u201d which at least is a word most people know, even if they and their government don\u2019t agree on what it means.\n\nFor the first time, dictionary.com also picked the \u201cmisspelling of the year\u201d: \u201cfurlough,\u201d which was misspelled \u201cfurlow,\u201d \u201cfurlo,\u201d and \u201cferlow\u201d by people looking it up on the site. (It\u2019s hard to believe, as the site says, that no one looking up \u201csequester\u201d or \u201csequestration\u201d misspelled those.)\n\nBefore the lists were released, one safe bet seemed to be \u201ctwerk\u201d (rhymes with \u201cjerk\u201d). But Oxford, which publishes dictionaries throughout the English-speaking diaspora and requires that its WOTY \u201cdemonstrate some kind of prominence over the preceding year or so,\u201d chose \u201cselfie.\u201d \u201cTwerk\u201d was on its shortlist, as were \u201cbedroom tax\u201d (from a UK plan to penalize households \u201cthat were receiving housing benefit and that were judged to have bedrooms surplus to their requirements\u201d) and \u201colinguito\u201d (a mammal discovered in South America), among others.\n\n\u201cTwerk\u201d and \u201colinguito\u201d were on the Collins Dictionary shortlist, too, which opted for \u201cgeek\u201d as its WOTY, acknowledging its morphing from \u201ca boring and unattractive social misfit\u201d to \u201ca person who is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about a specific subject.\u201d\n\nGrant Barrett of public radio\u2019s A Way With Words included \u201ctwerk\u201d on his list, along with \u201cITAP\u201d (I took a picture; see \u201cselfie\u201d), \u201csharknado,\u201d and \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u201d appeared on lots of lists, too, some of them lexicographical, and some of them regulatory.\n\nGlobal Language Monitor chose \u201c404.\u201d Other top GLM choices, including \u201cfail!\u201d and \u201chashtag,\u201d could indicate that the site, which offers \u201c\u2018algorithmic services\u2019 to help worldwide customers protect, defend, and nurture their branded products and entities,\u201d lags actual word usage by a year or three. (\u201cHashtag\u201d was the American Dialect Society\u2019s WOTY last year; its 2013 WOTY will be selected in January.) To be fair, \u201ctwerk\u201d was on GLM\u2019s shortlist, and it chose \u201ctwerk\u201d as its \u201cTop Teleword of the 2012-1013 TV season.\u201d\n\nMerriam-Webster also picks its WOTY based on \u201cthe greatest increase in lookups this year as compared to last year,\u201d but its list is far less faddish. \u201cTwerk\u201d was nowhere to be found. The top word this year was \u2026 \u201cscience.\u201d \u201cA wide variety of discussions centered on science this year, from climate change to educational policy,\u201d M-W\u2019s editor-at-large, Peter Sokolowski, said. Other top words included \u201cparadox,\u201d \u201cethics,\u201d \u201cmetaphor,\u201d and \u201cvisceral.\u201d\n\nUse all those words in a sentence and you can describe \u201ctwerk\u201d\u2014and its impact.\n\nMerrill Perlman managed copy desks across the newsroom at The New York Times, where she worked for 25 years.
