Proof of the effectiveness of the Affordable Care

Act, or Obamacare as it is derisively known, has been

growing for more than two years now. Study after study

shows more Americans with health care, more efficient

health care and cost containment. While more needs

to be done on costs, the Affordable Care Act is a

success. At least it is if you let it be.

A new study released last week found states that

accepted Medicaid funding provided by the ACA had

a reduction in hospital costs among other things,

without a significant change in recipients looking

for work. All of this proves states that have refused

to accept available federal funds are making a huge

mistake.

Governor Walker is one of those we has refused

the funds. Now, he took advantage of another ACA provision

to get everyone below the federal poverty limit into

the private insurance marketplaceat taxpayer's expense

because he turned down $550 Million to pay for it.

Political stubbornness sure is expensive.
