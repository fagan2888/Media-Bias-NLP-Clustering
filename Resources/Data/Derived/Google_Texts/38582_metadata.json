On the other hand, it will have a deductible of $6,450, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is the one option, the one plan,\u201d Middleton said.\n\nIn addition, Middleton says the Humana plan is not available on so-called \u201cObamacare exchange,\u201d where many people can access federal subsidies to help pay the premiums on individual health plans.\n\nIt is only available \u201coff exchange,\u201d where consumers will have to pay the full premium price.\n\nMiddleton says her clients are getting frustrated with the narrow networks offered within the individual plans.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m getting is \u2018I want to be able to see this cardiologist. I want this pediatrician for my child. I want this hospital in my network. I want this ob/gyn, this PCP (primary care provider),\u2019 and my challenge is trying to find them all within the same plan,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cSo it\u2019s coming down to you\u2019ve got to pick and choose who\u2019s important, because I likely can\u2019t give you all of them in the same network.\u201d\n\nThe increasing restrictions in the insurance market have many causes, and some have nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act. Before the the law passed, insurance companies had already been tightening their networks of doctors and hospitals, and raising deductibles and co-pays. In many cases, corporate employers pushed for those changes to keep their health care costs down.\n\nBut the 2010 Affordable Care Act also requires insurance companies to issue coverage to all consumers, including those with pre-existing conditions. Other parts of the law mandated the coverage of benefits that some plans had previously excluded, such as mental health and pregnancy. That has increased medical claims and prompted insurance carriers to raise premium prices.\n\n\u201cThis has been the biggest mess since the law has passed. This year has been the worst year that I\u2019ve had to deal with people under 65 helping them with their insurance,\u201d Middleton said.\n\nPremiums vary by age, market location, and type of plan selected. One commonly-used comparison is the average cost of a benchmark \u201csilver plan\u201d on the Obamacare marketplace. In Texas, the premium for that plan rose an average of 5.1 percent from 2015 to 2016. This is actually lower than the national increase of 7.5 percent.\n\nHumana did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Affordable Care Act", "description": "In an individual health market bereft of", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "In an individual health market bereft of", "title": "Narrow Networks Frustrate Houstonians Shopping For Individual Health Plans | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/12/11/130671/narrow-networks-frustrate-houstonians-shopping-for-individual-health-plans/", "image": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11131942/cal-cost-medical-scope.jpg", "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11131942/cal-cost-medical-scope.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 459378966, "twitter": {"description": "In an individual health market bereft of", "title": "Narrow Networks Frustrate Houstonians Shopping For Individual Health Plans", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/12/11/130671/narrow-networks-frustrate-houstonians-shopping-for-individual-health-plans/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11131942/cal-cost-medical-scope.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Carrie Feibel", "wordCount": 542, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-12-11T13:20:23+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-12-11T13:20:23+00:00"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Health & Science, News, aca, health insurance, houston, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "In an individual health market bereft of \u201cout of network\u201d options, Humana has offered a last-minute health plan for 2016.\nIn many cases, corporate employers pushed for those changes to keep their health care costs down.\n/ DownloadHoustonians who purchase their own health insurance have been upset recently over fewer choices and higher prices for 2016.\nThis year has been the worst year that I\u2019ve had to deal with people under 65 helping them with their insurance,\u201d Middleton said.\n\u201cThis is the one option, the one plan,\u201d Middleton said."}
