Murthy is a young physician with a distinguished career. But unlike other recent nominations, including those for leadership of Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Reserve, his selection has barely registered on the national stage. He didn\u2019t get a televised ceremony at the White House. His nomination was announced with an end-of-day press release. It slipped past most Americans; the public was mostly unaware of the last surgeon general (Dr. Regina Benjamin) or the fact she had even left.\n\nMurthy\u2019s inconspicuous nomination reflects the declining influence of the post he may soon assume. The surgeon general has historically been, and needs to be, an independent medical voice on public health, rather than an arm of the administration\u2019s health policy. Yet, in recent years, the public presence of the surgeon general has all but disappeared. One could argue many reasons for this deterioration, from failed nominations under recent administrations to prolonged periods without an official surgeon general to consolidation of power under the Secretary of Health and Human Services. While all of these factors undoubtedly play some part, the politicization of the position seems to be a leading contributor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2007, three former surgeons general \u2014 Richard Carmona, C. Everett Koop, and David Satcher \u2014 came together for a congressional hearing on the challenges of the office. Their testimonies were astounding. During Carmona\u2019s tenure in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, senior officials instructed him to mention Bush\u2019s name at least three times on every page in speeches, and prevented or delayed many of his reports for political purposes. While the Reagan White House tried to keep Koop silent on the growing AIDS crisis, the Clinton administration blocked Satcher from releasing reports on needle exchanges and sexual health education.\n\nIt was quite a sad reunion. Surgeons general from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, each attesting to political manipulation and the stifling of scientific findings that could otherwise improve our public health.\n\nSo, how does Murthy fit into this backdrop? At 36, he has accomplished more than his age would suggest. Murthy has founded several organizations, including the nonprofit VISIONS Worldwide dedicated to HIV/AIDS education and the software company TrialNetworks that seeks to improve the efficiency of drug development and clinical trials. He has served on the surgeon general\u2019s Prevention Advisory Group, a panel of appointees created by the Affordable Care Act to develop recommendations for public health promotion. In addition, he is a practicing physician at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and an instructor in medicine at Harvard.\n\nHowever, he is best known as the cofounder of Doctors for America \u2014 a national grass-roots organization of over 16,000 physicians and medical students advocating for improvements to our health care system. Whether filing amicus briefs to the Supreme Court or contacting representatives in Congress, the organization has spent much of its time lobbying for the Affordable Care Act, which may be a point of contention during Murthy\u2019s confirmation hearings.\n\nOf course, to be involved in health care without thoughts on the Affordable Care Act is to not to be involved in health care at all. And, once in office, the surgeon general should have the authority to educate the public about accessing health care, regardless of the optics. But Murthy\u2019s advocacy speaks to a broader problem \u2014 on the whole, his eligibility for the post seems to come from his political, rather than professional, contributions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctors for America originally began as Doctors for Obama, which campaigned on the president\u2019s behalf in 2008. What\u2019s more, Murthy served on Obama\u2019s New England steering committee in that election and as a volunteer adviser to the president\u2019s reelection team in 2012. In an op-ed last week for USA Today, Dr. Bruce Davidson even suggested that Murthy\u2019s appointment to the Prevention Advisory Group was simply tribute for his prior political support.\n\nFor a position that requires nonpartisan scientific analysis for advancing the nation\u2019s health, these credentials are troubling to say the least.\n\nMurthy could still be a strong surgeon general. If confirmed, he would bring a bevy of qualities to enhance the role, including youth, health policy insights, and an inventive background. Yet his considerably partisan resume raises questions about his potential independence in the position. Specifically, should a leading figure of Doctors for Obama, which became Doctors for America, become America\u2019s doctor under President Obama?", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.1193999588", "eomportal-id": 124748, "description": "The White House announced on Nov. 14 that President Obama would nominate Dr. Vivek Murthy for Senate confirmation as the next US surgeon general.
