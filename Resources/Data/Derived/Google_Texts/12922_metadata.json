Five Republicans joined all Democrats in opposition to the lawsuit.\n\nIn the CBS poll, released Wednesday, 54 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the suit, while 37 percent said they approved of it. A similar poll conducted by CNN last month found that Americans disapprove of the GOP effort against the president by a 57 percent to 41 percent margin.\n\nDemocrats have called the suit an expensive political stunt that is a prelude to impeachment, which some conservative corners of the party have advocated for. But the public has even less of an appetite for impeachment. According to CNN, nearly two thirds of Americans do not think Obama should be impeached.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Obama defended his administration's use of its powers, arguing executive orders on the minimum wage, workplace pay and LGBT protections were necessary given congressional dysfunction.\n\n\"The American people don\u2019t want me standing around twiddling my thumbs waiting for Congress to do something,\" he said. \"Wherever I have the legal authorities to make progress on behalf of middle-class Americans ... I'm going to seize those opportunities.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama's Fist Bumps Obama's Fist Bumps\n\n1 of 24 Obama Holds Final Primary Night Event In St. Paul ST.
