By Wednesday February 26 the two will have changed places.\n\n\u201cDuring dawn on Wednesday the 26th, Venus shines to the upper right of the waning Moon low in the southeast,\u201d Sky and Telescope says. \u201cAt the time of dawn in the Americas they appear closer together than they did on Tuesday morning.\u201d\n\nVenus is shining its brightest this month for the year, making its meeting with the moon all the more poignant as they greet the day.\n\n\u201cThese two brilliant beauties will climb over the eastern horizon in the predawn darkness, and will continue to light up the morning twilight till after all stars have been washed from the sky,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cSharp-sighted people might even see the moon and Venus after sunrise.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Full Snow Moon and Vibrant Venus Fete Lovers for Valentine\u2019s Weekend\n\nThe fun continues on Thursday when, about 30 minutes before sunrise, Venus will shine in contrast to a now uber-thin crescent moon that has Mercury to its lower left.

The diamond has brilliant Jupiter at the top, Sirius at the bottom and the stars Procyon and Betelgeuse forming the two side corners, Sky and Telescope says.\n\nRELATED: Let's Get 'Sirius' About the Dog Star, Sky's Brightest Twinkler", "article_metadata": {"description": "Having admired one another from afar during the early part of February\u2014one in evening and the other in the barely nascent morning\u2014the moon and Venus will reunite in Moon and Venus cosy up on February 26, and other sky treats.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/22/moon-and-venus-get-down-dawn-winter-diamond-graces-night-sky-153704", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/moon-venus-wordlesstech-com.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Moon and Venus Get Down Before Dawn as Winter Diamond Graces Night Sky"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-22T13:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Moon and Venus Get Down Before Dawn as Winter Diamond Graces Night Sky"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/22/moon-and-venus-get-down-dawn-winter-diamond-graces-night-sky-153704", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Moon, Venus, Sun, Earth, Space, Astronomy, Stars", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Moon and Venus Get Down Before Dawn as Winter Diamond Graces Night Sky"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a62\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDuring dawn on Wednesday the 26th, Venus shines to the upper right of the waning Moon low in the southeast,\u201d Sky and Telescope says.\nOn Tuesday February 25, just as dawn arrives, the crescent moon will hover to the upper right of Venus in the southeast, Earthsky.org tells us.\nSaturday night at 8 or 9 p.m. on February 22, the big and bright Winter Diamond will stand upright in the south, according to Sky and Telescope.\nThe diamond has brilliant Jupiter at the top, Sirius at the bottom and the stars Procyon and Betelgeuse forming the two side corners, Sky and Telescope says.\nHaving admired one another from afar during the early part of February\u2014one in evening and the other in the barely nascent morning\u2014the moon and Venus will reunite in the pre-dawn sky this week."}
