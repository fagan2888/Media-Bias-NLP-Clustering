The steep rise was announced on Sept. 20 by Turing Pharmaceuticals, a startup that, according to the New York Times, acquired the rights to the medication in August, and immediately after increased its price by over 5,500%.\n\nTuring\u2019s CEO, former hedge fund manger Martin Shkreli, publicly defended his decision to raise the drug price saying that the new profit would be invested in further research and the drug\u2019s new cost was more in line with that of other life-saving drugs. But he eventually gave in and announced a price revision.\n\nWhile insults of all kinds have been thrown at \u201cPharma Bro,\u201d he is not the real villain but rather someone trying to do his job, which is to make a profit. The villain is the system.\n\nA privately funded healthcare system, as the one at work in the US, sets all the conditions that allow Shkreli\u2019s actions. What\u2019s more, they seem perfectly justifiable if viewed from the perspective of entrepreneurship. Health is arguably the most valuable of goods, and if you let the market determine its price without regulation, well, suppliers will always try and get the highest price they can.\n\nIt\u2019s the market, stupid\n\nAmericans pay far more than any other country for prescription drugs. In fact, Americans overpay for every aspect of healthcare: procedures and services are the most expensive in the world, because efficiency plays no role in rewarding the healthcare providers. As Dr. Stephen Ondra\u2014who works as chief medical officer for customer-owned health insurance company Health Care Service Corporation\u2014told Quartz, \u201cright now inefficiency is rewarded, the more you do to get an outcome, the more you make.\u201d\n\nThere is a common denominator behind all of this: the free, unregulated market.\n\nThe US is an outlier among industrialized nation: it\u2019s the only rich country that does not offer a publicly funded health system, relying instead largely on private insurance. This affects the pricing of drugs in several ways that are independent from the actual regulations imposed on pharmaceutical companies.\n\nFirst, and perhaps most importantly, the power in setting the price for drugs is skewed toward drug manufacturers. Unlike countries where universal health coverage is in place, the negotiating is left to individual care providers rather than being in the hand of a large, publicly funded buyer that\u2019s able to negotiate since it purchases most (if not all) of the drugs.\n\nFor those with health insurance, high drug prices result in higher premiums, but it\u2019s hard to notice the price increases directly. This means consumers lack awareness of the actual medication prices, and consequently, any pressure to keep them under control.\n\nPlus, the costs of bringing a drug into the US market are higher, partially because of marketing expenses. The US is one of only two countries (the other being New Zealand) that allows direct-to-consumer advertisement of prescription drugs, while elsewhere promotion is limited to medical professionals. This raises the already steep marketing bill of drugs manufacturers. As Robert Yates, former World Health Organization senior health economist told Quartz, \u201cthe amount [pharmaceutical companies] spend on marketing is massively more than they do on research and development.\u201d\n\nFinally, pharmaceutical companies can count on tens of billions of dollars in revenue, at higher margins than most other sectors (with the sole exception of software). So they make the most of the opportunity to advertise directly to the customer in the world\u2019s only rich market that\u2019s unregulated. With more advertising come more requests of specific brand names, which in turn can cause higher volumes of prescriptions, overmedication, and price hikes.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t in any way mean that other countries are immune to high drug prices. A recent Guardian article, for instance, exposed the struggles of the UK\u2019s National Health System (NHS), one of the biggest in the world, in supplying British patients with expensive cancer drugs. Yet drug prices that are too high for the NHS, or other publicly funded systems, are a fraction of what US citizens pay. Let\u2019s take Daraprim as an extreme case: the same drug (pyrimethamine, Daraprim\u2019s main ingredient) that could be priced $750 a pill in the US is currently available in India for \u20b97, or $0.10.\n\nBeyond drug pricing\n\nThe Daraprim case should make clear why 61 prominent US economists are among the 267 signatories of the Economists\u2019 Declaration on Universal Health Care, a statement led by Larry Summers and subscribed to by economists Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty, presented in New York ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, on Sept. 18. Healthcare expenditure in the US far outpaces other rich countries and represents the first cause of individual bankruptcy.\n\nIn the declaration, the economists \u201ccall on global policymakers to prioritize a pro-poor pathway to universal health coverage as an essential pillar of development.\u201d\n\nThe document also focuses on the individual human right to high-quality, accessible health care, which, if administered through universal coverage has \u201caccompanying benefits in both health and in protection from health-related financial risks.\u201d Publicly funded healthcare is not simply good for citizens but also for the economy on the whole.\n\nAs Yates told Quartz, \u201cthese [economists] aren\u2019t people who have vested interests, but who recognize that [universal health coverage] is good for society.\u201d\n\nIndeed, despite the US adversity to publicly funded, socialized healthcare (where citizens contribute to health coverage according to their income), the current system has proved ineffective not only in providing access to affordable care, but also in saving public resources. Although the Affordable Care Act might help in reducing costs for the government, the US government is currently in the paradoxic position of spending more in healthcare than any other in terms of GDP percentage, while covering a much smaller percentage of the overall health costs.\n\n\u201cOne of every four dollars we pay in the US [for healthcare] are used for administrative expenses,\u201d William Hsiao, professor of economics at Harvard Public Health School, told Quartz. Because there are so many insurers, each with their own sets of rules, there is a large amount of resources wasted purely in dealing with the system.\n\nTo explain it, Hsiao provides the example of an independent medical practice. The average US independent doctor, Hsiao says, deals with an average of six different insurance companies, each providing several products with specific rules in terms of reimbursement and co-pay, so the practice has to deal with an estimated 30 different plans. This becomes so complicated that the doctor has to hire a dedicated person to deal with it, and on top of it 25% of the nurses\u2019 weekly time, and eight hours of the doctor\u2019s, are dedicated to administrative tasks.\n\nIf, instead, there were a single, publicly funded payer\u2014not necessarily through taxation, but with a social insurance fund based on income, that covered everyone\u2014these costs would be eliminated. \u201cMy very rough guess would be that we could reduce US healthcare cost of 30%,\u201d Hsiao told Quartz. It would mean going from a 17.5% GDP spending in health to about 12%\u2014which could save the average American $2,500 a year.\n\nBut what would happen to all those administrative jobs that would become obsolete? \u201cTo be realistic about it, the savings of the initial years would have to be spent re-training the people for some other occupations,\u201d Hsiao told Quartz. This would, however, only be an issue for the very short-term, since people would spend the savings they make on healthcare in other sectors, creating new, different jobs.\n\nThe American exception\n\nThen there is the cultural issue, well expressed a few years ago by Megan McArdle in The Atlantic: \u201cOnce the government gets into the business of providing our health care, the government gets into the business of deciding whose life matters, and how much.\u201d\n\nThat is a concern that sits at the core of the American belief that no good comes of government\u2019s involvement in the life of the individual\u2014in any sphere. It\u2019s something that profoundly differentiates the US from other Western countries, and is embodied in the country\u2019s welfare state (or lack of thereof). The economists directly address this in their declaration, stating that \u201cresource constraints require individual countries to determine their own definition of \u2018essential.'\u201d They, however, believe having a public entity, rather than private capital, decide what is \u201cessential,\u201d (what needs to be covered, and in which order of priority) is the better option.\n\n\u201cYou never get perfect universal health care,\u201d Yates told Quartz, \u201cit\u2019s always a process.\u201d\n\nDefenders of private healthcare think it offers choice and access to the best services. But the reality is that such services remain a privilege of the rich, who face a proportionally lower cost since insurance premiums, whether provided through an employer or independently purchased, do not vary according to the insured\u2019s income level. The system doesn\u2019t appear to be working, and the poor performance of America in terms of health parameters such as life expectancy, infant mortality rates, maternal deaths are proof.\n\nBut while many agree that the system needs to change, not everyone is convinced publicly funded health care is the way to go, or that it would even feasible, in the US. \u201cYou have to have a solution that fits your culture,\u201d said Ondra, who proposes an approach to healthcare that would leverage the private entrepreneurial spirit as a driver to lower costs.\n\n\u201cIf you can find a non-governmental solution, a rational middle ground that fits more with our dynamics,\u201d Ondra told Quartz, that would be \u201cmore efficient and creative.\u201d\n\nYates, on the other hand, thinks America might not be that far from implementing publicly funded health care. The Affordable Care Act, he says, was the first step in that direction, and now some states \u201care debating [adopting] health care [plans] that are socially and publicly funded.\u201d\n\nThe power is often in people\u2019s hands on this and, Yates believes, can move the electoral needle in the US as it has in other countries. Healthcare is a campaign issue, and not only for the left: \u201cDonald Trump has been on the record as believing in universal health care,\u201d Yates told Quartz, and in case a Republican won, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be without precedent that a rightwing government introduces universal health care.\u201d\n\nAs the US struggles with the dilemma, middle- (and sometimes low-) income countries the world over are adopting publicly funded systems. Sri Lanka, Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia are just some of the countries making steps toward universal health care.\n\nParadoxically, America\u2019s wealth might be what makes it harder to transition. For all its wastage, the current system has \u201cbuilt up very powerful and wealthy stakeholders,\u201d Hsiao told Quartz. What he calls a \u201crampant insurance industry\u201d is worth about $1 trillion\u2014a size large enough that even a 1% investment in lobbying and advertising could stall attempts at substantial reforms at the federal level. These vested interest groups aren\u2019t, however, as powerful at the state level, where perhaps lies the real hope for the American system to finally follow the rest of the world\u2019s lead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When news broke that the price of Daraprim, a 62-year-old life-saving drug\u00a0often prescribed to AIDS patient, had\u00a0been raised from $13.50 a tablet to $750, outrage ensued.
