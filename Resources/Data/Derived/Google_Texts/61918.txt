Chief Executive Ghaith al-Ghaith added at a news conference that the Dubai-based budget carrier was working closely with Russian authorities to identify the cause of Saturday's crash, and appealed for an end to speculation about the disaster.

"We have high confidence in the Russian authorities who are capable of managing local conditions for flights," he said. "We fully trust the Russian authorities in this."
