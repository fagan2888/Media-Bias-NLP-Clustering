An 18-year-old woman who drove south in the northbound lanes of Interstate 25 was killed, and two men were injured seriously in a head-on collision that triggered a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles, including a large box truck.

State troopers are investigating whether drugs or alcohol contributed to the crash. Authorities identified the driver who was killed as Siara Jaramillo of Longmont.

Thornton residents Francisco Garcia, 32, and Andres Garcia, 26, received minor injuries.

After the initial crash, a 2006 Freightliner truck driven by Obdulio Ramos, 37, of Westminster and a 2006 Ford Escape driven by William Rivas, 37, of Hudson, struck the first two vehicles.

Ramos and Rivas were not injured.

State troopers closed all three northbound lanes of the highway in Broomfield to investigate what triggered the 6:21 a.m. collision near Colorado 7, Trooper Josh Lewis said.

One lane was reopened at about 9:20 a.m., and the other two lanes opened about 10 a.m.

Jaramillo was driving a silver 2007 Kia Rio south on the northbound side of I-25 when it slammed head-on into a blue 1994 Toyota pickup truck driven by Francisco Garcia, said State Partol Sgt. Rob Madden.

“To go head-on on the highway, someone had to have been going the wrong way,” Madden said.

It’s unclear whether the woman crossed the median or entered the highway from on off-ramp, he said.

Troopers have questioned several witnesses.

The injured men were taken to Good Samaritan Medical Center for treatment.
