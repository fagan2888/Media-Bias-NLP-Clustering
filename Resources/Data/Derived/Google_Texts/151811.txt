Within two days of his release from the Boston Red Sox organization, Nick Moore found himself a new home in a new sport. After about four years of playing baseball, Moore is returning to football and joining the Georgia Bulldogs.

Moore was an all-state selection in baseball and football in high school. His old coaches were the ones who spread the word about a potential return to football to universities in the area. Moore visited Georgia, Georgia Tech, Alabama and North Carolina State.

“It was kind of a whirlwind for the first 10 days there after he got released,” Mark Crews, Moore’s high school coach, told the Gwinnett Daily Post. “He kind of repeated the recruiting process that usually takes months in a week or so.”

The turnaround time was quite remarkable.

“I had no idea I’d have the opportunity to play football at places like that,” Moore told the newspaper. “I forgot baseball easily that first week, visiting all these campuses. Within the first week, I knew I was going to play college football even if I had another baseball opportunity.”

Why did he choose Georgia? Location. Location. Location.

“Georgia’s close to home,” Moore said. “I’ve spent most of my baseball career playing far away from home, and it was tough for me, tough for my parents, my friends, my brothers. They couldn’t come see me. Georgia’s close to my house so I can drive home when I want. My parents can be at every game. My dad being a Georgia alum and my brother being at the University of Georgia. I know it’s something they’re excited for.”
