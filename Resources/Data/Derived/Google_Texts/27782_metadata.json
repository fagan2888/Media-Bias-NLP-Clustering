Trump overcame controversy about the violent clashes that have marked his rallies this week and Clinton muted the criticism over her history on trade deals with big wins in Ohio and Illinois over Bernie Sanders.\n\nBut the Republican delegate count is about to become a national obsession. Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s win in his home state \u2014 and 66 delegates \u2014 makes Trump\u2019s path to the nomination more difficult, and will have everyone in the political world looking for their calculator.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s contests:\n\nClinton\u2019s pivot, take two\n\nAfter her big Super Tuesday wins two weeks earlier, Clinton sought to pivot to the general election. She dropped her usual attacks on Sanders and started trying to smooth things over with his younger, more liberal supporters.\n\nThen Sanders threw a wrench into all of that by shocking her in Michigan last week.\n\nA steadier Clinton campaign made up for that loss, and then some, by crushing Sanders in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio on Tuesday, denying him a repeat. She also won Illinois and as of 2 a.m. was battling Sanders in Missouri.\n\nAnd afterward, Clinton \u2014 who knows Sanders won\u2019t be dropping out anytime soon \u2014 turned her eyes to November, and to Trump. The message to Democrats: The general election is here, and I\u2019m going to stand up to the GOP front-runner.\n\nShe hammered Trump repeatedly during her speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, only a few minutes from Trump\u2019s resort there, saying at one point: \u201cWhen we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture, that doesn\u2019t make him strong, it makes him wrong.\u201d\n\nAnother big night for Trump\n\nTrump won big \u2014 routing Marco Rubio in Florida and running up the score in Illinois and North Carolina, while duking it out to the end with Cruz in Missouri.\n\nThis was a defiant candidate. The violence that erupted at his rally in Chicago last weekend didn\u2019t stop him from winning the state. The media criticism led him only to take a whack at \u201cdisgusting reporters\u201d and leave without taking a single question, even though his campaign had advertised his election-night event as a \u201cpress conference.\u201d\n\nAs the volume and fear about Trump rose to a new level, once again the Republican front-runner gets to say: Scoreboard.\n\nPerhaps the best evidence of Trump\u2019s supreme confidence: Embattled campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, accused by a female reporter from the pro-Trump outlet Breitbart of grabbing her during a rally last week, was parked on stage next to Trump, who gave him a shout-out.\n\n\u201cCorey \u2014 good job, Corey. Great job,\u201d Trump said.\n\nKasich\u2019s narrow road to Cleveland\n\nSo Kasich won his home state of Ohio, and all 66 of its delegates. It was an impressive victory over Trump.\n\nBut where does he go from here?\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Kasich has won a state, and he\u2019s far behind Trump and Cruz in the delegate race. He\u2019s made big bets on two other states, New Hampshire and Michigan, and he lost them both. If he can\u2019t win there, it\u2019s not clear where he can win \u2014 except for as a dark horse at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.\n\nBut there are hurdles ahead for a candidate who will now face more intense scrutiny. Trump has relentlessly attacked the Ohio governor. Ted Cruz will likely hammer his decision to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. And his Not-Quite-Mr.-Nice-Guy persona from his Capitol Hill days could do him damage.\n\nKasich is betting on strong showings in states that award delegates proportionally, like New York, Connecticut, Oregon and Washington, and the winner-take-alls including Wisconsin, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Indiana and California.\n\nAt the convention, Kasich\u2019s campaign said in a memo, Rubio\u2019s delegates are likely to side with the Ohio governor, \u201cbringing the three candidates very close to parity on a second ballot.\u201d\n\nFrom there, he\u2019d make the argument that he\u2019s the best-equipped candidate to take on Clinton.\n\nKasich\u2019s message has been overwhelmingly positive, but he did begin drawing some implicit contrasts with Trump on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about pulling us together, not pulling us apart,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another Trump-focused line, Kasich said: \u201cI will not take the low road to the highest office in the land.\u201d\n\nA contested convention is more probable\n\nTrump\u2019s big night still wasn\u2019t enough to stave off the likelihood of a contested convention in Cleveland.\n\nKasich seizing Ohio\u2019s 66 delegates complicates things for Trump. Even after winning 18 of the first 27 states with Missouri still counting, Trump needs to capture about three out of every five remaining delegates to win the 1,237 necessary to claim the GOP nomination outright.\n\nWith Cruz and Kasich continuing on, that won\u2019t be easy.\n\nCruz, in particular, represents a pesky challenge. He argued Tuesday night \u2014 as he has each of the past Tuesdays \u2014 that he and Trump are the only candidates with a shot at the nomination.\n\n\u201cNobody else has any mathematical possibility whatsoever,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nDoes a contested convention mean Trump would be denied the nomination? Not necessarily.\n\nThe anti-Trump forces are now divided into three camps: Anger, bargaining and acceptance.\n\nSome are convinced that allowing him to advance to the general election would permanently damage the party. Some \u2014 particularly those those who have for president or are still in the race \u2014 are still convinced that there\u2019s some alternative option. And some believe denying the will of the voters on the convention floor would destroy the party.\n\nAware of the challenge he faces, Trump talked party unity on Tuesday night from his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida \u2014 name-dropping House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring our party together,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRubio\u2019s 2020 play\n\nRubio knew his path to the Republican nomination was non-existent once Trump crushed him in Florida.\n\nSo he made a big bet on his political future: He went down swinging against Trump, hoping that a rebalancing might swing the Republican pendulum back in his direction in the future.\n\n\u201cI ask the American people, do not give in to the fear. Do not give in to the frustration,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nOf his own campaign, Rubio said, \u201cI chose a different path, and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake: Rubio\u2019s Florida loss didn\u2019t just mark the end of his candidacy; it\u2019s the defining moment in the electorate\u2019s total repudiation of the GOP\u2019s efforts to reboot \u2014 with a more inclusive, optimistic message aimed at minority populations \u2014 after its loss in 2012.\n\nStill, at only 44, Rubio\u2019s political star could very well rise again.\n\nAnd while he won\u2019t stray far from the conservative movement \u2014 in his exit speech, he railed against Washington elites \u2014 his calculus depends on Trump ultimately faltering, likely in the general election.\n\nRepublican operative Rick Wilson made that much clear on Twitter, when he compared Rubio\u2019s 2016 campaign to Ronald Reagan\u2019s unsuccessful primary against President Gerald Ford in 1976 \u2014 four years before Reagan began eight years of Republican rule and influenced an entire generation of young conservatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump dominated one of the biggest days of the 2016 presidential race so far.
