Blackstone-Backed PGI Expands in Europe with Dounor Buy

The buyer, which makes engineered, non-woven fabrics, acquired manufacturers Fiberweb in 2013 and Providencia in 2014

Private equity-backed PGI Specialty Materials Inc., which makes engineered fabrics, is buying Dounor Sas for an undisclosed amount.

Dounor, headquartered in Neuville en Ferrain, France, manufactures materials used for hygiene, health care and industrial products.

PGI says the deal should help it expand its business in Europe. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company makes materials used for infection prevention and personal care, such as diapers, tampons, surgical gowns and face masks.

The company has made other acquisitions, picking up Companhia Providencia Industria e Comercio, a Brazilian company that makes nonwoven products used for hygiene, health care and industrial applications. Before that, in 2013, the company bought Fiberweb, another manufactuerer.

PGI filed for an initial public offering in February. The company has been backed by private equity firm the Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX) since 2010.

Other recent manufacturing deals have come from Sifco Industries Inc. (NYSE: SIF), which bought parts maker C*Blade earlier in March, and A. Schulman's (Nasdaq: SHLM) deal for Citadel Plastics, also in March.
