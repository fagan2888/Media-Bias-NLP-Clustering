The town of Douglas, on the Arizona-Mexico border, recently lost its hospital and the ripple effect is evident: job loss, emergency services overwhelmed, and people worried about their safety.\n\nAn ambulance can be heard returning to the Douglas\u2019 Fire Department more often now. Emergency responders are out on the road more, traveling to what\u2019s now, the nearest hospital in Bisbee, about 20 minutes away.\n\nSince the town\u2019s hospital closed about a month ago, the fire department is called out on average nearly a dozen times per day, 30 percent more than in the past. Fire Chief Mario Novoa said this is a lot for a department that serves a large rural area.\n\n\u201cApproximately 1,500 square miles from one fire department, with 6 ambulances. We\u2019re busy, we\u2019re busy,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the chief said he\u2019s worried about his staff, who are working overtime and need rest. He said he has asked for extra personnel.\n\nNovoa said he anticipates getting busier for the holidays when the town\u2019s population grows with shoppers coming over from Mexico.\n\nHe said losing a hospital for this community of nearly 17,000 was a major blow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a hospital here. When I was a kid, we had two hospitals here. So it was very, very disheartening to know at this day and age, no hospital,\" Novoa said.\n\nKate Sheehy Lifetime Douglas residents Becky and Gilbert Gutierrez are concerned, like many people, about getting to the closest hospital in Bisbee, 20 minutes away.\n\nGilbert and Becky Gutierrez have their 4-year-old granddaughter visiting at their home in the Pirtleville area of Douglas. The couple is in their 60s and grew up in Douglas. Gilbert said he took it for granted that there had always been a hospital here.\n\n\u201cA 20-minute drive is really, may make it or not, say life and death,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nHe said there are many elderly people in their neighborhood who don\u2019t have transportation to get to and from Bisbee.\n\nDouglas\u2019s hospital closed after years of financial instability that led to the loss of federal Medicare and Medicaid payments.\n\nMaggie Elehwany is the vice president of Government Affairs with the National Rural Health Association. She said 43 percent of rural hospitals, designated as \u201ccritical access,\u201d are operating at a loss, and they\u2019re serving a needy population.\n\n\u201cPer capita, rural patients are older, poorer, so there\u2019s a higher dependence on Medicare and Medicaid, and they\u2019re actually sicker. They have a higher percentage of chronic disease,\u201d Elehwany said.\n\nThe University of Arizona's Center for Rural Health shows of 12 critical access hospitals in Arizona, half have negative fiscal margins.\n\nKate Sheehy Douglas' Fire Department has seen about a 30 percent increase in emergency calls since the town's hospital closed.\n\nElehwany said the threat to rural hospitals, is like \"death by a thousand knives.\" She said these hospitals have been hit with several types of federal cuts in recent years. The Affordable Care Act is one factor. She said with the ACA there was the assumption that hospitals would have more insured people.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to have more paying customers, Mr. Hospital, you\u2019re not going to need as much of your disproportionate share payments from the federal government,\u201d she said.\n\nThose are the payments that help offset the cost of treating people who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nHowever, many states didn\u2019t expand Medicaid under the ACA, allowing more people to get insurance, to make up for that loss. Elehwany said those states have a high number of rural hospitals that have closed or are on the brink of closure.\n\nIn Arizona, Medicaid was expanded, but with that came a new state assessment, or tax. This has been an added burden on struggling rural hospitals.\n\nElehwany said that\u2019s why the \u201cSave Rural Hospitals Act\u201d pending in Congress, is so important.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking Congress to throw a whole lot of money at this problem. We\u2019re just saying, \u2018Stop these cuts,\u2019\u201d said Elehwany.\n\nSome of these rural hospitals may just need time to embrace a new healthcare model, she said, that focuses on emergency and outpatient care.\n\nKate Sheehy Jim Dickson is the CEO of Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Jim Dickson said he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s the CEO at Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee. He said rural hospitals don\u2019t admit enough patients to offset the high overhead. Copper Queen\u2019s been able to stay profitable with a focus on outpatient care.\n\n\u201cYou go to our clinic you see a doctor, you can have your laboratory, radiology and if you need a consult by a cardiologist you can have it done right there,\u201d Dickson said.\n\nHe said this leads to better management of diseases and avoids more expensive, acute care treatment in a hospital.\n\nCopper Queen has seen a 65 percent increase in its ER patients since the hospital in Douglas closed. Dickson recently announced he will open a 24/7, free-standing emergency room in Douglas in the next six to nine months.\n\nBut people in Douglas worry that without a full-service hospital, the town will shrivel away.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to come to a town that doesn\u2019t have a hospital, if you can go someplace else. I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Wendy Gomez said.\n\nMeanwhile, Douglas Mayor Danny Ortega said a feasibility study will be done to see if the town can support another, smaller hospital. He said the town is also trying to attract and keep physicians.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to promote it as a quality of life. It\u2019s a safe, small community. People sleep with doors unlocked at night. We all know each other,\" he said.\n\nOrtega said some medical providers in the area are looking to Mexico, marketing across the border to people with health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The town of Douglas, on the Arizona-Mexico border, recently lost its hospital and the ripple effect is evident: job loss, emergency services overwhelmed, and people worried about their safety.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Fronteras Desk", "description": "The town of Douglas, on the Arizona-Mexico border, recently lost its hospital and the ripple effect is evident: job loss, emergency services overwhelmed, and people worried about their safety.", "title": "Why The United States Is Losing Rural Hospitals", "url": "http://www.fronterasdesk.org/content/10112/why-united-states-losing-rural-hospitals", "image": "http://www.fronterasdesk.org/sites/default/files/field/image/2015/08/IMG_5677.JPG", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DOUGLAS, Ariz. \u2014 Rural communities across the country are losing their hospitals at an increasing rate \u2014 57 rural hospitals have closed over the last 5 years.\nAudio Clip Why The United States Is Losing Rural HospitalsKate Sheehy Douglas' hospital went through several CEOs and bankruptcies before it finally closed in July.\nElehwany said those states have a high number of rural hospitals that have closed or are on the brink of closure.\nShe said 43 percent of rural hospitals, designated as \u201ccritical access,\u201d are operating at a loss, and they\u2019re serving a needy population.\nElehwany said that\u2019s why the \u201cSave Rural Hospitals Act\u201d pending in Congress, is so important."}
