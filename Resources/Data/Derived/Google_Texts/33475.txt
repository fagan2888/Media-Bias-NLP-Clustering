Attorney general’s office signs and circulates a lobbyist-drafted letter.

Days after being approached by a lobbyist from Hunton & Williams asking Mr. Pruitt’s office to intervene with the federal government on an environmental issue, a lawyer in Mr. Pruitt’s office took the lobbyist-drafted letter, put it on state government stationery and circulated it to 15 other state attorneys general, almost all Republicans, urging them to sign on as well after telling them this was “a comment letter we have prepared.” Soon after, the nearly identical final letter was sent to the E.P.A. administrator signed by seven Republican attorneys general.
