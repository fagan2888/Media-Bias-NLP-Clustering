They had to be, at the minimum, in order to know what to plant, and when.\n\nFlash forward to modern times, when light pollution threatens to mask much of our night sky. The International Dark-Sky Association, in conjunction with the National Park Service, is on a quest to heighten awareness of this issue and its environmental implications.\n\nRELATED: Get Your Night Sky on With This Yosemite Video\n\nA small tribe in northern Arizona has become the first \u201cdark sky nation\u201d in honor of its efforts to protect unspoiled nighttime views and a culture that is tied to the stars.\n\nThe Kaibab Paiute Tribe has about 250 members living near the Arizona-Utah border, north of the Grand Canyon. The tribe\u2019s 120,000-acre reservation is surrounded by federally protected lands, including the Grand Canyon-Parashant and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Another national monument, Pipe Springs, occurs within the reservation boundary.\n\nAll of those neighbors pitched in to get the attention of the International Dark-Sky Association, which recognizes dark-sky communities, said Daniel Bulletts, director of the tribe\u2019s environment department.\n\n\u201cWe have worked closely with the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument on youth education projects,\u201d Bulletts told Indian Country Today Media Network. \u201cWe had the mutual idea to seek a designation. At the time, we weren\u2019t really sure if we were going to be the first anything. We just recognized that our night skies are pristine, and why not seek a designation?\u201d\n\nThe Tucson-based International Dark-Sky Association established the International Dark Sky Places conservation program in 2001 to recognize excellent stewardship of the night sky. Designations are based on stringent outdoor lighting standards and innovative community outreach. Since the program began, 10 communities, 22 parks and nine reserves have received designations. Two other International Dark Sky Communities, Flagstaff and Sedona, are in Arizona.\n\nConvincing the tribe to support a night skies designation was challenging at first, because people took it for granted that they could look up at night and see starlight that wasn\u2019t dimmed by the haze of light pollution, Bulletts said. But tribal members conducted outreach during annual stargazing events at Pipe Springs that highlight the importance of natural darkness to culture and wildlife. And astronomers from Bryce Canyon National Park brought their Star Lab equipment to the events several times. The Lab can project constellations skyward at any time of year, so people know where and how to look for them.\n\n\u201cPeople would kind of start looking for it,\u201d Bulletts said. \u201cStories started to emerge through our oral archives, and tribal elders remembered them. Once that got started, we proceeded with the application.\u201d\n\nIn order to earn the designation, the Kaibab Paiutes had to agree to a reservation-wide lighting ordinance, including wattage limits and requirements that lights be pointed down and shielded from above. The tribe also committed to ongoing efforts to showcase a cultural connection to the stars.\n\n\u201cOne of our goals is to have storytelling and night watching,\u201d Bulletts said, as well as \u201cevents in the summer, spring and fall that actually pertain to tribal stories about those different times of year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kaibab Paiute Tribe has won a dark skies award for keeping light pollution to a minimum and preserving the night-sky view of the stars.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/10/indigenous-cosmology-wins-kaibab-paiute-tribe-nets-dark-skies-award-161027", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/thundermountainpootseenightsky_logo.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Indigenous Cosmology Wins: Kaibab Paiute Tribe Nets Dark Skies Award"}, "abstract": "The Kaibab Paiute Tribe has won a dark skies award for keeping light pollution to a minimum and preserving the night-sky view of the stars.", "keywords": "Kaibab Paiute, Astronomy, Milky Way, Pollution, Arizona, National Park Service, Anne Minard", "dc": {"title": "Indigenous Cosmology Wins: Kaibab Paiute Tribe Nets Dark Skies Award"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/10/indigenous-cosmology-wins-kaibab-paiute-tribe-nets-dark-skies-award-161027", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-10T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Indigenous Cosmology Wins: Kaibab Paiute Tribe Nets Dark Skies Award"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04ae\"", "article_summary": "Flash forward to modern times, when light pollution threatens to mask much of our night sky.\nThe International Dark-Sky Association, in conjunction with the National Park Service, is on a quest to heighten awareness of this issue and its environmental implications.\nThe Kaibab Paiute Tribe has about 250 members living near the Arizona-Utah border, north of the Grand Canyon.\nThe tribe\u2019s 120,000-acre reservation is surrounded by federally protected lands, including the Grand Canyon-Parashant and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments.\nWe just recognized that our night skies are pristine, and why not seek a designation?\u201dThe Tucson-based International Dark-Sky Association established the International Dark Sky Places conservation program in 2001 to recognize excellent stewardship of the night sky."}
