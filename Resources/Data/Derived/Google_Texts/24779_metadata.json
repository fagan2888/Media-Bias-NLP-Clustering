Pasceri shot and killed Davidson, then turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn emergencies, most hospitals \"call a code\" that can mean anything from a patient going into cardiac arrest to a lost child on the hospital campus.\n\nThe problem is that only hospital staff and employees know what the codes mean. With an active shooter in the hospital, everyone--including the thousands of patients and visitors who come through the facility's doors each day--must be warned.\n\n\"It really does not make sense to call a code,\" Robert Chicarello, director of security at the hospital, told Boston Magazine. \"It needs to be plain English so untrained visitors, patients, anybody who is in the building, can hear it and know what's happening.\"\n\nHe and hospital administrators did an extensive reworking of their emergency plan in the wake of the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech University, which claimed more than 30 lives. After the Boston shooting, Partners HealthCare, the company that owns BWH, instituted the plain English announcement protocol across all of its hospitals, the article notes.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHospitals reassess security after Boston surgeon shooting, but is threat overstated?\n\nHospital violence: Boston hospital prepared for active shooting event\n\nWorkplace violence is on the rise and nursing staff are in particular danger\n\nAmid more violence, some hospitals form police departments\n\nBoston Marathon bombings put hospital disaster planning to the test\n\nFed up with violent incidents, hospitals seek to balance security with patient care\n\nHospital shootings: What to do when disaster strikes\n\nNurse stabbings raise questions on hospital violence\n\nAre hospitals responsible for preventing workplace violence?\n\nViolence against healthcare workers leads to increased focus on safety\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital shootings are becoming distressingly common--and safety advocates say that the color coded alert systems used by most healthcare facilities are not only inadequate, but may endanger the lives and safety of hospital patients and visitors.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospital shootings are becoming distressingly common--and safety advocates say that the color coded alert systems used by most healthcare facilities are not only inadequate, but may endanger the lives and safety of hospital patients and visitors.", "title": "Color-coded alert systems provide little benefit in hospital shootings", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/color-coded-alert-systems-provide-little-benefit-hospital-shootings/2015-07-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Brigham and Women's Hospital,color coding,emergency preparedness,Hospital Shootings,hospital violence,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16d5\"", "article_summary": "Hospital shootings are becoming distressingly common--and safety advocates say that the color-coded alert systems used by most healthcare facilities are not only inadequate, but may endanger the lives and safety of hospital patients and visitors.\n\"It really does not make sense to call a code,\" Robert Chicarello, director of security at the hospital, told Boston Magazine.\nAfter the Boston shooting, Partners HealthCare, the company that owns BWH, instituted the plain English announcement protocol across all of its hospitals, the article notes.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated ArticlesHospitals reassess security after Boston surgeon shooting, but is threat overstated?\nWith an active shooter in the hospital, everyone--including the thousands of patients and visitors who come through the facility's doors each day--must be warned."}
