We can\u2019t imagine a world where in 5 years, a small business will be purchasing insurance offline.\u201d\n\nThe Y Combinator-backed company has built a number of online tools to help small businesses figure out which plans are right for them. Shah said that over 6 million small businesses currently purchase insurance offline, and SimplyInsured is the only group health insurance \u201cparser\u201d on the Internet.\n\nIts website offers immediate quotes across all insurers, multi-carrier comparisons, and the ability to complete the application and administration process online.\n\nSimplyInsured\u2019s technology reads health insurance plans and models more than 100 different medical scenarios \u2014 from a simple doctor\u2019s visit to getting hit by a bus \u2014 against the them to generate custom price estimates and recommendations. Its algorithm ranks each plan on premium vs. coverage provided. Once a client picks a plan, they can fill out the applications and access information.\n\nShah said that brokers and insurance companies produce complex plans that are difficult to understand. The Affordable Care Act elevates the possibilities for greater clarity and transparency when it comes to insurance, and will likely drive many brokers out of the market.\n\nThis creates opportunities for a low-cost online brokers, like SimplyInsured.\n\nThe startup\u2019s goal is to simplify plans so \u201cnormal\u201d people can understand them and reduce costs for businesses. The company claims its technology can save clients up to $1,000 per employee.\n\nNow with the opening of the ACA exchanges, SimplyInsured enables people to create custom quotes for plans offered on the Covered California healthcare exchange.\n\nShah founded SimplyInsured with cofounder Bob Aspell, who was his housemate and classmate at MIT. Shah worked as a consultant in consulting firm McKinsey\u2019s Healthcare practice working with health insurance clients and saw how difficult it was to answer simple questions.\n\n\u201cI built an Excel model to estimate costs and eliminate issues like deductibles, coinsurance, maximums, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201cMy excel model became the basis of our website. It provides easy to compare costs for the most common health procedures, comparable across all health plans.\u201d\n\nSimplyInsured earns a recurring monthly commission for every group it signs up and its recurring revenue has grown by 500% in the last 6 months.\n\nInvestors include Y Combinator, Altair Capital, founders of NerdWallet Jake Gibson and Tim Chen, Waseem Daher, Jeff Arnold, Amee and Adil Chaudry, Sam Melamed, and Matt Huang.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2013-10-02T14:41:18+00:00", "author": "rebecca-grant", "modDate": "2013-10-02T14:41:18+00:00", "keywords": "affordable-care-act,insurance,obamacare,simplyinsured,y-combinator", "type": "news", "id": 826279}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "The Y Combinator-backed company helps small businesses and their employees get instant, customized quotes, make comparisons, and complete the application process online.", "title": "SimplyInsured aims to put health insurance into terms anyone can\u00a0understand", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/02/simplyinsured-aims-to-put-health-insurance-into-terms-anyone-can-understand/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_97346801-780x520.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The Y Combinator-backed company helps small businesses and their employees get instant, customized quotes, make comparisons, and complete the application process\u00a0online.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Shah said that over 6 million small businesses currently purchase insurance offline, and SimplyInsured is the only group health insurance \u201cparser\u201d on the Internet.\nSimplyInsured has closed $750,000 to help small businesses navigate the changing landscape of costs, taxes, fines, and regulations surrounding health insurance.\n\u201cThere are 400,000 health insurance brokers in the US who sell insurance the same way, via paper, phone, and fax,\u201d said cofounder and CEO Vivek Shah to VentureBeat.\nSimplyInsured\u2019s technology reads health insurance plans and models more than 100 different medical scenarios \u2014 from a simple doctor\u2019s visit to getting hit by a bus \u2014 against the them to generate custom price estimates and recommendations.\nShah worked as a consultant in consulting firm McKinsey\u2019s Healthcare practice working with health insurance clients and saw how difficult it was to answer simple questions."}
