Mountaire is a closely held poultry company based in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe Koch brothers, billionaire oil industry executives, started a network of nonprofits that promote small government and aren\u2019t required to disclose their donors. The new super-PAC is mandated to report donations quarterly, the first Koch entity subject to this requirement.\n\nThe Freedom Partners super-PAC was formed on June 13 and will have more flexibility to criticize political candidates by name in commercials than do nonprofit groups.\n\nIt will put money toward supporting \u201ccandidates who share our vision of free markets and a free society and oppose candidates who support intrusive government policies,\u201d said Davis in an e-mailed statement.\n\nCameron said he\u2019s concerned that the country\u2019s freedoms are threatened and is particularly opposed to the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 health-insurance law.\n\n\u201cObamacare is a disaster for the country and is the present administration\u2019s effort to try to take over all of the private health-care services,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest single political donation Cameron has made to a federal candidate or committee, according to Federal Election Commission data. \u201cThis is a big contribution,\u201d he said.\n\nFundraising Target\n\nOther donors have made commitments to the new super-PAC, though the money wasn\u2019t collected in the first few days of operations, Davis said. The group expects to raise more than $15 million to run commercials, and pay for mailers and some online ads before the November midterm elections, he said.\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit business association based in Arlington, Virginia tied to the super-PAC, aired 3,500 commercials in five Senate races from January 1 through July 7, according to Kantar Media\u2019s CMAG data. They highlight negative aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe business association is one of several Koch-founded groups active in this year\u2019s election cycle. Another, Americans for Prosperity, has aired about 26,000 commercials through July 7, according to CMAG data. It\u2019s a nonprofit and doesn\u2019t have an associated super-PAC.\n\nThe $500,000 donation will be reported on the super-PAC\u2019s Federal Election Commission filing, which is due today and covers all activity from March through the end of June.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Annie Linskey", "twitter": {"description": "A new super-political action committee connected to David and Charles Koch reported one donation -- of $500,000 -- in its first two weeks of operation.", "title": "Koch-Founded Super-PAC Draws $500,000 Donor in First Days", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-15/koch-founded-super-pac-draws-500-000-donor-in-first-days", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iR7QxqMbXmDQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Annie Linskey", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Charles De Ganahl Koch", "news_keywords": "Charles De Ganahl Koch", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-15/koch-founded-super-pac-draws-500-000-donor-in-first-days", "parsely-title": "Koch-Founded Super-PAC Draws $500,000 Donor in First Days", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-15T18:45:20.073Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A new super-political action committee connected to David and Charles Koch reported one donation -- of $500,000 -- in its first two weeks of operation.", "parsely-tags": "Charles De Ganahl Koch,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-07-15T18:45:20.073Z", "parsely-section": "culture", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "A new super-political action committee connected to David and Charles Koch reported one donation -- of $500,000 -- in its first two weeks of operation.", "title": "Koch-Founded Super-PAC Draws $500,000 Donor in First Days", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-15/koch-founded-super-pac-draws-500-000-donor-in-first-days", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iR7QxqMbXmDQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "A new super-political action committee connected to David and Charles Koch reported one donation -- of $500,000 -- in its first two weeks of operation."}, "parsely-post-id": "N8RJCL6KLVRR01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iR7QxqMbXmDQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fde\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s the largest single political donation Cameron has made to a federal candidate or committee, according to Federal Election Commission data.\nThe $500,000 donation will be reported on the super-PAC\u2019s Federal Election Commission filing, which is due today and covers all activity from March through the end of June.\nThe Freedom Partners super-PAC was formed on June 13 and will have more flexibility to criticize political candidates by name in commercials than do nonprofit groups.\nFundraising TargetOther donors have made commitments to the new super-PAC, though the money wasn\u2019t collected in the first few days of operations, Davis said.\nA new super-political action committee connected to David and Charles Koch reported one donation -- of $500,000 -- in its first two weeks of operation."}
