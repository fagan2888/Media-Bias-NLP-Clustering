Not Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn any case, advocates for the uninsured warn, if it asks for money, it's probably a scam to prey on low-income Texans seeking mandated insurance coverage under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law.\n\nNonprofit workers in the Rio Grande Valley say they\u2019ve seen an increase this year in sales tactics \u2014 including the examples cited above \u2014 that are at best unethical and at worst illegal, charging low-income Texans fees for assistance they are entitled to receive for free.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about hard-working, resource-limited people who are not aware they may be charged, that\u2019s crossing the line,\" said Jose Medrano, a regional director for Enroll America, an advocacy group offering free information to people signing up for health insurance.\n\nThe Obama administration has spent up to $11 million per year on Texas \u201cnavigators,\u201d the state and federally regulated workers who help people sign up for coverage. They are barred from charging a fee. Licensed insurance agents are exempt from that law, but industry experts said agents typically do not charge sign-up fees because they are paid on commission.\n\nBut this year, with adults facing a minimum $695 tax penalty for remaining uninsured, a growing number of con artists have exploited people\u2019s ignorance about the health law, charging fees from $25 to $100 for signup assistance, said Cliff Clark, program director for Weslaco-based MHP Salud.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re in the third year [of open enrollment], more people have figured out how to scam and found out, \u2018Oh hey, I can make some money off this,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe lack of clarity about how Texans can access subsidized health insurance could hamper the federal government\u2019s efforts at a time when it is specifically eyeing the state for more signups. Roughly 19 percent of Texans are uninsured, the highest share of any state, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nMore than one million Texans signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage in 2015, but the rate of enrollment lagged behind other states with large uninsured populations, like Florida.\n\nTexas navigators face greater scrutiny than their counterparts in other states. In 2013, after a series of videos showed navigators in Dallas encouraging enrollees to lie on their applications, state lawmakers mandated extra regulations for the assisters. Navigators were required to receive 20 hours of state-specific training in addition to the federal training requirement of 20 to 30 hours, to undergo background checks and to provide proof of identity \u2014 which some critics called excessive and politically motivated.\n\nState Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, said state officials should bear some of the blame for the increase in scam artists because the state didn't provide \u201csufficient education and outreach\u201d about Texans' options under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBecause of the lack of straightforward, fact-based information, that creates an opening, I think, for some of these unscrupulous actors to step in,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups are launching an aggressive education campaign in response to the reportedly higher number of rogue assisters. But in the less-affluent Rio Grande Valley region in South Texas, where the majority of reports have surfaced, many people lack reliable Internet access or have difficulty speaking English, making outreach more difficult, Medrano said.\n\nA spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance said the agency has not received any navigator-related complaints since open enrollment began last month and encouraged Texans to report alleged fraud to the state\u2019s consumer help telephone line.\n\n\u201cNavigators are funded through federal grants and should not request any kind of payment from the consumers they assist,\u201d agency spokesman Ben Gonzalez said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nonprofit workers in the Rio Grande Valley say they&rsquo;ve seen an increase this year in the number of rip-off artists charging Texans for help signing up for health insurance &mdash; a service they are eligible to get for free.", "parsely-title": "Rise Seen in Health Insurance Scammers", "twitter": {"description": "Nonprofit workers in the Rio Grande Valley say they&rsquo;ve seen an increase this year in the number of rip-off artists charging Texans for help signing up for health insurance &mdash; a service t...", "title": "Rise Seen in Health Insurance Scammers", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/12/02/advocates-warn-rise-health-insurance-scammers/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/Uninsured4_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "creator": "@ewalterstx", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "Nonprofit workers in the Rio Grande Valley say they&rsquo;ve seen an increase this year in the number of rip-off artists charging Texans for help signing up for health insurance &mdash; a service they are eligible to get for free.", "title": "Rise Seen in Health Insurance Scammers", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/12/02/advocates-warn-rise-health-insurance-scammers/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/Uninsured4_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Federal Health Reform And Texas,Texas Department Of Insurance", "parsely-author": "Edgar Walters", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "Dec. 2, 2015, 6 a.m.", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/Uninsured4_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/12/02/advocates-warn-rise-health-insurance-scammers/"}, "article_summary": "It might be a man on his laptop at a Saturday flea market, accepting cash to help people sign up for subsidized health coverage on Healthcare.gov.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about hard-working, resource-limited people who are not aware they may be charged, that\u2019s crossing the line,\" said Jose Medrano, a regional director for Enroll America, an advocacy group offering free information to people signing up for health insurance.\nThe lack of clarity about how Texans can access subsidized health insurance could hamper the federal government\u2019s efforts at a time when it is specifically eyeing the state for more signups.\nNot Obamacare.\u201dIn any case, advocates for the uninsured warn, if it asks for money, it's probably a scam to prey on low-income Texans seeking mandated insurance coverage under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law.\nTexas navigators face greater scrutiny than their counterparts in other states."}
