Here are five times it fell well short of that standard.\n\nThe Fact Checker column usually tackles strong statements on complex issues that require rigorous research, analysis, and context.\n\nAnd sometimes you get a nothing-burger like when Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), tapping into many Americans\u2019 frustrations with the bizarre complexity of their tax system, made the completely accurate statement that the IRS tax code contains more words than the Bible.\n\nA sharp-tongued man who has never been accused of getting favorable press, Cruz was put through the ringer by the Washington Post. The fact that this easily verifiable nugget was even worth a long column in one of the country\u2019s most well-read newspaper sites is strange in and of itself; as writer Michelle Ye Hee Lee pointed out, she simply copy-and-pasted both documents into Microsoft Word to get the word count. The King James Bible contains more than 800,000, while the IRS code has about 3.7 million.\n\nTed Cruz says a number is bigger than another, smaller number. WaPo fact-checks. http://t.co/0s7RX3c8Bf \u2014 Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) March 11, 2015\n\nPretty easy. Sounds like a Check Mark statement. Yet, while \u201cCruz is correct on the comparison of words in both texts,\u201d Lee concluded it was \u201ca nonsense fact, something that is technically correct but ultimately meaningless. Thus it is not worthy of a Geppetto Checkmark but neither does it qualify for a Pinocchio.\u201d\n\nCruz makes the point that tax policies need to be drastically simplified, and many Americans likely would support that sentiment. But such a crude comparison, which provides no nuance or context, doesn\u2019t capture why the tax code has become so complex and how it affects taxpayers.\n\nSome true statements are truer than other statements, right? For his part, Kessler thought Fact-Checker was \u201cgenerous\u201d to not award any Pinocchios in this instance.\n\n@EdMorrissey No apology necessary. I thought we were being generous in not awarding any Pinocchios but obviously some disagree! \u2014 Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) March 11, 2015\n\nOne of President Obama\u2019s most clearly baloney remarks came when he told assembled press in 2013 that he \u201cdidn\u2019t set a red line\u201d on Syria but, rather, the \u201cworld set a red line\u201d regarding the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons. In 2012, Obama said, \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\u201d\n\nGlenn Kessler included this in his introduction:\n\nHow can the president say he did not create a \u201cred line\u201d when his statement last year about a \u201cred line\u201d is one of the most famous statements of his presidency? We\u2019ve certainly received many tweets and e-mails from readers eager to see The Fact Checker slap a bunch of Pinocchios on him.\n\nHe went on to provide the context that Obama\u2019s words in 2012 surprised his aides, but the next day Press Secretary Josh Earnest backed up Obama\u2019s rhetoric and, as Kessler put it, \u201cthe red line, for better or worse, was in place.\u201d\n\nWe know what happened next. Assad used chemical weapons on his own people in August of 2013, and Obama hedged on taking military action, placing the idea of any \u201cred line\u201d on the rest of the world. From The Weekly Standard comes more proof that Obama meant what he said, with a White House official saying, \u201cWe go on to reaffirm that the President has set a clear red line as it relates to the United States that the use of chemical weapons or the transfer of chemical weapons to terrorist groups is a red line that is not acceptable to us.\u201d\n\nYet Kessler concluded this was an \u201cill-considered rhetorical statement\u201d and a \u201cbungled talking point\u201d rather than a full flop or a lie.\n\nThe Emergency Committee for Israel and Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign released ads in 2012 criticizing Obama for not visiting Israel once during his first term and creating \u201cdaylight\u201d between the two countries.\n\nKessler listed all other U.S. presidents\u2019 travel schedules since Israel\u2019s founding and found four of the other 11, including Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, had made official visits to the Jewish state. No part of either ad claimed that Obama wasn\u2019t the only president not to go, or even mentioned other presidents, but apparently not including this bit of added noise to 30-second spots was dishonest. The ads also pointed out Obama\u2019s trips around the rest of the Middle East while spurning Israel, which are not in dispute.\n\nThe daylight created between Israel and the U.S. during the Obama administration is one of the worst marks on the White House\u2019s foreign policy record, and these ads highlighted that. EIC Executive Director Noah Pollak defended his group\u2019s ad to Kessler by saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t criticize Obama simply for not visiting in his first term. It doesn\u2019t make any comparison to visits by other presidents. It criticizes him for traveling to the Middle East repeatedly but intentionally skipping Israel as part of his \u2018daylight\u2019 policy of distancing the U.S. from Israel while pursuing friendly relations with Muslim states. I think the ad is pretty clear on this.\u201d\n\nKessler acknowledged Pollak was \u201ccorrect\u201d on that front but still saw fit to give the ads Two Pinocchios.\n\nYes, she did, as an Americans for Prosperity explained in a damning ad in 2014. But to hear Kessler tell it, this was \u201cTwo Pinocchio\u201d worthy because, in the 60-39 Senate cloture vote that ended debate on the Affordable Care Act in 2009, every Democrat cast a \u201cdeciding\u201d vote on the bill.\n\nWell, yeah. And if Landrieu had not done so, the bill would not have achieved cloture at that time. Every vote was a \u201cdeciding vote\u201d and Landrieu was one of them. Blogger Paterico explains:\n\nHer vote was not just \u201cimportant\u201d to the outcome \u2014 it was critical. It was indispensable \u2014 in the sense that without it, there would be no ObamaCare. There would be no second bill and no signed law. Landrieu\u2019s vote was absolutely essential to the passage of the law \u2014 as was the vote of every other Democrat.\n\nKessler instead got bogged down with the semantics of AFP using \u201cdeciding\u201d versus \u201ccrucial\u201d or \u201cindispensable\u201d and felt the claim was untrue enough to merit a Two Pinocchio rating.\n\nSNL skit suggests Obama\u2019s immigration executive action is unconstitutional*\n\nWas it the sheer shock of watching Saturday Night Live actually get a pretty good burn on Obama? Maybe that\u2019s what compelled policy editor Zachary Goldfarb to fact-check a November cold open skewering Obama taking executive action to shield illegal immigrants from deportation. In the skit parodying Schoolhouse Rock, Jay Pharaoh\u2019s Obama pushes Kenan Thompson\u2019s \u201cBill\u201d down the Capitol steps repeatedly, while the Executive Order (Bobby Moynihan) smokes a cigarette and sings, \u201cI\u2019m an executive order, and I pretty much just happen.\u201d\n\nGoldfarb got super-serious and dissected such details as executive orders versus executive actions and the constitutionality of Obama\u2019s endeavor. He didn\u2019t get into how Obama had said for years that his executive amnesty actions were outside his authority.\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t appear the Washington Post ever checked for sure that Will Ferrell\u2019s Bush wanted to put Germany, the economy and math into his \u201cAxis of Evil.\u201d That, of course, would have been absurd since this was a silly comedy show. They did get around, four years later, to debunking the idea that Sarah Palin had actually said \u201cI can see Russia from my house,\u201d as made famous by Tina Fey\u2019s impersonation.\n\nWe give these blunders double double Pinocchios.\n\n*Goldfarb did not write that article for the Fact Checker column.
