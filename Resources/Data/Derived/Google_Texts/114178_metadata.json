Tonight we have wine, tomorrow we have coffee, and then we say goodbye.\u201d\n\nEager to be there on the final day of business, loyal customers flocked to the coffeehouse at 1553 Platte St.\n\nChad Thurman, 29, approached Maguire at the counter to let her know how sad he was to see the cafe closing.\n\n\u201cThis was literally the first place I came when I got my driver\u2019s license,\u201d Thurman told Maguire. \u201cIt\u2019s been a staple.\u201d\n\nThurman said he didn\u2019t realize the coffeehouse was closing, so he was glad he happened to stop by Saturday for tea.\n\n\u201cThe owners have always been very friendly and welcoming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hustle-and-bustle coffeeshop, just trying to get the next cappuccino out. They know you. I\u2019m going to miss it a lot.\u201d\n\nJill Hamilton, 46, said her first job was at Paris on the Platte when she moved to Denver in 1993.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place I\u2019ve ever worked,\u201d said Hamilton, who stopped by to say goodbye. \u201cIt has always been a funky, eclectic, awesome, good-energy place.\u201d\n\nEven after moving to a different job, Hamilton said she always popped in whenever she found herself in the neighborhood.\n\nJacque Williams, 53, also made a special trip to the coffeehouse Saturday after hearing it was shutting down.\n\n\u201cI used to come here with my son when he was about 3 years old,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, he\u2019s 28. It\u2019s too bad some of these places are closing down. (I\u2019ll miss) the community feeling.\u201d\n\nMaguire said a new cafe will move into the space. After 28 years, she said it was just time to get out.\n\n\u201cSo many people have told me over the last couple of days how important Paris was in their lives,\u201d she said between hugs and goodbyes to longtime customers. \u201cIt\u2019s really been about the community.\u201d\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666 or agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fans say goodbye to Paris on the Platte", "title": "Fans say goodbye to Paris on the Platte", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/17/fans-say-goodbye-to-paris-on-the-platte/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__paris-platte-1p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__paris-platte-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T12:43:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:25:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f8d\"", "article_summary": "Billed as the oldest coffeehouse in Denver, Paris on the Platte opened in 1986 \u2014 long before Coors Field and the success of Lower Downtown and the Highland neighborhood.\nFamilies, longtime customers and former employees crowded into Paris on the Platte on Saturday afternoon as the iconic Denver cafe served its final rounds of coffee and tea.\nI\u2019m going to miss it a lot.\u201dJill Hamilton, 46, said her first job was at Paris on the Platte when she moved to Denver in 1993.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place I\u2019ve ever worked,\u201d said Hamilton, who stopped by to say goodbye.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing 28 years watching everything grow up around us.\u201dThe closure was announced on the cafe\u2019s Facebook page Friday:\u201cAu revoir,\u201d the post read."}
