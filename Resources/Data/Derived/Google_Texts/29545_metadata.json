The school requires students to dress modestly and \u201cseek parental counsel when pursuing a romantic relationship.\u201d\n\nBut the match has been a good one. Scanlan returned to campus in late August to begin her sophomore year. Among the things she loves about her classmates and her campus: \u201cI\u2019ve never had to sign an autograph, and I\u2019ve never had to take a picture. Here, I can be just another student,\u201d she said.\n\nBlending in is not always easy for Scanlan, who won the Miss America Contest at 17, representing Nebraska. The youngest Miss America in more than 70 years, she spent a year fulfilling her duties and enrolled at Patrick Henry in 2012. She says the school\u2019s workload matched the grueling schedule as Miss America.\n\nSEE ALSO: Christian baker hounded by gays to close shop: My faith in God \u2018has grown\u2019\n\nThe school was established in 2000 with the goal of giving home-schooled Christian conservatives a foundation to help them effect change in government, the law and journalism.\n\nThe school started with 90 students and a single major \u2014 government. It is still a tiny campus in the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C., but now has 320 students and five majors, including journalism, literature and history. The SAT scores of its students are comparable to top-tier state universities.\n\nScanlan, who came from a homeschooling family, says she wanted to go to Patrick Henry ever since she was 8.\n\nSEE ALSO: Atheists threaten suit over 9/11 memorial with Christian cross\n\nShe said she\u2019s frustrated by stereotypes that some hold about Patrick Henry students. She recalled a recent photo essay published about the school that she felt went out of its way to depict students as cloistered weirdos. The reality, she said, is that while the students are Christian, they come from a variety of backgrounds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that we don\u2019t struggle with the same problems, that we don\u2019t understand real world problems \u2026 that everyone comes from wonderful, happy families, that we\u2019re close-minded and brainwashed. That kind of pushes my buttons,\u201d she said.\n\nThe degree to which some people are willing to make snap judgments about her has occasionally taken her aback. As a teenager, she admits her schedule as Miss America and some of the accompanying expectations, wore on her. The negativity she faced from anonymous Internet critics was hurtful.\n\n\u201cTo have someone look at a picture of you and decide just based on that picture that they hate you, and that they\u2019re going to tell the world that they hate you \u2014 that takes some getting used to,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring her year as Miss America, she began to feel depressed and, at times, even suicidal. The depression continued during her freshman year, she said, when she found her coursework grueling, with a heavy emphasis on reading and writing. She earned a 3.75 grade-point average, but was disappointed because she had set a goal of a 3.9 or higher, which she feels she needs to get accepted into Harvard Law School.\n\nShe reached out to her parents for help during her spring semester, and she\u2019s now taking fewer classes and worrying less about others\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finally starting to let go of some of the stress, some of the responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she loves her school, she said she has occasionally received criticism from some there who feel the Miss America pageant, particularly the swimsuit competition, is not compatible with a Christian lifestyle because it shows too much skin or objectifies women. Scanlan respectfully disagrees.\n\n\u201cI have never violated my conscience. I was never compromising my morals,\u201d she said. \u201cFor myself, I have never believed it\u2019s wrong for a female to wear a swimsuit that would show the same amount of skin a man. It\u2019s a bit of a double standard.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s founder and chancellor, Mike Farris, also said he received sporadic complaints that Scanlan\u2019s status as a Miss America was supposedly contrary to the school\u2019s code and values.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view getting into the pageant world to be incompatible with Christian values,\u201d said Farris \u2014 who made his name as a lawyer defending homeschooler families.\n\nFarris never had any doubts that Scanlan would be a good ambassador for the school. Farris sensed she could be a starter on Patrick Henry\u2019s Moot Court team, which Farris coaches and regularly wins national championships.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very bright, a great communicator,\u201d Farris said, noting she placed third in a regional in Moot Court championships as a freshman. \u201cYeah, no doubt I expect a national championship out of her.\u201d\n\nKira Clark, a Moot Court teammate of Scanlan\u2019s and now a roommate, described Scanlan as \u201ca caring, incredibly ambitious, smart, compassionate person who puts her friends first.\u201d\n\nOn the small campus, she said students don\u2019t dwell on the fact that Scanlan was Miss America.\n\n\u201cWe see her as a sister we can be proud of, rather than a celebrity we can be taking advantage of,\u201d Clark said.\n\nDespite her plans to reduce stress, Scanlan remains ambitious. On her LinkedIn profile, she lists herself, among other things, as \u201c2028 presidential candidate.\u201d She would be 35, the constitutional minimum to serve as president.\n\nFarris, who designed the school with the idea of launching Christian conservatives into the public sphere, said Scanlan and many other Patrick Henry students set such goals and he encourages them to aim high.\n\n\u201cIf they mess up and only get to be governors and senators, I\u2019ll live with it,\u201d Farris said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PURCELLVILLE, Va. \u2014 It's a startling contrast to some observers \u2014 the glamorous, bikini-clad Miss America from 2011, Teresa Scanlan, finding her home at the tiny, super-conservative Patrick Henry College.
