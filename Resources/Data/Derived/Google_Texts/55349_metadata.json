If \u2013 God forbid \u2013 we discover today that I require extensive treatment, I will turn over every bit of information you need,\u201d I promised. \u201cBut for now, the answer is no.\u201d\n\nMore than once, a receptionist called an office manager to deal with me.\n\n\u201cHow do you store the scan?\u201d I\u2019d ask the office manager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our system,\u201d she would say. \u201cNobody has access to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is your system secured?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a firewall,\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you do, but how is your electronic data secured?\u201d\n\nNo matter what they said, I always went deeper, and I always won.\n\nThat was before my catastrophic care policy was rendered illegal by the Affordable Care Act. Now, Obamacare has defeated me in my quest for digital privacy and security, but I still put up a fight. I will lose, but it\u2019s important to resist the data collectors.\n\nIf I don\u2019t protest, it won\u2019t occur to these people that they have no right to my personal information; that they aren\u2019t adequately securing it (trust me, they aren\u2019t); and that they are placing me in jeopardy, through a combination of acquiescence and negligence.\n\nWhen the retail cashier asks if I\u2019m a discount club member, I say no.\n\n\u201cIf you can afford to give me a discount, then just give it to me. Why do I have to turn over my email address and phone number?\u201d I ask.\n\nYes, they often, they say yes, it\u2019s true. They have a fake membership card they can swipe, and I get the discount anyway. But if they don\u2019t \u2013 even if I pay fifteen cents more for a bottle of nail polish remover, I will not turn over any personal information. Is it fair? No. Is it the right thing to do? Yes, it is.\n\nI once brought a DMV employee to the edge of a breakdown, and I don\u2019t say that with any pride. I\u2019m not just a jackass who enjoys a power struggle with a public employee.\n\n\u201cWhy do you need my mother\u2019s maiden name to issue me a driver\u2019s license?\u201d\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable question. My mother\u2019s name is the key to my bank account, and I wonder what assurance it provides that I can safely negotiate a crowded freeway. He couldn\u2019t give me a reasonable answer, and I so pressed harder, and ultimately, he couldn\u2019t look me in th eye.\n\nThe poor man had to call his supervisor. The supervisor and I went back into history to look at my previous driver\u2019s license applications \u2013 yes, they\u2019re stored for years \u2013 to see what information was included back in the day, before there was Real ID.\n\nThe supervisor offered me a choice. Certainly, he said, you can withhold my mother\u2019s maiden name (and other information I suggested has no place in their possession).\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. I can withhold, but you will withhold my license renewal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he replied. He was very pleasant, though.\n\n\u201cSo please pass along to management that I\u2019ve registered a protest,\u201d I said, and he agreed to do it. Yeah, right.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t even open an account with NV Energy or other utilities unless you turn over your social security number. Ten years ago, you could just pay an extra deposit, and withhold the personal data. I know, because I did it. A hundred to the power company, a hundred to the water company, a hundred to Waste Management. It was expensive, but I withheld my personal identifiers, and it gave me peace of mind.\n\nNow, you could offer them your dead mother\u2019s 10-carat engagement ring, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t open these accounts without providing a social security number.\n\nI protest anyway, and you should too. Make no mistake, it\u2019s a lonely fight. It\u2019s inconvenient, and it\u2019s expensive, and it\u2019s exhausting. But we can\u2019t go through life handing out personal information to anybody who asks, all day long, without conducting a bit of consciousness raising. It sends the wrong message, and from a practical standpoint, it\u2019s stupid.\n\nNote to data collectors: If you need to find me, you can. My car is traced, my license plate is scanned, my phone is traced, my credit cards are traced, and there are cameras everywhere measuring my facial features. Don\u2019t worry. you\u2019re in control, even without my social security number.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "kkoh-am", "description": "By Samantha Stone When the retail cashier asks if I'm a discount club member, I say no.
