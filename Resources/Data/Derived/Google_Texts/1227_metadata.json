The matched sample for all Medicare patients aged 65 and over for any primary diagnosis was 667,684 hospital stays. For purposes of the study, oral nutritional supplements given to patients were defined as dietary food, often in liquid form, that provide calories, protein and nutrients for added nutrition and energy in the diet.\n\nThe analysis demonstrated that use of nutritional supplements were associated with an 8.4 percent reduction in 30-day readmissions for patients with any diagnosis, a 10.1 percent reduction among patients with congestive heart failure, and a 12 percent reduction for acute myocardial infarction patients. The research was conducted by teams at the University of Southern California, Stanford University, The Harris School at The University of Chicago and Precision Health Economics.\n\n[See also: Nutrition research has economic impact]\n\n\u201cMalnutrition is a really big problem among patients, and particularly with the Affordable Care Act and the readmission penalties \u2013 it\u2019s something we can focus on that can decrease these readmissions,\u201d said Kelly Tappenden, Ph.D., R.D., FASPEN, Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition representative from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cOne in three patients enters the hospital malnourished. Patients do not do as well with malnutrition. They have increased chances of complications, infections and lengths of stays.\u201d\n\nThe study also discovered a 16 percent, or 1.65 days, reduction in length of stay among all the studied patients, and 15.8 percent in cost savings per episode, equivalent to $3,079.\n\nThese cost savings are even more important when considering that, effective on Oct. 1, the ACA increased hospital penalties based on readmissions for three conditions: acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and pneumonia, with an estimated $227 million in fines expected to be levied by Medicare this year, said Tappenden.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is also looking at expanding readmission penalties to include other diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and knee and hip replacements.\n\n[See also: Patient nutrition focus of new alliance]\n\nTappenden explained that while the facts about nutritional supplement use are public knowledge, nutrition is often overlooked and undervalued at hospitals. Even more disturbing, she said that although the Joint Commission mandates a nutritional screening of patients within 24 hours of admissions, such a procedure is not always completed or followed up on.\n\n\u201cThe therapeutic value of nutrition is often underappreciated by many clinicians, which is why we\u2019re trying to improve awareness with data on how to reduce costs so they can start paying attention more and put into place these procedures,\u201d Tappenden said.\n\nThe Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition suggests that hospitals make nutrition and nutritional screenings a part of the entire care team's responsibilities. Tappenden says attention to detail will likely improve Medicare readmission rates by decreasing malnutrition.\n\n\u201cTalk about nutrition, make sure it\u2019s not overlooked, and screen 100 percent of the patients,\u201d she said. \u201cEngage evidence-based care that we know will make a difference. Hospital administrators also need to take a role \u2013 share the quality and economic gains at the hospital against the relatively low investment in nutritional programs. Administrators are really important for communication. Ensure that this isn\u2019t left on the table.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/better-nutrition-tied-fewer-readmissions-according-study", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "New research suggests that healthcare organizations can lower their readmission rates and improve patient care simply by using oral nutritional supplements as part of an overall patient care protocol.", "title": "Better patient nutrition may mean fewer Medicare readmissions"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "New research suggests that healthcare organizations can lower their readmission rates and improve patient care simply by using oral nutritional supplements as part of an overall patient care protocol.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Better patient nutrition may mean fewer Medicare readmissions"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "New research suggests that healthcare organizations can lower their readmission rates and improve patient care simply by using oral nutritional supplements as part of an overall patient care protocol.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7caf\"", "article_summary": "The Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition suggests that hospitals make nutrition and nutritional screenings a part of the entire care team's responsibilities.\nNew research suggests that healthcare organizations can lower their readmission rates and improve patient care simply by using oral nutritional supplements as part of an overall patient care protocol.\nThe matched sample for all Medicare patients aged 65 and over for any primary diagnosis was 667,684 hospital stays.\n[See also: Patient nutrition focus of new alliance]Tappenden explained that while the facts about nutritional supplement use are public knowledge, nutrition is often overlooked and undervalued at hospitals.\nTappenden says attention to detail will likely improve Medicare readmission rates by decreasing malnutrition."}
