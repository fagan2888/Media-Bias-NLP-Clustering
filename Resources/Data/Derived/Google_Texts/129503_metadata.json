Residents are cleaning up after hurricane-force winds raced through their town. In addition to the wind, lightning struck near Jessica Gardner's home. It hit a tree in her yard, splitting it in half and landing on her friend's car. \"We are feeling pretty lucky, it only took half a shingle on my house and their minivan only sustained minor scratches,\" Gardner said.\n\nPower in Beloit was out for 12 hours, some power lines were taken out by trees while many power poles were blown crooked by the wind.\n\nTree branches with a diameter of four-to-six inches could be found laying across many yards and alleyways.\n\nIn northwest Kansas an 89 mile per hour wind gust was reported north of Atwood. Blowing dust limited visibility to zero, stopping traffic on I-70 for a short period of time. Baseball sized hail was also reported in the Colby and Goodland area.\n\nWichita received 0.97 inches of rainfall overnight that caused flooding on many city roads.\n\nTo see photos from the weekend storms", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Damage reported in across the state after a line of severe storms passed through.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Damage reported in across the state after a line of severe storms passed through.", "title": "Storms leave damage behind in Kansas", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Storms-leave-damage-behind-in-northern-Kansas-263220641.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F51/579/F5157916693646279BA6F7709061CF1A", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/260/654/2606547E4D4E4AF4BF6FF35B04743A41.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Damage reported in across the state after a line of severe storms passed through.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Storms-leave-damage-behind-in-northern-Kansas-263220641.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Beloit+Tree+Damage.jpg", "title": "Storms leave damage behind in Kansas", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Storms leave damage behind in Kansas", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Storms leave damage behind in"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd330\"", "article_summary": "High winds and hail caused damage in parts of northern and western Kansas overnight.\nIn northwest Kansas an 89 mile per hour wind gust was reported north of Atwood.\nIt hit a tree in her yard, splitting it in half and landing on her friend's car.\nWichita received 0.97 inches of rainfall overnight that caused flooding on many city roads.\nTree branches with a diameter of four-to-six inches could be found laying across many yards and alleyways."}
