Saturday, though, Franklin was relieved.\n\nSitting at the front of the media room, the Penn State coach smiled and exhaled after the Nittany Lions snapped their four-game losing streak. In that moment, Franklin was all those words tied into one and wrapped up with a grin. Penn State\u2019s 13-7 victory against Indiana puts the Lions (5-4, 2-4 Big Ten) within one win of bowl eligibility, and it didn\u2019t matter that the win was perfectly imperfect. When the Memorial Stadium scoreboard struck zero, Franklin\u2019s team outlasted the Hoosiers (3-6, 0-5) and Penn State celebrated its first win since Sept. 20 against Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cThis is the prettiest win I\u2019ve had in my 20 years of coaching and I\u2019m looking forward to getting back on that bus and heading home and enjoying this win for a couple hours,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cBeautiful. Would you prefer beautiful? Wonderful? \u2026 It\u2019s a W.\u201d\n\nThe defense did more than its share yet again, keeping Indiana\u2019s star running back Tevin Coleman in check. The Lions limited Coleman to 71 rushing yards on 20 carries, snapping Coleman\u2019s streak of 10 consecutive games with 100-plus rushing yards. The defense didn\u2019t let the Indiana offense score, pitching a shutout with the Hoosiers\u2019 lone touchdown coming off a Christian Hackenberg interception that was returned 47 yards for a score.\n\nNeeding a big play late in the fourth quarter to avoid another close defeat, linebacker Nyeem Wartman picked off Indiana\u2019s third-string quarterback, Zander Diamont. The Penn State offense couldn\u2019t put together a touchdown drive, instead setting up Sam Ficken for the successful 28-yard field goal with 55 seconds left. Ficken also hit a 27-yard field goal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cPeople on the team kept telling me I had a lane for the end zone. I wish I would\u2019ve read it,\u201d said Wartman, who had his first collegiate interception and was looking for his first career pick-6. \u201cEverybody keeps saying, \u2018Wait until you watch the film, you\u2019re going to see you had a lane.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThroughout the ups and downs of the game, the Lions did just enough to work through their small margin of error and find a way to win. Days after vowing to unveil a few new offensive wrinkles, the Lions responded in the second quarter after Hackenberg\u2019s pick-6 put them behind, 7-0.\n\nPenn State went with a conventional up-the-gut run to try to give Hackenberg some room to operate, but running back Bill Belton said he wanted to unleash the burdens of his own struggles and those of the offense in the previous four games.\n\nThe senior burst through the middle and got just enough of a block from his tight end to see a whole lot of room in front of him. Belton chugged on, outrunning three defenders who were on his heels as he crossed midfield, cut to his left and kept his balance after getting tripped up around the 10. Belton pulled off the 92-yard touchdown, the longest rushing score in Penn State history.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sort of been itching to have an opportunity like that and he took advantage of it,\u201d Hackenberg said. \u201cI saw it open up, I saw him hit it and I knew he had a shot.\u201d\n\nLike Franklin and the rest of the team, Belton celebrated after his score, saying he wanted to respond after \u201cnot playing well\u201d the past two weeks when he combined for 22 yards on 17 carries.\n\nBelton finished with a season-high 137 rushing yards, the first rusher to eclipse 100 yards for Penn State this season.\n\n\u201cMy biggest thing was I wasn\u2019t trying to get caught from behind,\u201d Belton said. \u201cOnce you see the touchdown in front of you, it\u2019s kind of like, \u2018All right, I\u2019ve got to get there.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA season after throwing 10 interceptions as a freshman, Hackenberg added two more and was held without a touchdown for the fourth time this season. He was sacked five times, the result of holding the ball too long, receivers not getting separation and a patchwork offensive line.\n\nThe line, which played without injured left tackle Donovan Smith for the second consecutive game, did receive a boost as senior left guard Miles Dieffenbach played a few series off the bench, his first action of the season.\n\nThe Lions will continue easing Dieffenbach back into the lineup, possibly doubling his workload next week against Temple, Franklin said. Smith didn\u2019t make the trip to Bloomington.\n\nToday, the Lions will hit the practice field and prepare for their game against Temple Saturday. Until then, Franklin and the Lions will enjoy this one, knowing all too well how difficult it is to get back above .500.\n\n\u201cRight now, where we\u2019re at as a program, we\u2019re just going to find ways to get Ws,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cThe most important thing where we\u2019re at right now is to get a W, get back on that plane and keep building.\u201d\n\nAudrey Snyder: asnyder@post-gazette.com and Twitter @audsnyder4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Penn State defense did more than it\u2019s share yet again, keeping Indiana\u2019s star running back Tevin Coleman in check.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. \u2014 James Franklin likes to throw around adjectives such as \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cexcellent.\u201d The past seven weeks, despite four consecutive losses and two off weeks, the coach wouldn\u2019t publicly let on that he was anything but positive.
