It was founded more than 80 years ago by the father of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and is run by Osama's brother Bakr.\n\nNeither the company, nor the family, issued an immediate statement on the suspension. The company is believed to have attributed the collapse to a lightning strike breaking a cable that was used to secure the crane.\n\nA statement by a spokesman for the administration of the mosques in Mecca and Medina said the crane smashed into the part of the Grand Mosque where worshippers circle the Kaaba - the black-clad cube towards which the world's 1.6 billion Muslims face to pray.\n\n\"The state \u200ewants to show to both the corporate and the Islamic world that they will address any wrongdoing and that they are on top of things,\" said John Sfakianakis, regional director at Ashmore Group.\n\nThe hajj, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, has been prone to disasters in the past, mainly from stampedes as pilgrims rush to complete rituals and return home. Hundreds of pilgrims died in such a crush in 2006.\n\nHowever, extensive development work on the main pilgrimage sites, expanding those where dense crowds had previously led to stampedes, have prevented such incidents, which were previously common, in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Ali Abdelatti and Marwa Rashad, writing by Sami Aboudi and Angus McDowall, Editing by William Maclean and Angus MacSwan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It also ordered the Finance Ministry to review existing projects by the firm, a titan", "title": "Saudi suspends Saudi Binladin Group over Mecca crane disaster", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/15/Saudi-suspends-Binladin-group-over-Mecca-crane-crash-royal-court", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/saudi-haj_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/15/Saudi-suspends-Binladin-group-over-Mecca-crane-crash-royal-court", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/saudi-haj_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It also ordered the Finance Ministry to review existing projects by the firm, a titan", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b6c\"", "article_summary": "The crane toppled over at Mecca's Grand Mosque last Friday, less than two weeks before Islam's annual hajj pilgrimage.\nThe company, one of the largest contracting companies in the kingdom, had been carrying expansion work at the Grand Mosque.\nSaudi Binladin Group has long been regarded in the conservative Islamic kingdom as the government's favorite contractor for important or sensitive work, including defense and security projects.\nIt also ordered the Finance Ministry to review existing projects by the firm, a titan of the Arab business world.\nThe company is believed to have attributed the collapse to a lightning strike breaking a cable that was used to secure the crane."}
