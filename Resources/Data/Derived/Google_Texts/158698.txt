A federal hearing on Tuesday will consider if HCA hospitals are responsible for exhausting the Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits of a Florida woman in one day, the Palm Beach Post reports.

Penny Wollmen, a Palm Beach Gardens resident was in a car accident in 2014, and says a hospital exam at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis used all $10,000 of her benefits, the Post reports. The lawsuit claims hospitals grossly overcharge for services, sometimes up to 65 times what Medicare pays, the Post reports.

Three other Florida drivers join Wollmen in filing the lawsuit, being heard in a federal court in Tampa. Defendants include JFK Medical Center, Memorial Hospital Jacksonville, North Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville and HCA Holdings Inc. according to the Post.
