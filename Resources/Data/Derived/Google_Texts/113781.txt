CDH Investments is inching closer to a final close of its $2 billion fifth fund, as the Chinese private equity firm kicks off its three-day annual general meeting today in Hong Kong, said people familiar with the situation.

CDH Fund V LP is around the $1.5 billion mark and is officially targeting a final close by the end of the year, said one limited partner, who didn’t specify if his firm is an investor in CDH’s latest vehicle.
