Brad McClain, a pastor with congregations in Mobile and Fairhope.\n\nMcClain said he found that a family insurance plan comparable to the one he had would double his monthly premium from $800 to $1,600 and increase his deductible from $200 to $2,000 per person.\n\n\u201cWe were just shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Are you kidding me?... It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nBob Mannich, a Fairhope Realtor, said his premium would rise from $647 a month to $1,544. He said he was able to cut that to $890 by removing two adult children from his insurance.\n\nPondering the increase, Mannich said he thought not only of the immediate hit to his wallet but the potential impact on his livelihood. He said selling houses will be harder it potential buyers have to absorb increases of hundreds of dollars a month in their health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to hit the real estate market tough. \u2026 That\u2019s a house payment,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t pay what they can\u2019t pay.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the increased monthly premium, he said, the deductible for prescription drugs will rise from $600 to $2,000.\n\nResponding to mounting criticism that he had broken a promise to allow Americans to keep their insurance if they liked it, President Barack Obama last week announced he was seeking a one-year reprieve for folks in the individual insurance market who had plans that were no longer valid under the law that took effect this year. That is about 87,000 Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama customers.\n\nBut the insurer announced Wednesday that a one-year continuation of policies that violate the law \u201ccould create significant legal and financial risks\u201d to policyholders and the company.\n\nMcClain said Blue Cross and Blue Shield informed him that a cheaper option would give him a premium that is lower than what he faces but still higher than the one he had paid. Plus, he added, the per-person deductible would rise to $12,000 under that policy.\n\nMcClain said the new plan would cover procedures he does not need. For instance, the 60-year-old preacher whose child-rearing days are behind him, said the plan covers maternity care. But the new plan will not cover things he previously had, like dental care.\n\nAs a pastor, McClain said, he supports the goal of providing health coverage for the millions of Americans who don\u2019t have it. But he questioned whether the government has taken the right approach.\n\n\u201cIt is not as if we\u2019re trying to be callous about people\u2019s medical needs,\u201d he said.\n\nMcClain said he believes his income is too high to qualify for subsidies through the federal health care exchange under Obamacare. He said he checked with Humana Health Insurance and got quotes even higher than Blue Cross.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a reach for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen the beginning of a train wreck.\u201d\n\nMannich, the Fairhope Realtor, said he believes insurance companies ultimately will benefit from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is nothing but a windfall for the insurance companies,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like they were behind it, behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nMannich does not spare Obama, either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he ever cared how that was handled or how it was paid for,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just wanted it out there.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, Obamacare, news", "title": "Doubled premiums, higher deductibles: Blue Cross decision leaves some with few options", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Doubled premiums, higher deductibles: Blue Cross decision leaves some with few options\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/11/doubled_premiums_higher_deduct.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/13806758-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11684001\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-20T22:07:02Z\", \"author\": \"Brendan Kirby\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"affordable care act\",\"Obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/13806758-standard.jpg", "description": "The Rev.
