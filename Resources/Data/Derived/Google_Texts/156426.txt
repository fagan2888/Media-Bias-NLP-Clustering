There's a lot of insurers that want a bite of a potentially lucrative Obamacare pie.



Nearly 70 percent of insurers will sell health plans on the new Obamacare exchanges by 2015â€”and many already plan on expanding in those markets in future years, a survey released Wednesday by professional services giant PwC's Health Research Institute found.

But even those insurers are concerned the technology that will enable people to buy coverage on those online exchanges will run into problems, the survey of 101 insurance executives found.

Most insurers participating in those government-run insurance exchanges, which are set to open on Tuesday, are primarily motivated by a desire to sell plans to new members and to retain existing members, the survey said. A sense of social responsibility and public perception, while important motivators, were less of a priority.

"Our projection is for the year 2023, there will be 24 million customers in the state exchanges generating $210 billion in premium revenue annually," said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC's Health Research Institute.

"That's a business opportunity. Somebody is going to capture that market, and that money," Connolly said.
