She eventually kicked it away 100 meters later, and losing it ended any chance of a strong finish. Her foot was scarred and bloodied after the race.\n\n\u201c(Genzebe) Dibaba went by, and about 700 meters to go, the heel of my shoe got caught by somebody and just slipped off,\u201d she told Universal Sports. \u201cThere\u2019s some pretty intense jostling, and that\u2019s where I started to lose half of it. And I was clenching my toes as hard as possible just try to keep that toe box of my shoe in, and it just wouldn\u2019t stay on. So about 600 meters to go \u2026 I finally give up and just kick it off.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to kick it into the crowd of people and take anyone else out because it\u2019s, like, terrible for me, but I didn\u2019t want to ruin anyone else\u2019s race. I hope it didn\u2019t impede anyone. I tried to run without a shoe as long as I could, but I just really couldn\u2019t, like, get up on my toes and start kicking.\u201d\n\nDibaba of Ethiopia \u2014 the world record holder in the event \u2014 took control halfway through after an extremely slow start, the kind typical of championship finals, finishing in 4:08.09 \u2014 a time that would have been even faster had she not pulled up in the last 15 meters to celebrate.\n\nKenya\u2019s Faith Kipyegon was second, .87 seconds back from her, and Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands was third, 1.25 seconds behind.\n\nShannon Rowbury, who set the American record in this event earlier this year, finished seventh in 4:12.39. Both Rowbury and Simpson took an early lead after the gun and led the field, trotting to a 77-second first 400 meters. Dibaba moved up alongside Simpson and Rowbury with two laps to go and cranked up the pace to lung-searing levels, and both Americans faded into the field.\n\nSimpson \u2014 who is coached by Colorado\u2019s Mark Wetmore and Heather Burroughs \u2014 won a gold medal in this event in 2011. She had advanced to the final on Sunday after racing to a fifth place finish in the semifinal.\n\nOnce she lost her shoe, Simpson debated dropping out to save further damage to her foot, which could hinder training for the rest of her track season.\n\n\u201cThat also goes through your mind: I\u2019m probably not going to finish well. Should I stop, because I have other races? Or what?\u201d Simpson told Universal Sports. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows how to handle it until they\u2019re in it. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m not going to finish. But I\u2019m going to run as hard as I can. And as everyone ran by me, I just thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to get them next week.'\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jenny Simpson finishes 11th at 1500 world championships after losing shoe", "title": "Jenny Simpson finishes 11th at 1500 world championships after losing shoe", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/25/jenny-simpson-finishes-11th-at-1500-world-championships-after-losing-shoe/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825_074608_jenny-simpson-pack-shot.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825_074608_jenny-simpson-pack-shot.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-25T07:35:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T03:56:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "And as everyone ran by me, I just thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to get them next week.\nOnce she lost her shoe, Simpson debated dropping out to save further damage to her foot, which could hinder training for the rest of her track season.\nBut I\u2019m going to run as hard as I can.\nShe eventually kicked it away 100 meters later, and losing it ended any chance of a strong finish.\nBoth Rowbury and Simpson took an early lead after the gun and led the field, trotting to a 77-second first 400 meters."}
