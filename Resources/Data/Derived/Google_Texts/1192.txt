Donald Trump called America "a dumping ground for the rest of the world" Monday at a Texas rally, where he also promised to replace Obamacare with some sort of system in his own name.

"We have to end this sanctuary cities crap fast," he declared.

The Republican presidential candidate drew ovations with his anti-immigration ire and talk of "anchor babies," despite calls from GOP officials to tone down his attacks on illegal immigrants.

"It's disgusting what's happening to our country," Trump told a crowd of about 15,000 in the American Airlines Center in Dallas, echoing his June candidacy announcement in which he called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and criminals.

"You people are suffering," he said. "I'm in New York, but they're in New York, too. They're all over the place."

The blustering billionaire also swore to repeal Obamacare in favor of a new system called "Donaldcare," but offered no details about what this new health care system would entail.

His supporters frequently interrupted his speech with wild cheers and chants of "USA!"

Trump, who started speaking 30 minutes later than scheduled, called his flock "the new silent majority" â€” before having second thoughts.

"Maybe we should call it the noisy, the aggressive, the wanting-to-win majority," he said. "That's what it is."

RICHARD COHEN: WHAT TRUMP COULD LEARN FROM MERKEL

Trump remains the leading GOP candidate in early presidential polls, and is the leading candidate in Texas, whose former governor Ricky Perry dropped out of the race last week. Perry was one of the few GOP peers who got some slack from Trump during the speech.

"He's a nice guy, but he came after me hard," The Donald told the crowd. "I like the man. Frankly, he tried."
