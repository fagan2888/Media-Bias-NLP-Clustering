Sometimes that\u2019s true, other times \u2026 it\u2019s hard to make the case.\n\nBut when startups bring tech smarts and design into large, hidebound industries, the good fight may actually be getting fought. The latest such effort is Oscar, a new healthcare startup. It offers its own health insurance.\n\nOscar is the only new commercial health insurance provider in New York State in the last 15 years.\n\nThe Oscar service includes three free physician visits, unlimited calls to a doctor at any time of the day or night, and unlimited generic drugs. Its least-expensive plan is priced near the bottom of the market \u2014 currently the third cheapest of 17 options on the new Obamacare health insurance exchange in New York.\n\nTo be clear, Oscar has not even begun to offer its service yet (January 1 is the kickoff). It\u2019s getting a steady stream of press due in part to a famous co-founder, but that means little for its long-term prospects.\n\nAdd the uncharted territory of health insurance to the gazillions of reasons that technology startups could fail. And the Affordable Care Act is not exactly a beacon of stability.\n\nBut here\u2019s the Oscar pitch, honed over the last two years \u2014 which has raised $40 million from investors including General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund, and is exceedingly well-timed to the launch of Obamacare \u2014 straight from the mouths of co-founders Josh Kushner and Mario Schlosser via a recent phone interview.\n\nHealth insurance in the United States is traditionally sold to employers. That misaligns incentives around care for actual people, and creates data gaps between something happening, the availability of a provider and the billing process.\n\nBy bridging the healthcare process together, Oscar thinks it can be more effective and cheaper. And, not a pain in the ass for all involved.\n\n\u201cWe actually can make an impact because we control the relationship,\u201d said Kushner, a real estate scion who invested in Instagram via his VC firm Thrive Capital and already has his own Wikipedia page. He and Schlosser previously co-founded the Brazilian social gaming company Vostu. \u201cWe were fortunate enough to dig into this and learn as much as we could before everything went into action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of startups out there that are incremental,\u201d Kushner adds. \u201cThere\u2019s so big many problems to solve, so why would you do anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cOriginally Oscar was not contingent on the ACA,\u201d said Schlosser. \u201cBut along the way we realized, wow, we can do so much more than be a pretty user interface.\u201d\n\nThe company spent two years getting certified in New York, which required something like 9,000 pages worth of filings, contracts and descriptions of how the business works, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your normal bullshit venture capital business model pitch with a hockey stick graph,\u201d Schlosser joked.\n\nFurther, the company needed so much capital because it had to set aside an ever-growing amount in reserve due to regulatory mandates ($1 in reserves for every $8 in premiums). Today, $29 million of the funding is held in reserve.\n\n\u201cIf you look really closely you realize there\u2019s a lot of data points to grab,\u201d said Schlosser. \u201cNormally, when you walk in to the doctor\u2019s office, you will get a claim from that doctor probably four weeks later.\u201d By contrast, Oscar registers the beginning of care in its system when the patient initiates a phone call or appointment.\n\nOr another example: Telemedicine. With traditional health insurance relationships, if a patient gets a migraine at four in the morning on a Saturday, often the best available option for care is an emergency room. That\u2019s overkill, and expensive and inefficient for everyone involved. Better to send the patient to a doctor via telephone who can pull up her medical history and send a report to her regular provider.\n\n\u201cIf you do basic research, it\u2019s a cost reduction to offer telemedicine,\u201d Schlosser said. \u201cIt\u2019s low-hanging fruit.\u201d\n\nThose insights come from a team of 42 people composed of techies like Foursquare co-founder Naveen Selvadurai and healthcare experts like Aran Ron, a doctor and long-time health insurance executive who was chief medical officer at Emblem in New York.\n\n\u201cWhenever we do something, we do it in a sound actuarial way,\u201d Schlosser said. \u201cOur insurance premiums were not just cooked up by our own spreadsheets.\u201d\n\nSo what happens if Obamacare gets sacrificed amid the ongoing political meltdown? Would that have an adverse impact on Oscar? Kushner\u2019s answer isn\u2019t the most convincing, but he claims he\u2019s not worried.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re the best to speak to that, but I would say no; we\u2019re already a business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe challenge now is getting people to sign up for Oscar. That hasn\u2019t been helped by the repeated downtime the New York exchange had in its first week.\n\nKushner and Schlosser said they plan to focus on the New York market for the foreseeable future. \u201cThere are about a million people in a 50-mile radius for whom it would be a good idea to sign up for this,\u201d Schlosser said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re treating this like a political campaign, trying to get the word out,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the streets. We have a ground game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By bridging the healthcare process together, Oscar thinks it can be more effective and cheaper.
