A family of three is without a home after their house caught fire Sunday afternoon.

The Tucson Fire Department received a call about a fence fire on the 400 block West Palmdale Road just before 12:30.

When firefighters arrived they were surprised to see black smoke and the back of the house engulfed in flames, according to Capt. Barrett Baker, TFD spokesman.

Additional fire engines were dispatched to help put out the fire.

A 41-year-old woman, a 20-year-old man and a 17-year-old female were able to get of the house safely and no one was injured.

Tucson firefighters say the fire started at the back of the house but the cause is still under investigation.
