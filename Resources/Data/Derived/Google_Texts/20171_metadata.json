On Wednesday, the site published a story with the Drudge-baiting headline \u201cObamacare could increase food stamp rolls,\u201d and even led by explaining what a great Republican talking point this is going to be.\n\nDrudge-baiting is usually a subtler exercise than this, but in their lust for clicks, Politico just drops the robe in the first paragraph:\n\nRepublicans have another reason to hate Obamacare: It could grow the number of people on food stamps.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, but no, it\u2019s not because David Frum will be forced onto SNAP by the $197.37 extra he\u2019ll have to pay if he keeps his adult children on his health insurance, which he\u2019s only allowed to do because of Obamacare. The headline is technically accurate, Obamacare may result in increased food stamp enrollment, but only in the same way that opening a new hospital increases the number of sick patients. The article goes on to explain that the Affordable Care Act will help people who already qualify for SNAP, but either didn\u2019t know it or otherwise weren\u2019t enrolled, access the assistance that they already need, but aren\u2019t getting.\n\nOr, as Politico puts it, these people will be \u201ctargeted\u201d:\n\nNearly all uninsured people now covered by the Medicaid expansion are also eligible for food stamps, but they are not all enrolled. Depending on how states put residents in these programs \u2014 many have integrated the process for SNAP and Medicaid \u2014 eligible food stamp recipients could be more easily targeted and encouraged to apply.\n\nSo far, this sounds like mostly good news. People who needed food assistance will now get it. Why is the headline not \u201cObamacare could connect hungry Americans with food aid,\u201d or, if you prefer conflict, \u201cRepublican Governors screwing constituents out of food aid they qualify for?\u201d\n\nThe article does get around (at the end of page two) to informing readers that some guys who already love poor people think this is a good thing, but they put Republican objections, unchallenged, right up front:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling that three years after passage, we\u2019re still learning about new unexpected consequences from Obamacare.\u201d wrote Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), who sponsored a bill to reform SNAP in the House, in an email to POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019d be very interested to see a report on the interaction between SNAP and Obamacare,\u201d Neugebauer wrote. \u201cAs a member of the ag committee, we\u2019ve been dealing with the interaction between SNAP and other federal programs for years and I\u2019ve been a strong advocate for reforming the categorical eligibility provisions that allow individuals to receive benefits when they don\u2019t otherwise qualify for SNAP.\u201d\n\nWait, but didn\u2019t the article just say that these were people who were already qualified for food stamps? Why is Politico then printing this without challenge?\n\nOn top of all of that, the \u201cnews peg\u201d of this article, that \u201cThe Obama administration has ordered a study to determine whether the Affordable Care Act, by increasing the number of people eligible for Medicaid, will also increase the number of people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,\u201d is actually eight months old. The Obama administration ordered this study back in March.\n\nAll of this, including the clinical mention of the tens of billions of dollars in SNAP cuts that Republicans already have their sights set on, is just window dressing to that enticing headline, a piece from a legitimate media outlet that allows conservatives to further link access to affordable health care to the welfare, and associated queens. Drudge hasn\u2019t bitten yet, but others have.
