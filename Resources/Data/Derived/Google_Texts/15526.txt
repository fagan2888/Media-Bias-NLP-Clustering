Hint: It’s a round number!

Associated Press:

No one from Alaska has enrolled in the new health care exchange, and a U.S. senator wants weekly updates on future enrollments…

In a letter Monday to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said no one in Alaska has been able to sign up.

“This system that cost more than $400 million, took three years to build, and was billed as a one-stop shop for individuals seeking health insurance is not working as advertised,” Murkowski wrote. “In its first two weeks of operation, I am told that no one was able to enroll in the Alaska Exchange.”

There must be some way to blame Palin for this…

Update:

I notice @Obamacare has gone silent. Must be because everything is running so smoothly, there’s nothing to say about it. YAY!!!!! — Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) October 15, 2013

Update: Back in June, Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) promised “aggressive outreach to help constituents use the exchanges and other consumer benefits.” Maybe that’s what happened. He was so aggressive, he scared everybody away!
