Daschle has been furious that Reid has refused to endorse, and the Democratic party has barely spent a dime on, the campaign of Democratic Senate candidate Rick Weiland. (We\u2019re not sure that an endorsement-endorsement from Harry Reid would help any Democratic Senate candidate, but a tacit nod towards the party\u2019s money apparatus to support someone sure would.) It goes back to candidate recruitment last year, when Reid and the party wanted former Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin to run. She chose not to, but Rick Weiland stayed in. Since then, the help Weiland\u2019s been getting from the party has been\u2026 [crickets].\n\nThe story was easy to dismiss, even a couple of weeks ago, because who cared about Harry Reid and Tom Daschle fighting over some lost Senate race? Now we know, though, that the race is hardly lost. It\u2019s a three-person race between Republican Mike Rounds, independent (and former Republican Senator) Larry Pressler, and Weiland. A well-publicized poll last week showed Rounds leading Pressler by a modest 3 percentage points, and Weiland by 7. The numbers are close enough that the DSCC is putting $1 million into the race \u2014 not to support either Pressler or Weiland, but to attack Rounds.\n\nPressler, the Republican-turned-independent, is the closest to Rounds in current polling and thus presents the best shot to knock the Republican off. Or maybe he did present the best shot.\n\nPolitico wrote up some opposition research on Pressler late last week that showed Pressler\u2019s principle residence is in Washington, D.C. One of the things we\u2019ve learned from races like, say, Kansas Senate, is that revelations about candidates not *actually* living in the states where they\u2019re running can be damaging. You could argue that these attacks are Very Silly \u2014 you don\u2019t need to sit on the recliner in some house in Kansas or South Dakota all the time in order to know how to represent a state\u2019s interests in Washington D.C. \u2014 but they do work.\n\nSuppose this news hurts Pressler. Then that offers Weiland a chance to grow. If Weiland were to become the predominant challenger to Rounds, that would make things easier for the Democratic party \u2014 instead of hoping that some independent (who was a Republican until like five seconds ago) wins and chooses to caucus with the Democrats, a real-life Democrat could be the one to save Tim Johnson\u2019s seat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rick Weiland is finally getting some urgent, last-minute (indirect) support from the national party.
