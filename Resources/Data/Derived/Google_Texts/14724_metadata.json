REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4195309\n\nColorado has become the 20th state to support a federal lawsuit filed last week by a Texas doctor to overturn the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt\u2019s only the third state with a Democratic governor to do so.\n\nColorado Attorney General John Suthers, a Republican, signed onto an amicus brief last week, showing support for the effort to overturn the law based on the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause, which says that all bills that raise revenue must begin in the House of Representatives.\n\nObamacare, the suit contends, began in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIf the Origination Clause means anything, it must mean that the ACA is unconstitutional,\u201d the brief reads, as reported by the Colorado Observer.\n\nBut exactly where the controversial law began is itself a point of controversy. The Observer notes that the U.S. Justice Department contends that it did indeed begin in the House, originally as H.R. 3590, which was concerned with housing tax credits for veterans. Once in the Senate, however, Obamacare opponents say its language was entirely stripped and replaced with what became the ACA.\n\n\u201cBy a voice vote of 416-0, the House passed the bill on October 8, 2009, and the enrolled version was eight pages long,\u201d the brief reads. \u201cAbout one month later, on November 19, 2009, the Senate struck every single word of H.R. 3590, deleted any reference to members of the military or home-ownership tax breaks, and substituted a 2,074-page \u2018amendment\u2019 that we now know as the ACA.\u201d\n\nPacific Legal Foundation is also challenging the law based on an Origination Clause argument in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the penalty for not signing up for health care under the new law is considered to be a tax.\n\n\u201cIf the charge for not buying insurance is seen as a federal tax, then a new question must be asked,\u201d PLF Principal Attorney Paul J. Beard II said in a press release. \u201cWhen lawmakers passed the ACA, with all of its taxes, did they follow the Constitution\u2019s procedures for revenue increases?\u201d\n\nThe Origination Clause was intended to check Congress\u2019s ability to levy taxes by requiring that such measures begin in the chamber whose members are deemed more \u201cpolitically accountable,\u201d according to the brief, since U.S. Representatives are elected every two years.\n\nAllowing Obamacare to stand, the brief argues, would render the clause moot.\n\nOf all the states to support the lawsuit, Colorado joins only Montana and West Virginia as states run by Democratic governors.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story incorrectly stated that revenue bills must originate in the Senate rather than the House of Representatives according to the Origination Clause. The post has been corrected.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
