It\u2019s falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should they tear it down when they could put it to good use?\u201d his nephew Jimmy responded. \u201cAt least fix up the gym so the kids have a place to play basketball. That school is part of Campti\u2019s history\u2014it would be a shame to see it go.\u201d\n\nThe building Steven and Jimmy were arguing over is the Campti Middle School, which stands across the street from Steven\u2019s house in Campti, Louisiana, one of the country\u2019s poorest towns. It was originally an all-black school, but eventually integrated before closing in the early \u201990s. Although Steven and Jimmy held opposing views of what should be done with it, they both took pride in the school and believed it positively shaped generations of Campti residents. Jimmy wanted to see the school renovated; Steven, on the other hand, was doubtful that the town would devote the necessary funds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just painful to watch it deteriorate day after day,\u201d Steven said.\n\nA man named Leon showed up on the back of a horse just as the ribs were being laid on the smoker. He joined the rest of the men under the tent, leaving his horse in the vacant lot across the street without tying him up. When the discussion turned to politics in Campti, Leon said, \u201cThere\u2019s three kinds of people in Campti.\u201d He smirked, showing large gaps between his teeth. \u201cThe good, the bad, and the fucked up.\u201d\n\nLeon grew up in Campti, working on his father\u2019s farm during the day and breaking wild horses with his brother in the evening. He left Campti for a job after high school and returned home for good only 11 years ago at the age of 63.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I signed up for Social Security and gone and made an ass out of myself,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Cause right when I signed up they raised the age to 66, and now they\u2019re talking about raising it again to 70. But hardly no one makes it to that age around here. Heck, I can open my old yearbook and point to maybe ten people from my class that are still alive today.\u201d\n\nHardly no one makes it to that age [70] around here.\n\nIn spite of his circumstances, Leon always managed to meet his responsibilities. \u201cI have a home that I maintain with some farmland and a few horses. I have 22 children, and the youngest is nine. But no one hunts me down for child support or nothing. I take care of my own, always.\u201d\n\nWhen the conversation under the tent began to heat up, Leon joined in. \u201cGeorge Bush ruined this country\u2014both Bushes, as a matter of fact. Obama tried to bring us back to where we were, but he failed, too. We\u2019ve had centuries of men promising great things when they\u2019re elected, but time and again failing to deliver on their word. This country\u2019s long overdue for a change\u2014if I don\u2019t see it in my lifetime, if it\u2019s not Hilary or someone else, then it certainly won\u2019t be long after I die that we see a woman step into office.\u201d\n\nA car wash on Route 71 CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nCampti is one of the poorest towns in America\u2014more specifically, among towns with a population over 1,000, it\u2019s the 8th poorest. With a median household income under $14,000 and a staggering poverty rate of 55 percent, many Campti residents don\u2019t have access to the basic resources that most Americans take for granted, such as food, reliable housing, and medical facilities. Campti begs the question: How do those who live in dire poverty manage their daily lives, and can a town struggling under the weight of such poverty ever transform itself?\n\nThe history of Campti is both rich and turbulent, a tale of prosperity, resilience, and decline. The town is the oldest settlement along Louisiana\u2019s Red River, which made it a hub for trade and travel through the 18th century. In the final years of the Civil War, though, Campti was destroyed when a group of Union soldiers returning from battle set the town ablaze. The only buildings left standing were the veteran\u2019s hospital and the Catholic church on the hill.\n\nIn the following decades, the town tenaciously bounced back, and by the early 20th century Campti once again flourished. Since the area was rich in natural resources, specifically timber, mills and industry were drawn to Natchitoches Parish, which brought jobs and capital to the area. The construction of the Louisiana Railway, now part of the Kansas City Southern Railroad, also facilitated Campti\u2019s recovery by increasing commerce and creating ease of access. William Edenborn, dubbed the \u201cfather of barbed wire\u201d and one of the wealthiest men in the country at the time, launched the construction of the railway. While he never lived in Campti, the town\u2019s main street was named in his honor, and the restaurants, hotels, and stores that once populated it attested to the prosperity he brought to the area. Even during the Depression when the rest of the country was struggling, Campti\u2019s economy remained strong and many people traveled to the area in search of work.\n\nIf you visit Campti today, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the town was once so successful. Weatherworn trailers line neighborhood streets while antebellum houses crumble behind curtains of thicket and vines. On Route 71, semi-trucks and through-travelers fly past vacant stores and restaurants, the names of the businesses on windows and walls faded. Edenborn Street, too, is now empty save for a few crumbling structures, some municipal buildings, and the Campti Historic Museum. What caused such an unforgiving fall from economic grace in this quiet, working-class town?\n\nDonna Isaacs CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nDonna Isaacs, executive director of the nonprofit organization Campti Field of Dreams, which runs the Campti Historic Museum, has studied the town\u2019s history for the last two years in hopes of answering this question and reversing the town\u2019s decline. A native of Jamaica, she moved to the U.S. in 1984 and has degrees in engineering and construction.\n\nFrom her extensive research over the years, Isaacs points to two significant events in the middle of the 20th century that led to Campti\u2019s downfall. \u201cFirst, in 1956, the Crawford Young mill burned down,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mill only employed 50 people, but it was the heart of the town\u2019s economy and its destruction had far-reaching effects.\u201d\n\nAn article by Ed Kerr, \u201cWhen the Mill Burned Down,\u201d was written four years after the destruction of the Crawford Young mill and describes the devastating \u201cchain reaction\u201d that took place after the destruction of the mill and how \u201cthe threads of local economy [began] to unwind with increasing tempo.\u201d The A.C. Stiles planing mill, which dressed lumber from the Crawford Young mill before it was shipped, closed down immediately, leaving dozens of people out of work. Business stagnated for local carpenters and logging contractors, and nearby forest landowners saw a sharp decline in demand for raw timber. Local businesses without direct ties to timber, such as grocery stores and service stations, suffered from decreased commerce in the area. In the three years following the fire, residents began to leave Campti in search of opportunities elsewhere, and according to Kerr, \u201cWhen the people moved out, the house movers moved in [and] the houses were sold and moved away.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuckily,\u201d Kerr concluded, \u201cthe Campti story had a happy ending.\u201d By 1960, the Crawford Young Mill had been rebuilt and the economy showed signs of recovery. Just as Campti had bounced back from the fire that crippled the town at the end of the Civil War, Kerr believed it would rebound from this destructive fire nearly a century later.\n\nRacial integration is often viewed as a wholly positive development in American history, but the fallout for blacks in the years that followed\u2026often goes ignored.\n\nBut then Campti was dealt the blow that, according to Isaacs, would seal its downfall: desegregation.\n\n\u201cRacial integration is often viewed as a wholly positive development in American history,\u201d Isaacs said, \u201cbut the fallout for blacks in the years that followed desegregation\u2014the unrest, tension, and economic decline\u2014often goes ignored.\u201d\n\nPart of this fallout can be seen in terms of local business. Jim Kilcoyne, director of the Small Business Center at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, has researched the development of small business in Louisiana and noted the negative repercussions that were a byproduct of desegregation. \u201cDuring the Jim Crow era,\u201d he explained, \u201cblack business owners were savvy enough to adapt to the racist laws of the time so that their businesses benefited\u2014economically, at least. Small businesses owned by blacks were guaranteed 100 percent of the black consumer base, and if their products were better than those offered by white business owners, they drew part of the white consumer base as well.\u201d That all changed after desegregation. \u201cBusinesses owned by blacks could no longer depend on receiving the entire black consumer base, and they lost much of their white consumer base due to boycott or because whites left the area in refusal to integrate.\u201d\n\nKilcoyne didn\u2019t suggest that segregation was beneficial for black people; the harm it caused far outweighed the very minor benefits. But black people had adapted to an unjust, racist system for decades, and when this system was overhauled, it promised misfortune for many in the community. And with the economy already bruised from the destruction of the mill, this misfortune hit Campti\u2019s black community particularly hard.\n\nCampti\u2019s abandoned public pool CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nThe most potent symbol of the fallout from desegregation turned out to be a municipal relic from half a century ago. Across the street from the Historic Museum, an abandoned public pool sits crumbling and empty save for the debris that has collected in its basin for the last 50 years. The pool had served Campti\u2019s white population through the 1950s, but like other all-white facilities in town, it eventually violated desegregation laws. Instead of integrating the pool so all of Campti\u2019s residents could enjoy it, however, white town leaders, supported by much of the white population, decided to decommission the pool and close it to everyone.\n\nThe decommissioning of Campti\u2019s public pool crystallized how desegregation laws were positive in the abstract but often problematic in application. Local governments were largely responsible for implementing desegregation laws, but blacks in these local communities couldn\u2019t vote to elect leaders with their best interests in mind. As a result, integration laws that were established to create equality were often muddied by the indiscretion of local white leaders.\n\nEventually, the residents who had the means to leave Campti\u2014the vast majority of them white\u2014did so in the second half of the 20th century. The empty pool left in their wake now serves no purpose beyond being an emblem of the void that was left behind.\n\nClara CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nClara, her daughter Susan, and Brenda\u2014three generations of Campti women\u2014sat on the front porch as dusk settled and the sun straddled the distant line of oak trees. When asked what needs the most improvement in their town, Susan replied, \u201cThe men.\u201d\n\nClara and Brenda laughed. Susan\u2019s husband Darrel sat at the other end of the porch and looked over his shoulder when Susan made the remark.\n\nPeople are raised to work in Campti.\n\n\u201cBut seriously,\u201d Susan continued, \u201cthe leadership in this town needs to improve. Too many undelivered promises. That\u2019s why I hate to vote\u2014because I know there\u2019s no follow-through. Sometimes I think, Why should I even bother?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that I think this town needs most is jobs,\u201d Clara said. \u201cPeople here want to work, but there are no jobs for them to find. People are raised to work in Campti. When I was a girl, my father never let me rest\u2014I was always sawing wood, pulling weeds, or mowing the lawn. It didn\u2019t matter that I was a girl. When I graduated from high school, I found a job to support myself, and when my husband died a few years ago, I learned to support myself all over again. Even when the post office cut back on my hours, I started housesitting to make a little extra money. I\u2019m an independent person\u2014I didn\u2019t want to rely on anyone else. I could probably go on welfare, sure, but I want to depend on myself.\u201d\n\nSusan\u2019s 11-year-old son, Marcus, returned home from school and picked up a rake leaning against the railing. He started cleaning the yard while his younger brother and sister played in the grass. When asked if the task is part of his chores, Susan said, \u201cNo, he just does that on his own. Likes to keep the yard clean. Guess hard work runs in his blood.\u201d\n\nRonald CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\n\u201cI lived in Campti on and off when I was young,\u201d Ronald said, \u201cbut I left for good when I joined the military right out of high school.\u201d\n\nHe served 13 months overseas in the early \u201970s, spending most of that time in Germany but seeing some action in Vietnam. \u201cBeing overseas was tough, especially when I was in combat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut returning home was even harder. That was pretty rough. We didn\u2019t receive the kind of recognition and respect I thought we deserved. We were treated like monsters instead of veterans. There was no parade when we came home, nothing to welcome us back. It was pretty messed up.\u201d\n\nNot only was the initial return home difficult for Ronald and his fellow veterans, but the process of readjusting to civilian life posed an additional set of challenges. When he applied for a job, he made sure not to mention his time in the service. Employers often perceived veterans who recently returned from oversea as unstable or unreliable. In addition, he found that the services in place to help returning veterans were severely lacking.\n\nThere was no parade when we came home, nothing to welcome us back. It was pretty messed up.\n\n\u201cThere just weren\u2019t quality facilities to help soldiers returning from war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed help adjusting back to everyday life, but we didn\u2019t get it. Following the war, there were a lot of vets who wound up on the streets.\u201d\n\nNearly 40 years after returning home, he continues to face the challenges of being a veteran. \u201cI still haven\u2019t received any benefits from the VA [Department of Veterans Affairs] for my time in the service. The last I heard from them was in the \u201990s when they assigned me a JAG Officer to help figure out my situation, but he hasn\u2019t been in touch in years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone down to the VA office in Winfield to file a report several times, but nothing\u2019s come of it. Just as soon give up at this point. Guess I\u2019m just a lost name in the records.\u201d\n\nThe additional benefits from his time in the service would certainly come in handy. He worked in heavy construction for a number of years after returning from overseas but was forced into early retirement at 58 after a series of heart attacks. He collects a combined $800 a month from Social Security and disability, which makes it difficult to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cHeck, I\u2019d still be working now if I could,\u201d he said. \u201cDoctors won\u2019t let me though.\u201d\n\nInstead, Ronald spends most of his time sitting outside and watching the days pass through Campti, which has given him plenty of time to observe how his hometown has changed since he was a boy and where it seems to be headed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for people to do around here,\u201d Ronald said. \u201cThere used to be baseball leagues and pick-up basketball games\u2014things to do. You used to see everyone out and about enjoying themselves, helping each other when someone was in need. But now\u2014I don\u2019t understand, I just don\u2019t understand. Maybe it\u2019ll get better, maybe it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe part of the community that Ronald is most concerned about is the younger generation, who he sees heading down a dangerous path. \u201cSome of the young ones around here just want to get that quick cash. They get into\u2014pushing, you know? We need to give these kids other alternatives so they don\u2019t go in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of them are in desperate situations. A lot of them go hungry, some don\u2019t have places to stay. They also don\u2019t have people to talk to. We don\u2019t have councilors around here, places where kids can go to get help. Maybe people just aren\u2019t as interested in helping people any more.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nThe mill fire and racial integration deeply shook Campti, but they weren\u2019t the lone causes of the profound poverty that plagues the town. There is a web of problems that has become self-reinforcing.\n\nOne such issue in Campti is affordable Internet access. Students who use digital technology in classrooms can\u2019t continue their work at home, so teachers are often forced to adapt their curriculum to meet the limited technological resources of their students. With the growing expectation that high school graduates will have a working familiarity with computers and digital technology, students who graduate from schools like Lakeview High in Campti are at a significant disadvantage when entering the workforce or applying to college.\n\nAnother systemic issue in Campti is transportation. In order to find work, for example, most Campti residents have to travel 20 minutes to Natchitoches or 40 minutes to Winfield, if not further. There is no public transportation in Campti, and if a family can afford a car, it\u2019s often old and unreliable. As a result, many people are only a dead battery or transmission failure away from losing their jobs. Numerous residents are out of work because they lost their jobs due to a car failure or accident, but even for those who remain employed, such tenuous job security makes it hard to establish concrete, long-term financial plans for themselves and their families.\n\nLack of access to healthcare and rampant health issues are another set of challenges that residents face. The town has only one medical facility, North Natchitoches Medical Clinic, which is a walk-in clinic staffed primarily by nurses. (Once a week, a doctor travels to the facility to work a four-hour half-day.) In addition to her role with Campti Field of Dreams, Donna Isaacs volunteers as a community health advisor. The services she provides are all that many in the community receive in terms of healthcare outreach.\n\nIt starts from the moment you\u2019re born.\n\n\u201cI really enjoy working as a health advisor, but it can be frustrating at times,\u201d Isaacs said, noting the paradoxes associated with poverty and healthcare. Last year, for example, the Rapides Foundation, in conjunction with the American Cancer Society, started an initiative to find uninsured residents and offer them early cancer screenings. The screenings were free, but the closest facility was 15 miles away in Natchitoches. Isaacs and her fellow health advisors found plenty of interested uninsured residents, but many of them didn\u2019t have access to a vehicle. She volunteered to drive some of the residents, but the organizers strongly discouraged her since she wasn\u2019t insured to transport residents as a health advisor.\n\nAccording to Isaacs, these kinds of situations have become alarmingly common and contribute to what she describes as the vicious life cycle of Campti residents. \u201cIt starts from the moment you\u2019re born,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re raised in a trailer that\u2019s 60 years old and falling down, absorbing the formaldehyde and volatile chemicals day in and day out from the trailer\u2019s interior. Then you go to a school that\u2019s also 60 years old where you\u2019re exposed to asbestos and mildew eight hours a day. You may get one decent meal at school, but otherwise you have terrible nutrition because your family can\u2019t afford healthy food\u2014not that fresh produce or other organic foods are available to buy within 15 miles of town anyway. Or your family survives off of fish caught in the Red River, which tests have shown absorb heavy metals and toxins in the water due to chemicals from the mill and pesticides from nearby farms. Then, if you\u2019re one of the lucky ones, you get a job at the paper mill and are exposed to carcinogenic chemicals eight hours a day for 40 years, and live in an old trailer because that\u2019s all you can afford, and the cycle starts all over again.\u201d\n\nEudora CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\n\u201cMy husband was in the service, so we were constantly on the move,\u201d Eudora said, pulling a short drag on her cigarette. \u201cWe spent three years overseas in Germany, which was probably the longest we lived in one place. When we came back to the U.S., we bounced all over. I had all kinds of jobs\u2014I was a cashier, a waitress, a cook in a nursing home. Too many to remember.\u201d\n\nI have an appointment on Monday, but I know I won\u2019t go. Just don\u2019t have the money this week.\n\nThe job Eudora enjoyed most was at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. She was in charge of making sure the cadets were out of bed on time, had clean pressed uniforms, and followed the rules of the academy. \u201cI kinda felt like the mom away from home for those cadets. I knew when to nurture them, but also when to crack the whip,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nEudora had four children of her own and spoke fondly of them, especially the son she was living with in Campti. One of her sons passed away in his 30s, and there was a lingering sadness when she spoke of him. \u201cHe had health problems all his life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe got worse and worse in his last years, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier. I had to go through two brothers and a sister committing suicide, but nothing is like one of your children dying. It\u2019s like your heart is torn open for the longest time.\u201d\n\nEudora, too, has her own share of health problems that have plagued her for the better part of a decade. She suffers from atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, and had to have her heart shocked two years ago. At first, her heart showed signs of improvement, but about 10 months later it started to fail again. Her doctor refused to shock her heart again due to the risk of further complications, so she is now forced to take blood thinners and closely monitor her heart pressure. She also has back issues that leave her in chronic pain.\n\n\u201cI have to drive over an hour to Shreveport to get my pain medicine \u2019cause I can\u2019t get it around here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the place I have to go to doesn\u2019t accept my Medicare, so I have to pay out of pocket, too. Every two weeks I have to drive up there and it\u2019s $150 a pop, plus the cost of gas to get there and back. I have an appointment on Monday, but I know I won\u2019t go. Just don\u2019t have the money this week.\u201d\n\nShot CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nShot got his name growing up on his grandfather\u2019s farm. \u201cMy granddaddy used to call everything \u2018Shot.\u2019 He\u2019d call the pig over and say, \u2018Come here Shot,\u2019 or fill the cat\u2019s feeding bowl and say, \u2018Time to eat, Shot.\u2019 I also lived on the farm, so I guess I was Shot, too.\u201d\n\nA native of Campti, Shot lived in the area until he was drafted into the army after graduating from high school. But before leaving for Vietnam, he eloped with his girlfriend. \u201cShe was 17 at the time, and I don\u2019t believe you could get married at 17 in Louisiana back then, so we traveled to Texas to get married,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that I loved her, and knew I needed something to come home to.\u201d\n\nHe saw regular combat in Vietnam, which left him shaken when he returned from the war. \u201cI grew quieter, spent more time by myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people around me noticed the change, too. I guess you could say I became something of a loner after I came home.\u201d\n\nUnlike Ronald, Shot wasn\u2019t as bothered by the tepid welcome home he received after returning from Vietnam. He didn\u2019t fight overseas for a parade, he said\u2014he did it because his country had asked him.\n\n\u201cSome vets were offended by the way we were treated,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t bother me so much.\u201d He was, however, frustrated by the stigma against veterans when he applied for jobs. \u201cI moved down to the Gulf Coast to work on the oil rigs, but I knew returning vets had a hard time finding work. So when I went in to apply for the job, I lied about being overseas, lied about having even been in the service.\u201d\n\nHe worked on oil rigs for close to 20 years and then started repairing boats. That was when his experiences in Vietnam came back to haunt him.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201980s, a lot of wealthy Vietnamese came to the U.S. and set up fishing businesses in the gulf, so I wound up doing repairs on a lot of their boats,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t help but think to myself, Now weren\u2019t these the same Vietnamese that I was told to shoot at a decade earlier? It was hard at times, had a few flashbacks here and there, but I coped the best I could.\u201d The real trouble came when the Vietnamese fishermen clashed with local Creole fishermen, who felt the Vietnamese were trespassing on their water. \u201cOne day, when I was working on a Vietnamese boat, a Creole fishermen on a nearby vessel started firing warning shots into the air, and I went into shock\u2014took me right back to the battlefield. I spent six weeks in the hospital recovering from that episode, and in the end was forced into early retirement due to the trauma from PTSD.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t care if I had to be homeless for a while. The thing about this community, though, is they won\u2019t let you struggle like that.\n\nHe still felt on edge even after his release from the hospital. He left his wife and home behind to return to Campti. Something, he said, was drawing him back. \u201cMy plan was to sleep wherever I landed when I got back to Campti\u2014under a tree, in an old trailer. I didn\u2019t care if I had to be homeless for a while. The thing about this community, though, is they won\u2019t let you struggle like that.\u201d\n\nSome people who knew his family took him in, and he eventually settled into the community after moving into his own place. But the struggles he faced from his time in the service persisted. He continued to have flashbacks and began experiencing the effects from exposure to Agent Orange. \u201cThe skin on my hands and between my fingers peeled away daily, and my doctor said it was likely from Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cI also saw the effects passed on to my kids\u2014they can\u2019t have food dye, for example, or else they\u2019ll have a reaction to it.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, Shot and other Campti residents were notified that an herbicide had contaminated the local water supply and that residents shouldn\u2019t drink the water until further notice. Notifications about water contamination were fairly common in Campti, but when Shot looked into the incident further, he made a startling connection.\n\n\u201cI recognized the name of the company that made the herbicide,\u201d he said. \u201cDow Chemical. It was the same company that manufactured Agent Orange and that had contacted me to offer a settlement for exposure to the chemical in Vietnam. \u2018Hush money,\u2019 is what vets called it\u2014if I accepted, I wouldn\u2019t be able to speak out about any issues I had from my exposure to the stuff. And I accepted\u2014maybe it was the wrong choice, but at the time I figured it\u2019d probably be that or nothing. $2,700, one time\u2014that\u2019s what they paid me.\u201d\n\nShannon\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the old people would say,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cCampti went from sugar to\u2014well, you know.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, the reason Campti was struggling was largely due to the lack of leadership in town. The town\u2019s leaders had failed on big issues, like unifying its residents and laying the ground for them to work towards progress, but also on small issues, like the lack of recreation for its youth.\n\n\u201cThese kids need to play sports, be part of clubs\u2014things to keep them active,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019Cause when they don\u2019t have anything to do, that\u2019s when they get drawn into drugs and violence. People around here don\u2019t seem to get that, though. Take the basketball courts in the middle of this housing complex. Every weekend there used to be basketball games here and people from all over town would come to play and watch. But some people didn\u2019t like all the cars parked along the grass, and other people thought the basketball games drew a rough crowd. So what did the man in charge of the housing complex do to fix the problem? He took down the basketball rims so no one could play anymore.\u201d Shannon paused and shook her head. \u201cNow doesn\u2019t that seem like throwing the baby out with bathwater to you?\u201d\n\nOutside the housing complex earlier that afternoon, two young brothers were shooting a small, rubber ball into a makeshift basketball hoop made out of a laundry basket and a mop. \u201cWe wanted to play basketball,\u201d the older brother said, \u201cbut they took down the hoops on the basketball court. So we had to make our own.\u201d The eldest was teaching his brother how to play. \u201cHe wants to be like me when he grows up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wanna be like LeBron James.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nShannon has an 11-year-old son and does what she can to ensure that he stays active and out of trouble, but because she is a T-level paraplegic, this can be difficult for her. \u201cBeing in a wheelchair and having no vehicle, there\u2019s only so much I can do,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my boy to have things to do so he doesn\u2019t go down the wrong path, but I need the town, the community to meet me halfway.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s been in a wheelchair for over a decade now and the first couple years were the hardest for her to adjust to. \u201cI had my share of doubts when the doctor said I\u2019d be in a wheelchair the rest of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI got pregnant with my son, my second child, when I was in this wheelchair, and that was a crossroads for me. I doubted if I\u2019d be able to take care of him, if I could really do this on my own. But when I went to the hospital for an ultrasound and the doctor told me it was a boy, something happened. I can\u2019t explain it, but that\u2019s when things changed, and I never looked back. I guess I\u2019ll say this\u2014if you got God on your side, a made up mind, and a willing heart, ain\u2019t nothing can hold you back.\u201d\n\nShannon\u2019s disability, though, has presented a new set of challenges in the last few years, especially when it came to healthcare.\n\nIf you got God on your side, a made up mind, and a willing heart, ain\u2019t nothing can hold you back.\n\n\u201cI tell you what, I can\u2019t wait for Obama to get out of office,\u201d she said. \u201cI voted for him so he could make history, but it\u2019s time for him to take a seat.\u201d\n\nHer biggest criticism of Obama\u2019s presidency is the Affordable Care Act (ACA). \u201cFor 14 years, I received catheters, sterile water, and the other supplies I needed through my insurance at no cost. But this past July, when I had to sign up for insurance through Louisiana Care, it turns out they don\u2019t cover any of those materials, so I have to pay for them out of pocket.\u201d Amerihealth Caritas, formerly Louisiana Care, is the state-run Medicaid program in Louisiana. Republican governor Bobby Jindal rejected an expansion of the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which would have been covered under the ACA. The move left many of the working poor in Louisiana without healthcare coverage or with reduced coverage, which may explain the change in Shannon\u2019s health plan. Regardless, she points to the ACA as the culprit. \u201cI tell you, this Obamacare is killing me.\u201d\n\nThe catheters cost close to $3 each, and Shannon needs about 100 per month. The sterile water costs $55 a bottle, and she uses about five bottles per month. She lives on a strict fixed income with two children to support\u2014one in middle school and one in college\u2014so the additional $550 a month she has to pay for medical supplies is a major expense.\n\nNevertheless, Shannon has no intention of letting these newfound challenges hold her back from living her life to the fullest. \u201c[I] still got a couple minutes to talk, but my mom\u2019s coming to pick up my son and me [soon],\u201d she said. \u201cI told him I\u2019d take him out today and teach him how to hunt.\u201d\n\nCampti Middle School CREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nAs Donna Isaacs works toward her master\u2019s degree in construction management at the University of Florida, an important focus of her studies has been the revitalization of communities through historic preservation. It requires an in-depth understanding of a place\u2019s history in order to use its past successes as a compass for working toward a prosperous future. During her research, she uncovered a spirit of resilience and a deep entrepreneurial drive in Campti residents throughout the town\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThese people are survivors,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir ethos is all about self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the history of a place is only half the job of a historic preservationist\u2014the other half, which tends to be more fickle, is understanding the residents\u2019 opinions and perspectives on the parts of their history they want to resurrect and preserve. Unlike top-down solutions implemented by governments or large organizations, historic preservation depends on the input of the people who make up the town. This has its benefits and drawbacks. Residents are empowered by controlling the outcome of projects based on their understanding of the town, which encourages communal participation and increases the likelihood of satisfaction with the project; if apathy strikes the community, however, project development can be stifled, which could undermine the entire revitalization effort.\n\nIn spite of these risks, Isaacs has moved forward with her vision to revitalize Campti from the bottom up through her non-profit. She has spent the last year surveying residents to inform how she will move forward with her vision. And while gathering opinions will be an ongoing task, she has begun to put her vision into action.\n\nOne of her first projects, which she launched in response to a yearning for self-sufficiency from residents within Campti and a growing call for sustainability from the outside world, was the Campti Community Gardens. She hopes the community garden will help spark a renewed interest in locally grown produce, which would improve the health of both residents and the local economy. Donna has also started planning for projects aimed at affordable housing, making buildings more energy efficient, constructing sidewalks throughout town, and building mixed-use, mixed-income facilities.\n\nThese people are survivors. Their ethos is all about self-sufficiency.\n\nThe list of improvements for the town is extensive, and some might even say over-ambitious\u2014but according to Isaacs, the scope necessary.\n\n\u201cThe thing with revitalizing a community through historic preservation is that you can\u2019t focus on one issue and think it\u2019s going to completely reinvigorate the town,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to look at the problem holistically and propose a holistic solution. Even if you take on projects one at a time, in order for revitalization to stick, your focus needs to be on the things that ail the community as a whole.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Isaacs\u2019s most ambitious project for Campti, and the one that she hopes will swing the momentum of the town toward prosperity, focuses on small business and entrepreneurship. A couple years ago, through a partnership with Northwestern State University, she held a series of small businesses classes for local residents interested in entrepreneurship in the town of Natchez, about 20 miles south of Campti. In the spring of 2015, she will hold a similar series of small-business classes at the Campti Historic Museum. Professors from NSU and the Small Business Development Center will provide lessons on how to fund and operate small businesses, with the goal of encouraging local residents to put their entrepreneurial ideas into action.\n\nShe\u2019s also hoping to get a three-year grant she applied for through the University of Florida. Each year, the grant would bring 20 exchange students from Southeast Asia to participate in an intensive, four-week workshop at the university\u2019s business school. At the end of the workshop, the students would participate in a one-week practicum in the small town in need of entrepreneurial growth that wins the grant, such as Campti, applying skills they learned in the classroom to real world business situations. Local entrepreneurs would have the opportunity to consult with students to develop their business models. With the backing of a major university, Isaacs hopes the grant would not only promote the creation of local businesses but also draw the attention of outside investors.\n\nThe final step in her initiative to promote small business in Campti is a small business incubator and career development center housed in the derelict Campti Middle School.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the state of Louisiana to recognize the school as a historic landmark, which would minimize the cost to refurbish the building\u2014but it\u2019s much more than simply rehabbing an old building that still standing in our town,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe want to create a place where residents can develop valuable skillsets, exchange ideas on how to improve potential business ventures, and bring their separate backgrounds together to improve the community and local economy overall.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: Scott Rodd\n\nIsaacs\u2019s vision for the town also targets one of the sources of its decline by mending the racial fissures that pulled the community apart over 50 years ago.\n\nCampti Field of Dreams borrows its name from the park that was once part of the town\u2019s all-white high school. Today, an old wooden sign bears the park\u2019s name in cracked, peeling paint, the fields are overgrown with knee-high grass, and the dugouts on the baseball diamond are ready to collapse. Rebuilding the Field of Dreams park is Isaacs\u2019s other major project that involves revitalizing an old facility. She hopes to build a community center at one end of the park, construct a new playground, and rehab the baseball field so local leagues can play on it. Although the former all-white and all-black schools both symbolize the force that pulled the town apart, residents acknowledge each location as an important landmark. Where these schools once divided the town, residents now see the opportunity for them to bring people together.\n\n\u201cPeople here understand that if we create meeting places for residents to come together, then we\u2019ll see greater creativity, greater social development, and the increasing exchange of ideas, which will only lead to a stronger community,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nThe slogan that she and other members of the Campti Field of Dreams organization have embraced for the town\u2019s revitalization is \u201cRevitalize Campti 2020.\u201d She acknowledged that this is a short timeline to rebuild a town that has been in decline for over half a century. But she said she would like to see short-term progress on some of the more urgent issues afflicting the town by that point and also has hope that the ground will be laid for some of her long-term projects. At the very least, she wants to see opportunities created for people living in Campti.\n\n\u201cIn the coming decades, this is going to be a self-sustaining, environmentally conscious community with a robust local economy\u2014a place that people really take pride in,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019re in the trenches.\u201d\n\nScott Rodd is a freelance writer currently based out of Los Angeles whose work has appeared in Salon, the New York Observer, and The Source, among other publications.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "How do those who live in dire poverty manage their daily lives, and can a town struggling under the weight of such poverty ever transform itself?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "How do those who live in dire poverty manage their daily lives, and can a town struggling under the weight of such poverty ever transform itself?", "title": "Stark Images Capture Real Life In One Of America\u2019s Poorest Towns", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/01/29/3616743/campti-louisiana/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CamptiMiddleSchool.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CamptiMiddleSchool-321x214.jpg", "description": "How do those who live in dire poverty manage their daily lives, and can a town struggling under the weight of such poverty ever transform itself?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Stark Images Capture Real Life In One Of America\u2019s Poorest Towns"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CamptiMiddleSchool.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CamptiMiddleSchool.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-29T11:28:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35fe\"", "article_summary": "During her research, she uncovered a spirit of resilience and a deep entrepreneurial drive in Campti residents throughout the town\u2019s history.\nWhere these schools once divided the town, residents now see the opportunity for them to bring people together.\nEach year, the grant would bring 20 exchange students from Southeast Asia to participate in an intensive, four-week workshop at the university\u2019s business school.\nAccording to Isaacs, these kinds of situations have become alarmingly common and contribute to what she describes as the vicious life cycle of Campti residents.\nIn order to find work, for example, most Campti residents have to travel 20 minutes to Natchitoches or 40 minutes to Winfield, if not further."}
