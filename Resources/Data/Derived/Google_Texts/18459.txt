The Tucson Police Department has identified a woman who died Friday night in the 7600 block of East Apple Tree Drive as Gonekie Tatum, 47.

Officers responded to a call around 7 p.m. Friday regarding a physical altercation and found an unresponsive woman lying on the ground outside a home, according to Sgt. Kimberly Bay, spokeswoman for the Tucson Police Department.

Detectives continued the investigation, and after speaking with witnesses have determined Tatum had a prior relationship with a man who lived at the home and had been contacting him, according to a TPD media release.

The man was in a new relationship, and on Friday, Tatum drove to his house and got into a physical fight outside with one of the occupants, eventually becoming unresponsive, which is when the occupants called 911, according to the release.

The investigation is ongoing and once complete, detectives will present the case to the Pima County Attorney's Office for review, according to the release.

Tatum was taken to St. Joseph's hospital shortly after paramedics arrived, and about an hour and a half later was pronounced deceased.
