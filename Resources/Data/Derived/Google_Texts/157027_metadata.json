He said he accidently dropped the infant when he stood up from a rocking chair, but the coroner\u2019s office ruled Taylor\u2019s death a homicide.\n\nDefense attorneys filed a motion on Monday, asking Douglas County District Court Judge Richard Caschette to hear new evidence they say prove Taylor\u2019s death was the result of an accidental fall from her father\u2019s arms. They also argue Taylor had an undiagnosed bone disease.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we are in the review process and cannot comment further on this matter,\u201d said Michelle Yi, spokeswoman for the 18th Judicial District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nMontour was serving his sentence when he beat Eric Autobee, 23, to death at the Limon Correctional Facility in 2002. In 2003, he pleaded guilty to killing Autobee, and a judge sentenced him to death.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court reversed that ruling in 2007, and Montour was allowed to withdraw his original plea in April. Prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty against Montour, who has since pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nDuring a recent hearing, Montour\u2019s attorneys asked to keep jurors from learning about his first conviction. The defense called two experts: Dr. Michael Arnall, a pathologist who performs autopsies in Adams County, and Dr. Leon Kelly, the chief deputy medical examiner at the El Paso County Coroner\u2019s Office.\n\nArnall testified that new research shows Taylor\u2019s head injuries from such a short fall could have been fatal. But Caschette denied the motion after Kelly and Arnall said the fall did not account for other broken bones the infant suffered.\n\nBut Kelly recently reversed his position after a specialist hired by the defense found that Taylor had an undiagnosed \u201cbone disease which made her bones extraordinarily brittle,\u201d according to the defense motion. Kelly now says there is no longer sufficient evidence to rule Taylor\u2019s death a homicide.\n\nDefense attorneys argue the wrongful conviction allowed Montour to be sent to prison, where several factors caused his mental illness to \u201cflourish.\u201d\n\nJury selection began in January for the trial for Autobee\u2019s death. Opening statements are expected to start in March.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Edward Montour\u2019s attorneys say new evidence proves wrongful conviction", "title": "Edward Montour\u2019s attorneys say new evidence proves wrongful conviction", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/03/edward-montours-attorneys-say-new-evidence-proves-wrongful-conviction/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140105__20140106_A4_CD06MONTOURp2-1.jpg", "height": 401}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140105__20140106_A4_CD06MONTOURp2-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T16:52:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:27:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd907a\"", "article_summary": "He said he accidently dropped the infant when he stood up from a rocking chair, but the coroner\u2019s office ruled Taylor\u2019s death a homicide.\nKelly now says there is no longer sufficient evidence to rule Taylor\u2019s death a homicide.\nDuring a recent hearing, Montour\u2019s attorneys asked to keep jurors from learning about his first conviction.\nDefense attorneys filed a motion on Monday, asking Douglas County District Court Judge Richard Caschette to hear new evidence they say prove Taylor\u2019s death was the result of an accidental fall from her father\u2019s arms.\nProsecutors announced they would seek the death penalty against Montour, who has since pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity."}
