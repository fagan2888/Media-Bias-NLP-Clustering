He never would have, even if he weren\u2019t a public figure and even though the assault was captured on camera. According to New Jersey prosecutors, who have come out in defense of their handling of the criminal charges against Rice, the former Ravens running back would have faced either a two-year probationary sentence as a first-time offender, or a 12-month pretrial intervention program (he was sentenced to the latter at his lawyer\u2019s request).\n\nIn an interview with the Press of Atlantic City, prosecutor Jim McClain explained and defended his decisions in the Rice case, saying the law would not have allowed him to push for jail time:\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand, the choice was not PTI versus five years\u2019 state prison,\u201d McClain said. \u201cThe choice was not PTI versus the No Early Release Act on a 10-year sentence. The parameters as they existed were: Is this a PTI case or a probation case?\u201d \u2026 McClain said the video would have been enough evidence against Rice to get a conviction at trial, even without Palmer\u2019s cooperation. But all that would have come after the headlines and the daily coverage would be a probationary sentence, \u201cand it\u2019s not fair to the victim to put her through that when that was the difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prosecutors explain how Rice got off without serving time -- and how it shows our domestic violence laws are broken", "title": "Ray Rice was never going to jail", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Prosecutors explain how Rice got off without serving time -- and how it shows our domestic violence laws are broken", "title": "Ray Rice was never going to jail", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/ray_rice_was_never_going_to_jail/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/rice-video-football.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prosecutors explain how Rice got off without serving time -- and how it shows our domestic violence laws are broken", "title": "Ray Rice was never going to jail", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/rice-video-football.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Domestic abuse, domestic violence, domestic violence laws, janay rice, New Jersey, prosecution, ray rice", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca85\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Domestic abuse, domestic violence, domestic violence laws, janay rice, New Jersey, prosecution, ray rice, Media News, NewsRay Rice never went to jail for punching Janay Palmer in the face.\n\u201cThe choice was not PTI versus the No Early Release Act on a 10-year sentence.\nThe parameters as they existed were: Is this a PTI case or a probation case?\u201d \u2026 McClain said the video would have been enough evidence against Rice to get a conviction at trial, even without Palmer\u2019s cooperation.\nBut all that would have come after the headlines and the daily coverage would be a probationary sentence, \u201cand it\u2019s not fair to the victim to put her through that when that was the difference.\u201d\nHe never would have, even if he weren\u2019t a public figure and even though the assault was captured on camera."}
