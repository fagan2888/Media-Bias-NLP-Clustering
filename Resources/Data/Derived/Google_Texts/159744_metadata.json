(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nNew bills not likely to cause strife like 2013\n\nBy Matthew Waller\n\nAUSTIN \u2014 Two years ago abortion dominated conversation toward the end of the Legislative session, culminating in a historic filibuster from then-state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, against proposed regulations and restrictions on abortion.\n\nThe agenda for and against abortion rights and restrictions are quieter this time, possibly because opponents of abortion already obtained most of their goals.\n\n\u201cThe pro-life movement obtained virtually its complete wish list on abortion-related legislation,\u201d Rice University political science professor Mark Jones said. The legislation that became law, House Bill 2, included requirements for abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, for abortion providing facilities to have higher standards, that patients follow stricter guidelines for abortion inducing medication, and banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much more they can realistically push for that is plausibly constitutional,\u201d Jones said.\n\nReeling back\n\nA coalition of seven pro-abortion rights groups have gathered to \u201crestore trust in Texans to make their own reproductive health care decisions, respect for health care professionals\u2019 judgment, and access to the full range of reproductive health care,\u201d according to the coalition\u2019s announcement of formation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand the devastating consequences of restrictive policies affecting reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion access,\u201d said Fatimah Gifford, the director of marketing and public relations for abortion provider Whole Woman\u2019s Health. \u201cAs a result, the state has shuttered dozens of clinics across the state, making access out of reach for thousands of Texans. Today we come together, as a unified coalition, to continue the momentum that emerged during the 2013 legislative session.\u201d\n\nThe pro-abortion rights groups are promoting four bills.\n\nHouse Bill 78 from state Rep. Mary Gonz\u00e1lez, D-Clint, would require human sexuality courses in public schools, and House Bill 468 would let a child 15 or older consent to examination or medical treatment related to contraception other than abortion or emergency contraception.\n\nHouse Bill 1210 from state Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, would keep medical care information \u2014 such as advice about birth control, mammograms or cancer screenings \u2014 \u201cbetween a woman and her doctor,\u201d Howard wrote in a release.\n\nHouse Bill 709 from state Rep. Jessica Farrar, D-Houston, would get rid of a mandatory waiting time in abortion cases.\n\nJones said it doesn\u2019t look like such bills have much any chance at passing in the conservative House, even more conservative Senate, and self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d governor.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cmore of a PR campaign to remind Texans that the majority of Democrats don\u2019t agree with HB 2 and the sonogram law,\u201d Jones said, referring to a law in 2011 that added waiting requirements.\n\nKeeping away the money\n\nProposed laws from groups against abortion include everything from not paying for abortion through insurance plans to stopping judges from surreptitiously allowing a minor to get an abortion without parents\u2019 permission.\n\nConservative leadership already has efforts en route to keep government money out of the hands of Planned Parenthood.\n\nTexas Right to Life sent out legislative priorities with several bills ready or in the works.\n\nState Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, has SB 575, which would \u201cshield citizens from paying for insurance coverage for abortion both in private insurance plans and through\u201d the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for insurance, a release states. HB 1435 from state Rep. John Smithee, R-Amarillo, is identical.\n\nPlanned legislation would remove \u201cglaring loopholes\u201d in letting minors undergo abortions without a parent\u2019s permission \u2014 such as allowing an attorney to represent the minor rather than the parents \u2014 according to the Texas Right to Life release.\n\nAnother bill could come from state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, that would clarify that coercing or forcing a woman to have an abortion is a crime.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will also establish several mechanisms to inform women about their full rights and protections against acts of coercion,\u201d a release from Texas Right to Life states.\n\nJoe Pojman, the executive director of the Texas Alliance for Life, said that there would be efforts to put signs in abortion facilities regarding sex trafficking or forced abortions and that his group would move to train abortion facility workers to recognize victims of sex trafficking.\n\nHis group is also planning to further defund Planned Parenthood as the Legislature has done in the past. This time, the aim is to exclude Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program altogether. The group also plans to largely exclude Planned Parenthood from the Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program. The program has brought in $2.9 million per year in general revenue, according to an interim report. He said a rider in the Senate version of the budget shifts more money away from organizations like Planned Parenthood.\n\nPojman also wants to eliminate wrongful birth lawsuits. Such lawsuits let parents with a disability sue providers because they weren\u2019t told of the disability in time for an abortion, Pojman said.\n\nReforms for judicial bypass, allowing for abortion without parental consent for a minor, may be a strong contender for becoming law.\n\nChanging judicial bypass \u201cis long overdue,\u201d Pojman said. \u201cWe think that will have a very good chance. \u2026 We have the firepower in the House and the Senate.\u201d\n\nMatthew Waller covers state news as the Scripps Austin Bureau chief.
