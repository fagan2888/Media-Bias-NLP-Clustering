But the New York archbishop waved off suggestions that his election signaled a shift in priorities for the nation\u2019s largest religious body.\n\n\u201cYou might interpret this as the bishops are tired of short and skinny presidents,\u201d the bulky Church leader quipped with a reference to his predecessor Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, who, like Bishop Kicanas, has a smaller build.\n\nThus began the archbishop\u2019s tumultuous tenure at the helm of the USCCB, a period marked by intense media coverage of both his policy positions on issues like President Obama\u2019s proposed military strike on Syria, and his outsized personality and gift of humor, recently on display during an appearance on The Colbert Report.\n\nOver these past three years, the USCCB has sought to promote the New Evangelization, culminating in the Year of Faith. But it has also been a time of sharp contrasts between Catholic teaching and the political status quo, on issues like the Health and Human Services mandate, the advance of same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d through the courts and in the ballot box, cuts in social programs for the needy, and comprehensive immigration reform efforts.\n\nProtagonist for Common Good\n\nArchbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco recalled Archbishop Dolan\u2019s election, and suggested that his most daunting challenge was to return the Church to its present position as an \u201cinfluential protagonist for justice and the common good in our American society.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Archbishop Cordileone believes that Cardinal Dolan has accomplished two important goals. He has effectively articulated Catholic teaching, penetrating spiritual indifference in a secular age, and he has kept his brother bishops unified during uncertain times.\n\n\u201cHe is affable and engaging while he communicates the timeless truth the Church teaches which is what we\u2019re all striving to do,\u201d Archbishop Cordileone told the Register.\n\n\u201cHe has kept the bishops energized and united while addressing the challenges we are facing.\u201d\n\nAt the time of his election, then-Archbishop Dolan expressed his admiration for the charismatic leadership style of the late Cardinal John O\u2019Connor of New York. Cardinal O\u2019Connor was never elected to the top USCCB post, but used his pulpit at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, the nation\u2019s media capital, to champion Church teaching on abortion and homosexual relationships, going toe-to-toe in with 1984 Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.\n\n\u201cHe had a pastoral heart and sidewalk savviness, but was as cogent and compelling in preaching faith and morals as anyone,\u201d recalled Archbishop Dolan, extoling Cardinal O\u2019Connor after his election in 2010, and before he was made a cardinal himself in 2012.\n\nReligious Freedoms Defense\n\nCardinal Dolan\u2019s dual roles \u2014 as USCCB president and New York archbishop \u2014 have increased his national impact, even as his \u201csidewalk savviness\u201d has been repeatedly tested in a series of public exchanges with the Obama administration over the federal contraception mandate.\n\n\u201cCardinal Dolan\u2019s biggest challenge was keeping the bishops united behind a principled defense of religious freedom in the wake of the Obama administration's HHS mandate and making that defense credible to the public,\u201d George Weigel, the author, most recently, of Evangelical Catholicism, told the Register.\n\n\u201cNo one could have done this better than Cardinal Dolan, and he leaves a strong record from which his successor can lead all friends of religious freedom to victory in this crucial matter.\u201d\n\nRussell Shaw, the former long-time spokesman of the USCCB, and the author of American Church: The Remarkable Rise, Meteoric Fall, and Uncertain Future of Catholicism in America, echoed that judgment.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that leaps out from the last three years, is his taking on the Obama administration over the HHS mandate. I applaud him for that, though not everyone does,\u201d Shaw told the Register.\n\nThe HHS mandate required private employers to provide co-pay free coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization and contraception, and after the USCCB leadership reviewed the interim final rule, Archbishop Dolan explained his objections in a meeting with President Barack Obama, who reportedly said his administration would address those concerns.\n\nHowever, the White House approved the law in January 2012 and offered only a limited religious exemption for houses of worship. Church-affiliated universities, hospitals and charities were still required to comply with the law.\n\n\u2018A Happy Warrior\u2019\n\nThe HHS mandate fight ignited a political firestorm, and prompted intense criticism from within the Church, but the USCCB president never backed down\n\n\u201cHe came across as a happy warrior. He was not spoiling for a fight, but when he had to take a stand, he did so willingly, and he said the Church would see it through to the end,\u201d said Shaw.\n\n\u201cHis public demeanor vis-a-vis the president and the administration has been more than civil. It is an issue of principle and has been fought on principle.\u201d\n\nThough he was accused by abortions-rights advocates of conducting a \u201cwar on women,\u201d Cardinal Dolan was still invited to deliver the invocation at the Democratic and GOP national conventions where he offered pointed references to Catholic moral and social teaching.\n\nMeanwhile, the USCCB began a parallel effort to educate the faithful about past and present threats to the free exercise of Catholics in the land of the free.\n\nThe \u201cFortnight for Freedom,\u201d scheduled during the past two years to mark a two-week period of prayer, fasting and education on religious liberty, is one of several initiatives designed to help Catholics wake up to the changes afoot in their country. During Cardinal Dolan\u2019s tenure, the U.S. bishops also issued a pastoral letter on this issue that has provided a framework for a religious freedom curriculum in Catholic schools.\n\n\u201cUnder Cardinal Dolan\u2019s leadership, the interrelationship between defending vulnerable human life, defending and fostering marriage and family and defending religious liberty was brought out in great clarity,\u201d Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, the U.S. bishops\u2019 point man on religious liberty, told the Register.\n\n\u201cHe has helped us see that the conference is not just an organization that gets involved in one hot-button issue after another, but to see how these issues are related to the Church\u2019s overall mission of evangelization. \u2026 We are proclaiming God\u2019s word, worshipping in spirit and truth and aiding those in need.\u201d\n\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., who helped lead several campaigns to block the legalization of same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d in Rhode Island, before \u201cmarriage quality\u201d forces finally attained victory in 2013, said that he welcomed the conference\u2019s educational resources and media-ready videos designed to educate Catholic about Church teaching on marriage.\n\nBuilding Bridges\n\nBishop Tobin also noted the USCCB president\u2019s embrace of Pope Francis and the fresh challenges he posed regarding the evangelization of Catholics on the \u201cfringes\u201d of the Church.\n\n\u201cCardinal Dolan has been the right guy at the right time. His stature and joyful personality have provided a bridge between what Pope Francis is doing and the Church in the U.S. He is helping us understand that and respond in a positive way,\u201d Bishop Tobin told the Register.\n\nThe bridge-building is vital, not only to draw alienated Catholics back to their cradle faith, but to bring immigrant groups, especially Hispanics, into the mainstream of Church life.\n\nWith Hispanic immigrants comprising an ever-larger percentage of U.S. Catholics, the cardinal has encouraged pastoral outreach and evangelization, but also advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nCardinal Dolan has argued that the Church should continue to play a central role in helping a new generation of immigrants become \u201cfull members of our culture and communities,\u201d as he wrote in an Oct. 17 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform is the way to continue this success.\u201d\n\nBut it now looks doubtful that Congress will pass proposed legislation for comprehensive immigration reform during Cardinal Dolan\u2019s watch. Further, recent data suggest that the Church is already losing many immigrants to the secular values that have captured so many other cradle Catholics.\n\nShaw\u2019s latest book, American Church, provides a pessimistic view of such trends, and he told the Register that Cardinal Dolan has yet to offer a candid, hard-hitting assessment of a way to change the increasingly bleak picture of Catholicism in the United States.\n\nVisibly Engaging Catholics\n\nIn public, at least, he USCCB president has opted for a joyful, positive message, and his many supporters will argue that that this approach offers the most engaging draw for alienated Catholics.\n\n\u201cHis approach is to go to people where they are, speaking their language, aware of their experiences, pain and biases,\u201d said Kathryn Lopez, an editor at large of National Review who is working with the Catholic Voices initiative that trains ordinary Catholics to present Church teaching in public forums.\n\nThat outsized legacy presents a tall order for Cardinal Dolan\u2019s successor, one of 10 candidates nominated by USCCB members. But whoever is chosen, no one expects the man who made Time magazine\u2019s list of \u201cThe World\u2019s 100 Most Influential People: 2012\u201d to fade away.\n\n\u201cHe is the archbishop of New York and he still has that bully pulpit available to him,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cHe will remain a high visibility spokesman for the Church for some years to come.\u201d\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEWS ANALYSIS: The outgoing USCCB president led the U.S. bishops during a tumultuous time.\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "NEWS ANALYSIS: The outgoing USCCB president led the U.S. bishops during a tumultuous time.", "title": "Evaluating Cardinal Dolan\u2019s Tenure", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/evaluating-cardinal-dolans-tenure/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/Timothy_Cardinal_Dolan_035.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/evaluating-cardinal-dolans-tenure/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/Timothy_Cardinal_Dolan_035.jpg", "description": "NEWS ANALYSIS: The outgoing USCCB president led the U.S. bishops during a tumultuous time.", "card": "summary", "title": "Evaluating Cardinal Dolan\u2019s Tenure"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ea9\"", "article_summary": "That outsized legacy presents a tall order for Cardinal Dolan\u2019s successor, one of 10 candidates nominated by USCCB members.\n\u201cComprehensive immigration reform is the way to continue this success.\u201dBut it now looks doubtful that Congress will pass proposed legislation for comprehensive immigration reform during Cardinal Dolan\u2019s watch.\nDuring Cardinal Dolan\u2019s tenure, the U.S. bishops also issued a pastoral letter on this issue that has provided a framework for a religious freedom curriculum in Catholic schools.\n\u201cCardinal Dolan has been the right guy at the right time.\n\u201cHe had a pastoral heart and sidewalk savviness, but was as cogent and compelling in preaching faith and morals as anyone,\u201d recalled Archbishop Dolan, extoling Cardinal O\u2019Connor after his election in 2010, and before he was made a cardinal himself in 2012."}
