A recent survey of 14,000 registered nurses by BlackBlook shows that their dissatisfaction with EHRs stands at a whopping 92 percent. Most blame problems on financial administrators and CIOs for \u201cselecting low performance systems\u201d based on price and government incentives like Meaningful Use, and \u201ccutting corners at the expense of quality of care.\u201d Ninety-seven percent of nursing administrators in for-profit hospitals say nurses\u2019 workloads were not considered in their facilities\u2019 EHR selection decision. Five percent say they are \u201cstruggling with continually flawed EHR systems.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe nurses ranked Cerner as the most \u201cnurse user-friendly\u201d inpatient EHR vendor. Other vendors in the study included: Siemens, McKesson, Epic Systems, Allscripts, CPSI, GE Healthcare, NextGen, Meditech, Quadramed, HMS, HCS, RazorInsights, 3M, HCare, Vista, Healthland, Prognocis and eClinicalWorks.

Timothy Jordan from Google will kick it off with a discussion of wearable computing, and there\u2019s plenty of digital health on the agenda. Mitre, IBM, Adidas, Nike, Sony and White House reps will be making appearances through Tuesday. WEDI-Con 2014 kicks off tomorrow http://bit.ly/1olGqxL around noon with some educational sessions on meaningful use audits and HIPAA security risk assessments. The FDA\u2019s \u201cCollaborative Approaches for Medical Device and Health Care Cybersecurity\u201d is Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nDON\u2019T BLAME IT ON THE EHR: TEXAS HEALTH RESOURCES is clarifying that Thomas Duncan\u2019s travel history was put in the EHR but not \u201ccommunicated effectively among the care team\u201d in full-page ads in local papers (H/T to HIStalk).\n\nThe DoD DHMSM application due dates have been pushed back again \u2014 from Oct. 23 to Oct. 31.\n\nCLARIFICATION: PWC LEADS OPEN-SOURCE EHR EFFORT FOR NEW DOD EHR: On Thursday we reported on the DoD\u2019s $11 billion contract for a brand-new electronic health records system. We\u2019d like to clarify that VistA itself is not one of the bidders. Rather, PwC, in partnership with DSS Inc., General Dynamics, MedSphere and MedicaSoft announced in September that it would bid for the DoD contract. \u201cPwC is leading the team and its proposal uses some of the fundamentals of the VistA application through the open source architecture supported by OSEHRA,\u201d a PwC spokesperson points out.\n\nCDC, ONC WORKING ON EBOLA SCREENING TOOL: A CDC and ONC initiative launched to help providers meet meaningful use public health objectives is now focusing on creating an Ebola electronic screening tool, ONC said Friday. The CDC has developed a clinical algorithm for evaluation of arriving travelers and a checklist for patients being evaluated in the U.S. for Ebola. The Public Health Electronic Health Records Vendors Collaboration Initiative, created in August 2013, will work to include the information in an electronic format to help clinicians. \u201cThe overall goal here is for us to explore ways in which the electronic medical record can serve as a prompt to help our healthcare professionals around the country identify individuals that may be at risk for Ebola,\u201d said Dana Meaney Delman of the CDC during a webinar soliciting industry feedback. CDC and ONC will be having a separate call with members of HIMSS Electronic Health Record Association to gain input.\n\nABOUT 1 IN 4 STATES ADDRESSING TELEMEDICINE REGS: Twelve states are actively revising their telemedicine policies either through working groups or rulemaking, Kofi Jones, vice president of public affairs at telemedicine company American Well, said Friday. The states want to update their regulations to try to keep pace with the dynamic and growing field, Jones said at the AHIP State Health Issues Conference. They include Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Iowa, Indiana, Texas, New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Arkansas and Idaho. \u201cIt\u2019s a moving target. Most of them are moving forward, Jones said. \u201cSome of them are moving back.\u201d There has never been a busier year in telehealth policy, she said, citing interest in licensure, reimbursement, definitions of telemedicine and the patient-physician relationship, and determinations of what sorts of medical practices are allowed to happen at a distance.\n\nFORMER HEALTH IT CZAR DEFENDS EHRS IN EBOLA SCARE: David Blumenthal, a former national coordinator for health IT, has defended EHRs from accusations they were partly to blame for mishaps in the Texas Ebola outbreak, saying the problem was \u201chumanware, not the software.\u201d Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital at one point blamed its EHR system for not prompting questions about Ebola patient Thomas Duncan\u2019s travel history, allowing him to be discharged from the emergency room before returning to be admitted two days later. The hospital later retracted the statement. \u201cThe culprit was a mundane and all-too-common failure by people to communicate in a fast-paced and stressful medical setting,\u201d Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, wrote today on the think tank\u2019s blog. Doctors and hospitals today blame EHRs for problems because they are ubiquitous and imperfect, he said. They are also an easy scapegoat for \u201cunderlying dysfunctions\u201d in the broader health system. \u201cThe dissatisfaction with the technology will recede as EHRs improve, and as a new generation of young clinicians, raised in the electronic world, populates our health care system,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cIn the meantime, blaming EHRs for whatever ails American health care is an understandable, if not wholly justifiable, reaction to the dramatic changes with which providers are grappling.\u201d\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING:\n\nNew doctors site rates for experience, quality \u2014 USA Today: http://usat.ly/1vSNW5l\n\nEbola isn\u2019t a messaging problem, Dr. Scott Gottlieb writes in the WSJ: http://on.wsj.com/1vSOMiB\n\nIn NextGov: Is Big Data the cure to the VA\u2019s woes? http://bit.ly/1ntnlJn\n\nDavid Blumenthal in the Commonwealth Fund: EHRs are the new lightining rod in healthcare: http://bit.ly/1vSQ25g\n\nDr. Wen Dombrowksi tells the WSJ venture capitalists should back inventions for the sick, not the rich: on.wsj.com/1xWZGll\n\nFortune considers the causes of rising medical identity theft: http://for.tn/1t1s59Q\n\nAn infectious disease specialist and member of the HealthTap app tells NPR how telemedicine can help manage hypochondria and fears of Ebola: http://n.pr/1urGQ20\n\nNEW POLITICO POLL OUT TODAY REVEALS most battleground voters believe their health care costs will go up under the Affordable Care Act.
