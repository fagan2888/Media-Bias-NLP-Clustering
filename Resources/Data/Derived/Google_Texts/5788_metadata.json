Ron Johnson of fields questions from attendees during a luncheon at The Madison Club in Madison on Oct. 9. He has made reducing the federal deficit and spending a key part of his re-election campaign, in which he faces a challenge from Democrat Russ Feingold. Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy of the\n\nRon Johnson won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2010 by making the federal budget his signature issue, warning voters that runaway spending and debt were \"threatening our freedom.\"\n\nSince Johnson took office in January 2011, the debt has kept growing, though at a slower pace, and federal spending has remained fairly steady. So has the manufacturer used his accountant's eyeshade to start addressing that imbalance or has his opposition to the federal deficit been more symbolic than successful?\n\nWith Johnson facing a tough challenge from Democrat Russ Feingold in 2016, voters will have to decide.\n\nJohnson said he and other Republicans in Congress could take some credit for keeping spending lower than what President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats in the Senate wanted.\n\n\"It's been a messy process and I'm not going take full credit for it but it's because of the tea party movement, because of fiscal conservatives, we've spent\" less, Johnson said recently. \"We have to take credit for the fact that we actually have restrained the growth of government.\"\n\nThe annual federal deficit peaked at $1.4 trillion at the height of the recession in 2009 and has improved since then along with the economy.\n\nBut it's still sits at nearly $500 billion for this year, or about three times as much as in 2007.\n\nThe total debt owed to groups outside the U.S. government rose to $13 trillion this year from $9 trillion in 2009, or 44%, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nFederal spending rose relatively little between 2010 and 2015, but it still sits about 23% higher this year than it was in 2008.\n\nDemocrats say Johnson hasn't been a real factor in those changes.\n\nHe hasn't sought the kind of compromises needed to balance the federal budget and has been too willing to back costly military spending such as his recent call to commit U.S. ground troops to Syria as part of a coalition with other nations, they said.\n\n\"It's an outrageous contradiction that Senator Ron Johnson has spent countless hours giving a PowerPoint presentation on his 'signature issue' then voted against the bipartisan policies currently responsible for reducing our nation's deficit. Senator Johnson has spent his time in Washington ... lecturing, not acting,\" said Martha Laning, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.\n\nRepublicans point out that Johnson was in the minority for his first four years and still has to work with a Democratic president.\n\nJohnson says he has helped bring about lower spending and debt while avoiding risky tactics such as a government shutdown.\n\nOver the past five years, Johnson:\n\n\u25a0Sat on the conference committee between the House and Senate that helped put together the first joint budget resolution to pass in six years.\n\nThe plan approved in May lays out spending targets to balance the budget over a decade, though committees still have to draft legislation to impose the trillions of dollars in spending cuts.\n\nDemocrats say that the budget would mean unacceptable cuts to programs such as medical research, food stamps and federal student financial aid.\n\nRepublicans say the plan represents the first balanced budget since 2001.\n\nBob Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, said the GOP budget is similar to those put forward by Obama in that it contains some \"unrealistic expectations\" in terms of future spending and tax collections.\n\n\"It's a blueprint,\" Bixby said of the GOP budget. \"In some sense, it's a vision. It's a political statement.\"\n\nWithin that budget resolution, Johnson inserted amendments requiring the CBO to project the federal budget picture over 30 years and put together a one page summary of federal income and expenses.\n\nJohnson says that simplifies the government's financial challenges for ordinary citizens.\n\n\u25a0Argued strongly for repealing the federal Affordable Care Act, sometimes known as Obamacare, and offered last spring a plan to transition the country's health care system away from it.\n\nJohnson also sued to end health subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs under the law.\n\nThat lawsuit was thrown out by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in April\n\n\u25a0Voted for some budget deals, despite his opposition to federal spending and the ACA.\n\nFor instance, Johnson supported funding the federal government in a September 2013 vote before that fall's government shutdown.\n\n\"I don't want to play brinkmanship with the American economy,\" Johnson said at the time\n\nJohnson also voted last month for a stopgap funding measure to keep the government funded and backed the bipartisan two-year budget deal that was brokered in December 2013 by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).\n\nThe deal sought to end the type of stalemates that triggered the government shutdown two months earlier.\n\n\u25a0At other times, though, Johnson voted on conservative principle rather than pragmatism.\n\nIn January 2014, just a month after backing the Ryan-Murray agreement, Johnson voted against a bipartisan spending bill that tracked the earlier deal, saying it didn't do enough to eliminate waste.\n\nIn August 2011, Johnson voted against the bipartisan Budget Control Act, which at the time was projected to cut deficits by about $2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nFor his first two years in the Senate, Johnson served on the Appropriations Committee, where by his own account he was often out of sync with other members, including his fellow Republicans.\n\n\"Most of the votes we had in committee I was losing 29-1 or 28-2,\" Johnson said in February 2013 after stepping aside.\n\nIn the majority, Johnson has served as the chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\n\nThere the senator said he has sought to use the panel to expose federal waste and abuse, such as the dangerous overprescription of painkillers at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Voters to gauge Ron Johnson's role in federal budget issues", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/voters-to-gauge-ron-johnsons-role-in-federal-budget-issues-b99601968z1-336692941.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99601968z.1_20151024214150_000_gpmd2ef0.1-1.jpg", "height": 1281}, "type": "article", "description": "Ron Johnson won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2010 by making the federal budget his signature issue.
