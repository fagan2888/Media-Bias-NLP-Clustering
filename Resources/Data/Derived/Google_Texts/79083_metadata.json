Allow me to comment.\n\nFirst of all, it's necessary to distinguish between what comes from the Bible and what comes from Church tradition. \"Christian\" leaders claiming to speak in the place of Christ have often given horrible, even deadly, direction to people. That shouldn't surprise anybody. Every book of the New Testament warns against false teachers arising within the Church. If a Christian knows her Bible well, she will not only spot error, but also distinguish between biblical mandates and church tradition.\n\nThe Bible nowhere commands Christians to celebrate Christ's birth on Dec. 25 or Easter in the spring, or even to worship on Sundays. We do so in Christian freedom. These are worthwhile traditions that have served God's people well.\n\nYour opinion that Jeremiah 10:2-4 \"specifically forbids Christmas trees\" is interesting. The Christmas tree tradition came over 2,000 years after Jeremiah. Therefore he couldn't be forbidding them. He was forbidding the pagan practice of crafting and adorning an idol to worship. If people worship and pray to a tree \u2014 or any thing for that matter \u2014 then they are clearly violating God's will. Likewise, God's word forbidding Jews who lived before Christ's arrival to make a graven image in no way applies to nativity scenes.\n\nI'm also curious how you turn Jesus' direction to remember his death into an \"admonishment\" of \"celebrating his birth.\" I don't follow that logic.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, I won't close with either \"Merry Christmas\" or \"Happy Holidays.\" Instead, I wish you and other readers the peace that only God can give as you ponder how the eternal Son of God became a human being to save us from our sins.\n\nPastor James Borgwardt\n\nRedeemer Lutheran Church\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1Dthtaa", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Fond du Lac clergyman writes about Christmas traditions.", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "A Fond du Lac clergyman writes about Christmas traditions.", "title": "LETTER: Distinguish between Bible, church tradition", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/opinion/2014/12/13/letter-distinguish-bible-church-tradition/20362469/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Fond du Lac clergyman writes about Christmas traditions.", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e65f6884a98005fef5437ea3dde980191ec5499/c=701-0-2899-2198&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/WIGroup/FondduLac/2014/11/26/635525994851790009-Faith-bible-stack.JPG", "title": "LETTER: Distinguish between Bible, church tradition", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde47a\"", "article_summary": "First of all, it's necessary to distinguish between what comes from the Bible and what comes from Church tradition.\nIf a Christian knows her Bible well, she will not only spot error, but also distinguish between biblical mandates and church tradition.\nThe Christmas tree tradition came over 2,000 years after Jeremiah.\nThe Bible nowhere commands Christians to celebrate Christ's birth on Dec. 25 or Easter in the spring, or even to worship on Sundays.\nBuy Photo Area communities of faith hold events week of June 14 (Photo: Gannett Wisconsin Media file photo)Buy PhotoDistinguish between Bible, church traditionDear Christine Ewerdt and Reporter readers:I read your Dec. 9 column regarding the history of the \"War on Christmas\" with interest."}
