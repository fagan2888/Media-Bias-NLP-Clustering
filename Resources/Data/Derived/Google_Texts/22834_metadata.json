The Republican trend was slow to develop amid the Mountain State\u2019s relative poverty \u2014 it went for Jimmy Carter twice and even Michael Dukakis. But the trend\u2019s origin was the Democrats\u2019 embrace of what, from the safety of anonymity, Democratic Sen. Thomas Eagleton once called the agenda of \u201camnesty, acid and abortion.\u201d In today\u2019s terms, this long-forgotten disparaging phrase translates to the progressive social values of the white urban liberal gentry, which were repudiated tonight in other states (most notably Texas and Colorado).\n\nAdd to that toxic mix the same urban gentry\u2019s radical environmentalism, and you have the final ingredient for today\u2019s result. West Virginians arguably know more than anyone the need for workplace safety and a clean environment, having suffered a recent chemical spill and many fatal mining disasters. But the Left's obsession with eradicating coal has convinced the state's voters that do-gooders in Washington will never let them live their lives or make a living.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s \u201cWar on Coal\u201d may have been overblown \u2014 in fact, low natural gas prices are also a major factor in killing off the fuel\u2019s continued use. But Obama\u2019s popularity in the state did not benefit from his own multiple anti-coal comments ranging as far back as 2007, nor from his environmental policies, nor from his senior EPA officials\u2019 careless talk of wiping West Virginia towns off the map and \u201ccrucifying\u201d their major employers to make a statement.\n\nFor decades, local Democrats survived their national party\u2019s leftward lurch by convincing voters that Democrats there were different and could be trusted. But the era when this was possible may finally be ending.\n\nIn recent years, Democrats in the entire Appalachian region have had to go to greater and greater extremes to keep up appearances of remaining in touch with their constituents and not in the hip pockets of national party leaders. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the most conservative Democrat left in the Senate, drove his point home in 2010 by shooting up a copy of the cap-and-trade bill in one of his ads. Allison Lundergan Grimes also tried to show off her prowess with a gun and differentiate herself from Obama, but it just wasn\u2019t enough this year. Her other mistakes aside, it was widely believed, with some justification, that she would be a vote for Obama the coal-killer whenever he needed her.\n\nManchin is now lonely as the last Democrat representing the Mountain State in Washington, D.C. He must at least be considering a change of party, as his state turns red and his fellow Senate Democratic moderates (especially Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark.) go down to defeat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hour is late, and so far it's been a great night for Republicans.
