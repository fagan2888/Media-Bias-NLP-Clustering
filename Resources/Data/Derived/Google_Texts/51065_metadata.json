Obama bowed to political pressure from his fellow Democrats on Thursday and announced a plan to let insurers renew for one year the health plans for Americans whose policies would be otherwise canceled due to Obamacare. REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) - RTX15DNW\n\n4133634\n\nAnother day, another unwelcome poll for the White House.\n\nPew reports that Hispanic support for Obamacare has lurched downwards from 60-plus percent in September 2013 to 47 percent.\n\nThat matters a lot, because it possibly means there\u2019s less chance that the GOP\u2019s campaign against Obamacare will prompt the large Hispanic turnout that President Barack Obama needs in November to keep Sen. Harry Reid in charge of the Senate.\n\nSo far, Democrats have expected Latinos\u2019 support for Obamacare will help them vote Democratic in November.\n\nBut the poll showing tepid support for Obamacare might force Obama to spend more time and money pushing Obamacare up the priority list.\n\nOverall, Obama\u2019s support among Hispanics fell from 75 percent in December 2012, to 52 percent in November, according to Gallup.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Obama\u2019s support fell among Hispanics, but he easily revived it by granting a quasi-amnesty to at least 500,000 younger illegal immigrants in June 2012. The GOP\u2019s open criticism of the President\u2019s move also buttressed his support among Latinos, who gave him 71 percent of the their vote in November.\n\nBut top Democrats are split on whether Obama can use even the most emotional aspects of the immigration dispute to spur Latino turnout this year.\n\n\u201cOf course it is going to effect turnout,\u201d AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka told The Daily Caller March 14.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that the Republicans are stopping\u2026 11 million [illegal immigrant] citizens \u2014 that are citizens in every way except papers \u2014 from getting citizenship,\u201d he said during a brief interview outside the White House.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear\u201d if the immigration issue will increase the Latino vote in November, Janet Murguia, president of the largest Latino lobby group, the National Council of La Raza, told TheDC. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but what I have said is that it will certainly have an impact on the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have long regarded their creation of Obamacare as a key driver for the Hispanic turnout.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s biggest problem with Hispanics is Obamacare, not immigration, David Plouffe told the New York Times in in February 2013, shortly after the 2012 election. \u201cIt\u2019s their economic policies and health care. The group that supported the president\u2019s health care bill the most? Latinos,\u201d said Plouffe, who was Obama\u2019s campaign manager in the 2008 election and a top adviser for the 2012 election.\n\nThe new Pew poll shows that Hispanics are now split evenly on Obamacare, with 47 percent approval and 47 percent disapproval.\n\n\u201cOver most of the past four years, Hispanics have offered more support than opposition for the health care law\u2026 support for the ACA among Hispanics fell sharply in October of 2013 (to 47%) and has yet to recover,\u201d said the March 20 Pew report, \u201cACA at Age 4: More Disapproval than Approval.\u201d\n\nThat score puts Hispanics closer to whites, at 33 percent approval, than to blacks who remain solidly behind Obamacare at 77 percent approval.\n\nHispanics\u2019 support for Obamacare crashed after Obama admitted he had lied when he claimed voters could keep their own health-care plan if they wished to keep it. Since then, Obama has also admitted that people won\u2019t be able to keep their own doctors, as he had promised while pushing the bill through Congress.\n\nSupport might have also dropped because the Spanish-language website has been crippled for months, hindering access by the roughly one-quarter of Hispanic households that only speak Spanish at home.\n\nAlso, Obamacare\u2019s monthly premiums are high, especially for younger people who can\u2019t get a subsidy.\n\nAlso, the law allows poor people to sign up for Medicare, perhaps reducing the willingness of people to give credit to Obamacare.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Democrats now have another November election problem", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Another day, another unwelcome poll for the White House.
