It was built for episodic care. Both consumers and providers are victims of the system.\u201d\n\nBroussard acknowledged that health insurers have been \u201cpart of the problem\u201d in perpetuating the currently misaligned system, but he vowed that Humana, at least, would help drive transformation.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies must make the healthcare system simpler for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to change from an underwriting business model to a health improvement model.\u201d\n\nIndustry transformation can be painful, Broussard noted, but he said the difficulties in moving away from volume-based care would ultimately yield improved health outcomes and cost control. He praised the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for its stated intention to tie 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations or bundled payment arrangements by the end of 2016.\n\n\u201cValue-based reimbursement and interoperability are the keys to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of both means we remain in a siloed healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBroussard\u2019s message to the IT audience was blunt \u2013 U.S. healthcare doesn\u2019t need new technologies for transformation, it needs new perspectives.\n\n\u201cThe problem is in this room, with all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be bold leaders in changing healthcare, because the consumer is looking for us to change. Interoperability is a great place to start. Information should be a shared asset, not a proprietary asset.\u201d\n\nSome U.S. employers have seen the light, Broussard noted, and have begun to look at their employees\u2019 health holistically. Forward-thinking companies are including wellness benefits in their health plans, for instance, and are paying for employee health risk assessments.\n\nHumana itself is changing, Broussard said, revealing that compensation for his senior leadership team is based not only on earnings per share \u2013 common for a public company \u2013 but on the health engagement scores of members.\n\n\u201cWe want to improve the health outcomes of our communities 20 percent by 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re measuring this by a concept called \u2018healthy days.\u2019 We ask members four questions about their physical and behavioral activities, based on an approach used by the CDC. There is a high correlation between certain answers to those questions and healthy outcomes.\u201d\n\nBroussard said Humana\u2019s experience suggested a combined \u201chigh-tech, high-touch\u201d approach to care that will have the most impact on outcomes.\n\n\u201cImproving the consumer experience with healthcare depends on personalization, not just data-driven personalization, but face-to-face conversation to drive better decision-making,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. healthcare must transition from a supply-based to a demand-based system, with patient choice at the center, said Bruce Broussard, Humana's president and CEO, at the HIMSS15 Annual Conference & Exhibition on Tuesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "U.S. healthcare must transition from a supply-based to a demand-based system, with patient choice at the center, said Bruce Broussard, Humana's president and CEO, at the HIMSS15 Annual Conference & Exhibition on Tuesday.", "title": "HIMSS15 Keynote: Value, interoperability are keys to success", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/value-interoperability-are-keys-success", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/patient_and_doc.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-14T19:34:53-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/value-interoperability-are-keys-success", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/patient_and_doc.jpg"}, "description": "U.S. healthcare must transition from a supply-based to a demand-based system, with patient choice at the center, said Bruce Broussard, Humana's president and CEO, at the HIMSS15 Annual Conference & Exhibition on Tuesday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "HIMSS15 Keynote: Value, interoperability are keys to success"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-14T13:21:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-14T19:34:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cInsurance companies must make the healthcare system simpler for consumers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cValue-based reimbursement and interoperability are the keys to change,\u201d he said.\nForward-thinking companies are including wellness benefits in their health plans, for instance, and are paying for employee health risk assessments.\n\u201cImproving the consumer experience with healthcare depends on personalization, not just data-driven personalization, but face-to-face conversation to drive better decision-making,\u201d he said.\nKeynoting the second full day, Broussard emphasized themes becoming increasingly common in the healthcare industry: that volume-based care is not long for the world, while a value-based reimbursement system is the unavoidable future."}
