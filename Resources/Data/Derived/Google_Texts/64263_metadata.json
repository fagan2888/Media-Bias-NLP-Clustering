Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\n\u201cWhile Boston Children\u2019s has long served patients and families from the tri-state area, the affiliation with CWPW will enable us to better serve pediatric patients, who require highly complex care through improved integration,\u201d said Sandra Fenwick, president and CEO of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in a statement.\n\nWhile more than 1,000 doctors practice across Boston Children\u2019s departments, Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Physicians of Westchester will also be the nonprofit\u2019s first owned practice.

Boston Children\u2019s earned $113 million last year on more than $1.5 billion in revenue, 24,000 patients and 551,000 patient visits.\n\nFounded in 2000, Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Physicians of Westchester led an effort to create the Maria Fareri Children\u2019s Hospital at Westchester Medical Center and now serve as the majority of its physicians. The group\u2019s physicians will remain faculty of New York Medical College, and continue to staff 10 area neonatal intensive care units and maintain their current affiliations across the region.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/boston-childrens-hospital-buys-new-york-based-childrens-womens-physicians-westchester", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/boston-children%27s-hospital-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Children's & Women's Physicians of Westchester has 276 doctors in 57 locations throughout Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.", "title": "Boston Children's Hospital buys New York-based Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Physicians of Westchester"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/boston-children%27s-hospital-feature.png"}, "description": "Children's & Women's Physicians of Westchester has 276 doctors in 57 locations throughout Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Boston Children's Hospital buys New York-based Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Physicians of Westchester"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, a Harvard Medical School affiliate, on Friday said has acquired Children\u2019s &amp; Women\u2019s Physicians of Westchester, a medical practice with 276 doctors in 57 locations throughout Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.&#13; It\u2019s Boston Childrens\u2019 first acquisition outside of Massachusetts and is aimed at both expanding community-based care and drawing in complex pediatric patients to the 395-bed comprehensive medical center.
