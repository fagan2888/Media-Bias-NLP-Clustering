When I promised 27 million Texans that I meant it, and I am proud of standing and fighting to honor that promise.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cin the midst of that fight to defund Obamacare, just about every graybeard in Washington went on television and said, \u2018This is a disaster. You are dooming the Republican Party. As a result of you and Mike Lee fighting to stop this law, Harry Reid\u2019s going to be reelected. Republicans are going to get killed in the 2014 election.\u2019 Well, you know, a funny thing happened on the way to the election booth. Now, I guarantee you, if that had happened, if we\u2019d gotten clobbered in the 2014 election, every Republican greybeard would have gone on television and said, \u2018You see? It\u2019s Cruz\u2019s fault we got killed.\u2019 But, instead, not only did we not get killed, we won an historic tidal wave victory, the biggest majority in the house since the 1920\u2019s. \u2026 And the number one issue in the country, if you look at the ads and messages Republicans used, the number one issue was Obamacare. I think mobilizing and energizing millions of conservatives against the train wreck that is Obamacare was a major victory to winning the Senate in 2014. \u201d\n\nCruz concluded, \u201c2016 is going to be a referendum on repealing Obamacare. And if I am elected president in 2017, a Republican president is going to sign legislation repealing every word of that failed law.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz defended his Obamacare filibuster while criticizing \"about every graybeard in Washington\" who critiqued him during the shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz defended his Obamacare filibuster while criticizing \"about every graybeard in Washington\" who critiqued him during the shutdown", "title": "Cruz Criticizes Washington Greybeards Who Denounced Shutdown - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Cruz-OCare-718-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/07/18/cruz-criticizes-washington-greybeards-who-denounced-shutdown/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz defended his Obamacare filibuster while criticizing \"about every graybeard in Washington\" who critiqued him during the shutdown", "title": "Cruz Criticizes Washington Greybeards Who Denounced Shutdown - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Cruz-OCare-718-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "government shutdown, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-07-18T13:24:43-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCruz said of the shutdown, \u201cJust about every Republican in Congress campaigned saying they would do everything humanly possible to stop Obamacare.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAt Saturday\u2019s Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, Texas Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz defended his Obamacare filibuster and the government shutdown, while criticizing \u201cabout every graybeard in Washington\u201d who critiqued him during the shutdown.\n\u201dCruz concluded, \u201c2016 is going to be a referendum on repealing Obamacare.\nAs a result of you and Mike Lee fighting to stop this law, Harry Reid\u2019s going to be reelected.\nRepublicans are going to get killed in the 2014 election.\u2019 Well, you know, a funny thing happened on the way to the election booth."}
