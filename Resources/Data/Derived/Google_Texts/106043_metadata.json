And what if the abolitionists had said, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in slavery but you guys do whatever you want\u2019? Where would be?\u201d\n\nCarson, who is challenging Donald Trump for the role of frontrunner in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination, said he would \u201clove\u201d to see Roe v. Wade overturned. When asked whether there could be exceptions that would allow abortions to be carried out in certain circumstances, he said the issue could be discussed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a reasonable person. And if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I\u2019ll listen,\u201d Carson said. But he made it clear that the only room for discussion had to do with the \u201cextraordinarily rare situation\u201d in which the mother\u2019s life is at risk. \u201cRape or incest, I would not be for killing a baby because the baby came about in that way,\u201d Carson added.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "The Republican presidential hopeful said he would \"love\" to see Roe v.
