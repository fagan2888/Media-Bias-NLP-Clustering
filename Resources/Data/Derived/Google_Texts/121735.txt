COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH)–Trump is no stranger to protesters and disruptions.

His campaign rhetoric on refugees and immigration is attracting big crowds, but many see Trump as divisive and hateful.

“It’s very hurtful to know that people are not questioning out potential candidates, and are showing support to such an anti-worker, anti-immigrant, anti-black, and anti-woman movement that’s going on. That he’s promoting,” said Jessica Camacho, an immigrant who came to Ohio at age five.

Gov. John Kasich’s presidential campaign is also attacking Trump; his qualifications, his temperament and his controversial positions.
