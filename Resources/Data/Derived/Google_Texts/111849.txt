U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) today endorsed Leonard Lance for Congress in the 7th District.

Ryan went with the right Republican Primary buzz words on behalf of Lance (pictured), who’s looking to squelch movement conservative challenger David Larsen for the third time.

“Leonard Lance has helped House conservatives lead the fight against Obamacare. And he has worked to advance pro-growth legislation to expand our Nation’s energy production,” Ryan said. “He is committed to reducing our debt, making common-sense reductions in spending and balancing our budget.

“We need more principled leaders like Leonard Lance and I am proud to support his reelection to Congress,” added the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president. “On Tuesday, June 3 I ask that you vote to reelect Leonard Lance to Congress.”
