This is the third year for a health fair in Riverside providing free dental care and medical and vision checkups, and the first held since people began signing up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Although thousands of Inland residents may have new health insurance under Obamacare, health fair organizer Gilberto Esquivel said he still expects to see long lines of people at Saturdayâs event at the CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Community Center, 2060 University Ave.

The event will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., with registration beginning at 7 a.m. Services are first-come, first-served.

âAt this point, the number of people actually enrolled (under the Affordable Care Act) who have functioning insurance is very low,â said Esquivel, president of the Riverside chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a sponsor of the fair. âThe vast majority of people in the Inland Empire are not registered.â

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for care under the law, and dental and vision care are not part of Obamacare coverage.

At last yearâs health fair, more than 1,000 people received care, checkups, tests, free glasses or some other type of service.

Yet many had to be turned away. The 174 spots for dental care were snatched up by 10 a.m. last year, two hours after the doors opened.

âThere must have been 600 people looking for dental care who didnât get it,â Esquivel said.

This year, there will be at least 26 dentists, compared with 17 last year, and eight doctors, compared with four last year.

âThe ultimate goal is to try to serve more people,â Esquivel said. âWe might have to turn people down. We hope not as many as last year.â

New this year are mammograms, hearing exams and free hearing amplifiers.

The league is organizing the event with Chicanos/Latinos for Community Medicine at Riverside City College. There were similar clinics in 2011 and February 2013.

Some of the dentists are flying in from Northern California with Auburn-based Flying Doctors, an organization that was founded to provide care in rural Latin America but later expanded to the impoverished eastern Coachella Valley and in 2011 to Riverside. Individual local dentists are also scheduled to volunteer, along with dentists affiliated with Loma Linda Universityâs School of Dentistry, Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona and San Dimas-based Buddhist Tzu-Chi Foundation.

Riverside County Regional Medical Center is providing primary-care physicians. Other organizations are providing nurses, equipment, dental and physician assistants, optometrists, ophthalmologists and audiologists.
