Then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper suggested Bennet, his chief of staff, should consider applying to be superintendent of the city\u2019s troubled school system.\n\nAccording to a 2007 New Yorker profile of Bennet, at the time he had aspired to hold public office someday and thought running an urban school district could end his political career rather than start it.\n\nBut Bennet dug in and learned as much as he could about what ails and works in public education.\n\n\u201cI can remember vividly sitting in my office reading about what was going on in urban systems across the country and finding myself going from the feeling that there is nothing I can contribute here to feeling desperately interested in it because it is the future,\u201d Bennet said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cAcross this country, we have done such a bad job in so many ways. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, but it is all of us \u2026 this sort of obsolescence that we have allowed to creep in. That made me want to work on it.\u201d\n\nBennet became superintendent in 2005. The rest is well-known Colorado history. Suffice to say, the experience didn\u2019t snuff his political ambitions.\n\nA decade later, Bennet is now the senior senator from Colorado, leading the push to rewrite the long-standing federal education law No Child Left Behind and borrowing on his experiences as an urban school superintendent to help craft the Senate\u2019s bill.\n\nThe legislation that is still being debated in Congress has the former superintendent\u2019s fingerprints all over it, and many of the reforms started in Denver could soon be part of a new federal law.\n\nFor Michael Bennet, the spark that ignited a decade ago over how to improve public education is still burning, and now it is a fire that could finally change the country\u2019s poorly crafted education law.\n\nHigh-stakes testing\n\nCongress has for years attempted to rewrite No Child Left Behind, arguably a failed mandate \u2014 sweeping legislation from 2003 that started an era of high-stakes standardized testing.\n\nSenate bills attempting to rewrite the law have twice failed under partisan bickering. This year, when public sentiment has turned against testing, both the House and Senate passed versions of a new education law, setting up a showdown for a final compromise.\n\nBennet will be a critical player in reaching that middle ground, according to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n\nAs the first superintendent in the Senate since Strom Thurmond, Bennet has been a key member in helping the Senate figure out what the government should do, she said.\n\n\u201cHe probably understood the ins and outs of this legislation better than anybody because he lived them,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHis voice, his ideas, his thoughts were all absolutely key. The senators on the committee on both sides of the aisle really respected his expertise and thoughtfulness.\u201d\n\nWhen he was superintendent of Denver Public Schools from 2005 to 2009, Bennet shuttered empty schools, encouraged charters, and implemented a pay system that rewarded teachers who improved their students\u2019 performances and provided them incentives to work in the neediest schools.\n\nUnder Bennet, DPS students scored higher in math, science, reading and writing.\n\nProgress continues under Superintendent Tom Boasberg, who was Bennet\u2019s childhood friend and his chief operating officer.\n\nEnrollment has skyrocketed. The dropout rate has been cut in half. Last year, DPS sent 30 percent more kids to college than it did in 2005. And preschool and full-day kindergarten slots dramatically expanded.\n\nWhile superintendent, Bennet always bristled at the federal education law.\n\n\u201cI used to wonder all the time why was everyone in Washington so mean to our teachers and to our kids?\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd why would you have an accountability system that makes no sense? What I figured out is they are not mean. They are well-intentioned. But they have no idea of what is going on in schools and classrooms. No idea.\u201d\n\nAs an education writer for The Denver Post beginning in 2007, I was charged with following this dynamic, young superintendent who had captured the hearts of the reform movement. I was struck by how Bennet seemed to have a plan already developed in his mind on how to do the impossible \u2014 turn around an urban school district. Every few weeks, Bennet and his team introduced a new initiative.\n\nFirst, the district would track individual student growth, then it would attach that growth to a school performance framework for every school in the district. It would offer bonuses to teachers who push that growth, choosing to work at hard-to-serve schools or a hard-to-teach subject.\n\nParticularly incensed by the federal act\u2019s accountability measure, Bennet worked with the state to develop a new way to measure academic growth. He sought and obtained a waiver from the U.S. Department of Education to use the new accountability method.\n\n\u201cIt asked the wrong question: How did this year\u2019s fourth grade do compared to last year\u2019s fourth grade?\u201d Bennet said. \u201cIt is an irrelevant question to the fourth-graders, to the teachers, and to the community.\u201d\n\nThe new growth model would examine the test history of a child and compare it to the progress of peers with similar test histories. It made complete sense. Eighteen other states have gone to similar models, and the Senate bill would allow states and districts to opt for this type of measurement without having to obtain waivers.\n\nIdeas from Denver reform\n\nThere are other signs of Denver\u2019s reforms in the Senate\u2019s rewrite, such as a revisions to the section of the law that addresses teacher training and recruitment \u2014 efforts that DPS has been working on for years.\n\nDenver established a teacher residency program that allows people from different careers to become educators. It created a program that allows teachers to take on critical leadership roles within their schools and established the ProComp pay system that gives teachers bonuses for a variety of efforts.\n\nThe Senate bill allows districts and states the flexibility to put federal funds toward exactly these types of programs.\n\nFrom the moment he came into the Senate, Bennet established himself as the go-to guy on education matters, said Frederick Hess, director at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cNo one else in the Senate has actually been on the ground in a school system,\u201d Hess said. \u201cBennet is a guy who was absolutely up to speed on how federal rules affect school districts, what happens when federal testing gets handed off to states and a school district. For a lot of folks, this is all abstract stuff. But Bennet had the advantage.\u201d\n\nBennet has repeatedly said much of No Child Left Behind is problematic and goes too far \u2014 yet he concedes the standardized tests did allow people to see how sets of students were performing.\n\nMoreover, standardized tests revealed the ugly truth that the nation\u2019s public school system was dramatically failing poorer, minority children in epidemic-like proportions.\n\nAfter President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s passed the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act and after Congress created Title 1 funds to target students with the greatest need, the problems are still around, Bennet said in a speech on the Senate floor in March.\n\n\u201cSadly, half a century later, the data reveals that these profound inequities persist and that our students need our help now more than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is also reason for hope in this data. We now have evidence that sustained support can make the difference in closing the pernicious gaps that remain for low-income kids.\u201d\n\nNo Child Left Behind was \u201can extraordinary federal overreach of epic proportions,\u201d Bennet said in a recent interview. \u201cIt is kind of amazing that the Bush administration got away with it. It is absolutely essential that we don\u2019t give up on the civil rights function of the federal government\u2019s involvement in education. That is the only reason it should be involved, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nThe Senate version would require states continue to use assessments for accountability, though the House\u2019s version is much weaker. Both versions remove a requirement for a specific set of academic standards, like Common Core.\n\nBennet wants the final bill to require states to identify the bottom 5 percent of failing schools and come up with their own ways of fixing them. He also wants states to identify when groups of students are failing in high-performing schools.\n\n\u201cThere is a balance of wanting to have Washington dictate less and be less prescriptive but to have kids who aren\u2019t performing be visible,\u201d he said.\n\nNo bill in Washington will solve the education struggles of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to make sure kids get an education and that zip codes don\u2019t determine the kind of education they get,\u201d he said. We are a long way from being able to make that promise to the next generation. \u2026 But there are places in the country that are making progress. We just need to make more progress and we need to do it faster.\u201d\n\nJeremy P.
