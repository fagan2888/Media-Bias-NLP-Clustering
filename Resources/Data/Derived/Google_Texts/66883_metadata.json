The title is a reference to a line in Sir Mix-A- Lot\u2019s classic hip-hop track \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d (she samples it throughout).\n\nLike the tune itself, the \u201cAnaconda\u201d plot isn\u2019t that deep. Minaj and her back-up dancers shake themselves through a jungle, a kitchen, and a stark white room, with whipped cream and bananas popping up as not-so-subtle props. Rapper Drake makes a guest appearance towards the end, where Minaj does a strip-tease like dance in front of him. Naturally, he seems impressed.\n\nIs the whole thing impressive though? With everything Minaj seems to touch these days, it\u2019s likely the \u201cAnaconda\u201d video will be another lightning rod for whether or not Minaj herself is a leader of female empowerment via twerking or just another sexually exploitive visual that degrades women. The comment section already has thousands of Nicki haters and defenders bickering back and forth. One thing\u2019s for certain: the song itself is a censor\u2019s dream come true.\n\nStill, the video has over two million views in less than 12 hours. Sir Mix-A-Lot would be proud.\n\nWatch it below:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The rapper's latest visual is a not-so-subtle ode to female sexuality", "title": "Nicki Minaj Unleashes Predictably Racy \u2018Anaconda\u2019 Video Featuring Drake", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/08/20/nicki-minaj-anaconda-video/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EE599_0820mi_G_20140820120831.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Nicki Minaj Unleashes Predictably Racy \u2018Anaconda\u2019 Video Featuring Drake", "description": "The rapper's latest visual is a not-so-subtle ode to female sexuality", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Mike Ayers", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "The rapper's latest visual is a not-so-subtle ode to female sexuality", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-20T16:13:54-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/08/20/nicki-minaj-anaconda-video/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-82994", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The rapper's latest visual is a not-so-subtle ode to female sexuality", "title": "Nicki Minaj Unleashes Predictably Racy \u2018Anaconda\u2019 Video Featuring Drake", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/08/20/nicki-minaj-anaconda-video/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EE599_0820mi_G_20140820120831.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-82994", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-20T16:14:08-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Nicki MinajNicki Minaj released her new video for \u201cAnaconda\u201d overnight and, par for the course, the song is an unabashed ode to sex and the female backside.\nRapper Drake makes a guest appearance towards the end, where Minaj does a strip-tease like dance in front of him.\nThe title is a reference to a line in Sir Mix-A- Lot\u2019s classic hip-hop track \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d (she samples it throughout).\nWith everything Minaj seems to touch these days, it\u2019s likely the \u201cAnaconda\u201d video will be another lightning rod for whether or not Minaj herself is a leader of female empowerment via twerking or just another sexually exploitive visual that degrades women.\nMinaj and her back-up dancers shake themselves through a jungle, a kitchen, and a stark white room, with whipped cream and bananas popping up as not-so-subtle props."}
