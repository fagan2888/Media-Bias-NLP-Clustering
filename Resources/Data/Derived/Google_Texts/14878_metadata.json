Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\n\nThe Facts\n\nObamacare is not a wildly popular law and negative views outstrip favorable ones. That\u2019s a fact. But the isn\u2019t wildly unpopular either. And Americans who oppose it do so for wildly different reasons.\n\nAccording to a CNN / ORC poll, 43 percent of Americans favor the law. With less than majority support, that\u2019s not exactly a ringing endorsement. But Americans who oppose the law are split. Thirty-five percent of people who oppose the law felt that it was too liberal. Sixteen percent thought it actually wasn\u2019t liberal enough. As for whether opposition has grown, that isn\u2019t borne out by the facts.\n\nIn March of 2010, according to a CBS / New York Times poll , thirteen percent of Americans strongly approved of the law. A much larger portion, 33 percent, strongly disapproved of it. Twenty-four percent somewhat approved and 15 percent somewhat disapproved.\n\nFast forward three and a half years to this month and not much has changed.\n\nAccording to the same poll, now 17 percent of Americans strongly approve of the law. That\u2019s a slight but probably statistically insignificant jump in strong support. Strong disapproval went from 33 percent in 2010 to 34 percent this month. Twenty-two percent now strongly disapprove (a statistically insignificant rise of two percentage points) and seventeen percent somewhat disapprove (again, two percentage points). Fifteen percent had no opinion in 2010 and ten percent still have no opinion today.\n\nOther polls have showed a wider swing. Forty-one percent had a favorable view of the law in a May 2010 Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That\u2019s down to 37 percent in August of 2013. Opposition, however, grew less \u2013 from 40 percent in April of 2010 to 42 percent in August. The number that has grown the most in the Kaiser poll \u2013 14 percent in 2010 and 20 percent in August \u2013 who say they don\u2019t know or are unsure about their opinion.\n\nThere has been a slight jump in the number of people who said the law would \u201churt\u201d rather than \u201chelp\u201d them. In 2010, 20 percent of Americans in the CBS / NYT poll thought the law would \u201chelp\u201d them and 38 percent thought it would \u201cnot have much effect\u201d on them. Thirty-five percent thought the law would \u201churt\u201d them. Now 40 percent think the law will hurt them, 18 percent expect it to \u201chelp\u201d and 40 percent don\u2019t expect much of an effect to their personal situation.\n\n\n\nVerdict\n\nTrue, but misleading. It is absolutely accurate to say the law is unpopular, at least according to current opinion polls. But disapproval is for a variety of reasons and not always the ones opponents say it is. Also disapproval has not markedly grown in the three years the law has been in effect. What\u2019s more, a lot of Americans still don\u2019t know a lot about the law. In that same CBS / New York Times poll, 52 percent of Americans said they knew \u201csome\u201d about the law. And 26 percent knew not much or nothing at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Assertion Obamacare is unpopular. \u201cThe more the American people have learned about this law, the less they\u2019ve liked it.\u201d - Sen.
