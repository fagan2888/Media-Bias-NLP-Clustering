Cuomo's pick for lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, as too conservative for Democratic primary voters.\n\nTeachout and her running mate Tim Wu on Monday unveiled the first installment of what they called the \"Hochul Dossier\" that focused on Hochul's stint in Congress and several votes she took in favor of GOP-backed measures.\n\nThe campaign plans to release three other segments over the next 10 days. The candidates will square off in a Sept. 9 primary.\n\n\"Kathy Hochul is a choice that Andrew Cuomo made that reflects his own Republican values as opposed to Democratic values,\" Teachout said. \"If Andrew Cuomo had been born in another state or born to another father, we'd call him a Republican.\u201d\n\nShe cited votes Hochul took to block portions of Obamacare and hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress.\n\nKathy Hochul is too conservative for Democratic voters, according to Teachout. (Alex Rud/for New York Daily News)\n\nHochul\u2019s former colleagues refuted the charges.\n\n\"I don't know where this professor was when the New York delegation was facing relentless attacks from the Tea Party in Washington, but I do know where Kathy Hochul was \u2014 standing and fighting right alongside us,\" said Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem).\n\nThe attacks on Hochul came as Teachout's campaign appeared to gain some momentum with the endorsement of the National Organization for Women's New York State Chapter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "GLENN BLAIN", "twitter": {"description": "ALBANY \u2014 Gubernatorial hopeful Zephyr Teachout slammed Gov.
