He said the state had been \u201cengaged in the issue\u201d since 2012 and that representatives from the attorney general\u2019s office were serving on the executive committee of a coalition of states working on litigation against implant manufacturers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentatives for Johnson & Johnson did not respond to a request for comment, but company lawyers have argued in court that the implants were effective and that the company properly warned consumers about related risks.\n\nBut patient advocates say mesh manufacturers are not doing enough to warn women about the severe complications they may experience, including extreme pain, bleeding and infections.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s risks with any surgery, and that\u2019s no different with mesh surgery,\u201d said Aaron Leigh Horton, founder of the Dallas-based Mesh Warrior Foundation for the Injured . \u201cMost of the patients that I come in contact with as a patient advocate were not given the reality of those risks before surgery.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s investigation could benefit the women who have filed lawsuits because it may encourage the company to settle, said Jane Akre, who has organized patients who have had pelvic mesh implants for more than five years.\n\nIn its letter to the attorney general, the coalition said it was seeking action by his office because it has the \u201csole authority to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation\u201d into whether Johnson & Johnson violated Texas\u2019 consumer protection laws.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office has requested a vast amount of information on surgical mesh devices from Johnson & Johnson, according a document obtained by The Texas Tribune.\n\nPelvic mesh implants are used to correct pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when the reproductive organs or the bladder falls into a woman\u2019s vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. For years, surgeons have used plastic mesh to strengthen the pelvic wall and treat the condition, which is common among mothers and older women.\n\nThrough the foundation, Ms. Horton organizes support groups for women injured by their implants, including her mother, who suffered from complications related to an implant that she received in 2009 and eventually had surgically removed.\n\nTexas women have also filed dozens of individual lawsuits against mesh manufacturers in federal courts. Stephen Blackburn, a lawyer with the Dallas firm Baron & Budd, which represents several women in mesh-related lawsuits, said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that they would receive monetary compensation from manufacturers whose products had left some of them unable to sit or stand comfortably. But he said that would not be enough for women whose personal lives had been \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the implant.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140712185845, "twitter":
