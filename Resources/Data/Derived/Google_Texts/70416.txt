Washington woman dies of measles in first death from the disease since 2003

U.S. health officials revealed Thursday that a Washington woman recently died of measles â€” the first death from the disease in the U.S. since 2003. Measles is highly contagious, but it is extremely rare for a patient to die from it. Officials did not immediately say whether the woman had been vaccinated, although they said her immune system was compromised due to medications she was taking. Over the last year, measles cases have soared to an all-time high of 644 since the U.S. was declared to be measles-free in 2000.
