How bad do you think this could get?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cBut it looks like the worst-case scenario continues to play out. \u2026The problem is, the CDC just doesn\u2019t seem to be truthful with us.\u201d\n\nHannity claimed \u201ca top U.S. commander\u201d is warning that if Ebola breaks out in Central America, we\u2019ll be overrun with contagious (brown-skinned) immigrants \u201cIt\u2019s literally, Katy, bar the door,\u201d Hannity said, supposedly quoting that \u201ctop U.S. commander.\u201d\n\nEbola has not broken out in Central America, but why not fear monger just in case?\n\nMobley called the Central American scenario \u201cvery real.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cThey say it\u2019s hard to catch but you tell that to the NBC cameraman that caught it from a car.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s not known how cameraman Ashoka Mukpo caught the virus, and Mobley\u2019s suggestion \u2013 that Mukpo caught it just from sitting in a car that had once transported an Ebola carrier was misleading. From CNN.com, earlier in the day:\n\nA reporter asked Tuesday if Mukpo might have gotten the deadly virus while cleaning a car that he used to transport someone suffering with Ebola. (Dr. Phil Smith, the medical director of the biocontainment unit at the hospital treating Mukpo) said that was possible, depending on a few factors including \u201chow sick the patient was in the car.\u201d \u201cIf they just had a fever than that\u2019s very different from a patient that was actively vomiting or having diarrhea or bleeding,\u201d Smith said. \u201cContact with bodily fluids like that actually can transmit this disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for the panic, blame misinformation from the government,\u201d Mobley insisted.\n\nHannity, of course, ate it up. He piled on: \u201cThe scientist who discovered Ebola says you cannot overprotect against this. What does that mean to you?\u201d\n\nHannity left out the fact that the scientist, Peter Piot, was referring to medical personnel treating Ebola patients. As Yahoo reported, but Hannity did not:\n\nBut while Ebola poses a threat to health care workers around the world, Piot said there was \u201cno risk that I see for outbreaks\u201d in developed countries like the one that has killed 3,439 people in west Africa, according to the latest WHO toll.\n\nMobley laughably said about Piot, \u201cThat\u2019s who we need to listen to and maybe the World Health Organization as well. They said September 4th that Ebola was coming to industrialized nations. It\u2019s a matter of time and inevitable.\u201d\n\nI could not find any such statement from WHO. But I did find this article from The Washington Post, one day earlier, quoting WHO\u2019s director general, Margaret Chan, at a briefing the day before:\n\nSpeaking of the importance of a robust international response to the outbreak, Chan added, \u201cwith this international response, coordinated response, the money is coming, the technical experts are coming, so we hope to stop the transmission [of Ebola] in six to nine months.\u201d\n\nThat same day, USA Today reported, \u201cChan said people shouldn\u2019t be afraid to travel to West Africa, noting that she and her colleagues are visiting the area and remain perfectly healthy.\u201d\n\nDo you think that within 24 hours, WHO decided it was only a matter of time until some mass contagion hit the rest of the world?\n\nBy the way, this is not the first crackpot doctor Hannity has promoted in order to advance a personal agenda.
