Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and chairwoman of the National Governors Association, as she delivered the group\u2019s second State of the States address.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent budget agreement, partisan gridlock continues to prevent long-term policy solutions,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our part as governors to create jobs and address the challenges facing our states and this country. But we also believe that now it\u2019s time for our federal partners to do theirs and to take action.\u201d\n\nLast January, the governors association came to Washington to lay out a blueprint of what states needed from lawmakers. This year\u2019s list of requests, Ms. Fallin said, is almost identical.\n\n\u201cWe stand here today with essentially the same to-do list sitting before our Congress,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Fallin and the vice chairman of the association, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, delivered the address at the National Press Club a day after meeting with President Obama.\n\nThe president and his staff asked a lot of questions, Mr. Hickenlooper said, and promised to act on behalf of any governors who felt the federal government was stifling their states\u2019 efforts.\n\nIn particular, the governors called on Congress and the White House to fix what they said were flaws in the No Child Left Behind Act, to reauthorize the Water Resources Development Act, to restore the 15 percent of cash set aside for states under the Workforce Investment Act, to ensure that each state\u2019s National Guard has enough money to operate effectively, and to give states more flexibility to experiment with new solutions to nagging problems.\n\nThe rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which has dominated political discussion in Washington in recent months, received barely a mention, an indication of the disagreement among governors on the contentious subject.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cChange is hard.\u201d\n\nThe governors were also keen to point to state efforts to train workers, improve access to education, lower health care costs and address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, contrasting that to the lack of action in Congress.\n\n\u201cStates are leading, and we encourage our federal partners to work more closely with us and to take note of and use the policy ideas coming from their state partners,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cAbove all, please do not get in our way.\u201d\n\nAs the shrinking federal budget, including the automatic cuts known as sequestration, has choked off some of the money that ordinarily flows to statehouses, governors have had to reduce services and scramble to keep programs operating.\n\n\u201cIt is left to the states to chart their own path and pursue their own policies where partisan gridlock has left Washington unable to address the nation\u2019s serious problems,\u201d Ms. Fallin said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the future, the governors said, Congress should pay closer attention to the implications of budget cuts and make certain that what appear to be savings at the federal level do not merely push those costs to the states.\n\n\u201cIn my state of Oklahoma, and in states across the country, the most liberal Democrats and the most conservative Republicans can agree that moving from one crisis to another, without any long-term plan or vision, is a recipe for trouble,\u201d Ms. Fallin said. \u201cWashington\u2019s short-term thinking and continued inaction are hurting state economies, repressing job growth and, ultimately, hurting American families in every state.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that states cannot operate without federal assistance, Mr. Hickenlooper said.\n\n\u201cMore than 26 percent of most state budgets come from the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe politics of fiscal responsibility can no longer be centered around crisis and deadlines. We applaud the recent budget agreement reached by Congress. Now we need to build on that success.\u201d\n\nThe alternative, he said, is more gridlock.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to return a year from now with the same to-do list,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140115145750, "twitter": {"description": "The National Governors Association blamed political gridlock for the stymieing of numerous federal initiatives needed by the states, noting that its requests for 2013 and 2014 were nearly identical.", "title": "Governors Criticize Gridlock in Congress", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/us/politics/from-governors-to-congress-a-blunt-message-do-something.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002652155"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "ricklyman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/15/us/STATES/STATES-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/us/politics/from-governors-to-congress-a-blunt-message-do-something.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002652155", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/us/politics/from-governors-to-congress-a-blunt-message-do-something.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Governors Criticize Gridlock in Congress", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "National Governors Assn", "keywords": "Federal Budget (US),National Governors Assn,States (US),Fallin  Mary,Hickenlooper  John W,Governors (US),United States,Congress", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Rick Lyman", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Hickenlooper, John W", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By RICK LYMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The National Governors Association blamed political gridlock for the stymieing of numerous federal initiatives needed by the states, noting that its requests for 2013 and 2014 were nearly identical.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/15/us/STATES/STATES-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The National Governors Association blamed political gridlock for the stymieing of numerous federal initiatives needed by the states, noting that its requests for 2013 and 2014 were nearly identical.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/rick_lyman/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-01-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2014-01-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "16states", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140117113007, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/us/politics/from-governors-to-congress-a-blunt-message-do-something.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/15/us/STATES/STATES-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The National Governors Association blamed political gridlock for the stymieing of numerous federal initiatives needed by the states, noting that its requests for 2013 and 2014 were nearly identical.", "title": "Governors Criticize Gridlock in Congress"}, "pdate": 20140115, "des": "Governors (US)", "articleid": 100000002652155, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Governors Criticize Gridlock in Congress", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/15/us/STATES/STATES-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf91a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDespite the recent budget agreement, partisan gridlock continues to prevent long-term policy solutions,\u201d Ms. Fallin said.\n\u201cWe are now midway through the 113th Congress, and governors are frustrated,\u201d said Gov.\nMary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and chairwoman of the National Governors Association, as she delivered the group\u2019s second State of the States address.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our part as governors to create jobs and address the challenges facing our states and this country.\nThis year\u2019s list of requests, Ms. Fallin said, is almost identical."}
