(Vicky Pombo)\n\nDavid Axelrod sounds kind of relieved not to be in Washington these days.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a good time to be a visitor,\u201d said the longtime Democrat strategist said, only half-joking.\n\nAfter six years in President Obama\u2019s inner circle, Axelrod is working on his next act: TV pundit, educator and author. (Of course he\u2019s working on a book. You had to ask?) But at a dinner Sunday night he and wife Susan were honored for their work closest to their heart: Epilepsy, the disease that has afflicted their 32-year-old daughter, Lauren, since she was a baby.\n\n\u201cI would give anything to not to have had this happen to our child and to our family,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cBut there are blessings associated with a tragedy. You learn things about life, about what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nAxelrod was a young, unknown journalist in Chicago when his daughter was first diagnosed. Years later his wife co-founded CURE (Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy), and his subsequent political success gave the couple a national platform to talk about the disease \u2014 and more recently, about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on young families struggling with serious medical issues.\n\nThe dinner at the residence of Kuwaiti Ambassador Salem Al-Sabah and his wife, Rima, included VIPs such as Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Reps. John Dingell and Joe Kennedy, MPAA head Chris Dodd, businesswoman/philanthropist Connie Milstein, NBC\u2019s David Gregory, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough (who was singled out by Axe for a special shoutout), several ambassadors and Bob and Lee Woodruff, who emceed the benefit because Bob\u2019s father had epilepsy and the ABC journalist briefly suffered from seizures after his 2006 head injury in Iraq.\n\nAxelrod is now based in Chicago, dividing his time fundraising for CURE, working as a political analyst for NBC, and serving as director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics, a program to train the next generation of leaders. But no campaigns in his future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I could do in American politics that would surpass what I\u2019ve already done,\u201d he told us. \u201cThere\u2019s no client I could work with whom I have a closer or better relationship than I do with Barack Obama. And I always felt like I didn\u2019t want to do this for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nSo no chance, he said, he\u2019ll dive back into the 2016 fray: \u201cNo no no. Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nAnd no more mustache. Axelrod famously shaved off his signature fringe last December \u2014 on live television \u2014 after MSNBC host Joe Scarborough raised $1 million for epilepsy research.\n\n\u201cI got 10 steps away from shaving it off and my wife said to me, \u2018I always hated that thing anyway,\u2019 \u201d he told us. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019ve been married for 33 years. You could have said something.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do anything. But now that it\u2019s off, leave it off.\u2019 So I\u2019m going to leave it off.\u201d\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\nEarlier: Reliable Source: David Axelrod on his \u2018kind of strange\u2019 mustache shave, raising money for epilepsy research\n\nMore Reliable Source:\n\nHey, isn\u2019t that . . . ?: Barbra Streisand and James Brolin\n\nThe Scene: Washington Ballet\u2019s \u2018Unmask the Night\u2019 fundraiser\n\nLove, etc.: Chris Kirkpatrick gets married, results in another elusive \u2018N SYNC reunion\n\nKanye West, Kim Kardashian sue YouTube founder for leaked proposal footage\n\nOprah holds a yard sale, raises $600,000", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democrat strategist sounds kind of relieved not to be in Washington these days.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Democrat strategist sounds kind of relieved not to be in Washington these days.", "title": "David Axelrod\u2019s post-D.C. life: TV, a book, future leaders and epilepsy research", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2013/11/05/david-axelrod/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/files/2013/11/DSC_5825_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2013/11/05/david-axelrod/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "david axelrod, susan axelrod, Kuwait\u2019s Ambassador Salem Al-Sabah, Salem Al-Sabah, david axelrod; david axelrod epilepsy; david axelrod obama; david axelrod epilepsy charity; david and susan axelrod; david axelrod daughter,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "david axelrod, susan axelrod, Kuwait\u2019s Ambassador Salem Al-Sabah, Salem Al-Sabah, david axelrod; david axelrod epilepsy; david axelrod obama; david axelrod epilepsy charity; david and susan axelrod; david axelrod daughter,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5496\"", "article_summary": "Susan Axelrod, Kuwait\u2019s Ambassador Salem Al-Sabah, and David Axelrod during a dinner at the Kuwat embassy.\nAfter six years in President Obama\u2019s inner circle, Axelrod is working on his next act: TV pundit, educator and author.\nAxelrod famously shaved off his signature fringe last December \u2014 on live television \u2014 after MSNBC host Joe Scarborough raised $1 million for epilepsy research.\nYou learn things about life, about what\u2019s important.\u201dAxelrod was a young, unknown journalist in Chicago when his daughter was first diagnosed.\n\u201cIt seems like a good time to be a visitor,\u201d said the longtime Democrat strategist said, only half-joking."}
