Although the sins are not part of any religious texts, including the Christian bible, they are very closely related and regarded as heresy. Heresy is speaking about a belief or opinion that does not agree with the \u201cofficial\u201d belief or opinion of a particular group. Republicans crusade to penalize Americans as heretics for criticizing the religious right for unconstitutionally forcing aberrant Christian beliefs on the entire population, and like condemning Christians for ramming their religion down Americans\u2019 throats, criticizing Republicans\u2019 true god in public is a mortal sin. No, it is not GOP man-god Ronald Reagan; it is about criticizing their two-headed John Birch man-god and financial backers the Koch brothers.\n\nAn inconvenient truth is causing trouble by speaking about something that agrees with the facts or in accordance with the actual state of affairs, and is typically so painfully accurate that the only recourse is calling truth lies or resorting to a typically male response to a woman speaking and calling them crazy. Over the past few weeks, one politician has told the unbridled truth about the Kochs, and Republicans considered Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s Koch criticism religious heresy and, lacking truth or facts to refute Senator Reid\u2019s assertions, they followed the patriarchal approach to women and accused Reid of lying and claimed he is mentally ill and off his medication. It is apparent that Reid hit a raw nerve with Republicans because they made absurd claims to defend their lying John Birch man-god and resorted to personal attacks to accuse Harry Reid of heresy. Republicans are apoplectic over Reid committing the mortal sin of telling the truth about the Koch brothers, accusing Republicans of being addicted to Koch, and labeling the Kochs un-American; something every American familiar with the John Birch acolytes knows is true.\n\nRepublicans went on the offensive to defend the Koch gods and were joined by Charles Koch who wrote a lie-filled op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming he championed environmental causes and better opportunities for Americans and accused critics of \u201cengaging in character assassination instead of encouraging free and open debate.\u201d He said \u201ccollectivists strive to discredit and intimidate opponents\u201d that lent credence to the belief Reid, and Senator Bernie Sanders, are intimidating the rich and powerful Koch brothers. Koch\u2019s \u201cwoe is me\u201d op-ed drew praise from the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Chair Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) whose devotion to Charles Koch led him to waste taxpayer money and time in the Senate on Thursday to read the GOP man-god\u2019s op-ed into the congressional record. That is right. Moran was so distressed over Reid\u2019s truthful comments about Kochs he inserted Charles\u2019 self-promotion image piece into our nation\u2019s permanent legislative record as proof the Kochs own and operate the Republican Party. It is highly likely Senate Republicans were astonished Reid had the temerity to condemn the preponderance of Koch\u2019s \u201cphony\u201d Obamacare horror stories as patently \u201cuntrue.\u201d A plain-talking collectivist would have called them dirty filthy lies, but Harry Reid is no ordinary collectivist and when he speaks quietly, people listen, and Republicans listened to the truth about the Kochs.\n\nFor his part, Harry Reid exhibited his boxer mindset and was unfazed by the toddler-punches Republicans threw at him and said, \u201cMost people here are familiar with the Koch brothers. I\u2019ve helped make them a little more infamous or famous, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done that. These two men are a pair of shadowy billionaires spending millions of dollars to rig our political system. And who does it help? Them.\u201d Unlike Republicans, Reid\u2019s assertions are founded in truth according to the Washington Post which shows the Koch\u2019s political networks spent at least $407 million in the 2012 elections alone; there is no telling how much dark money they spent to benefit themselves. Since conservatives are unable to refute Reid\u2019s inconvenient truth about their money man-gods, they resorted to personal attacks and recruited some of their truly best and brightest Koch sycophants to assail the Senate Majority Leader.\n\nFor example, Sharron \u201c2nd Amendment remedy\u201d Angle, said Thursday that, \u201cThere\u2019s something going on with Harry Reid\u2019s mental state and we need to really be concerned about it.\u201d Mike \u201clying preacher-man\u201d Huckabee said, \u201cPoor Harry Reid. Either he is off his meds and he clearly needs some assistance immediately \u2014 he needs to be rushed to an emergency room \u2014 or the man is just brazenly unable to tell the truth.\u201d Congressional representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think Mormons used drugs. \u2026 I think the longer you stay in political office, the more detached you become from reality.\u201d\n\nFox Republicans joined Kochs\u2019 defense team with Steve Doocy saying, \u201cIt does look like Harry Reid is a very powerful guy who is either \u2014 I read one blog that said he\u2019s either having a nervous breakdown or he\u2019s simply somebody who lies about lies.\u201d Fox News contributor Bo Dietl took Harry Reid\u2019s rejection of Koch\u2019s godhead very personal and said, \u201cLook at that moron there. That guy from Nevada. Uhhhlll. What\u2019s his name there. \u2026 Harry Reid is brain dead. He isn\u2019t well. You know what? It\u2019s time. He\u2019s got to be wearing Depends the way he talks because he doesn\u2019t remember when he went to the bathroom last.\u201d\n\nSo, because Harry Reid refuses to worship at the Koch altar and tells the truth about the John Birch corporate fascists he is mentally ill and lying? Christian fundamentalists make the same claims about secular humanists because they fail to acquiesce to the religious rights\u2019 demand all Americans obey their abbero-christian edicts, and condemn them as liars because they use scientific facts and empirical data to support their opinions as a matter of course. It is no exaggeration that Republicans are devoutly religious in their support of the Kochs and their all-out personal attacks on Harry Reid reek of an Inquisitor defaming a heretic. Obviously, the Kochs are intimidated that Democrats are violating the GOP\u2019s unwritten law that their two-headed god shall not be questioned or criticized and it is precisely the same Republican reaction to Americans criticizing religious right fascists for ramming their Christo-fascist edicts down everyone\u2019s throats.\n\nRepublicans likely gave their man-god Charles Koch advice to resort to the religious rights\u2019 persecution complex defense, and when that failed to garner public support, they resorted to a typical patriarchal response to a woman and claimed Harry Reid is mentally ill for daring to tell the truth about the poor beleaguered Kochs. Charles Koch complained that \u201cinstead of encouraging free and open debate, collectivists strive to discredit and intimidate opponents. They engage in character assassination,\u201d and it is the same assertion Republicans make about President Obama and Democrats and yet they refuse to debate because the facts prove they are liars in the same vein as their two-headed god the Koch brothers. If Charles Koch or Republicans truly want a \u201cfree and open debate\u201d about the Koch brothers, then let them debate Harry Reid, or this collectivist, in public any time because they will be discredited and their lying fascist characters will be revealed as compulsive pathological liars; a true mental illness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For his part, Harry Reid exhibited his boxer mindset and was unfazed by the toddler-punches Republicans threw at him and said, \"Most people here are familiar with the Koch brothers.
