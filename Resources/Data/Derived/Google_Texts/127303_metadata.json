They understood that personal diaries are to cellphones as a horseback ride is to a flight to the moon, and so told the police not to search cellphones, after making an arrest, without a warrant. They didn\u2019t let Aereo get away with its fairly ludicrous argument that equipping you with a personal antenna, through which you can then watch all the TV shows you want for as little as $8 a month, doesn\u2019t involve ripping off the copyright of those shows from the cable and broadcast networks that produced them. In both cases, the justices who wrote the majority opinions (Roberts and Breyer, respectively) tossed off references to \u201cthe cloud,\u201d and it was absolutely clear they weren\u2019t talking about the weather.\n\nEmily Bazelon Emily Bazelon is a staff writer at the New York Times Magazine and the author of Sticks and Stones.\n\nGrandchildren everywhere, heads up: The next time your elderly relatives can\u2019t figure out how to Google the answer to the question they\u2019re asking you, tell them that if the Supreme Court can understand the basics of new (or not so new) technology, they can, too.\n\nThis is especially a relief since, as you say, Eric, the court got dinged for its grasp of molecular biology last year. Also because at argument in the Aereo case, Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to think that HBO was free over the airwaves. He didn\u2019t make that mistake today in dissenting from the ruling against Aereo. Instead, he had a war of analogies with Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the majority opinion. At issue in this case is whether Aereo \u201cperforms a work publicly when it \u2018transmit[s] \u2026 a performance \u2026 of the work \u2026 to the public.\u2019 \u201d That\u2019s hardly the formulation Aereo would use in zooming broadcasts to you over tiny personal antennae (with a delay of mere seconds), but it\u2019s the words the court was stuck with because that\u2019s what Congress said is protected by copyright infringement law back in 1976. Breyer (who has five other justices on his side) compared Aereo to a car dealership that provides cars to the public, made up of buyers \u201cwho lack a pre-existing relationship to the cars.\u201d Similarly, he continued, \u201can entity like Aereo that transmits to large numbers of paying subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the works\u201d is serving the public\u2014or, in the words of the 1976 law, performing a work publicly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNo, no, Scalia says (speaking also for Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito). Breyer\u2019s way will \u201csow confusion for years to come,\u201d because performing to the public, in transmitting all those shows, isn\u2019t what Aereo is doing at all. Scalia thinks Breyer is a clueless grandpa. His entry in the analogy battle is that Aereo is a copy shop that gives its customers a library card. I\u2019ve never heard of such a copy shop, and I don\u2019t think Kinko\u2019s will adopt this model anytime soon. Especially since I just Googled Kinko\u2019s and found out it no longer exists. But to give Scalia his due: The idea is that Aereo, like a copy shop, offers patrons access to a system that \u201clies dormant until a subscriber activates it.\u201d It\u2019s the subscriber who pushes the button that transmits the shows he wants to watch. And so it\u2019s the subscriber, if anyone, who \u201cperforms\u201d the copyrighted work. Aereo is passive and blameless.\n\nBreyer tries so hard to argue that he is not screwing up cloud computing, or cloud storage, or video on demand, or whatever other emerging technology the court doesn\u2019t want to be accused of standing in the way of. He is not the clueless grandpa! \u201cWe have not considered whether the public performance right is infringed when the user of a service pays primarily for something other than the transmission of copyrighted works, such as the remote storage of content,\u201d he writes. Other things he is not saying violate copyright: DVRs, mailing DVDs, and transmitting content to people in your family or social circle.\n\nBut this only makes Scalia madder. The majority has blown it precisely by trying to go narrow. It has created a rule against the free transmission of copyrighted content by any \u201ccable-TV-lookalike\u201d without making it clear what it takes to be a look-alike. The court has left the industry with \u201cnothing but th\u2019 ol\u2019 totality-of-the-circumstances test,\u201d and that means it will \u201ctake years, perhaps decades\u201d to know which companies are crossing the line like Aereo and which are on the safe side. Here\u2019s Scalia\u2019s parting blow: He says that in effectively shutting down Aereo, Breyer has made a mistake as bad as blocking the VCR would have been 30 years ago.\n\nIs Scalia right? I\u2019m no tech expert myself, but Aereo\u2019s business model sounds like merry, clever theft to me. And in general, I think the court is safer taking the narrow, case-by-case approach Breyer advocates here than announcing an abstract rule that really could leave inventors and entrepreneurs stuck or scrambling. But what do you guys think?\n\nThe 10th Circuit stayed its ruling to give the opponents of gay marriage a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court. Rick Hasen and plenty of other people think this means gay marriage is headed back to the justices as early as next term. So far, though, there\u2019s no split over gay marriage in the lower courts since the DOMA ruling. Anyone want to subscribe to my (minority) theory that gay marriage could become the law of the land without another word from the high court? Gay marriage has so much righteous momentum behind it\u2014maybe it doesn\u2019t need another push from Kennedy. Though surely, with a record of 20\u20130 this year in the lower courts, he will be ready to give it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Scalia and Breyer battle it out to see who is the least clueless grandpa.", "fb-share": "Scalia and Breyer Battle It Out to See Who Is the Least Clueless Grandpa", "sailthru.author": "Emily Bazelon", "description": "The Supreme Court scored cool points for old people today.
