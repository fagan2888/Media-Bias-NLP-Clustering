Kraushaar also noted that Kasich \u201ccould be well-positioned to win a second term by racking up unusually high support from traditionally Democratic constituencies.\u201d\n\nThis is the case for the same reason that John Kasich is suddenly the favorite Republican of many media elites.\n\n\u201cFirst, he did an end run around his state\u2019s Legislature \u2014 controlled by his own party \u2014 to proceed with the federally funded expansion of Medicaid that is an important piece of Obamacare,\u201d Paul Krugman explained in an October 2013 New York Times column.\n\nKrugman\u2019s editorial and a host of others like it were prompted by a Kasich quote printed days earlier in a Times story with the headline, \u201cOhio Governor Defies G.O.P. With Defense of Social Safety Net.\u201d\n\nJohn Kasich \u201coccasionally sounds more like an heir to Lyndon B. Johnson than to Ronald Reagan,\u201d reporter Trip Gabriel opined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor,\u201d Kasich told The Gray Lady. \u201cThat if you\u2019re poor, somehow you\u2019re shiftless and lazy.\u201d\n\nFar from a one-off, Kasich\u2019s remark was consistent with months of prickly reactions from the governor to critics of his decision to use Obamacare money for a radical redefinition of Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program. For the press, the boilerplate \u201cwar on the poor\u201d line was a story by virtue of who said it.\n\nGaining Popularity by Growing Government Running as a fiscal hawk against Democrat Ted Strickland, under whom Ohio lost almost 375,000 jobs, Kasich was narrowly elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave.\n\nKasich was known for his work balancing the federal budget as House Budget Committee chairman in the 90s, and during the campaign he told small-government activists, \u201cI was in the Tea Party before there was a Tea Party.\u201d\n\nSecretive \u201cjob creation\u201d agency JobsOhio notwithstanding, Kasich\u2019s governorship was off to a good start \u2013 including a phase-out of Ohio\u2019s estate tax \u2013 until a state senator submitted a 300-page public employee union reform bill in early 2011.\n\nWith his approval rating in the 30s after Big Labor\u2019s subsequent $40 million smear campaign against empowering taxpayers, Kasich decided that further empowering government was the way to win back swing voters\u2019 support. Ohio\u2019s press, led by Kasich donor and Columbus Dispatch publisher John Wolfe, agreed.\n\n\u201cIn pursuing an expansion of Medicaid under the federal health-care overhaul, Gov. John Kasich wisely is putting pragmatism before party and ideology,\u201d the Dispatch editorial board wrote the week after Kasich\u2019s plan to enact the Obamacare expansion was unveiled.\n\n\u201cKasich offers some very smart, humane ideas that will both improve the lot of workaday Ohioans and make it harder for Democratic critics to caricature him,\u201d wrote the Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s editors.\n\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of a great society is caring for the less fortunate,\u201d the Cincinnati Enquirer editors wrote. \u201cExpanding Medicaid can improve the lives of nearly a million people in Ohio and Kentucky alone and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t damage state budgets.\u201d\n\nKasich, who had warned on the 2010 campaign trail that Medicaid expansion would \u201cstick states with large and unsustainable costs,\u201d proceeded to push the expansion as the only way to help heroin addicts and the mentally ill.\n\nReferencing his Christian faith and the teachings of \u201cthe Good Book,\u201d Kasich made frequent public attempts to shame the Ohio General Assembly into expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cFor those that live in the shadows of life, those who are the least among us, I will not accept the fact that the most vulnerable in our state should be ignored,\u201d Kasich said during a lengthy portion of his 2013 State of the State address devoted to the Obamacare expansion.\n\nDispatch Senior Editor Joe Hallett lamented that \u201cthe justifiable expansion of Medicaid in Kasich\u2019s budget is in jeopardy, because GOP lawmakers fear it will invite primary-election challenges from tea partiers who seem bent on society\u2019s regression.\u201d\n\nWith legislators still refusing to expand Medicaid months later, the governor warned, \u201cwhen you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not gonna ask you much about what you did about keeping government small, but he\u2019s going to ask you what you did for the poor.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s suggestion that opposing him would have eternal consequences didn\u2019t concern the press, which again leapt to attack Kasich\u2019s critics.\n\n\u201cEven Kasich\u2019s faith irks the off-the-chart right,\u201d Plain Dealer editor and Ohio University journalism professor Thomas Suddes sneered.\n\n\u201cAn unapologetic conservative is fighting the tea party and his own Republican legislature because he thinks the less privileged people of Ohio deserve health coverage,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s E.J. Dionne swooned.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes expressed enthusiasm that Kasich was \u201cactually standing up against the right-wing elements in Ohio because he believes it\u2019s wrong and inexcusable to make more than 270,000 poor Ohioans go without health coverage for no reason other than spite.\u201d\n\nWhile the press celebrated Gov. Kasich\u2019s generosity, Kasich lied about how his Medicaid expansion would be paid for.\n\nWarning that \u201cOhio\u2019s\u201d share of promised Obamacare money would go to other states if Ohio rejected the expansion, Kasich said Medicaid expansion would simply \u201cbring back Ohio\u2019s tax dollars\u201d \u2013 and insisted the expansion had nothing to do with Obamacare.\n\nInstead of challenging the governor\u2019s assurances that his Medicaid expansion would cost taxpayers nothing, reporters repeated Kasich\u2019s lies time and again and ignored anyone who tried to correct them.\n\n\u201cOpposition to Medicaid expansion is purely ideological,\u201d The Columbus Dispatch editorial board declared last April.\n\n\u201cRepublican lawmakers can offer all the excuses they want for their feckless obstructionism in resisting Medicaid expansion,\u201d the Toledo Blade editors asserted the following month. \u201cBut they can\u2019t argue persuasively that they\u2019re acting in the best interests of the state and its taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe Buckeye Institute, Opportunity Ohio, Cato Institute, Foundation for Government Accountability, Heritage Foundation, and others would beg to differ.\n\nThese are all facts that were explained to the legislature, which Kasich ultimately circumvented for the Obamacare expansion, and to the press, which cheered Kasich on.\n\nStill a Conservative? With the press lauding his devotion to bigger government, how is John Kasich still widely regarded as a conservative?\n\nFirst and foremost, the Kasich Administration controls the Ohio Republican Party. Outsiders who rely on the state GOP for news from Ohio are getting their information from an organization whose sole purpose is the advancement of John Kasich\u2019s political career.\n\nSecond, it helps that Kasich was a Fox News host for several years after leaving Congress in 2001. The governor appears on Fox often, and the rare challenging questions he faces always seem to be sandwiched between praise for his strong conservative record.\n\nKrugman, Dionne, MSNBC hosts, and other national media figures recognize the importance of Kasich\u2019s not-so-limited approach to limited government, but one of Ohio\u2019s top political reporters needed a nudge to see the story angle.\n\nIn a recent video teasing a 5-part \u201cdeep dive\u201d into Kasich\u2019s career, Plain Dealer reporter Henry Gomez proudly acknowledged that the governor encouraged him to write the series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually funny \u2013 I got the idea from Governor Kasich,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cI was at this event in January that the Associated Press hosts in Columbus and I asked him a question: \u2018How are you dealing with criticism from the conservatives in your party who say you\u2019re too moderate?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAs anybody who\u2019s listened to John Kasich give a speech knows, he likes to focus in on one person as if it\u2019s only him and the other person in the room,\u201d Gomez continued. \u201cHe kept personalizing his response to me, saying, \u2018Well, Henry, as you know,\u2019 and \u2018Henry, as you know\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then a few weeks later when I met with him at the Plain Dealer for an endorsement interview, he was surprised that nobody had wrote more about his answer to the question, which is, he feels he has a right to shape what a conservative philosophy is, and really that he\u2019s trying to sort of rewrite the book on modern conservatism.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s comments were dissected the day after he made them in a story shared by hundreds of readers at Media Trackers and thousands more at RedState, but old-media forays into conservative philosophy rarely allot space for observations from conservatives.\n\n\u201cSo, I did sort of feel like it was a journey that I took along with Kasich,\u201d Gomez concluded. \u201cHe sort of planted that seed in my head, \u2018Why is nobody writing more about what I\u2019m trying to do here?\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 19 May 2014 07:18:31 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "John Kasich has found popularity with the legacy press the only way a Republican can, by expanding government.", "title": "Why John Kasich is the Media's Favorite Republican Governor", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/John-Kasich.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-21T07:35:37+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/05/19/the-medias-favorite-republican-governor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "John Kasich has found popularity with the legacy press the only way a Republican can, by expanding government.", "title": "Why John Kasich is the Media's Favorite Republican Governor", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/John-Kasich.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Henry Gomez,John Kasich,Medicaid,National Journal,New York Times,Ted Strickland", "published_time": "2014-05-19T07:18:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-21T07:35:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "John Kasich has found popularity with the legacy press the only way a Republican can, by expanding government."}, "article_summary": "Ohio Governor John Kasich has found popularity with the legacy press the only way a Republican can, by expanding government and questioning the morals of anyone who does not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually funny \u2013 I got the idea from Governor Kasich,\u201d Gomez said.\nKraushaar also noted that Kasich \u201ccould be well-positioned to win a second term by racking up unusually high support from traditionally Democratic constituencies.\u201dThis is the case for the same reason that John Kasich is suddenly the favorite Republican of many media elites.\nWith the press lauding his devotion to bigger government, how is John Kasich still widely regarded as a conservative?\n\u201cRepublican lawmakers can offer all the excuses they want for their feckless obstructionism in resisting Medicaid expansion,\u201d the Toledo Blade editors asserted the following month."}
