Obama is set to make 64-year history for worse back to back midterm loss ever.\n\nAccording to The Washington Times on Nov. 2 Obama is now inching up on Harry Truman\u2019s midterm loss record, which has maintained the top spot in history for the most midterm losses back to back for the past 64 years.\n\nThe State website is also reporting that Obama is set to do what no other president was able to do in the past 50 years and that is to have \u201ctwo horrible, terrible, awful midterm elections in a row.\u201d It is more than likely that Obama will walk away with the legacy of the worst midterm loss of any two-term President since Harry Truman, who also had a less than stellar outcome for his Democratic Party.\n\nTruman\u2019s record loss for his back to back midterms was 83 House seats. He lost 55 seats in 1946 and the remaining 28 seats out of the 83 were gone in the election of 1950. Even the bookmakers are getting in on the turmoil of the U.S. political field today.\n\nThe Vegas odds makers are having a field day with the midterm election with a GOP \u201clandslide\u201d predicted in Tuesday\u2019s mid-term elections. Gambling 911 reports that Vegas odds maker, who is also the former Libertarian VP candidate, Wayne Allyn Root predicts a \u201cblood bath\u201d among the Democrats during Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nRoot predicted the Republicans would win 50 to 60 Congressional seats in the 2010 midterms and the experts said he \u201cwas out of his mind.\u201d The GOP won 63 seats. The Times poll suggests Tuesday\u2019s results will be even worse than were seen in 2010 for the Democratic House seats. According to Root the landslide will be very similar to the 2010 midterm outcome.\n\nIn 2010 the GOP had the biggest landslide in almost a century and that was based on Obamacare. This midterm election is based on \u201cthe fear of the healthcare scare of our lifetime-Ebola,\u201d said Root. When the Democrats are even trailing badly in Massachusetts, which is a staunch Democratic state, that says a lot about the midterm projections.\n\nMany Democrats are not wanting Obama\u2019s help on the campaign trail. Root said that \u201cDemocratic candidates are making believe that Obama never existed. Root goes on to say:\n\n\u201cNow those same Democrats\u2026Obama's brothers and sisters in socialist policy\u2026are on the run from Obama like he\u2019s contagious. The medical term might be \"loser's disease.\" They don\u2019t want Obama anywhere near them. Not on the stage with them. Not in a photo. Not in the same city. Not in the same state. Obama is as toxic as Ebola\u2026to Democrats!\u201d\n\nRoot believes that Obama\u2019s refusal to seal the borders when it comes to Ebola and his naming of an \u201cEbola Czar\u201d who knows nothing about healthcare \"sealed the deal and his legacy.\u201d After sending 4000 U.S. military troops into the Ebola-saturated areas in West Africa to \u201cface the invisible enemy,\u201d people see Obama\u2019s overall approach to Ebola as \u201cincompetence.\u201d \u201cThis is madness,\u201d said Root.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Obama has been busy attempting to create a legacy it looks as if a legacy has been creating itself behind the scenes without much work on his part.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-set-to-hatch-grim-midterm-legacy-vegas-oddsmaker-predicts-gop-landslide", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/92/72/92729c82d21c76df776f261c41ba5a7f.jpg?itok=fx-6Nfc3", "type": "article", "title": "Obama set to hatch grim midterm legacy: Vegas oddsmaker predicts GOP landslide"}, "twitter": {"description": "While Obama has been busy attempting to create a legacy it looks as if a legacy has been creating itself behind the scenes without much work on his part.", "creator": "@roz124", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/92/72/92729c82d21c76df776f261c41ba5a7f.jpg?itok=fx-6Nfc3", "title": "Obama set to hatch grim midterm legacy: Vegas oddsmaker predicts GOP landslide", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-11-02T17:27:27-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Top News, Midterm Election predictions, GOP landslide, Democrats, Republicans, Obama legacy", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-02T17:27"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e0a\"", "article_summary": "The Vegas odds makers are having a field day with the midterm election with a GOP \u201clandslide\u201d predicted in Tuesday\u2019s mid-term elections.\nObama is set to make 64-year history for worse back to back midterm loss ever.\nAccording to Root the landslide will be very similar to the 2010 midterm outcome.\nWhen the Democrats are even trailing badly in Massachusetts, which is a staunch Democratic state, that says a lot about the midterm projections.\nGambling 911 reports that Vegas odds maker, who is also the former Libertarian VP candidate, Wayne Allyn Root predicts a \u201cblood bath\u201d among the Democrats during Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections."}
