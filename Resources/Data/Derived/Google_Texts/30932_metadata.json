Some manhole covers had methane concentrations as high as 500,00 parts per million of natural gas \u2013 about 10 times greater than the threshold at which explosions can occur.\n\nFour months after phoning in the leaks to the city authorities, the research team returned and found that nine were still emitting dangerous levels of methane.\n\nNationally, natural gas pipelines failures causes an average 17 fatalities, 68 injuries, and US$133 million in property damage annually, according to the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\n\nThe United States is crisscrossed with more than 2.5 million miles of fuel pipelines, or enough to circle the earth about 100 times. U. S. regulators may step up inspections and increase the industry\u2019s maintenance costs, said Mark Easterbrook, a pipeline analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Dallas.\n\n\u201cMuch of the underground infrastructure in the U.S., which is also water and sewer pipes, has been in use for more than 50 years and needs to be evaluated and where needed, replaced,\u201d said Blaine Leonard, president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. \u201cJust because it\u2019s old doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s in bad shape, but the risk is certainly increased.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hidden infrastructure and we can\u2019t be complacent about it. so much of our economy and quality of life depends on it,\u201d Leonard added.\n\nIncidents with pipelines that carry natural, gas, gasoline, and crude oil can be inspected using devises called pigs that run through sections of pipe, deploying sensors and cameras to detect cracks, corrosion and other defects from the interior. Companies can also pump high pressure to test integrity, or dig up sections for visual inspections.\n\n\u201cThe lack of computerized records for much of the U.S. pipeline network complicates efforts,\u201d said Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust. \u201cOlder pipelines are much more at risk because we didn\u2019t have the protective technology that we have now,\u201d adding, \u201cOld pipes had either no corrosion protection or were wrapped with material that looked like tar paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuptures of natural gas lines are rare\u201d, said Richard Kuprewicz, president of Accufacts Inc., a pipeline-safety company. Causes of ruptures can include manufacturing defects that worsen over time, work crews that hit a pipe while digging, or corrosion.\n\nIn addition to the explosive hazard, methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and the leaked gas is a loss of $3 billion in unaccounted natural gas each year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This past Thursday, it was reported that more than 5,800 gas leaks were found in Washington, DC.
