Rush to the emergency room?\n\nA new kind of health insurance company may have the answer.\n\nMeet Oscar (HiOscar.com), a SoHo-based health insurance startup that\u2019s looking to disrupt the industry with a user-friendly website, a focus on guiding patients through the health care system and extra perks \u2014 including 24/7 access to board-certified doctors via the telephone.\n\n\u201cOur ambitions were to build an insurance company we would want for ourselves,\u201d Oscar co-founder Joshua Kushner told the Daily News.\n\nOscar is one of three new insurance companies that launched on New York\u2019s health insurance exchange on Oct. 1.\n\nThe other two are Health Republic Insurance of New York, the state\u2019s only \u201cco-op\u201d \u2014 the consumer-operated and oriented plan has 70,000 doctors and 132 hospital in its network \u2014 and North Shore-LIJ CareConnect Insurance, a provider-owned insurance company built around the North Shore\u2013LIJ Health System, its physicians and affiliated providers.\n\nOscar\u2019s founders come from the tech world and are using their technology background to change the experience of buying health insurance and managing health services.\n\nThe company is the brainchild of Kushner, 29, the son of New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner and a tech venture capitalist whose company Thrive Capital has invested in Instagram and MakerBot; Kevin Nazemi, 32, former director of customer relationship management at Microsoft; and Mario Schlosser, 35, who co-founded social gaming company Vostu with Kushner when they were students at Harvard.\n\nKushner, whose brother is New York Observer owner Jared Kushner \u2014 the company is named after their late grandfather, Oscar \u2014 said he got the idea for going into the insurance business one day after opening his insurance bill.\n\n\u201cI realized I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my benefits, I didn\u2019t know how to file a claim.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Oscar\u2019s goal is to function like the \u201cdoctor in the family,\u201d Schlosser said.\n\nUsing technology, Oscar has taken the process of \u201cfinding a doctor, telling you what is wrong, getting results, getting reminders, getting bills \u2014 and (doing) it in a more human way,\u201d he added.\n\nNot feeling well? An Oscar customer can log in and tell Oscar what\u2019s wrong, much like starting a Google search.\n\nThe site will provide a list of health care providers that match the patient\u2019s needs \u2014 with estimated costs and maps. Patients can see their entire medical history on the site.\n\nThere are extras, too: the free phone access to physicians, free generic drugs and three free doctor visits per year.\n\nTwo years in the making, the insurance startup has raised $55 million \u2014 investors include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel \u2014 to fund operations and claims.\n\nOscar operates in nine New York State counties, including the five boroughs and Long Island. There are 40,000 physicians in its network and 73 hospitals.\n\nMonthly premiums, which range from $218 for a catastrophic plan to $566 for a platinum plan, generally rank among the bottom third of plans offered on NY State of Health, the company says.\n\nWhether Oscar takes off remains to be seen. The insurer is not revealing its enrollment numbers yet, but Kushner said he was \u201cextremely satisfied with the traction.\u201d\n\nOne hurdle is name recognition, an important factor in the health field.\n\n\u201cConsumers want to go with what they are familiar with,\u201d said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health.\n\nOscar\u2019s pushing hard, running tongue-in-cheek ads featuring cartoon characters.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start this company because we love health insurance,\u201d reads one of them. \u201cQuite the opposite, in fact.\u201d\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO OBAMACARE: PICKING A PLAN DEPENDS ON OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS \u2014 NOT JUST PREMIUMS\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO OBAMACARE: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO OBAMACARE: YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR SEES VALUE OF NEW YORK\u2019S INSURANCE MARKETPLACE FIRSTHAND\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO OBAMACARE: HOW TO SIZE UP HEALTH PLANS WITH THE ONLINE EXCHANGE\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO OBAMACARE: MYTHS ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO OBAMACARE: SEVEN THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NEW YORK STATE OF HEALTH AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\npfurman@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "PHYLLIS FURMAN", "twitter": {"description": "Every parent has been through it: Your kid wakes up crying in the middle of the night and has a high fever.\r\n\r\n      Should you call the pediatrician\u2019s answering service?
