The tabloid snitch \u2014 his publicist\u2019s assistant, perhaps? \u2014 recounted the glorious scene for the Daily News, declaring, \u201che is my hero.\u201d\n\nIf DiCaprio is a hero for his stunt, he is a hero not made for the old glamour days of the Rat Pack but for the sensitive/raunchy Judd Apatow-produced here-and-now. He has the yen for bromance and puppyish need for attention that characterize many of Apatow\u2019s heroes, including Pete of \u201cKnocked Up\u201d and \u201cThis Is 40\u2033 (we can\u2019t forget how DiCaprio once captained that unofficial gaggle of B-list celebs known as the Pussy Posse), and he mixes it with the admirable grit of Pete\u2019s wife, Debbie, who hits the clubs with a younger crowd when she\u2019s feeling a little old and neglected. Like Tom in \u201cThe Five-Year Engagement,\u201d he might have to undergo some serious personal transformation before he\u2019s able to build a stable relationship, but we believe he\u2019ll get there. And the Twenty Girls Plan sounds like it could have been orchestrated by \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u2019s\u201d Aldous Snow, the raunchy overtones softened by its absurdity and wit.\n\nThe story of the talented rich guy who plays the field because he can isn\u2019t particularly unique. Never settle, Leo! But we can\u2019t get enough of this 40-year-old version of DiCaprio, who parades almost two dozen women out of a South Beach nightclub like those guys in the Christmas car commercials presenting the Lexus in the driveway, all wrapped up in a big, red bow, ready to be envied by the neighbors. There\u2019s an undeniable sense of showmanship at work here that helps his fellow aging Gen X-ers, especially those of us who are now married or sharing custody or saving up for kids, live vicariously through his unabashed singleton glamour. As long as he still has it, there remains the faint possibility that we might stumble upon it, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We can't let go of the DiCaprio of our youth, but thankfully, neither can he", "title": "This is Leo at 40: How Leonardo DiCaprio became a Judd Apatow character", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We can't let go of the DiCaprio of our youth, but thankfully, neither can he", "title": "This is Leo at 40: How Leonardo DiCaprio became a Judd Apatow character", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/this_is_leo_at_40_how_leonardo_dicaprio_became_a_judd_apatow_character/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/leonardo_dicaprio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We can't let go of the DiCaprio of our youth, but thankfully, neither can he", "title": "This is Leo at 40: How Leonardo DiCaprio became a Judd Apatow character", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/leonardo_dicaprio.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erin Keane", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, judd apatow, Leonardo DiCaprio", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8769\"", "article_summary": "As long as he still has it, there remains the faint possibility that we might stumble upon it, too.\nThe story of the talented rich guy who plays the field because he can isn\u2019t particularly unique.\nTopics: judd apatow, Leonardo DiCaprio, Entertainment NewsLeonardo DiCaprio turned 40 last month, but he performed for the world last weekend that he\u2019s still ready for any action when, like a stunt out of \u201cThis Is 40: Celebrity Edition,\u201d he reportedly emptied the VIP section of a Miami club of women, taking 20 female guests home with him during an Art Basel party weekend.\n\u2014 recounted the glorious scene for the Daily News, declaring, \u201che is my hero.\u201dIf DiCaprio is a hero for his stunt, he is a hero not made for the old glamour days of the Rat Pack but for the sensitive/raunchy Judd Apatow-produced here-and-now.\nAnd the Twenty Girls Plan sounds like it could have been orchestrated by \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u2019s\u201d Aldous Snow, the raunchy overtones softened by its absurdity and wit."}
