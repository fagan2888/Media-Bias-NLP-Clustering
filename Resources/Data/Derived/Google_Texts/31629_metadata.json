He also was charged with bribery, accused of offering a Noble police officer $50,000 to let him go after his late afternoon arrest on U.S. 77, the main drag in the Cleveland County town.\n\nHobson currently is facing three separate felonies \u2014 two for driving under the influence and one for attempting to bribe a police officer \u2014 although those charges are pending in Cleveland County District Court. The former lawmaker has a 9 p.m. nightly curfew and court documents indicate that he is electronically monitored, part of a stringent pretrial release program.\n\nWhile Hobson has many defenders across Oklahoma because of his accomplishments as a lawmaker, some believe his recent behavior is more than enough to warrant removing his name from the building, which is situated in the 200 block of 12th Avenue NE.\n\nCleveland County Commissioner Rod Cleveland said he will take steps to do just that next month.\n\n\u201cI will be bringing it up in January, at a public meeting,\u201d Cleveland told The Oklahoman. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal ... I like Cal and he was a great legislator for the area ... but addiction is one of the big things they treat over there.\u201d\n\nCleveland said he started thinking about changing the name after Hobson\u2019s second arrest in 2014, in May, but felt like the timing wasn\u2019t right because Hobson was running for public office at the time. Hobson was trying to win a seat on the Cleveland County Board of Commissioners, the same body that could vote next month to remove his name from the buildings he helped to get built a decade ago.\n\nReached by phone Sunday evening, Hobson expressed little emotion when told that current county commissioners were talking about removing his name from the building he helped to get built.\n\n\u201cWhatever they decide ... they have the power to do it,\u201d Hobson said. \u201cI worked with their predecessors in a bipartisan way to get this done, but what matters is that the building is there ... not some letters on a wall.\u201d\n\nHobson said he is more concerned that many elected officials in Oklahoma \u201care turning away our own money\u201d for health care services and resources available through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a law commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThousands of (Cleveland County) residents don\u2019t have access to health care ... people are dying because they can\u2019t get help,\u201d Hobson said. \u201cI know Obama is a dirty word in Oklahoma, but let\u2019s use the money, it\u2019s Oklahoma taxpayers\u2019 money after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I think Rod (Cleveland) and his daddy (State Rep. Bobby Cleveland) should do instead of sitting around thinking about me.\u201d\n\nAccording to a news story published in The Oklahoman in late 2003, the building was named for Hobson because he helped raise the millions of dollars necessary to construct the building while he served in the then-Democrat-controlled state Legislature.\n\nThe new, 42,000-square-foot facility Hobson helped to build doubled the office space available to the Cleveland County Health Department, which had used a much smaller space at the county fairgrounds. Newspaper archives indicate the Cal Hobson Center had its grand opening ceremony in December 2003 after 18 months of construction.\n\nOngoing struggles\n\nCleveland, who hails from a political family, said he\u2019s known Hobson \u201csince I was like 10.\u201d Cleveland said it\u2019s common knowledge in political and social circles that Hobson \u201cstruggles with addiction ... and has for a long, long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a disease,\u201d Cleveland said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that he wasn\u2019t great for the state, because he was a terrific legislator. But, given his current situation, it just looks bad.\u201d\n\nHobson was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in May and again in late August of this year.\n\nCourt records show that he drove into oncoming traffic before he was arrested May 18 in Noble. Just over three months later, Hobson was picked up again when Lexington officers found him apparently drunk in his vehicle at a convenience store.\n\nAfter he was elected to the state House in 1978, Hobson would go on to serve in the state Senate. In 2003, he was elected Senate president pro tem and was re-elected to the post two years later.\n\nIn March 2005 \u2014 two months after being elected a second time \u2014 fellow Democrats requested that Hobson resign his position as president pro tem. He would leave the Senate the next year due to term limits.\n\nAs for a new name for the building, Cleveland said he thinks the generic approach is best.\n\n\u201cI think we should just go in and take his name off and leave the rest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat way it just says Cleveland County Health Department ... that\u2019s what it is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Oklahoma lawmaker Cal Hobson\u2019s name may be removed from a building in Norman, the Cal Hobson Center, after he was arrested twice in the past year on drunken driving complaints.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
