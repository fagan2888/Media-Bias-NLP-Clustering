In an interview this week with Salon, Sanders set forth his thinking about why he might take that plunge, and offered assessments of contenders Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. He also blasted Wal-Mart\u2019s business model, Republicans\u2019 healthcare tactics, and a level of inequality that he warned has brought America to the cusp of oligarchy. A condensed version of our conversation follows.\n\nHow significant is the Senate\u2019s move to change the filibuster for nominations last week? And does this bring us closer to curbing the filibuster for nominations also?\n\nIt is a significant step forward in attempting to end the dysfunctionality of the United States Senate. I would go further. And I believe that when we are faced with unprecedented Republican obstruction, that it would make a lot of sense to go to majority vote for legislation as well. I also believe that we have to protect the rights of minorities, and I think minorities \u2013 minority or any other member of the Senate \u2014 should have as much time as he or she needs to voice opposition, stand up, filibuster, do their thing. So I believe in the concept of the talking filibuster.\n\nBut I think what we have got to end is the situation right now where the Senate is basically dysfunctional, and where the major issues facing this country are not being discussed, and are certainly \u2026 not being voted on.\n\nWhat\u2019s your view of the Upton bill that passed the House, and the bill proposed by Sen. Landrieu in the Senate on the Affordable Care Act?\n\nI\u2019m not sympathetic. Clearly, my own view is that [at] a time when our nation spends almost twice as much as any other country on healthcare, and we have so many people who will continue to be uninsured under the Affordable Care Act, we need to move toward a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. The Affordable Care Act is a modest proposal \u2014 it does some good things, it is much too complicated, and it doesn\u2019t get to the root of the problems of America\u2019s healthcare. Clearly, the rollout in terms of the website has been a disaster. That has got to be rectified.\n\nBut I would hope that we can move forward as quickly as possible in getting people into the Affordable Care Act, making sure that people get Medicaid, and get the system moving.\n\nThe Upton bill and the Landrieu bill, do they pose a threat to the law?\n\nWell, I think the Upton bill certainly does \u2026 Republicans in the House, their job is to kill healthcare reform, despite the fact that we have 48 million Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance \u2026 It is hard to take seriously people who quote-unquote want to make \u201cimprovements\u201d in the Affordable Care Act when every other day they are clear that they want to destroy the act.\n\nAnd are you concerned to see so many Democrats getting behind the Landrieu proposal or the Upton proposal?\n\nWell, I think what you have is legitimate concern on the part of many Democrats who are very, very worried about how this thing is rolling out. And the kind of \u2014 and given the enormous Republican opposition in stressing every problem that exists, of which there are many \u2014 there are Democrats who are nervous.\n\nThe Burlington Free Press reported that you\u2019re open to running for president if there isn\u2019t a good enough alternative in the race. What do you think you could accomplish by running?\n\nWell, let me just tell you, Josh, I don\u2019t wake up every morning with a huge desire to be president of the United States. I gather there are people who do. I don\u2019t.\n\nBut what I do wake up believing is that this country is facing more serious crises than we have faced since the Great Depression. And if you include the planetary crisis of global warming, the situation today may even be worse. And given that reality, what distresses me enormously is that there is very little discussion about these major crises, and even less discussion about ideas that can resolve these issues.\n\nAnd this is not just a crisis within the political establishment \u2014 it\u2019s certainly a crisis within the media establishment, because media seems to be far more concerned about looking at politics as a game, or looking at personality and celebrity life, rather than kind of analyzing the problems that we face. Let me just give you just a few examples \u2026\n\nThe great moral and economic and political crisis facing this country, which gets relatively little discussion, is the growing disparity in income and wealth that exists in America. We are in a situation where we have not been since the late 1920s, before the Depression, where the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the financial wealth of America, while the bottom 60 \u2013 six zero \u2013 percent owns 2.3 percent of the wealth in America. That is obscene beyond belief. The worst wealth inequality in the entire \u2014 of any major country in the world. And in terms of income, the last statistics we have seen from 2009 to 2012 tell us that 95 percent of all new income in this country went to the top 1 percent.\n\nSo what you have there is obviously [a] horrendous economic situation, but it is very dangerous to our political system. Because big money interests are putting huge amounts of money into the political process through Citizens United. And these are issues that have got to be addressed, or else in my view the United States will move very rapidly toward an oligarchic form of society when our economic and political life is controlled by a handful of billionaires.\n\nI see this as a huge moral issue, an economic issue, a political issue. There is virtually no discussion about that, virtually none. I don\u2019t know how we can be a serious nation when this issue is not front and center, and there are not real ideas out there on how we address it. That\u2019s just one issue.\n\nThe second issue is the crisis of unemployment in this country. Real unemployment is not 7.2 percent \u2014 it\u2019s close to 14 percent, including those people who have given up looking for work, and who are working part-time. Youth unemployment, youth unemployment is close to 20 percent. African-American youth unemployment is close to 40 percent. These are crises. And yet day after day, we hear about the deficit \u2014 which is a serious issue \u2014 and we hear almost nothing about the unemployment issue, which among other things is having a horrendous impact on the current young generation, the kids who have graduated high school and college. So we need a lot of discussion on that.\n\nAnd certainly it is beyond comprehension \u2014 although the scientific community is almost unanimous in telling us that global warming is man-made, that it is already causing disastrous problems, and that those problems will only get worse in years to come \u2014 that we have almost no movement at all, virtually no movement in Congress on this planetary crisis.\n\nAnd lastly, I would say that while the American people feel very strongly \u2014 and this is, by the way, across the board, Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 in opposition to cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, inside the Beltway, the political establishments, there is support for cuts to those terribly important programs.\n\nSo those are some of the issues that are out there that need discussing. We have a middle class that is disappearing, and somebody has got to be speaking strongly to defend our middle class.\n\nAnd if you ran for president, what do you think it would do for those issues?\n\nThe nature of media is that presidential campaigns and candidates are a means, to some degree at least, of getting these issues out there. And I think that you can give all the speeches you want on the floor of the Senate, that\u2019s great, but I think being involved in debates and being out there around the country allows \u2014 gives you the opportunity to talk about these issues in a way that you otherwise could not.\n\nThe Free Press also reported that you\u2019d be comfortable with an Elizabeth Warren presidential bid. What would make Elizabeth Warren a good president?\n\nOh, Elizabeth Warren is, you know, clearly one of the smartest people in the Senate. She is a true progressive. I\u2019ve known Elizabeth for many, many years. She is doing a great job, and understands fully the issues facing the middle class and working class in this country. She is a very strong proponent in defending the working families in this country.\n\nSo should she be running for president?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you give her a ring?\n\nYou told Playboy that while you like the Clintons, they \u201clive in a world surrounded by a lot of money,\u201d and a Hillary Clinton candidacy would not offer an alternative for the country. Why not?\n\nWell, actually that was a \u2013 a) You don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t know whether Hillary Clinton is running for president. And b) if she decides to run for president, we don\u2019t know the issues that she will be focusing on. I have known Hillary Clinton for a number of years, not terribly well, but I knew her when she was first lady and I knew her when she was in the Senate. I like her. She is extremely smart. But it\u2019s \u2014 we will have to see what she has to say, so \u2014 but based on the kind of centrist positions that we have seen her take in the past, it remains to be seen \u2014 although I may be wrong \u2014 it remains to be seen whether she will be a forceful advocate for working families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders tells Salon it \"remains to be seen\" if Clinton \"will be a forceful advocate for working families\"", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Why I might run in 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bernie Sanders tells Salon it \"remains to be seen\" if Clinton \"will be a forceful advocate for working families\"", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Why I might run in 2016", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/27/bernie_sanders_why_i_might_run_in_2016/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/bernie_sanders2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders tells Salon it \"remains to be seen\" if Clinton \"will be a forceful advocate for working families\"", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Why I might run in 2016", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/bernie_sanders2.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Citizens United, Elizabeth Warren, healthcare, Hillary Clinton, Inequality, Iran, John Kerry, Mary Landrieu, Upton, Wal-Mart, Walton Family, Welfare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aca, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Citizens United, Elizabeth Warren, healthcare, Hillary Clinton, Inequality, Iran, John Kerry, Mary Landrieu, Upton, Wal-Mart, Walton Family, Welfare, Media News, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis month Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders, the Senate\u2019s only self-described socialist, made a tour of four Southern states that stoked talk of a presidential run.\nI see this as a huge moral issue, an economic issue, a political issue.\nIn an interview this week with Salon, Sanders set forth his thinking about why he might take that plunge, and offered assessments of contenders Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren.\nThe Free Press also reported that you\u2019d be comfortable with an Elizabeth Warren presidential bid.\nAnd b) if she decides to run for president, we don\u2019t know the issues that she will be focusing on."}
