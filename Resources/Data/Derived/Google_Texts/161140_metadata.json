That, however, is the floor \u2013 some areas choose to go further.\n\nIrin Carmon recently reported on a new policy in the nation\u2019s capital, where policymakers approved a bold new law \u2013 the \u201cD.C. Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act\u201d \u2013 which adds \u201creproductive decision-making to anti-discrimination provisions.\u201d\n\nSo, for example, an employee in D.C. cannot be fired for being on birth control, using in vitro fertilization, exercising her right to terminate a pregnancy, or getting pregnant outside of marriage. Those are private matters, the D.C. law says, which cannot serve as the basis for a dismissal.\n\nAs it turns out, this quickly became the latest twist in the right-to-discriminate debate, and Roll Call reported late last week on congressional Republicans intervening in city law.\n\nIn a largely symbolic move, the House voted mostly down party lines late Thursday night to block a District of Columbia bill that D.C. officials say would combat workplace discrimination. A corps of mainly Republicans passed a joint resolution of disapproval 228-192\u2026. Conservatives argued the act could force employers to violate their religious beliefs.\n\nIt was, the article noted, the \u201cfirst time in nearly 25 years the entire House voted to block a D.C. law.\u201d\n\nThe ridiculous push from House GOP lawmakers didn\u2019t change city policy \u2013 the Senate chose not to act on the matter \u2013 and the local law took effect over the weekend.\n\nBut as it turns out, there\u2019s a presidential angle to this.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took it upon himself to go after the D.C. anti-discrimination policy, issuing this press release on Friday.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement urging Congress to formally disapprove of the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act (RHNDA) and the Human Rights Amendment Act (HRAA) recently passed by the District of Columbia in order to protect First Amendment rights for D.C. citizens. \u201cThe D.C. Council has proposed two measures that trample the very rights the First Amendment was designed to protect - the right of citizens to freely practice their faith,\u201d Sen. Cruz said. \u201cThe Constitution gives Congress the authority to exercise jurisdiction over the District of Columbia \u2018in all cases whatsoever.\u2019 And both the House and Senate have a constitutional duty to protect citizens\u2019 religious liberty, as enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nThe Senate GOP leadership ignored Cruz\u2019s cries, but Roll Call reported this week that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) \u201cappears to support the effort to block the law.\u201d\n\nIn other words, two Republican presidential candidates apparently believe employers should be able to fire workers if bosses don\u2019t like employees\u2019 personal reproductive-health decisions. One of the two candidates is ostensibly from the GOP\u2019s libertarian wing.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Should Americans lose their jobs if their employers disapprove of their reproductive choices?
