He understands that his party\u2019s popularity (down to 28% of registered voters) is pathetically weak.\n\nBut he seems to genuinely believe, \u201cI can make a difference . . . Think what would it do to the Republican brand if I won.\u201d\n\nA noble cause. But to make the November ballot he\u2019ll first have to beat out, not only the other Republicans in the race \u2013 former GOP chairman Tom Del Beccaro and Assemblyman Rocky Chavez\u2014but also finish in the Top Two in the primary against Democrats, U.S. Rep Loretta Sanchez or Attorney General Kamala Harris.\n\nGOP conundrum Here\u2019s Duf\u2019s challenge: While he\u2019s an economic and foreign policy conservative (he opposed the Iran nuclear deal, for example), he\u2019s essentially pro-gay marriage, favors a pathway to legality for undocumented immigrants, opposes further offshore oil drilling, takes a libertarian stance on abortion rights and wouldn\u2019t shut down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood and, perhaps most politically perilous of all, believes \u2013 gasp \u2013 in actually governing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of principle,\u201d he told Calbuzz in an interview last week. \u201cAnd one of my principles is principled compromise.\u201d You don\u2019t set out to compromise, he said. But compromise is not capitulation. He wouldn\u2019t immediately repeal Obamacare, for example, but he\u2019d like to replace it with a system based on medical care, not medical insurance controlled by Washington.\n\nHis biggest concern is that the economic system is not working for average, working Americans \u2013 \u201cpeople with full-time jobs, stagnant wages and rising costs\u201d who are being squeezed by a system that doesn\u2019t work for them.\n\nHe\u2019d like to resurrect the community bank system, make it easier for small businesses to depreciate capital equipment and \u201cencourage job growth in the U.S.\u201d (although exactly how he\u2019d do that is still rather fuzzy). Of one thing he\u2019s certain: \u201cThe middle class is being hollowed out.\u201d And he\u2019d be dedicated to reversing that.\n\nHe says he\u2019s for clean air and water, but he also argues that some environmental regulations go too far (like EPA regulations on truck emissions, for example) and that the feds could do more to help streamline development of manufacturing plants and keep gasoline taxes from overwhelming small businesses.\n\nHow about the Donald? Calbuzz asked him if he\u2019d be comfortable running as a Republican with Donald Trump as the GOP nominee for president. He didn\u2019t say yes, but he didn\u2019t say no. \u201cI think he\u2019s tapped into something that\u2019s a major reason why I\u2019m running \u2013 a current of anger and angst people have because they\u2019re not being listened to.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the GOP contenders he\u2019s most comfortable with, he told us, are Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Marco Rubio. He also thinks Carly Fiorina is doing an excellent job of making her case (although his politics seem far less right-wing than hers).\n\nAlthough stopping short of calling himself pro-choice \u2014 he takes a libertarian position on abortion rights, he said \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t try to overturn Roe v Wade. Nor would he send ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS (although he adds the boilerplate that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t take anything off the table\u201d).\n\nOn immigration, he says he wouldn\u2019t try to round up and deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here (except felons, who he would expel), but instead would like to see a system where they can win legal resident status.\n\nSeeking common ground. Sundheim disagrees with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein on many issues, but says she\u2019s the kind of bi-partisan, deliberative senator he\u2019d want to be \u2013 someone who seeks to find solutions. His favorite U.S. Supreme Court justices are Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito (and he liked Sandra Day O\u2019Connor).\n\nHe\u2019s a supporter of religious freedom but thinks Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis had an obligation to follow the law and issue marriage licenses. \u201cThe job has to be done. Gay marriage is legal and it\u2019s up to the state to issue licenses.\u201d\n\nSundheim has barely gotten his campaign off the ground and doesn\u2019t have real staff yet, but he says he\u2019s received informal advice from Bob White, Marty Wilson and Jeff Randle \u2013 three smart, moderate Republicans. Not a bad trio in the Calbuzz playbook.\n\nBottom Line: Duf Sundheim is a thinking person\u2019s Republican. We\u2019re just not sure there\u2019s a thinking person\u2019s party out there on his side of the aisle.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California politics, news, analysis, commentary, opinion, California local and state politics, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento", "og": {"site_name": "Calbuzz", "description": "George \u201cDuf\u201d Sundheim, the Silicon Valley lawyer and former California Republican Party chairman who last week joined the race for U.S. Senate, has two big problems: 1) He\u2019s too damn reasonable for the knuckle-dragging, right-wing GOP voters who in recent years have dominated first-round", "title": "Stop the Presses: Rational Republican Seeks Senate", "url": "http://www.calbuzz.com/2015/09/stop-the-presses-rational-republican-seeks-senate/", "image": "http://www.calbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/dufsundheim-228x300.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "description": "Political news, analysis, commentary, and more about California and beyond", "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1", "robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "Calbuzz asked him if he\u2019d be comfortable running as a Republican with Donald Trump as the GOP nominee for president.\nThink what would it do to the Republican brand if I won.\u201dA noble cause.\nBottom Line: Duf Sundheim is a thinking person\u2019s Republican.\nOf one thing he\u2019s certain: \u201cThe middle class is being hollowed out.\u201d And he\u2019d be dedicated to reversing that.\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of principle,\u201d he told Calbuzz in an interview last week."}
