Dental care for adults on Medicaid, cut during the state’s fiscal crisis, will be restored as of Jan. 1, according to the state’s Health Care Authority.

Adults enrolling in Apple Health/Medicaid under the new, higher-income eligibility rules that go into effect Jan. 1 as part of the Affordable Care Act will qualify for care as well as those already enrolled.

The benefit will cover restorative and preventive services, dentures, root canals, cavity care and routine checkups and cleanings, as well as emergency services such as extraction, pain or infection relief and treatment of trauma-caused damage.

The earlier cuts in service were a “major hardship” for elderly and disabled adults, said Dorothy Teeter, director of the state agency.

The agency began notifiying dentists this month about the restoration of service.
