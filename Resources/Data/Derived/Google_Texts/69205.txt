For something completely different, the legendary British comic John Cleese released a new memoir, “So, Anyway…” earlier this month. Mr. Cleese, 75, is probably best known as one of the members of the Monty Python comedy troupe, including in the immortal “Dead Parrot” and “Ministry of Silly Walks” sketches. He also had star turns in the BBC sitcom “Fawlty Towers” and the movie “A Fish Called Wanda.”

Mr. Cleese was shot by photographer Brad Trent on Tuesday, Nov. 4, at the Park Central Hotel in New York City.
