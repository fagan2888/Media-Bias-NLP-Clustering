Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio), chairman of the panel\u2019s subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, said about the bill to shift more permitting authority to states.\n\nBut Gibbs said the EPA \u201cis inserting itself into the implementation of state water quality permitting standards and is second-guessing states on permitting decisions in how standards are to be implemented, and even second-guessing EPA\u2019s own prior determinations that a state\u2019s standards meet the minimum requirements under the Clean Water Act.\u201d\n\nRep. Shelley Moore Capito Shelley Moore CapitoInvest in infrastructure to transform America Senate Republicans ask Trump to soften his tone Skittish GOP to Trump: Drop the insults MORE (R-W.Va.) sponsored the bill in an effort to help the coal industry, whose mines often need permits to dump waste materials.\n\n\u201cThis act addresses many of the obstacles that the EPA has placed in the way of our coal production in Appalachia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe EPA has a clear-cut role, and has for years, in making sure that these permits go forward. This bill does not in any way take that right or that ability from EPA away.\u201d\n\nThe panel also sought to overturn the EPA\u2019s highly controversial Waters of the United States rule, proposed earlier this year to clarify its jurisdiction over streams, lakes and other bodies of water, after a series of Supreme Court rulings that called the agency\u2019s authority into question.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the panel passed another bill aimed at the EPA\u2019s water rules. That bill would restrict the timeframe in which the EPA can veto permits to dump dredge or fill materials into waterways and wetlands. Republicans said stopping the rule would restore a longstanding federal-state partnership over water pollution issues.\n\n\u201cThe EPA and the Corps of Engineers are engaged in a brazen effort to upset a successful federal-state partnership that has regulated America\u2019s waters for more than 40 years,\u201d said Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.). \u201cForty years of progress is now being turned onto its head under the guise of clarifying the scope of federal jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nDemocrats defended the EPA.\n\nRep. Tim Bishop Tim BishopFlint residents hire first K Street firm House moves to vote on .1T package; backup plan in place GOP wants accountability, innovation from accreditation \u2013 at least right now MORE (D-N.Y.) called the permitting bill \u201ca wholesale rewrite of the underlying permitting requirements of the Clean Water Act.\u201d\n\nBishop said that the bill would encourage a state \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in terms of water regulation, in which states would roll back rules to attract more industry while allowing more pollution.\n\n\u201cAs our nation\u2019s history has shown, when individual states get to compete against one another for the lowest water quality protections, rivers catch fire, lakes die and the overall quality of our economic and ecological health suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.) said the bill to stop the water jurisdiction rule \u201cwould have a drastic impact on the health of our water supply.\u201d\n\nShe and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) recognized, however, that the EPA\u2019s proposal could have been more clear and answered more questions.\n\n\u201cThey keep telling us what it doesn\u2019t do, and if you\u2019ve written a rule and you have to keep telling people what it doesn\u2019t do, then maybe your rule needs a lot of work. And that\u2019s why we have a public comment period,\u201d DeFazio said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Transportation Committee passed bills to reform the EPA\u2019s water permitting process and stop a proposal to redefine its jurisdiction.", "description": "The Transportation Committee passed bills to reform the EPA\u2019s water permitting process and stop a proposal to redefine its jurisdiction.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Transportation Committee passed bills to reform the EPA\u2019s water permitting process and stop a proposal to redefine its jurisdiction.", "title": "Lawmakers target EPA\u2019s water regs", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/212461-lawmakers-target-epas-water-regs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-16T15:33:31-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-16T15:33-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/212461-lawmakers-target-epas-water-regs", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-16T15:17-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Clean Water Act,Bob Gibbs, Shelley Moore Capito, Steven Southerland, Tim Bishop,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-16T15:17:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T15:33:31-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/212461-lawmakers-target-epas-water-regs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Transportation Committee passed bills to reform the EPA\u2019s water permitting process and stop a proposal to redefine its jurisdiction.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers target EPA\u2019s water regs"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers target EPA\u2019s water regs"}, "article_summary": "Earlier Wednesday, the panel passed another bill aimed at the EPA\u2019s water rules.\nThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed two bills Wednesday aimed at undercutting the way the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates water pollution.\nRepublicans said stopping the rule would restore a longstanding federal-state partnership over water pollution issues.\n\u201cThe EPA has a clear-cut role, and has for years, in making sure that these permits go forward.\nThat bill would restrict the timeframe in which the EPA can veto permits to dump dredge or fill materials into waterways and wetlands."}
