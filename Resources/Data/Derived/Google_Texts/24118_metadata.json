(Photo: Dylan Buell, Special to The CJ)Buy Photo\n\nWith a little luck and a big Republican turnout on Tuesday, the GOP could effectively gain control of the Kentucky House of Representatives after four special elections to fill seats vacated when members moved up to statewide office or accepted appointments from Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nLes Fugate, a Republican activist, said party registration in the districts doesn't necessarily favor the GOP. He downplayed expectations, saying that merely breaking even would put Republicans in position take control of the House in the fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical they win two,\u201d said Fugate, who noted that House Democrats would then have a 52-48 advantage. \u201cIf they win two, they keep the fundraising interest going because it (the Democratic advantage) is still at two seats, closer than it\u2019s ever been and it keeps everything in play.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats have registration advantages in three of the four districts, but voters don\u2019t always vote that way, particularly when federal issues are at play.\n\nDanny Briscoe, a Democratic political consultant, said it\u2019s important for the Democrats to win at least two of those three seats if they want to start turning the tide after Republicans took the governor\u2019s office and most other statewide offices in last year\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cThey need to at least win two of the four to maintain the status quo,\" he said. \"Everything seems to be trending Republican.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Democrats have a 50-46 advantage in the House, which they have controlled for the last 95 years.\n\nBut a sweep would move the Republicans into a tie for the House, giving them effective control of the chamber because state Rep. Tom McKee, D-Cynthiana, has not returned following heart surgery earlier in the session.\n\nIf that happens, it could free a slew of bills that the Democrats have kept bottled up for years \u2013 everything from legislation designed to reduce the influence of unions to abortion legislation that has been held back.\n\nHouse Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, said he doesn't expect that to happen.\n\nStumbo said the elections are hard to predict \"because it's going to be a low turnout, special election. It's all about get-out-the vote. But I think there is a good likelihood that we will win at least two. I'm hopeful for three. And four is not out of the realm of possibility.\"\n\nSenate President Robert Stivers, a Republican, said he expects the GOP to win two to four races as well. He also expects the elections will give both parties a better understanding of the political landscape. Whatever the outcome, he said, the special elections will \"allow, I think, for there to be a clear understanding what the dynamics are as it relates to politics for the balance of the session.\"\n\nThe open seats include one in northeastern Kentucky, one in Western Kentucky and one in the Bluegrass region.\n\nTwo of the seats were previously held by Democrats, two by Republicans.\n\nIn Western Kentucky, where Rep. John Tilley resigned his 8th District seat to be Bevin\u2019s justice secretary, Democrat Jeffrey R. Taylor is taking on Republican Walker Wood Thomas.\n\nThat region of the state has been trending more Republican for more than 20 years, which puts the GOP in a position to pick up a seat with Thomas, who owns a roller skating rink.\n\nBut Democrats hope the significant African-American vote in Hopkinsville shows up and powers Taylor, a former Tennessee Valley Authority worker who is black, to victory.\n\nTwo Republican seats are open in central Kentucky, with former Rep. Mike Harmon moving up to state auditor and former Rep. Ryan Quarles becoming agriculture commissioner.\n\nIn Harmon\u2019s 54th district, a couple of lawyers are squaring off. Republicans have Daniel Elliott, of Danville, facing off against Democrat Bill Noelker, a former Navy fighter pilot, who sometimes has campaigned with a holstered handgun on his hip.\n\nIn Quarles\u2019 district, the race pits Democrat Chuck Tackett against Republican Phillip Pratt. Tackett is a farmer and former Scott County magistrate. Pratt owns a lawn care business.\n\nDemocrats also are trying to keep former Rep. Tanya Pullen\u2019s 98th District seat, vacated when Bevin appointed her as an administrative law judge. The Democrats found Lewis Nicholls, a former circuit judge, to vie for the seat.\n\nRepublicans picked Greenup County Commissioner Tony Quillen to wrest it away.\n\nBriscoe, the Democratic consultant, said Democrats need to quell the GOP tide.\n\n\"If they lose three of the four or four of the four,\" he said, \"it\u2019s going to continue to be the narrative that the Republicans are taking charge.\"\n\nReporter Joseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1oYdlcN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Four House seats up for grabs in special elections with Democrats holding slim majority", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Four House seats up for grabs in special elections with Democrats holding slim majority", "title": "GOP could take House control in Tuesday votes", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2016/03/05/gop-could-take-house-control-tuesday-votes/80507238/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Four House seats up for grabs in special elections with Democrats holding slim majority", "title": "GOP could take House control in Tuesday votes", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Republican Party", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Republican Party", "title": "GOP could take House control in Tuesday votes", "author": "Joseph Gerth", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections/kentucky", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7693856023716441bc41369055bedd0168e81635/c=750-0-2250-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67d77b70969a0c005d4a65ab900483945262d9b8/c=170-0-2830-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dcf7a5e162ecaf424bb786a3bfcd0eb1be1097de/c=0-153-3000-1848&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-05T14:35:55.223000-05:00", "shorthed": "GOP could take House control in Tuesday votes", "articleid": 80507238, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3872b571009e7a9e89ec6cb5deb3c24074565c3a/c=940-0-2060-2000/local/-/media/2016/01/05/Louisville/Louisville/635876025039829662-BS2C7685.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Kentucky special elections, Kentucky House of Representatives, Control of Ky House of Representatives, Joseph Gerth, Greg Stumbo,"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s critical they win two,\u201d said Fugate, who noted that House Democrats would then have a 52-48 advantage.\nHe downplayed expectations, saying that merely breaking even would put Republicans in position take control of the House in the fall.\nSenate President Robert Stivers, a Republican, said he expects the GOP to win two to four races as well.\nLes Fugate, a Republican activist, said party registration in the districts doesn't necessarily favor the GOP.\nBuy Photo The House of Representatives meets during the first day of the legislature at the Capitol Tuesday."}
