Scott Brown, who's now running for Senate in New Hampshire, offered his own take on that particular brand of counterfactual history: If we'd elected Mitt Romney in 2012 instead of reelecting President Obama, he said, we wouldn't be worrying about Ebola.\n\n\"Gosh, can you imagine if Mitt was the president right now?\" Brown asked during an interview on Fox News Radio that was uploaded to YouTube by a New Hampshire Democratic group. \"He was right on Russia, he was right on Obamacare, he was right on the economy. And I guarantee you we would not be worrying about Ebola right now and, you know, worrying about our foreign policy screw ups.\"\n\nRomney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, has campaigned with Brown in New Hampshire as the former senator takes on Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The two are currently locked in a tight race, with most public polls reflecting a small lead for the Democrat. A CBS News/New York Times estimate released earlier this month, for example, found Shaheen ahead of Brown, 48 to 41 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate suggests Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, would have the virus under control", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-brown-no-ebola-fears-if-mitt-romney-had-won/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/19/214772b8-0e01-4c4c-8b54-31e125c0c622/thumbnail/1200x630/a96b83711f1520fbe45e262eead0027c/ap210223577934.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate suggests Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, would have the virus under control", "title": "Scott Brown: No Ebola fears if Mitt Romney were president"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate suggests Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, would have the virus under control", "title": "Scott Brown: No Ebola fears if Mitt Romney were president", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/scott-brown-no-ebola-fears-if-mitt-romney-had-won/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/scott-brown-no-ebola-fears-if-mitt-romney-had-won/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-brown-no-ebola-fears-if-mitt-romney-had-won/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/19/214772b8-0e01-4c4c-8b54-31e125c0c622/thumbnail/1200x630/a96b83711f1520fbe45e262eead0027c/ap210223577934.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-brown-no-ebola-fears-if-mitt-romney-had-won/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/scott-brown-no-ebola-fears-if-mitt-romney-had-won/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08a9\"", "article_summary": "\"Gosh, can you imagine if Mitt was the president right now?\"\nAnd I guarantee you we would not be worrying about Ebola right now and, you know, worrying about our foreign policy screw ups.\"\nBrown asked during an interview on Fox News Radio that was uploaded to YouTube by a New Hampshire Democratic group.\nRomney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, has campaigned with Brown in New Hampshire as the former senator takes on Democratic Sen.
