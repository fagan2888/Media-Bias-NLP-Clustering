It is expected to be available through health care providers later this month.\n\n\"Physicians have prescribed FDA-approved testosterone replacement therapies for many years to help treat men diagnosed with testosterone deficiency, or hypogonadism,\u201d Dr. Martin Miner, co-director of the Men\u2019s Health Center at Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I. \u201cAVEED is an important new option that may be suitable for some men given its dosing schedule and administration.\u201d\n\nHypogonadism currently affects nearly 40 percent of the male population over 45. The hormone deficiency is characterized by poor erectile function, reduced libido, and an overall decline in sexual activity. Non-sexual complications include increased body fat, reduced muscle mass, fatigue, and depression.\n\nTestosterone treatments like AbbVie\u2019s current market leader AndoGel grossed about $1.2 billion in 2012, according to Reuters. During premarket trading on Thursday, Endo\u2019s shares rose 4.6 percent.\n\nConsumer advocacy groups initially asked the FDA to delay its decision on Aveed, citing the link between testosterone drugs and heart problems. The agency has also expressed concern about the ingredient castor oil, which may cause blockages in pulmonary blood vessels. This can in turn lead to serious lung problems.\n\n\u201cAVEED has a Boxed Warning for serious pulmonary oil microembolism (POME) reactions and anaphylaxis,\u201d the company wrote in a press release. \u201cIt should be used in patients who require therapy and in whom the benefits of the product outweigh the serious risks of POME and severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\u201d\n\nOther listed side effects include cough or urge to cough, difficulties breathing, sweating, chest pain, and tightening of the throat.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aveed, endo, fda, testosterone drug, hypogonadism, hormone deficiency", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Endo's testosterone drug Aveed has been approved by the FDA, but consumer groups have expressed concern over side effects.", "title": "After 3 Rejections, Testosterone Drug Receives Approval, But What Are The Side Effects?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aveed-testosterone-drug-rejected-fda-3-times-receives-agency-approval-how-will-it-help-men-hormone", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/06/injection.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Endo's testosterone drug Aveed has been approved by the FDA, but consumer groups have expressed concern over side effects.", "title": "After 3 Rejections, Testosterone Drug Receives Approval, But What Are The Side Effects?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aveed-testosterone-drug-rejected-fda-3-times-receives-agency-approval-how-will-it-help-men-hormone", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/06/injection.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/06/injection.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-06T10:53:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-06T10:53:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Endo's testosterone drug Aveed has been approved by the FDA, but consumer groups have expressed concern over side effects."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bb2\"", "article_summary": "Endo's testosterone drug Aveed has been approved by the FDA, but consumer groups have expressed concern over side effects.\n\u201cAVEED has a Boxed Warning for serious pulmonary oil microembolism (POME) reactions and anaphylaxis,\u201d the company wrote in a press release.\nEndo International Plc said on Thursday that its hypogonadism drug Aveed has now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, promising a speedy rollout of the thrice-rejected pill aimed at men with diminishing testosterone.\n\"With AVEED, Endo can now offer men living with hypogonadism different treatment options to raise testosterone levels,\u201d he said.\nConsumer advocacy groups initially asked the FDA to delay its decision on Aveed, citing the link between testosterone drugs and heart problems."}
