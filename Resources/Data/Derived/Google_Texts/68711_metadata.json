Rusty Crowe, even leaving their doctor a cow as payment.\n\nBut in 2016, with Tennessee legislators opposed to expanding Medicaid to more than a quarter million people under a plan pushed by the governor, lawmakers are considering out-of-the-box solutions to address health care costs.\n\nSen. Kerry Roberts\u2019 solution, up for debate next week, harkens back to \u201cgood old fashioned health care,\u201d with primary care physicians charging patients a monthly fee for unlimited doctor visits and services without ever having to use the health insurance system.\n\nShould patients have insurance, Roberts says, they can shift catastrophic health coverage in the event of a major injury or illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s solving an even larger problem than Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Roberts, adding that any of the state\u2019s 6.6 million Tennesseans could benefit from a direct-pay plan, not just the 280,000 estimated people who would qualify for health coverage under Insure Tennessee because they don\u2019t qualify for TennCare but also aren't eligible to use health care exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something done completely independent of insurance. It\u2019s done completely independent of TennCare,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt truly is a free-market solution to providing people with affordable health care.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a practice being done in Tennessee, albeit it sparsely. GracePointe Healthcare PLLC in Franklin charges $49 a month for free office visits, basic labs and diagnostic tests, prescription refills and phone consultations. Business at Rob Tomsett\u2019s clinic has grown so much he\u2019s considering a move to a larger building.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sick of the rat wheel of medicine being, 'Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!' and feeling like I\u2019m not helping anybody that much,\u201d said Tomsett, a physician assistant who runs GracePointe. \u201cJust like your favorite restaurant or your trusted mechanic, they come back to me because they value the services I provide to them.\u201d\n\nWithout having to spend time or money trying dedicating staff to chase down insurance companies rejecting their claims, Tomsett said he has more time to talk with patients instead of rushing them out the door after a five- or 10-minute exam to fill out more paperwork. His patients range from people of low income to millionaires, he said.\n\nThe Roberts bill stems from last year\u2019s failure of Insure Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s plan offer health care coverage to the section of the population left unaccounted for after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling found states are not required to expand their Medicaid programs to satisfy the Affordable Care Act. The idea was unpopular among Tennessee lawmakers from the beginning, first with former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen calling a federally-required expansion the \u201cmother of unfunded mandates\u201d and Republicans in the legislature killing the governor's Insure Tennessee plan early in committee.\n\nHaslam said he doesn\u2019t see the new legislation as hurting or helping his chances of trying to convince the legislature to consider a health care expansion in the future \u2014 although any further attempts, if any, would happen after the November presidential election.\n\n\u201cIf this is a good idea on its own, it should stand on its own regardless,\u201d Haslam said. \u201cBut we should make certain \u2014 there\u2019s still 280,000 Tennesseans who don\u2019t have health care coverage. And even having primary care provider coverage, there\u2019s a lot of different missions and agencies people can go to for the basics. But then when the costs get big beyond that, like I said, the surgery or ongoing cancer treatments, that\u2019s been what the issue has been.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee Medical Association, the state\u2019s largest professional organization for doctors, supports the plan, but would like direct primary care operations to be quarterbacked by a physician to ensure the quality of care and other minor aspects of the bill.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see if public policies pave the way for some of this, like this bill might do,\u201d said Dave Chaney, spokesman for the TMA. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a prediction, but even the push for it in and of itself even reflects the exhaustion with all the administrative stuff that they have to go through.\u201d\n\nAccording to the legislation's fiscal note, which predicts costs and economic impact, the legislation is expect to ease the pressure on insurance companies by reducing the number of claims to process.\n\nThe legislation, called the Health Care Empowerment Act, is up for a Senate vote Monday. From a technical standpoint, the legislation ensures any such direct primary care arrangements are not misconstrued as insurance. But Roberts hopes the legislation will help physicians across the state consider medical practices that resemble this arrangement, kicking the issue of affordable health care to the free market.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how widespread it will be because it\u2019s not the government\u2019s jobs to fan the flames of this thing. It\u2019s the free market's job and it will spread like wildfire,\u201d Roberts said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate to take up bill paving way for direct primary care", "og": {"image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://r2.nashvillepost.com/files/base/scomm/nvp/image/2016/03/640w/ThinkstockPhotos_180083519.56e1eff1249fe.jpg", "height": 360}, "site_name": "Nashville Post", "description": "Senate to take up bill paving way for direct primary care", "title": "Roberts wants state to embrace 'good old fashioned' health care | Nashville Post"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "o_O5_bdskNaHgbV0mHqd8wA_IMrDlmcgCIhZcz_QpYU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut we should make certain \u2014 there\u2019s still 280,000 Tennesseans who don\u2019t have health care coverage.\nShould patients have insurance, Roberts says, they can shift catastrophic health coverage in the event of a major injury or illness.\nSen.
