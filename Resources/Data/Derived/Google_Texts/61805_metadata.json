The experiences of one family \u2013 the Alnasars \u2013 in Massachusetts show how they have embraced their new life, despite many challenges.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nThe Alnasar family lives in this Westfield, Mass., home. They came to the US a year ago from Syria after an 18-month waiting period in Egypt.\n\nFor a man whose store was blown up and who has fled falling artillery shells, life in the United States now offers a new challenge: the political rhetoric of an election year.\n\nZaid Alnasar and his family were the first Syrian refugees to settle in Westfield, Mass. They are, in many ways, invisible to the community around them. Their apartment is nestled on a city street, with white sheer curtains and laundry pinned up on the porch.\n\nBut their story is a picture of how mundane and how profound life in America can be for Syrian refugees. Aside from the new baby born this year, their lives appear unremarkably normal. For the Alnasars, this may be the most remarkable thing of all.\n\nRecommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test?\n\nInterviewed twice this fall before the political fallout from the Paris attacks, the Alnasars regard their new life in America as a \u201csafe haven,\u201d as Mr. Alnasar puts it.\n\nFollowing the Nov. 13 attacks in France, fears about terrorists potentially entering the country posing as Syrian refugees reached a heated pitch, especially in the political world. President Obama has called for the US to accept 10,000 of the estimated 4 million Syrian refugees over this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is among 31 US governors saying he wants to halt acceptance of more refugees until he\u2019s assured that the vetting process is thorough enough.\n\nBut given that Mr. Obama has indicated he will veto legislation aimed at pausing the refugee program, it\u2019s likely that more communities are going to have to consider how they will respond to their newest members.\n\nIn seeking the answer, it may help to meet these new arrivals who aren\u2019t much different from anyone else, says Mohammed Najeeb, resettlement coordinator for Westfield Ascentria.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they eat, they sleep, just like you and I,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have ambitions, they take their kids to school, they want to do the best for their future and children.\u201d\n\nWhen they first settled in, just before Thanksgiving 2014, the Alnasars were the first Syrian refugees in the city. Several others have since joined them. According to the Massachusetts Office for Refugees and Immigrants, 32 refugees have been resettled in the state between 2011, when the civil war began, and 2014.\n\nOn a fall afternoon, seven Alnasars \u2013 from 3 months to 35 years in age \u2013 sit on two couches and folding chairs in a clean, sparse living room. It\u2019s been a year since they arrived, and, for this family, Syrian and American cultures have begun to merge.\n\nZenab Alnasar serves a guest thick, rich Syrian coffee \u2013 and then Tropicana orange and mango juice. Sons Mohammed, age 8, and Hadi, 10, play Corvette on their PlayStation. Through the door, a blackboard with a quote from the Quran that is written in Arabic is visible. Daughter Malam, 13, sits in her own room using her laptop, translating Arabic to English. When asked what her answer is to the question on her computer, \u201cWhat would you like to become someday?,\u201d Malam replies with a smile, \u201cDoctor.\u201d\n\nAside from the schools and city health department, the Alnasars have few interactions with their neighbors, sticking mostly to workers at their resettlement agency, Ascentria, and fellow Syrian refugees.\n\nHaving gone through the 18-month process to obtain refugee status, Zaid says, \u201cI want to assure the American community not to worry about the Syrian refugees. Unlike the Syrian refugees going to Europe,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter, he and other refugees arriving in the US have been comprehensively vetted.\n\n\u2018We were very happy\u2019\n\nPrior to the Syrian conflict, the Alnasars lived in the southwestern province of Daraa (former pop. 244,000).\n\n\u201cIt was good \u2013 all the life needs were available ... schools, streets, city services,\u201d Zaid says. \u201cIt was one of the most beautiful [places].\n\n\u201cI had a house, I had a car \u2013 as a family we were very happy,\u201d he says. He drove a taxi and ran a cellphone shop with his brother, while Zenab raised the children.\n\nThen, Zaid says, \u201cThe revolution started, and we lost all that.\u201d\n\nOn May 14, 2013, two missiles were fired near Zaid\u2019s store. \u201cIt threw me ... six, seven yards. My whole shop was destroyed,\u201d he says.\n\nZaid escaped serious injury, though some children playing nearby did not. Three were dead. He thought he might be able to save a fourth, who was lying on the ground. \u201cI went to pick him up and ... his head was dislocated from his body,\u201d Zaid says.\n\n\u201cThat immediate moment, I decided: [At] 6 a.m. the next morning, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next time, it\u2019s going to hit me and my wife and my kids.\u201d\n\nThe Alnasars\u2019 life in the US began Nov. 21, 2014, when they arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York \u2013 each with one bag in hand.\n\nRecalling his first thought, Zaid says, \u201cWe reached a safe haven.\u201d\n\nHis family was met by a team from Ascentria Care Alliance, a New England-based organization designated by the State Department as a refugee resettlement agency. The two-member team, which speaks the families\u2019 native language, transports families from the airport to their new apartment \u2013 which is prescreened and set up with utilities, furniture, and several days\u2019 worth of food.\n\nIn the case of the Alnasars, their Arabic-speaking team brought them to an apartment in a downtown Westfield neighborhood just blocks from grocery stores, barbershops, and churches. Inside, mattresses and blankets were laid out, couches were in place, halal food was in the fridge, and the heat \u2013 important to a family moving from a warm climate to New England in November \u2013 was on.\n\nThinking back, Zaid says the neighborhood somehow felt familiar, though one thing was off: \u201cHere the homes and apartments are made out of wood,\u201d he says. Back in Syria, everything was constructed from steel and concrete.\n\nWhether refugees are fleeing civil war or not, Ascentria\u2019s Mr. Najeeb says the first few days for a family are difficult, often overwhelming. Najeeb, who is himself a naturalized citizen from Iraq, says he personally greets each family. \u201cI tell them, it\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d he says.\n\nNajeeb also asks families what their most pressing needs are. For the Alnasars, it was getting medical care for their son Hadi, who has a long-standing liver condition. Over the past year, Hadi\u2019s health has improved and is expected to continue doing so, Zaid says.\n\nIt is one of many things that have improved, the Alnasars say.\n\nWhen they lived in Egypt for 18 months while waiting to be given refugee status, \u201cI didn\u2019t go out of the house much,\u201d says Zaid. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\nThe kids also dreaded school there.\n\n\u201cIn Egypt, when we used to wake them up and say you have to go to school, they said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want to,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cHere it\u2019s opposite \u2013 they wake me at 6 a.m.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Egypt we used to love holidays. Here, we hate holidays,\u201d adds Mohammed, who along with the other children receives help from an Iraqi tutor-interpreter.\n\nThe family attends a mosque in Springfield and is able to maintain a halal diet. When Zenab gave birth to Salih, she says her wishes were respected at the hospital when she requested female attendants during examinations and childbirth.\n\n\u201cThey had no problem providing at all,\u201d she says.\n\nZaid has found a temporary job at the Lightlife Foods Inc. factory, which specializes in vegetarian food. Working four or five days a week, he is able to pay most of the family\u2019s monthly housing costs, with some help from the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance.\n\nAs with all resettled refugee families, the Alnasars also received help from the US Office of Refugee Resettlement, which provides medical services and cash for up to eight months after arrival.\n\nZaid says he and his family have benefited repeatedly from the generosity of others. In the grocery store, fellow customers will help him find a specific product, and when he first began using the bus, the driver took the time to show him how to use the correct money to pay his fare.\n\n\u201cI find help everywhere I go,\u201d he says.\n\nSafety a priority\n\nPrior to the Paris attacks, says Kelly Gauger, deputy director of the US Refugee Admissions Program, groups opposed to Syrian refugees were loud but few.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never an entire community,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s people that have a distorted view of what a Syrian refugee population will do to their community. Those voices tend to be in the minority.\u201d\n\nFollowing the attacks in Europe, however, the climate changed \u2013 including in Westfield.\n\nJohn Velis, the state representative for the Westfield district, says he supports Governor Baker\u2019s position. \u201cI do back the governor,\u201d he says. \u201cOur foremost priority needs to be safety.\u201d\n\nMr. Velis adds that he\u2019s had a number of calls from constituents in recent weeks expressing security concerns.\n\nA November 2015 US House Homeland Security Committee report says that, according to preliminary findings through an investigation begun in December 2014, it\u2019s difficult to find background information on Syrian refugees given limited intelligence on the ground there. FBI Director James Comey is quoted in the report as saying, \u201cMy concern there is that there are certain gaps I don\u2019t want to talk about publicly in the data available to us.\u201d\n\nThe report also cites a number of gaps in Europe\u2019s refugee resettlement program, adding that America is put at risk when its partner countries cannot carry out adequate counterterrorism efforts.\n\nFor his part, Velis says that, although he wasn\u2019t aware Syrian refugees lived in Westfield until very recently, he wants to support them in the long run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a balancing act,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just tightening up the security procedures. After that, of course, [I am] welcoming them with open arms. At the end of the day, most human beings want what we want.\u201d\n\nThe Alnasars have settled in, but there are still some remnants of the difficulties they fled. Whenever planes go by overhead, Zenab still raises her arms to shield herself.\n\n\u201cShe still has that fear in her,\u201d Zaid says. \u201cI tell her, \u2018We\u2019re in America. Don\u2019t be scared.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGetting accustomed to the cold weather is another transition. It was especially nippy as Zaid spent his first months in Westfield getting around on a bicycle during last year\u2019s record snowfall. \u201cYou have to get used to it,\u201d he says.\n\nOther facets of Massachusetts \u2013 its fast-paced lifestyle, aggressive driving, and fast-spoken English \u2013 have been a lot to absorb.\n\n\u201cMy English is not the best,\u201d Zaid says. He\u2019s taking English language classes through Ascentria.\n\nHe and his family are also embracing all the new experiences coming their way, like eating pizza and drinking cold-brew coffee \u2013 and spending time in parks and shopping in nearby businesses. \u201cWe try the things we don\u2019t know to learn [about] it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re learning from this culture.\u201d\n\nThe language barrier has made it hard for the Alnasars to get acquainted with their neighbors. In Syria, Alnasar says, he knew everyone. Here, it\u2019s different. \u201cWe speak Arabic,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t socialize, because the language isn\u2019t there yet.\u201d\n\nTerrorism and security aside, supporting families like the Alnasars comes with a number of challenges for a community. Affordable housing, Ms. Gauger says, can be difficult to find, as are entry-level jobs for refugees who don\u2019t speak English well.\n\nSyrian refugees will be sent to areas of the US with the resources to help them, she adds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really going to be spreading them out,\u201d Gauger says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to overwhelm the system.\u201d\n\nIn Westfield, says Debra Mulvenna, a supervising public health nurse for the Westfield Health Department, resources become strained, at least to start. \u201cWe do struggle when we have a new group come in with the language and the cultural barriers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be better, absolutely \u2013 they need more help.\u201d\n\nGauger says overcoming cultural differences can be a challenge. A family from Syria who are practicing Muslims, for instance, may have different expectations for genders than Americans do. To make it here financially, Gauger says, a wife may have to work in addition to her husband.\n\nThe Alnasars say they\u2019re open to learning about more than just pizza and cold weather. \u201cFor the time being [Zenab] can\u2019t [work],\u201d he says, pointing out that they have an infant to take care of. \u201cBut in the future if she\u2019s able to, why not?\u201d\n\nLooking at his children, Zaid says that even if their home country were to find peace, he wouldn\u2019t move his family back \u2013 his kids are settled here now, and are safe.\n\n\u201cMy vision of America was, Life is beautiful there,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "e7542ba089bd3f7cb77fbf2c0098bf68", "sailthru.author": "Elodie Reed", "description": "Since the Paris attacks, the program to settle Syrian refugees in the US has come under scrutiny.
