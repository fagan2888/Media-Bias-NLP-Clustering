For each health plan, it said, it will try to determine the \u201cestimated out-of-pocket costs associated with standard treatment protocols for specific medical conditions using nationally recognized clinical guidelines.\u201d The conditions, it said, are likely to include bipolar disorder, diabetes, H.I.V., rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act says that insurers must accept all applicants for coverage and cannot charge higher premiums because of a person\u2019s pre-existing conditions or disabilities. Advocates for people with H.I.V./AIDS and certain other illnesses have complained that insurers were unduly limiting access to benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKevin M. McCarty, the Florida insurance commissioner, last week reached an agreement with Humana that significantly reduces the amounts that patients must pay for drugs to treat H.I.V. Patients had been paying 50 percent for some of the more expensive H.I.V. medications. Their share will now be 10 percent.\n\nThomas T. Noland Jr., a senior vice president of Humana, said, \u201cFlorida has a unique law providing insurance-related protections to individuals with H.I.V./AIDS.\u201d Humana denied that it had violated the law, but Mr. Noland said, \u201cWe understand the affordability challenges facing those with H.I.V./AIDS because of the relatively high cost of their specialty medications.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. McCarty has reached similar, more limited agreements with two other insurers, Cigna and Coventry Health Care, a unit of Aetna.\n\nInsurers, also known as insurance issuers, typically classify drugs into three or more categories with different levels of co-payments and cost-sharing.\n\nIn its letter to insurers, the administration said, \u201cIf an issuer places most or all drugs that treat a specific condition on the highest-cost tiers, that plan design effectively discriminates against, or discourages enrollment by, individuals who have those chronic conditions.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the administration said, \u201cage limits are discriminatory when applied to services that have been found clinically effective at all ages.\u201d The administration said it would challenge restrictions on benefits if they were \u201cnot based on clinically indicated, reasonable medical management practices.\u201d\n\nAndrew Sperling, a lobbyist at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an advocacy group, said he welcomed the new standards.\n\n\u201cWhen a doctor follows recommended treatment guidelines,\u201d Mr. Sperling said, \u201cthe cost-sharing should not be so burdensome that it discourages patients from adhering to the treatment.\u201d In some health plans, he said, patients are routinely required to pay 40 percent to 50 percent of the costs for drugs to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration also issued new rules requiring insurers to improve the accuracy of publications listing their doctors and hospitals. Consumers have found that these directories are full of errors and often include doctors who are not affiliated with the insurers\u2019 health plans.\n\nBut after vigorous internal debate, the administration decided not to propose new rules that would require insurers to include more doctors and hospitals.\n\nInsurance executives had lobbied against stricter standards. They said that \u201cnarrow networks,\u201d with limited numbers of providers, allowed insurers to hold down costs.\n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners, representing state officials, is drafting a model law to guide states in regulating networks. Administration officials said they would evaluate that effort before adopting new federal standards.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141222202849, "twitter": {"description": "The
