If Senate Bill 275 passes, the entire Colorado legislature will become a \u201chealth oversight agency,\u201d and members will be able to browse individual medical records at will without penalty.\n\nIt gets worse. The bill also gives the legislature access to all information that is \u201cconfidential under state statute, federal statute, state or federal administrative rule, or a rule of the state or federal courts.\u201d\n\nThis means that the legislature also wants unfettered access to individual financial information, tax records, credit records, voting records, employment records, educational records, private court records, and anything else that individual lawmakers might want to see.\n\nThe second part of the bill says that a state employee can give \u201cany information to a member of the General Assembly.\u201d If the information is \u201cconfidential\u201d and not covered under the Colorado Open Records Act, then the legislator receiving the information does not have to make it public and disciplinary action against the employee would be prohibited.\n\nWant to mobilize votes for yourself? Have a state employee scan tax records for names and addresses of people paying student loans. Then send them a flier saying vote for you because you want to make Colorado taxpayers help in loan repayment.\n\nWhy should legislators be given unfettered access to previously confidential records? According to the bill\u2019s preamble, \u201cmembers of the general assembly may need to receive confidential information during the course of their official duties in making decisions and voting on legislation with respect to all areas of state government.\u201d It even states that the legislature oversees the \u201chealth system in Colorado.\u201d\n\nThough some of its members wish otherwise, the Colorado legislature does not yet control the \u201chealth system in Colorado.\u201d The federal government runs the Medicare and Veterans Administration. The state and the federal government run Colorado Medicaid.\n\nBut people who pay for their own care run their own affairs.\n\nThe Colorado legislature oversees the state Medicaid program, public health programs, the licensing of health care providers, laws governing health coverage, the Colorado Indigent Care Program, and a variety of grant programs required to follow federal rules. Before exempting itself from treating individual medical records with the respect required by HIPAA, the legislators supporting this bill need to explain exactly what part of the management of these entities requires giving them the power to browse confidential personal records.\n\nThe legislature might also first demonstrate that it is fit to engage in basic oversight before demanding broad new powers. In recent years it has \u201coverseen\u201d a fiscally and technically dysfunctional health exchange. It has overseen a Medicaid program that in one year paid over 800,000 claims without properly identifying who the money was being given to. And it has done little to correct the underfunding in the state pension system.\n\nAwarding new powers to government requires careful thought because government always stretches any power it is given to the absolute limit and beyond. The Colorado legislature has disguised new taxes as fees in order to avoid the requirements of the TABOR Amendment. It has worked to compromise Colorado\u2019s flat rate income tax by lowering the rate paid by favorite groups with subsidies and tax credits. Some lawmakers even want to dictate what children eat, how children play, and how many rounds gun owners can put in their magazines.\n\nIf this bill passes, members of the legislature will undoubtedly be using all kinds of confidential personal information in ways they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe bill\u2019s boilerplate pinky swear says that confidential information \u201cwill be kept confidential and used only for official legislative purposes connected to the consideration of official actions of the General Assembly.\u201d But misuse is not defined and no penalties are specified if it occurs.\n\nThis offers about as much protection to Coloradans\u2019 privacy as a cheap umbrella in a hurricane.\n\nIn a world where everyone else faces fines or worse for disclosing such confidential information, the Colorado legislators sponsoring and supporting SB 275 need to fully explain why they should be placed above the law.\n\nUpdate: SB-275 has been amended.\n\nUnfortunately, the guts of the bill remain the same. Legislators still end up exempt from the HIPPA rules the rest of us have to follow. State employees can leak any kind of presumably confidential individual information to members of the state legislature without penalty. Legislators can use the information as they wish without penalty, as long as they don\u2019t leak it to anyone else and as long as it is \u201cfor official legislative purposes connected to the consideration of official actions of the general assembly\u201d which, as noted above, pretty much covers every aspect of life.\n\nThe fact that its authors are fleeing from specifics while keeping the bill\u2019s essential mechanics intact is telling. They\u2019ve removed the clause detailing that the confidential information received by the members of the legislature may be confidential under \u201cstate statute, federal statute, state or federal administrative rule, or a rule of the state or federal courts\u201d and replaced it with the much less descriptive access to \u201cinformation that is confidential or sensitive.\u201d\n\nThe result stays largely the same. State employees can leak previously confidential things like your individual banking, health, educational, tax, and arrest records to state legislators without being penalized.\n\nClick here to read the full text of the amendment to the bill.\n\nLinda Gorman is health care policy center director at the Independence Institute, a free market think tank in Denver.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "If this bill passes, members of the legislature will undoubtedly be using all kinds of confidential personal information in ways they shouldn\u2019t.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.6", "og": {"site_name": "Complete Colorado - Page Two", "description": "If this bill passes, members of the legislature will undoubtedly be using all kinds of confidential personal information in ways they shouldn\u2019t.", "title": "Senate Bill 275: Why should members of the Colorado legislature be above the law?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 250, "identifier": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/confidential-folder-250.jpg", "height": 200}, "url": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/2015/05/01/senate-bill-275-why-should-members-of-the-colorado-legislature-be-above-the-law/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 221004171379840}, "keywords": "Colorado legilsature,Linda Gorman,medical privacy,Senate Bill 275,", "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "Senate Bill 275", "published_time": "2015-05-01T18:16:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T21:34:25+00:00", "author": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/author/admin/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "State employees can leak any kind of presumably confidential individual information to members of the state legislature without penalty.\nThe Colorado legislature has disguised new taxes as fees in order to avoid the requirements of the TABOR Amendment.\nSome members of the Colorado legislature want to be exempt from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law requiring everyone else to protect individual health information from purposeful or accidental disclosure.\nIf Senate Bill 275 passes, the entire Colorado legislature will become a \u201chealth oversight agency,\u201d and members will be able to browse individual medical records at will without penalty.\nIf this bill passes, members of the legislature will undoubtedly be using all kinds of confidential personal information in ways they shouldn\u2019t."}
