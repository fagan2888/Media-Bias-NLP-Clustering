The program also promotes public safety by providing access to 911.\u201d\n\nEnrollment in the program in Florida peaked at 1.04 million households in 2012.\n\nThat was before a new Federal Communications Commission mandate that each customer be re-certified to determine whether he or she still qualified for benefits.\n\nThe FCC rules also limit benefits to one phone line \u2014 either mobile or land line, per eligible household.\n\nThe program has become controversial, as its cost has grown nationally from $800 million in 2005, when cellphone service was added, to more than $2 billion in 2012.\n\nCongress enacted it in 1985, and it was expanded under President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nAs in past years, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest qualifying program for Lifeline Assistance in Florida.\n\nIn Florida, 21 telecommunication companies participate in the federal Lifeline program.\n\nSafeLink Wireless had the most Lifeline customers in Florida in June, with more than 450,000.\n\nIn January 2015, the PSC began receiving complaints from consumers that TracFoneWireless,d/b/a SafeLink Wireless,was signing up consumers using only a veteran\u2019s status as a qualifying Lifeline criteria, which it is not.\n\nFurther complaints and inquiries by PSC staff indicated SafeLink agents were using qualifying criteria such as being a law enforcement officer, a firefighter, a state employee, or just a resident of Florida as qualifying criteria for consumers to sign up for Lifeline, which they are not\n\nOn August 4, 2015, a conference call was held with SafeLink management to discuss this matter. SafeLink management advised the PSC staff that all agent signups in Florida had been suspended that day pending further investigation. Since that time, SafeLink fired the agent company responsible for signing up the ineligible consumers to Lifeline.\n\nAs a consolation to those veterans who have received a SafeLink phone but are ineligible,\n\nSafeLink is allowing them to keep the handset and is providing free minutes to them\n\neach month until the end of 2015\n\nIn addition, SafeLink self reported the agent scheme to the Federal Communications Commmission and Department of Justice in addition to reimbursing the federal universal service fund over $11 million.\n\nStudies have found that while the program has helped low-income people, others who were not qualified received the discounts and phones, in some cases multiple phones from various companies.\n\nTo read more click here for a recent Georgetown University study on the issue.\n\nTo apply for Lifelife assistance, Florida residents can call their local phone company, the PSC at 1-800-342-3552, or the Office of Public Counsel at 1-800-540-7039 for assistance.
