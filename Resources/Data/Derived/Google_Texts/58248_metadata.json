For those of you keeping score at home, that\u2019s 0.11 percent of state spending that Haley found objectionable.\n\nRoughly one-tenth of one percent \u2026\n\nUnreal \u2026\n\nAmazingly, this year\u2019s vetoes are actually bolder than last year\u2019s suggested cuts.\n\nIn 2014, Haley vetoed a minuscule $18.5 million out of the state\u2019s $25.1 billion budget \u2013 or 0.07 percent of the spending plan. In fact she went so far as to join liberal \u201cRepublicans\u201d in the South Carolina Senate in approving a $26 million appropriation for U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s signature education initiative \u2013 an expansion of the state\u2019s failed government-run early childhood education programs.\n\nThe year before that Haley vetoed barely $100 million out of a $22.7 billion budget (.44 percent).\n\nIn 2012, Haley vetoed $60 million \u2013 or one quarter of one percent of a $23 billion budget. Her most \u201caggressive\u201d efforts to rein in spending took place during her first year in office, when she cut $213 million (or .96 percent) from a $22.1 billion spending plan.\n\nSo yeah \u2026 in five years during which time South Carolina spent $119.4 billion on government, Haley has only vetoed $421 million.\n\nWhile South Carolina lawmakers will gather soon to address Haley\u2019s vetoes, we\u2019re going to spare you the suspense.\n\nSeriously \u2026 there\u2019s no point even debating what amounts to a rounding error.\n\nWhat makes Haley\u2019s anemic veto pen even more disappointing is it represents one of the few areas where she \u2013 an executive in a legislatively dominated state \u2013 has the potential to actually limit government growth. For every spending item Haley crosses out, state lawmakers must muster a two-thirds majority in both the S.C. House and the State Senate.\n\nHaley has shown no reticence when it comes to using her bully pulpit (albeit hypocritically) \u2026 so why isn\u2019t she using it in support of real cuts to government?\n\nEasy \u2026 she hasn\u2019t proposed any.\n\nYou can\u2019t hold lawmakers accountable for their failure to rein in excess government if you don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excess government there.\n\nSo yeah \u2026 remember this the next time Nikki Haley refers to herself as a \u201cfiscal conservative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/07/01/nikki-haley-vetoes-next-to-nothing-again/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/haley-vetoes-606x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Nikki Haley Vetoes Next-To-Nothing \u2026 Again"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce199\"", "article_summary": "For those of you keeping score at home, that\u2019s 0.11 percent of state spending that Haley found objectionable.\nThe year before that Haley vetoed barely $100 million out of a $22.7 billion budget (.44 percent).\nIn 2012, Haley vetoed $60 million \u2013 or one quarter of one percent of a $23 billion budget.\nIn 2014, Haley vetoed a minuscule $18.5 million out of the state\u2019s $25.1 billion budget \u2013 or 0.07 percent of the spending plan.\nSo yeah \u2026 remember this the next time Nikki Haley refers to herself as a \u201cfiscal conservative.\u201d"}
