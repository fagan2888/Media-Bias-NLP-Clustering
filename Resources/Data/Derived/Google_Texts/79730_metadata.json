In the final weeks before you help your student pack up for the dorm, it\u2019s a good time to pack in some money lessons as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStart with what college will cost. On average, the Class of 2015 graduated with a little over $35,000 in student loan debt, according to Edvisors (http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/05/08/congratulations-class-of-2015-youre-the-most-indebted-ever-for-now/). Depending on your financial situation and how you\u2019ve planned for your child\u2019s college education, start with an overview of how your student\u2019s college costs will impact your finances now and after graduation.\n\nIf your child will be paying off personal or student loans once they graduate, discuss how that reality should define financial choices throughout college. That doesn\u2019t mean saving every penny and having no fun at all, but such a talk should reinforce how handling money intelligently, setting priorities and getting a jump on savings can position your child for a much stronger financial start upon graduation.\n\nTrain them to budget. If your child hasn\u2019t learned budgeting skills (http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/budgeting),it\u2019s time for a crash course. Budgeting is the first essential skill in personal finance. Teaching children to budget now gives them a head start on dealing with post-graduation debt or long-term goals like affording a home or car. Because teens often live their lives on smartphones, familiarize yourself with the growing range of budgeting apps (http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/04/27/budgeting-apps-affect-spending-habits/26190991/) to keep their money management on course.\n\nTalk through on-campus banking and credit needs. Many parents start their kids with custodial savings and checking accounts at their local bank when they are younger. If your bank has branches in the teen\u2019s college town, that relationship can easily continue. Responsible credit card use is also wise to start in college. Keep in mind that The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (or Credit CARD) Act of 2009 requires that anyone under 21 without independent income have a co-signer to qualify for a card. As such, you\u2019ll be able to keep track of your child\u2019s credit use. However, if they default, you\u2019ll be on the hook \u2013 so monitor your child\u2019s bank and credit relationships closely until you agree they\u2019re ready to manage them on their own.\n\nCover credit monitoring and identity theft. With smarter online thieves emerging every day, your child is at risk of identity theft from the minute he or she is assigned a Social Security number. While most teens generally don\u2019t have a credit report until they start earning a paycheck at age 16, be on the lookout for fraudulent activity earlier (http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0040-child-identity-theft) and make sure they get in the habit of ordering the three free credit reports (https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action) they are entitled to each year. Throughout college, consider sitting down with children so you can review their annual credit reports together.\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s plenty to do in the final weeks before your kids leave for college. Don\u2019t forget to reinforce important money lessons before they go.\n\nNathaniel Sillin directs Visa\u2019s financial education programs.
