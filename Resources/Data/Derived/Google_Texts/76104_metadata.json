Pieces can go for a few dollars to $50 or more.\n\nParticipants use the income for more art supplies, maybe a hot meal or even a night or two in a hotel when temperatures plummet, said Heidi Lee, the program\u2019s artist-in-residence.\n\nCommon Art is now held every Wednesday, without fail, at Emmanuel Episcopal Church on swank Newbury Street \u2013 even when Wednesday falls on Christmas, or during the worst of winter storms.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when people really need a place to go,\u201d said Lee, whose job is to provide instruction, advice and encouragement.\n\nArt is just one example of the creative outlets that shelters and homeless organizations across the country offer, said Megan Hustings, interim director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. Several cities have street newspapers. Some shelters offer writing and poetry workshops, or even dance, aerobics and yoga classes.\n\n\u201cHomelessness is very difficult, it can be very debilitating, and when you\u2019re going through stressful times \u2026 having the opportunity to have some kind of normalized experience is very positive,\u201d she said.\n\nHaubrich typically creates mountain scenes using acrylic paints on canvas, but has branched out recently to animals.\n\nHis mountain scenes are inspired by the late Bob Ross, the soft-spoken, bushy-haired art instructor on the PBS series \u201cThe Joy of Painting,\u201d he said. The program has boosted his self-worth, and taught him how to get along with others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned how to respect one another, how to respect different cultures, and I\u2019ve learned responsibility, leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nArtistic experience is not necessary.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even draw a stick figure when I started here,\u201d said Jeff Shaw, who mixes joint compound with paint to create abstract works.\n\nAll are welcome, whether they choose to participate in artistic expression or not.\n\nOn a recent rainy Wednesday, one man sat quietly on the perimeter of the room absorbed in a book. Others spread out sleeping bags and blankets on the stage and fell asleep. Some people just hung out, chatting. Some just showed up for a cup of coffee and a hot meal.\n\nAnd that\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to create,\u201d Grant-Rose said. \u201cIt\u2019s about community. We welcome everybody.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nOnline: https://www.facebook.com/commonartboston\n\n\u2014 Written by Mark Pratt\n\n\u00a9 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
