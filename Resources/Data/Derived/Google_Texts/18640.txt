About 70 stores that will include some outlet mainstays will be open for business before the end of the year at a regional outlet mall in Southaven.

The Commercial Appeal reports officials announced of the retailers at Friday's groundbreaking.

The 310,000-square-foot mall development at Interstate 55 and Church Road, just south of the existing Southaven Towne Center retail area.

As models showed off fashions from each store, Tanger Factory Outlets President Steven B. Tanger ran through a partial list of tenants: Gap Outlet, Banana Republic Factory Store, White House-Black Market, Columbia, Ann Taylor Factory Store, Under Armour, Chico's Outlet, Loft Outlet, Kay Jewelers Outlet, Guess Factory Store, Skechers and Pandora.

Tanger said more tenants will be announced as the center nears a projected Nov. 19 grand opening.
