Rassbach, a deputy general counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who has closely followed the issue, welcomed the order.\n\n\u201cThis is another instance in which the government fought all the way to the Supreme Court and lost again,\u201d Mr. Rassbach said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the government have something better to do than fight charities serving the poor?\u201d Plaintiffs in the case included the Roman Catholic bishop of Pittsburgh, the Most Rev. David A. Zubik, and Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn their lawsuit, Zubik v. Burwell, they challenged procedures established by the Obama administration to address religious objections to a federal requirement for coverage of birth control. The Affordable Care Act generally requires insurers and health plans to cover preventive services without co-payments or deductibles, and the administration has said that those services include all approved forms of contraception for women.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn February, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, rejected challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement filed by Bishop Zubik and a number of nonprofit organizations that objected to it on religious grounds. The court said that the nonprofit groups were \u201celigible for an accommodation to the contraceptive coverage requirement,\u201d and that this arrangement \u201cplaces no substantial burden\u201d on them.\n\nUnder the accommodation, the court said, the nonprofit religious groups can refuse to pay for contraceptive services. If that happens, the court said, \u201ccoverage for those services will be independently provided\u201d by an insurance company or by a third party that administers health benefits for the organization.\n\nThe plaintiffs said the accommodation violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 because it forced them to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the provision of coverage for contraceptive services.\n\nReligious groups can minimize their role by sending the government a form certifying their objections, but that does not make them \u201ccomplicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage,\u201d the appeals court said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150629214306, "twitter": {"description": "An order bars the Obama administration from enforcing
