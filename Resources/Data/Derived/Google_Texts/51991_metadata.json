In fact, DNews recently filmed an entire video on one of the most popular ways we categorize others: personality.\n\nWhile the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator suggests there are 16 personalities, the ones we commonly hear are type A and type B. These two personality types were first defined in the 1950s by a couple of cardiologists who were looking at differences in personality as possible causes for heart disease. They found that type A people were much more likely to have heart disease, a claim that has since been questioned. But what does that even mean?\n\nTraditionally, type A people are described as bossy, competitive, and impatient, but also very diligent workers. Type B people are the opposite \u2014 relaxed, easygoing, and they often \"go with the flow.\" And yet, people don't always fit neatly into these two types.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more, plus the advantages associated with each personality type.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "personality, types, explained, what, it, really, means, be, type, or, b", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People's personalities may be more more nuanced than we think.", "title": "Common Personality Types, Explained", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/personality-types-explained-what-it-really-means-be-type-or-b-366138", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/19/personality.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People's personalities may be more more nuanced than we think.", "title": "Common Personality Types, Explained", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/personality-types-explained-what-it-really-means-be-type-or-b-366138", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/19/personality.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/19/personality.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-12-19T16:08:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-19T16:08:17-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People's personalities may be more more nuanced than we think."}, "article_summary": "While the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator suggests there are 16 personalities, the ones we commonly hear are type A and type B.\nType B people are the opposite \u2014 relaxed, easygoing, and they often \"go with the flow.\"\nThey found that type A people were much more likely to have heart disease, a claim that has since been questioned.\nWatch the video above to learn more, plus the advantages associated with each personality type.\nWe love to categorize different aspects of ourselves, but perhaps not as much as we love to categorize other people."}
