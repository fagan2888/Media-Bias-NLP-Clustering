The nurses at Viera are nicer, and quicker to respond, said Cook, 42.\n\n\u201cI just think that Viera\u2019s more professional,\u201d said Cook. \u201cI mean, when I had my seizures at Wuesthoff, it seems like I had to wait and wait and wait. The people there, they seem like they treat you like a number, more than like somebody that\u2019s alive, that has a beating heart and has feelings.\u201d\n\nCook is not alone. In April\u2019s release of federal patient-opinion surveys of hospitals, Viera joined Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Sacred Heart Hospital on the Gulf in Port St. Joe, and Mariners Hospital in Tavernier as just four of 165 Florida hospitals in the state earning the highest rating possible -- five stars.\n\nMeanwhile, Wuesthoff in Rockledge was at the bottom of the list, one of 11 Florida hospitals accorded just one star.\n\nAn updated star-rating report came out in late July. In that report, six Florida hospitals earned five-star ratings, and 18 received just one star. The new five star hospitals are Jay Hospital in Jay, and Sacred Heart on the Emerald Coast in Miramar. The interactive map below shows that most recent information.\n\nWuesthoff and Viera hospitals are just eight miles apart along I-95, north of Melbourne and south of Cape Canaveral. Taken together, the hospitals\u2019 scores made Brevard County the only one in the state that had both a one-star and a five-star hospital.\n\nThe patient survey results are just the latest in a rollout of five-star ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that began in 2008 with nursing homes. Since then, the agency has added the five-star ratings symbols to indicate quality on Medicare Advantage plans, prescription drug plans, hospitals and home-health agencies.\n\nThe hope is that patients will learn to use the government-sponsored websites (Hospital Compare, Nursing Home Compare, etc.) the same way shoppers refer to Consumer Reports when buying an appliance or car.\n\nThe data are compiled from mail and phone surveys to a representative sample of adult patients after their discharge from a hospital. They are asked about cleanliness, speed of response to a call button, pain control and how well the nurses and doctors kept them informed. The hospital gets credit only if the answer is \"always\"; \"usually\" doesn't count.\n\nDonald Davidson of Satellite Beach, who was recently in Viera Hospital for heart tests, said he chose that hospital when he moved to the area four years ago because it was new. Davidson, 69, said he gave Viera high ratings on surveys following his two previous stays for knee operations.\n\nThe food is good, Davidson said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve always been treated well here. I think they\u2019re well-trained.\u201d\n\nThe star ratings are derived from percentages in the survey results, and are graded on a curve. In percentage terms, Viera was above average and Wuesthoff was below average on all 11 questions on the survey. The national and state averages were midway between the two.\n\nOn the survey results released in April, 90 percent of patients from Viera strongly agreed that they \u201cwould definitely recommend the hospital to others,\u201d compared with just 53 percent of patients from Wuesthoff.\n\nWuesthoff Health System declined a request to be interviewed for this story. Communications Director Diana Vandemark issued a written statement that noted there has been a changed of management since the period in which the survey data were gathered.\n\nWuesthoff\u2019s new owner, Tennessee-based Community Health Systems (CHS), brought \u201cnew resources to support our work to provide quality care and a positive patient experience through training and education on best practices,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe hospital already has embarked on a number of new initiatives, Vandemark said, including more frequent rounds to see patients, bedside shift reports and follow-up calls to discharged patients.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives are already showing a positive impact on communication, responsiveness and overall satisfaction,\u201d Vandemark wrote. \u201cWe are committed to our patients and their families and remain focused on meeting their expectations for quality, service and environment of care.\u201d\n\nRatings? What Ratings?\n\nSince the hospital star-rating system was announced in April, there has been little attention paid to it. The directors of both the local health planning agency and a health foundation said they hadn\u2019t heard about Brevard\u2019s unique status with a five-star and a one-star hospital.\n\nBut the ratings matter have an impact on hospital finances \u2013 increasingly so. Viera\u2019s five-star rating will bring it $100,000 in Medicare bonuses this year, officials there said, and an equally high rating for next year would bring in even more.\n\nWuesthoff\u2019s one-star rating could mean a pay cut, but both CMS and Wuesthoff said they were unable to provide that information.\n\nSteven G. Ullmann, director of programs in the Center for Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami, said the survey draws responses from two groups: those who are really angry and those who are really happy.\n\nUsually less than half return them, said Ullman, an economist and bioethics expert.\n\n\u201cMost response rates are in the 20-to-30% range,\u201d Ullmann said. \u201cSo therefore you have to take any of these rankings with a grain of salt \u2026 Having said that, they can provide a facility insight on where it may be experiencing issues.\u201d\n\nBrevard County resident Meesha Cook said she was first admitted to Wuesthoff in December 2011, right after doctors confirmed her diagnosis of MS. She stayed just over a week in the mental health unit being treated for depression.\n\n\u201cIt was very dirty, the floors, you wouldn\u2019t want to walk on the floor even to go to the bathroom,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as I got out of bed I grabbed my socks and put them on because I was afraid I was going to get some strange disease\u2026\n\n\u201cI had to ask for a pair of socks twice a day, because I would pull my socks off and they would be black. It was disgusting.\u201d\n\nAs a full-time employee at Lowe's, Cook had health insurance to cover that stay. But in 2012, as she grew weaker, she had to cut her hours, which meant she lost her insurance coverage. Two stays at Wuesthoff following seizures resulted in bills totaling $19,000 that she couldn\u2019t pay.\n\nCourt records show Wuesthoff filed suit against her for non-payment. A letter in the file Cook wrote to Wuesthoff explained her MS and lack of insurance and begged for a break. She didn't get it.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t (pay), I don\u2019t have the money,\u201d said Cook, who estimates her annual income at less than $11,000. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. They just want their money \u2013 no ifs, ands or buts.\u201d\n\nCooks says things were quite different after she suffered a seizure at home and was taken to Viera Hospital in 2013.\n\n\u201cViera Hospital told me about charity care,\u201d something Wuesthoff had never mentioned, she said.\n\nShowing its age\n\nThe differences between the hospitals start with their age: Wuesthoff in Rockledge is 74 years old. It was named for Eugene Wuesthoff, a winter visitor whose heirs provided $12,500 in start-up funds.\n\nFor most of those years, Wuestoff was an independent not-for-profit, but four years ago a Naples corporation bought it. That company, Health Management Associates, was purchased two years ago by CHS, the current owner.\n\nOn the outside, Wuesthoff has a bright new paint job. Inside, though, it looks dated and drab, with dim fluorescent lights and two patients to a room. It sits on a hill, flanked by small houses of considerable age and fronted by shabby shops.\n\nBy contrast, 4-year-old Viera sits on a 50-acre campus that includes a fitness center and medical office building in a prosperous suburb surrounded by golf courses and lakes.\n\nHealth First, a non-profit health network based in Melbourne, equipped the hospital with the latest technology, all-private rooms, high ceilings and a flood of natural light.\n\nViera Hospital has just 100 beds, about one-third the number at Wuesthoff. And it offers a helipad for quick transport to Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, among the state\u2019s most sophisticated trauma centers.\n\nAcing the test\n\nViera\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Deborah Angerami says the hospital didn't always come out on top in patient surveys. Last year, when she saw how Viera compared with other hospitals, she became concerned.\n\n\u201cAt the time, our scores en masse were the 24th percentile, so we were performing worse than 76 percent of the hospitals in the country,\u201d she said.\n\nAngerami and others drilled down into the results for each question and found a big problem: doctors\u2019 comparatively poor communication skills. Patients said the medical staff didn't keep them informed or treat them with respect, she discovered.\n\nDoctors on the hospital\u2019s medical executive committee took on the challenge of making the staff aware of what wasn\u2019t working and how to change. Two of the incentives: they threatened to cut off new-patient referrals to low-scorers. And they posted survey scores in the doctors\u2019 lounge. While they were listed by ID numbers, it didn\u2019t take doctors long to match the numbers with names. That got results, said Angerami.\n\n\u201cMost folks just didn\u2019t realize there were small behaviors that really meant a lot to the patient,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you sit down when you talk to them? Do you ask them before you leave the room: \u2018Is there anything else I can answer for you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nViera Surgeon Kenneth Tieu said he earned 98 percent approval by staying cheerful, getting test results back to patients quickly, and visiting patients far more often than he has to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in between (surgical) cases right now,\u201d he said recently when approached during a break on a patient floor. \u201cI do surgery all day, but I come up here two to three times a day.\u201d\n\nDr. George Walker, medical director at Viera Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department, says it\u2019s especially important for physicians to speak soothingly to patients there because they are terrified.\n\n\u201cA simple thing like going into a patient\u2019s room and sitting down, even if it\u2019s for five seconds,\u201d he said, \u201cmakes a huge impact on the way the patient perceives you.\u201d\n\nThe survey results are one of three measures that go into CMS\u2019 Hospital Value-based Purchasing Program, which grew out of a quality initiative that began in 2001 and was beefed up by the Affordable Care Act in 2011.\n\nIt adjusts Medicare payments to hospitals up or down depending on how they score on a mix of the three. The other measures are less subjective: cost-efficiency and quality-of-care comparisons, including the percentage of patients readmitted within 90 days.\n\nThe five-star system that CMS uses for its patient opinion surveys will eventually be broadened to include the cost-efficiency and quality-of-care measures, the agency says.\n\nSome criticize tying patient-opinion surveys to payments since most patients don't have enough medical knowledge to rate their quality of care.\n\nBut Dr. Donald Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, said he insisted on including patient-opinion surveys in the new hospital payment system when serving as President Barack Obama\u2019s CMS administrator in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\u201cThe patient is the boss; we are the servants,\u201d he said. \u201cThey, not others, should direct their own care, and the doctors, nurses and hospitals should know and honor what the patient wants.\u201d\n\nSpecial Correspondent Carol Gentry is a reporter for WUSF in Tampa.
