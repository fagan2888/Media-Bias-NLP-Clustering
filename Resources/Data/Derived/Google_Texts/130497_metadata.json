FIU is making sure that every student is covered by a health insurance.\n\nUnder the merger, Student Health has a new model to follow in providing medical care. It is a four-step process whose first two keeps operations the same for SH.\n\nStudents visit the clinic and if they require more than what SH can provide, or need more than 30 days of monitoring, they are referred to FIU Health or a health care provider that has the specialist he or she needs.\n\nSteps three and four are focused on health insurance enrollment and managing the health of the student population as a whole.\n\nThe University\u2019s Collaborative for Health Economics and Strategic Solutions, in a model they created, suggested FIU use the student health fee to reduce the cost of health insurance.\n\nThe health fee is one of several mandatory fees charged to all students as part of their tuition each semester. Every student pays $93.69 as part of the health fee regardless of the number of credits taken.\n\nHodgkins-Beckley Consulting | Stephen L. Beckley and Associates gave the University the option of requiring health insurance as a condition of enrollment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for us to say,\u201d Roldan said about whether FIU requires students to have health insurance.\n\nStudent Health\u2019s clinical services \u2013 the doctors, nurses and pharmacists \u2013 were merged with the University\u2019s healthcare provider, FIU Health, July 1.\n\n\u201cWe work for the College of Medicine, as well for the community and the campus,\u201d said FIU Health chief executive officer, Eneida Roldan. \u201cFIU Health, Healthcare Network, the Faculty Practice in the eye of the consumer are all one,\u201d she said.\n\nFIU Health is evaluating its new integrated services, according to Roldan the former president and CEO of the Jackson Health System from June 2009 to May 2011.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011 the hospital suffered from financial losses that cost them up to $419 million.\n\nRoldan submitted a volunteer resignation effective May 31, 2011 that coincided with the expiration of her contract, according to an email from Edwin O\u2019Dell, JHS spokesman.\n\nRoldan did not respond to requests from Student Media for a followup interview.\n\nShe was also president and CEO of Pan American Hospital and guided Pan American Hospital out of bankruptcy which it filed protection for in March 2004.\n\nSistema de Salud Metropolitano, a hospital operator in Puerto Rico, won a bankruptcy court bidding in 2006, paid $34 million for Pan American Hospital, converted the nonprofit into a for-profit, and renamed it Metropolitan Hospital.\n\nRoldan remained CEO during its transition of ownership.\n\nUnder a merged college health system, Roldan said FIU Health will stay the same and Student Health Services will have their \u201cback up and support.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re integrating services you\u2019re enhancing services for your customer base, in this case it would be students,\u201d said Roldan.\n\nRoldan develops collaboration and programs across the medical school with international and clinical partners as associate dean of International Affairs. She is also associate professor of Pathology.\n\nFaculty from the College of Medicine see patients in the Ambulatory Care Center as part of their FIU Health workload.\n\n\u201cThese are professors, but we all have had patients and we all have practiced before,\u201d Roldan said.\n\nFIU Health has some of the same clinical positions as SHS but lacks a pharmacy.\n\nRoldan said FIU Health is considered an outpatient clinic site. These provide care for patients whose ailments do not require overnight stays.\n\nShe said the type of specialty care a student needs will determine the service FIU Health gives them.\n\n\u201cWe always decide on clinical, never on economics,\u201d Roldan said. \u201cWe are first and foremost healthcare providers.\u201d\n\nThe specialties of FIU Health\u2019s 18 doctors include disorders of the joints and muscles, the female reproductive system, reproductive medicine, mental health and treatment of conditions with the intestinal tract and liver.\n\nThe clinic is an option for students, according to Roldan.\n\nStudent Health has doctors and advanced registered nurses who provide primary care and are specialists in the areas of mental health, women\u2019s health, the heart, skin conditions and eating disorders.\n\n\u201cIf the service could be done within Student Health it\u2019ll stay in Student Health,\u201d Roldan said.\n\nHealthcare navigators are new positions the University created for the purpose of getting students to a healthcare provider and enrolled into health insurance. There will be one at the Modesto Maidique Campus and one at the Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\nCounseling and Psychological Services, the Victim Empowerment Program and the Disability Resource Center still work for the Division of Student Affairs.\n\n\u201cThat does not mean students are not getting the same services,\u201d Roldan said. \u201cStill the health factor will be provided to the student, and it\u2019s seamless.\u201d\n\nThe University will increase its promotion of wellness as being a part of the health of any person, college student or otherwise.\n\nRoldan said \u201cwe have to educate individuals on what the definition of health is\u201d and cited the World Health Organization\u2019s definition for health which she said is a \u201cholistic approach to making a person well.\u201d\n\nThe WHO\u2019s definition states health is \u201ca complete state of physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d\n\nRoldan said Student Health fits the WHO\u2019s definition and that any health environment should be similar.\n\n\u201cHealth is not just you\u2019re unhealthy and the doctor needs to give you a prescription,\u201d Roldan said. \u201cA person has a brain and a spirit.\u201d\n\nphilippe.buteau@fiusm.com\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaCare says that after a child turns 26, they are no longer protected by their family\u2019s health insurance.
