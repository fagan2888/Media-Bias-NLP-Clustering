I was a college kid with a press credential from the University of Colorado\u2019s radio station, KUCB. The idea was to get sound \u2014 on cassette tape \u2014 for the sports show my brother and I hosted. Roughly five people listened to our broadcasts, so even arm-twisting a backup catcher into talking about Denver\u2019s potential as a major-league city represented a victory.\n\nI sneaked onto a back field at the Ray Kroc Baseball Complex, and there Tony Gwynn was, taking swings. It was as if I had stumbled into the recording studio to find Mozart.\n\nGwynn finished, and I walked over to him. I stopped playing baseball the year before and wanted to know everything about the game. I asked Gwynn if he had a second \u2014 not realizing the protocol of setting up an interview with a star major-leaguer. Gwynn smiled, and sat down. My first questions were like Chris Farley talking to Paul McCartney in a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit \u2014 \u201cSo you, um, are on, um, on the Padres?\u201d\n\nPhotos: Tony Gwynn\u2019s Hall of Fame career\n\nBlog: Tony Gwynn Jr. responds to father\u2019s death\n\nGwynn laughed \u2014 a memorable cackle I heard many times over the years \u2014 quickly putting me at ease. We talked for 45 minutes. I entered the rest of my life that day, realizing I wanted to write about pro sports for a living.\n\nGwynn died Monday from cancer, gone far too soon at age 54. I knew Gwynn wasn\u2019t well, as he had taken a medical leave from his position as San Diego State\u2019s baseball coach. I had no idea that oral cancer, which he traced to his years of chewing tobacco, had returned with such vengeance.\n\nGwynn ranks as one of the three greatest hitters I witnessed, alongside Albert Pujols and Barry Bonds. Gwynn lacked power, by choice, refusing to compromise his average for big swings. He turned batting into a science, evolving from a skinny singles hitter to a plump 30-something outfielder who revolutionized the sport with his use of video analysis.\n\nGwynn finished with 3,141 hits and a .338 career batting average, the highest since Ted Williams retired. The numbers are even better than you think. Gwynn batted .302 with two strikes. He hit .311 when the pitcher was ahead in the count. No wonder former Rockies outfielder Dante Bichette never took his Triple Crown bid seriously in 1995.\n\n\u201cI knew in my heart I was never going to get it, because there was no way I was beating Tony for the batting title,\u201d Bichette said Monday. \u201cI took pride in hitting with two strikes. But there was no one like him. He hit better with two strikes than the rest of the league hit with no strikes.\u201d\n\nBichette appreciated Gwynn\u2019s mastery of his craft, replaying his at-bats to pick up pointers, and to this day tells his ball-playing sons of Gwynn\u2019s approach, which blended remarkable eyesight and hand coordination with a relentless work ethic.\n\n\u201cI loved watching him face a rookie pitcher. The guy would get ahead 0-2. Tony would take two close pitches, and spoil another one,\u201d Bichette said. \u201cThen he\u2019d drive a shot between short and third. It was a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nGwynn played out his entire career as a Padre, turning down bigger money elsewhere. He retired in 2001, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame the same year as Cal Ripken Jr., in 2007. Writers adored him, shown by the 97 percent he received in the Hall of Fame voting.\n\nIn my 14 seasons covering baseball, I loved going to San Diego. I smiled as I drove down Tony Gwynn Way outside of Petco Park. Anytime I heard Gwynn\u2019s voice \u2014 he had a country music singer\u2019s twang \u2014 in the press box, I headed in that direction. I knew we could talk hitting, usually discussing one of his favorites, Todd Helton.\n\nGwynn fought cancer off like an 0-2 slider. He maintained his dignity, and his love for the game. He was a good man who shaped lives, including that of a naive kid reporter wandering aimlessly through the desert.\n\n\u201cA sad day,\u201d Bichette said. \u201cMan \u2026 He was a joy to be around and watch. I don\u2019t know if there will ever be anyone like him. The bat was a wand in his hand.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
