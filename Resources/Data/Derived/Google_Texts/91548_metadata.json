The decision also pleased health insurance companies and hospitals, which had feared the insurance market would collapse in Texas and elsewhere if the decision went the other way.\n\n\u201cThis will give me a chance to find work and provide for myself,\u201d said Geoffrey Lachman of Dallas, who suffers from debilitating psoriasis and depends on a $259 tax credit to help pay his monthly premium.\n\nTexas Republicans, such as White House hopefuls Ted Cruz and Rick Perry, blasted the decision and said it raises the stakes in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nFor the second time in three years, Chief Justice John Roberts helped save President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement from a potentially crippling legal challenge. Roberts sided with the court\u2019s four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy to say that although Congress included sloppy wording in the law, it clearly intended for federal health insurance subsidies to be available to all who qualify, no matter which state they live in.\n\n\u201cThe tax credits are among the act\u2019s key reforms, involving billions of dollars in spending each year and affecting the price of health insurance for millions of people,\u201d Roberts wrote in the 6-3 decision.\n\n\u201cWhether those credits are available on federal exchanges is thus a question of deep \u2018economic and political significance\u2019 that is central to this statutory scheme; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly.\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia called the decision purely political.\n\n\u201cUnder all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government should lose this case,\u201d Scalia wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. \u201cBut normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.\u201d\n\nWhat Congress meant\n\nOf the 50 states, only 16 created their own insurance marketplaces, called exchanges, where residents could buy individual coverage under the health care law. The other 34 instead let their exchanges be operated by the U.S. government.\n\nThe four Virginians who brought the case had insisted that federal subsidies provided for under the health care law were only for those who buy insurance from exchanges created by the 16 states. Those who live in Virginia, Texas and the 32 other states that refused to do so aren\u2019t entitled to the subsidies, they argued. The Obama administration, though, maintained that Congress intended to give subsidies to those who qualified no matter which state they live in.\n\nHad the court ruled the other way, the impact in Texas and elsewhere would have been dramatic. As many as 6.4 million Americans could have found themselves suddenly facing much higher premiums. In Texas, at least 830,000 people received subsidies to purchase insurance \u2014 with an estimated 190,000 of them in Dallas and Tarrant counties alone.\n\nEven Texans who buy insurance without subsidies \u2014 there are at least 134,000 who don\u2019t qualify for the help \u2014 would have been drastically affected.\n\nRoberts\u2019 opinion reflected the worries about the consequences if the subsidies were struck down.\n\n\u201cThe combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a state\u2019s individual insurance market into a death spiral,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd those effects would not be limited to individuals who purchase insurance on the exchanges. Because the act requires insurers to treat the entire individual market as a single risk pool, premiums outside the exchange would rise along with those inside the exchange.\n\n\u201cIt is implausible that Congress meant the act to operate in this manner.\u201d\n\nMany politicians in deep-red Texas lambasted the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court abandoned the Constitution to resuscitate a failing health care law,\u201d said Gov. Greg Abbott, expressing an opinion widely shared by other Texas leaders.\n\n\u2018To fight another day\u2019\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, though, noted that the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the subsidies flowing to Texans are worth at least $2.5 billion a year.\n\n\u201cDespite nonstop partisan political attacks on the Affordable Care Act, thousands in our communities and across our state have affordable health insurance coverage,\u201d Turner said.\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of the decision was already felt in Rowlett, where one recipient of the subsidies said she appreciated the court\u2019s allowing her to keep an $86 monthly tax credit.\n\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go to expand Medicaid for the folks in Texas who are completely left out,\u201d Daryn DeZengotita said. \u201cWe live to fight another day.\u201d\n\nTexas hospitals \u201ccan breathe a sigh of relief\u201d because they didn\u2019t lose as many as 1 million paying customers \u2014 the likely result if the decision had been to kill the subsidies, said Ted Shaw, president of the Texas Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cThis is very positive for hospitals and health systems,\u201d added Joel Allison, CEO of Baylor Scott & White, Texas\u2019s largest not-for-profit health care system. \u201cThere was a concern that there would have been a real challenge for the health insurance industry in Texas, and the impact on hospitals would have been immediate.\u201d\n\nOfficials at Parkland Memorial Hospital also were pleased. Dallas County residents who lost subsidies probably would have relied more on the already struggling public health system.\n\n\u201cThese subsidies are important for Dallas County taxpayers as well as our patients,\u201d said hospital spokesman Mike Malaise, noting that Parkland delivered $751 million in uncompensated care last year, most of it covered by local hospital taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision does not solve the issues Texas has in terms of health care funding and the high volume of uninsured patients,\u201d Malaise said. \u201cBut it will help more North Texans maintain health care coverage, which would otherwise be beyond their reach.\u201d\n\n\u2018We dodged one bullet\u2019\n\nOther state health care providers, though, said huge challenges remain.\n\n\u201cIt just means we dodged one bullet, and there are five left in the chamber,\u201d said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. He was referring to uncertainty over whether $6.2 billion a year in special federal Medicaid \u201cwaiver\u201d money will continue to flow to Texas. Cuts in the federal health care law to some pools of money for hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care are also a worry.\n\nCommunity health clinics lobbyist Jos\u00e9 E. Camacho of Austin said a standoff over the Medicaid waiver between Abbott\u2019s administration and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services could not only remove the $6.2 billion a year but also force the state to roll back a recent expansion of Medicaid managed care, causing \u201ctremendous disruption to the entire system.\u201d\n\nCamacho, whose group represents clinics such as Los Barrios and Mission East Dallas, said that even though the subsidies continue for the working poor and lower-middle class in the marketplace, there\u2019s an even larger number of Texas adults with lower incomes who are completely shut out.\n\n\u201cThe adults under 100 percent of poverty are not eligible for any kind of coverage because of Texas\u2019 decision not to expand Medicaid or do any kind of alternative coverage expansion,\u201d he said.\n\nEven some conservatives saw Thursday\u2019s decision as a chance for America and its politicians to move past fighting over whether the law should stay or be scrapped.\n\nConservative health policy analyst John Davidson of the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation said state policymakers should concentrate on lowering health care costs.\n\n\u201cThe Texas Legislature has allowed our health care system in Texas to remain behind much of the rest of the country,\u201d Davidson said.\n\nHe said legislators should override the Texas Medical Board and encourage more use of telemedicine, while allowing advanced-practice registered nurses to \u201cbe primary care providers like in 20 other states.\u201d\n\nMichael A.
