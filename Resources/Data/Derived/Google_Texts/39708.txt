Sioux City, IA

Most drivers hate them: Those traffic cameras that look for speeders on the interstate in Sioux City.

But you better get used to it.

"I still believe the Sioux City Ordinance is an unreasonable excercise of the government's power," plaintiff Michael Jacobsma said.



KMEG News reports that on August 6, 2012, Michael Jacobsma was detected by Sioux City Traffic cameras on I-29 Northbound. Since then, it's been a battle in the courts, going all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court.

In a unanimous decision, the High Court affirmed the lower court's ruling that Jacobsma was responsible for the citation issued to him, and that the cameras are in fact constitutional.



"Well, I'm disappointed and I disagree with the court's opinion. I respect the court's opinion, though, and that's what we'll have to abide by," Jacobsma said.



Nicole Jensen was one of the city attorneys representing Sioux City, and she says the city is pleased by the court's decision.



"There were several claims made in regards to due process and Constitutional Rights. The city felt the ordinance was in fact proper and hoped the court would find it exactly as it did," Jensen said.



Jacobsma says that the bigger picture behind the court's ruling is that other towns and cities in Iowa could implement similar ordinances; and he says that's a slippery slope.

"Unfortunately, I think the court's decision gives legal authority now to other cities all over Iowa to basically take a motorist or a person's money without having to prove they committed the violation," Jacobsma said.



Jacobsma's next course of action would be to petition the US Supreme Court to grant him Writ of Certiorari and hear the case.

He has 90 days to file a petition.
