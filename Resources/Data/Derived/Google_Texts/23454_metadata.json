But by applying the softer term \u201cscam,\u201d instead, we are able to paint a fairly clear picture of who this charlatan is \u2014 and to pose the essential question: \u201cDoes this charismatic, smooth-talking, always smiling and openly \u2018Progressive\u2019 (code word for socialist) president scam just a little, or does he truly scam a LOT?\u201d Knowing that the list below could be twice as long if word-count permitted, consider the following examples:\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nSCAM # 1 \u2014 He continues to assert \u201ctransparency\u201d in all matters, but there is very little or none. There is, instead, a Vast Left-Wing Cover-Up of his birthplace records, his Marxist and Muslim parentage and upbringing, his school records from grammar to graduate, his passport and Social Security records, his radical-Left personal and professional associations, his Harvard Law and book writing records, and his dozens of far-left (and non-vetted) regulatory \u201cczars.\u201d\n\nSCAM # 2 \u2014 He continues to assert \u201cbipartisanship\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d\u2013but there is little of those either, with most of his dealings with Congress crafted behind closed doors and with most legislation in the form of gigantic \u201cContinuing Resolutions,\u201d rather than as products of the Regular Order as envisioned by the Constitution.\n\nIn the cases of Obamacare and \u201cclimate change,\u201d BUYpartisanship might be a more accurate spelling where just enough Democrats seem to favor whatever \u201cDeemocrat\u201d Obama deems to be \u201cbest for America.\u201d Over 20 times, he has deemed Obamacare amended without Congress\u2019 approval. (The House is seeking an injunction, but when if ever will that overturn of a scofflaw President be granted?)\n\nSCAM # 3 \u2014 He promised not to sign any healthcare measure that \u201cadds a single dime to the deficit,\u201d but deceitfully front-loaded taxes and back-loaded benefits under guidance from clever activists who contrived \u201cscoring\u201d schemes that hid trillions of such \u201csingle dimes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn this regard, recall the central role of the establishment media and MIT professor Jonathan Gruber in keeping the public so ill-informed that they seemed \u201cstupid\u201d but were merely being kept ignorant of what many \u201csingle payer\u201d radicals were contriving \u2014 all the way back to the failed Hillarycare scheme of the 1990s, on which Obamacare was almost entirely based.\n\nSCAM # 4 \u2014 He pledged repeatedly not to raise the taxes of anyone earning less than such-and-such amount \u2014 a number which kept getting smaller \u2014 and cynically labeled $250 \u201cstimulus\u201d handouts as \u201ctax cuts for 95-percent of all taxpayers,\u201d and then added over 20 new Obamacare taxes by calling them \u201cfees\u201d and \u201cpenalties.\u201d Even the Supreme Court was scammed into a 5-4 vote of approval.\n\nSCAM # 5 \u2013 He assured that there would no role for \u201clobbyists\u201d in his Administration, but has made so many exceptions and end-runs as to render this pledge a prima facie lie. (Surely, former SEIU President Andy Stern, who virtually lived in the White House in the early days, would never \u201clobby\u201d the President.)\n\nSCAM # 6 \u2014 He pretends to have left the Black Liberation Theology church, when he has merely distanced himself from the \u201cGod-damn America\u201d Reverend Jeremiah Wright \u2013 while then appointing similar radicals to his White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Initiatives, and naming the Cuban expatriate Liberation Theology theologian, Miguel Diaz, as his fox-in-the-henhouse ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nSCAM # 7 \u2014 He claims not to be a socialist but a \u201cProgressive,\u201d instead \u2014 when the latter has long been the radical-Left\u2019s code word for the former, and when even such \u201cDeath to America\u201d socialists and communists as Fidel Castro, \u201cChe\u201d Guevara, Hugo Chavez, and Daniel Ortega have often called themselves \u201cProgressives.\u201d\n\nSCAM # 8 \u2014 He talks of \u201cenergy independence\u201d and \u201csustainability\u201d but opposes \u201cfracking\u201d for natural gas, expansion of clean coal and nuclear power, and most new oil and gas development on Federal Lands. These are job-killing policies of Less Energy at Higher Prices, especially when combined with mandates for ruinously low \u201ccarbon footprints\u201d on the use of all fossil fuels \u2014 which is itself a pseudo-religious and pseudo-scientific scam whose Gaia-worshiping acolytes are correctly being called the \u201cBranch Carbonian Cult.\u201d\n\nSCAM # 9 \u2014 He embraces as \u201cscientific consensus\u201d the junk science of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) and shamelessly rejects virtually all scientific evidence (solar cycles, cosmic winds, humidity, ocean currents, cloud formations and sunlight feedbacks, volcanic activity, etc.) to the contrary \u2014 just as Al Gore\u2019s and the UN-IPCC\u2019s cultic Branch Carbonians do.\n\nSCAM # 10 \u2014 He repeatedly blamed exploding budget deficits and enormous loss of jobs on \u201cthe Bush economy we inherited\u201d \u2014 when it was clearly the Pelosi-Reid Congressional Economy of 2007-08 (with its promises of higher taxes and radical crackdowns on \u201ccarbon pollution\u201d) that brought about job losses, slow economic growth, enormous deficit spending, and rapid expansion of today\u2019s OPRAH Land (Obama-Pelosi-Reid-And-Hillary Land) Plantation state.\n\nSCAM # 11 \u2013 He pompously claims false credit for an economic recovery which is occurring mostly in \u201cRed States\u201d where 31 Republican governors should be more clearly explaining and proving that their improving economies are not because of but in spite of Obama\u2019s over-taxation, over-regulation, and anti-profit \u201coutforcing\u201d of jobs and capital investment \u2013 along with deadly Obamacare\u2019s \u201cdownforcing\u201d of millions of fulltime jobs into part-time.\n\n(The GOP governors\u2019 and Republican-led legislatures\u2019 optimum slap-down: \u201cMister Obama, you didn\u2019t do that. Somebody else did that.\u201d)\n\nSCAM # 12 \u2013 His refusal to call the Global War on Terrorism and the AQ/ISIS-style terrorists by their \u201cRadical Islamist\u201d and \u201cSatanic Jihadist\u201d names but rather as an \u201coverseas contingency action\u201d and as mere purveyors of \u201cworkplace violence\u201d \u2013 trying always to insulate his legacy from having \u201cstarted a war\u201d or \u201clost a war\u201d on Terrorism which was not an actual war at all.\n\n\u201cKing Fiat of Scamalot\u201d rather than \u201cThe Environment President\u201d\n\nTopping it all, Barack Obama and his \u201cProgressively Worse\u201d (i.e., his increasingly Socialist) followers will continue in the media, in academia, and elsewhere to peddle the major scams listed above, plus false promises to create jobs, to eliminate deficit spending, to end crony capitalism, to rescue the Middle Class, to defeat Islam-related Terrorism (but with no credible strategy for doing so), and, above all, to \u201cdefeat apocalyptic climate change\u201d \u2013 and thereby anoint himself \u201cThe Environment President,\u201d as is now his apparent intention.\n\nJIM GUIRARD \u2014 TrueSpeak.org 703-768-0957 [email protected]\n\nA DC-area attorney and national security strategist, Jim Guirard was longtime Chief of Staff to former US Senators Allen Ellender and Russell Long.
