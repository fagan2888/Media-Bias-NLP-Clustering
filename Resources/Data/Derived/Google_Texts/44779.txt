The Rio Blanco County sheriff was released from a hospital Saturday after being stabbed by a 19-year-old this week as he attempted to break up a fight between the teen and his father.

Sheriff Si Woodruff was stabbed in the abdomen Thursday and taken to St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction, where his wound was “repaired,” the sheriff’s office said in a news release. The stabbing happened in the parking lot of Pioneers Hospital in Meeker.

The sheriff’s office identified the teen as Logan Piper of Meeker, according to Undersheriff Michael Joos. Piper is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail on suspicion of attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer.

‘The knife blade, fortunately, did not hit any vital organs,” Joos said, describing the weapon as folding and having a blade that was roughly 3 inches long.

Piper’s family had been attempting to take the teen to the hospital for evaluation and treatment for an undisclosed issue when he became irate, Joos said.

Unlike large counties in Colorado, the county sheriff typically responds to calls in Rio Blanco County, according to the office.
