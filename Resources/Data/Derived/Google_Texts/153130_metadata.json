It\u2019s a green space. It\u2019s a cafe patio. It\u2019s an open-air reading nook and music room. It\u2019s a few parking spaces, but on Friday it was a park.\n\nLocal landscape architecture, planning and industrial design firm Corvus Design brought Park(ing) Day to Juneau on Friday during business hours, joining communities around the world. The first Park(ing) Day was in San Francisco in 2005, but in 2011, when statistics were last available, more than a thousand communities participated, making parks from parking spaces.\n\nCorvus Design Landscape Architect Christopher Mertl, who has long been involved with planning and design projects around the city, took on the planning of Juneau\u2019s Park(ing) Day himself, as a way to showcase what open spaces in an urban streetscape can do.\n\nUsing just a few parking spaces on Front Street between Seward and Main Streets, Corvus Design created an open space, a \u201cpocket park.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a lot of open space in the downtown area. The intent is to provide an environment that supports local businesses and attracts people to come downtown,\u201d Mertl said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of research out there that if you have aesthetic streetscapes \u2014 open space, trees, benches, patios for cafes and restaurants \u2014 you create a dynamic downtown core that is an attraction.\u201d\n\nMertl said the project was taken on in the spirit of the push for downtown revitalization and improvement. The Park(ing) Day temporary space has the blessing of the Downtown Business Association and partners: The Rookery Cafe and Alaska Robotics.\n\nRookery Cafe co-owner Travis Smith committed to having waitstaff available to serve the eatery\u2019s offerings, from espresso drinks to pastries to made-to-order dishes, at the open-air seating. The restaurant gave away a gift certificate as a door prize (despite the lack of doors) to a visitor.\n\nAlaska Robotics\u2019 Aaron Suring stocked the spot with graphic novels from the shop\u2019s collection and set up a community drawing and coloring activity. Another visitor was awarded a gift certificate to the shop.\n\nCity and Borough of Juneau Parks and Recreation provided some green with artificial turf, creating a park-like feel. Maglin Site Furnishings provided seating and tables. Canopies were also a key part of the event, due to Juneau\u2019s decidedly autumnal weather.\n\nWhile naysayers of the Park(ing) Day event might cry foul at losing a couple of parking spaces, Mertl doesn\u2019t want that to be the focus. He\u2019d rather look at the larger concept: having an inviting streetscape and a vibrant downtown.\n\n\u201cBy creating something that\u2019s new, like a small pocket park with a cafe patio, some landscaping and some nice park furnishings, we want people to reenvision what downtown can be,\u201d Mertl said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we need to give up parking, but with good planning, we can create these spaces and still provide the parking that\u2019s required.\u201d\n\nBusiness owners like Smith value street parking but also see the value in having a downtown where people enjoy walking from shop to shop, or where businesses have space to interact with the outside environment to draw people in or take advantage of Juneau\u2019s sunny days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have outdoor seating,\u201d Smith said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not an option. There\u2019s no sidewalk space for us to put anything on and the back of the cafe is an alley. We talked about doing something with it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic.\u201d\n\nUtilizing open space along the streetscape can allow businesses and pedestrians to interact.\n\nSuring said having that kind of space to include the community in activities is \u201creally good for the community and downtown.\u201d\n\nSmartgrowthamerica.org has published a series of fact sheets about the benefits of \u201cComplete Streets,\u201d like what Park(ing) Day promotes. These sheets cover everything from safety to economic development.\n\nStudies show these attractive streetscapes stimulate the economy, encourage investment and increase property values (http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/documents/cs/factsheets/cs-economic.pdf) \u2014 all benefits to downtown business and property owners.\n\nMertl worked on the Seward Street revamp of eight years ago and said the benefits of wider sidewalks and trees were notable.\n\n\u201cWe worked with local businesses and created wider sidewalks, aesthetic paving and landscaping \u2014 It\u2019s really been a catalyst for the rejuvenation of Seward Street,\u201d Mertl said. \u201cTen years ago it was in decline. It was challenging to be a pedestrian, and the success of a downtown is based on pedestrian traffic and getting people to spend time in downtown.\u201d\n\nInitially, more businesses showed interest in participating in Park(ing) Day, which was first envisioned as occupying various parking spaces around downtown, but costs associated with providing liability insurance for the pop-up parks \u2014 $500 per space, as required by the city \u2014 made participation difficult.\n\n\u201cI understand CBJ needs to do this from a risk management perspective,\u201d Mertl said. \u201cThere are definitely challenges that need to be overcome. I\u2019d like to continue to do this but think the liability insurance is a challenge. People are putting a lot of time, money and effort into buying materials, then there\u2019s that extra layer. They\u2019re doing it for the community, for celebration, to promote downtown and provide something fun.\u201d\n\nThe event originated as a guerilla movement, with organizers maxing out parking meters, but, at least in Juneau, it has become a permitted event with all the associated costs.\n\nFor Mertl, the cost was worth it to create a community open space.\n\n\u201cIt allows people to interact, to slow down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt improves the quality of life.\u201d\n\nNaysayers may also cry \u201crain,\u201d but Mertl said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say we can\u2019t because of the weather, but let\u2019s work around the weather\u201d with overhangs, canopies, heat lamps and counting on Juneau\u2019s tendency to do most anything despite the rain.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to create safe, enjoyable spaces that tell something about the story of the community, Mertl said.\n\n\u201cPark(ing) Day is an extension of celebrating and trying to improve our community for residents and visitors, having an economically successful downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind, parks and open space and complete streets are a vital part of creating a successful downtown.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, MELISSA GRIFFITHS, Aaron Suring, Christopher Mertl, Day, Travis Smith, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "What was once a patch of asphalt takes on a second life as something more.
