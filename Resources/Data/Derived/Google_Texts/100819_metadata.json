It is one of only 47 such awards conferred in the state.\n\n\u201cThis award reflects the hard work and patient-centered accomplishments of medical professionals using health information technology to report quality measures, identify opportunities to enhance care and achieve improved patient outcomes,\u201d said Mary Ellen Dalton, HSAG of California president.\n\n\u201cThese physician practices are leaders in their communities and are crucial to help California meet the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s National Quality Strategy goals to provide better care and improve the health of communities at an affordable cost.\u201d\n\nHSAG of California reviewed the performance of California physician practices participating in quality improvement efforts during the past year, including Yubadocs Urgent Care.\n\nThis review encompassed four elements: quality measured excellence, effective use of health information technology, care management excellence and participation in data reporting quality initiatives. Based on specific criteria, physician practices received either a platinum or gold award.\n\n\u201cAward recipients should be proud of their efforts because they lead their colleagues in demonstrating effective prevention and treatment practices concerning the most serious disease indications,\u201d said Mary Fermazin, HSAG of California chief medical officer.\n\n\u201cThey are setting the pace to meet national benchmarks for aspirin use, blood pressure control, cholesterol management and smoking cessation.\u201d\n\nHSAG of California has conferred a formal plaque to Yubadocs enshrining this achievement.\n\n\u201cYour practice is a model for the health community, so we hope you display the award with pride,\u201d said Debashish Mittra, HSAG of California program director. \u201cAs other providers take heed, you can take satisfaction that you have spurred a movement of excellence in quality care.\u201d\n\nYubadocs Urgent Care is the premiere urgent care clinic for western Nevada County and has been part of the local medical community since opening in August 2000. Urgent care is a specialty devoted to treating minor emergencies, acute illnesses and other common medical needs.\n\nYubadocs is open seven days a week, never closes for lunch, and sees people as walk-ins or by appointment. They repair lacerations, take care of lumps and bumps, manage simple fractures and do x-rays, splinting, casting, basic lab work, ECGs and spirometry on-site.\n\nDr. Roger Hicks and RN Linda Rachmel are founders and owners of the clinic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yubadocs Urgent Care has been awarded the 2014 California Quality Improvement Recognition Award by the Health Services Advisory Group of California Inc., the Medicare quality improvement organization for California.", "og": {"url": "http://www.TheUnion.com/news/localnews/11895042-113/california-care-quality-award", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.TheUnion.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=HAXsdGx1RCurAn7H1Lm8Q8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsh_ZcIPuL0c7_UajSRtf$FWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Union", "description": "Yubadocs Urgent Care has been awarded the 2014 California Quality Improvement Recognition Award by the Health Services Advisory Group of California Inc., the Medicare quality improvement organization for California.", "title": "Grass Valley's Yubadocs receives quality improvement award | TheUnion.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheUnion", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 565424183476729}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 11895042}}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Paid", "keywords": "CALIFORNIA, CARE, QUALITY, AWARD, YUBADOCS, HSAG, IMPROVEMENT, HEALTH, URGENT, MEDICAL", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd182d\"", "article_summary": "Yubadocs Urgent Care has been awarded the 2014 California Quality Improvement Recognition Award by the Health Services Advisory Group of California Inc., the Medicare quality improvement organization for California.\nYubadocs\u2019 Dr. Roger Hicks and Dr. Andi Harris display the plaque they received as winners of the HSAG of California\u2019s Quality Improvement Recognition Award.\nUrgent care is a specialty devoted to treating minor emergencies, acute illnesses and other common medical needs.\nThis review encompassed four elements: quality measured excellence, effective use of health information technology, care management excellence and participation in data reporting quality initiatives.\nYubadocs is open seven days a week, never closes for lunch, and sees people as walk-ins or by appointment."}
