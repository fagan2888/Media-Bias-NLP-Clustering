(Photo courtesy of Twitter.com)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Massachusetts U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III on Wednesday proposed \u201cclarifying\u201d the Religious Freedom Act in a way that supporters say will prevent organizations, business owners and other individuals from using it to shield discrimination against others on the basis of religious beliefs.\n\nBusiness owners who believe marriage is strictly a union between a man and a woman, for example, would be barred from using the Religious Freedom law to protect their refusal to provide wedding services for same-sex couples. Kennedy\u2019s clarification would also eliminate a legal basis for claims of religious-based exemptions from Obamacare mandates to provide workers with insurance covering contraception services.\n\n\u201cThe right of Americans to freely and fully express our faith is sacred in this country,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement about his proposed bill. \u201cBut in order to guarantee that liberty for every citizen, our system must ensure that my religious freedom does not infringe on yours or do you harm.\u201d\n\nGroups including the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order that staffs nursing homes in 27 U.S. cities, including Somerville, cited the Religious Freedom act as protecting it from Obamacare mandates in a case recently reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The act was also cited by Hobby Lobby Stores and its founders in their successful challenge to Obamacare requirements, which the high court backed in 2014.\n\n\u201cWhile not its original intent, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has become a vehicle for those seeking to impose their beliefs on others or claim that the tenants of their faith justify discrimination,\u201d Kennedy said. He further claimed that his bill \u201cwill restore the balance between our right to religious freedom and our promise of equal protection under law.\u201d\n\nNew bill introduced by @RepJoeKennedy seeks to prohibit anti-LGBT bias in name of \u201creligious freedom\u201d https://t.co/KpspYr35Bq@WashBlade \u2014 Chris Johnson (@chrisjohnson82) May 18, 2016\n\nKennedy introduced the bill jointly with fellow Democrat and Virginia U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott.\n\nThe text of the bill specifically states that it seeks to \u201camend the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 to protect civil rights and otherwise prevent meaningful harm to third parties, and for other purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 should not be interpreted to authorize an exemption that permits discrimination against other persons, including persons who do not belong to the religion or adhere to the other beliefs of those to whom the exemption is given,\u201d the bill states.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/05/18/kennedy-bill-would-bar-religious-exemption-claims/", "article_author_name": "Evan Lips", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Kennedy_Scott-resized-cropped-twitter.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act., civil rights, discrimination, freedom of religion, Hobby Lobby, Joseph P.
