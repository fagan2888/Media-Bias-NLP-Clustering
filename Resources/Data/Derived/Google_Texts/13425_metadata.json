Kesha Rogers does not have that problem.\n\nThe Democratic Senate hopeful\u2019s platform calls for the impeachment of President Barack Obama and compares the Affordable Care Act to Nazism. She campaigns around the state with a poster of Obama sporting a Hitler mustache. Plus, she\u2019s a supporter of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.\n\n\u201cThere is this certain unique quality to what I do,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI go out and inspire people, especially people who have been discouraged by the party and discouraged by the political situation.\u201d\n\nThat has drawn the ire of mainstream Texas Democrats, who know that a Rogers win would disrupt the party\u2019s unified front. The party is touting what it hopes will be its most competitive statewide slate in years, but if Rogers were to win the nomination in the May 27 runoff, she would stick out.\n\n\u201cThey want candidates that are traditional and effective, and that\u2019s something I think that they are at a risk of losing here if \u2026 Kesha Rogers wins the runoff,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. \u201cIt makes the party look like they are in disarray. It makes it look like they haven\u2019t adequately vetted their candidates.\n\nDemocratic organizations across the state are lining up to discredit the Rogers campaign while David Alameel, the Dallas dentist who led the March primary but didn\u2019t get a high enough share of the vote to win outright, keeps his distance. Even though many Democrats believe Alameel will win, they don\u2019t want to take chances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that Dr. Alameel be the nominee and we do demonstrate that gadfly candidates like Kesha Rogers won\u2019t get nominated in important races,\u201d said Matt Angle, an adviser to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis who runs the Washington-based Lone Star Project. The group recently put out a video opposing Rogers.\n\nState parties usually stay out of primaries, but the Texas Democratic Party has been vocal in its support of Alameel. Rogers\u2019 campaign remains cut off from all party resources, including access to its voter data.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with Rogers, who says that the party has been hijacked by Wall Street financial interests and has lost its historic principles. She considers Alameel part of the problem: A wealthy dentist and investor, he has spent more than $3 million during the primary, mostly his own money. Rogers\u2019 campaign spent about $27,000 as of the most recent filing deadline, on Feb. 12.\n\nRogers said the push to impeach Obama and her disagreements with the state party shouldn\u2019t give the Texas Democrats \u201cthe right to isolate me.\u201d\n\nRogers, 37, supports LaRouche, a controversial perennial presidential candidate and economist. A Houston native, she\u2019s a volunteer for LaRouche\u2019s political action committee and has won two Democratic U.S. House primaries for a Houston-area seat, badly losing the general election both times to Rep. Pete Olson, R-Sugar Land.\n\n\u201cWhat a LaRouche Democrat in short represents is the defiance of the Wall Street control over our nation\u2019s institutions of government,\u201d she said. On her website, she writes that if \u201cWall Street has its way, we are headed toward thermonuclear war.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Jennings, the secretary of the Sharpstown Democrats Club in Houston, said that Rogers\u2019 stance on banking reform and support of NASA won her support. She added that the party shouldn\u2019t be blindly supporting the president, who she believes has overstepped his bounds.\n\n\u201cI see a firebrand Democrat and I say, \u2018Bring it on, girl,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf she\u2019s the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate against John Cornyn ... he\u2019s going to have a hell of a lot harder time fending himself off from Kesha than from David Alameel.\u201d\n\nRogers was able to win a spot in the runoff by taking 22 percent of the March primary vote, second to Alameel\u2019s 47 percent. But Rottinghaus said that a runoff victory will be much harder thanks to low voter turnout.\n\n\u201cA nonpresidential year, out of the traditional primary cycle, and it\u2019s a runoff \u2014 you\u2019ve got the most committed core Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people that turn out are going to be turned out by the elite and most likely to receive the elite messages.\u201d\n\nAlameel said that he is more focused on the Republican incumbent.\n\n\u201cEven though we still have a runoff, we need to lay the ground on how to send John Cornyn home,\u201d Alameel said. \u201cThe runoff will take care of itself.\u201d\n\nRogers has called for debates, but Alameel hasn\u2019t agreed to face her. She said he is avoiding the issues.\n\n\u201cMy opponent thinks that because he has lots of money and can flood the money around, he doesn\u2019t have an obligation to debate me or address the issues at hand,\u201d she said.\n\nAlameel rejected that, saying his spending is designed \u201cto build my base against Cornyn. That has been my strategy from the beginning, and beating John Cornyn is not going to be cheap.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kamisar on Twitter at @bkamisar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic leaders have been vocal about opposing Kesha Rogers, who wants President Obama impeached.", "og": {"description": "Democratic leaders have been vocal about opposing Kesha Rogers, who wants President Obama impeached.", "title": "Candidate in Democratic runoff likes LaRouche, not Obama", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140413-candidate-in-democratic-runoff-likes-larouche-not-obama.ece", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140404-kesha-rogers-16x9.ece/BINARY/original/kesha-rogers-16x9", "height": 365}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-04-14T13:42:22Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-04-14T04:32:56Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Candidate in Democratic runoff likes LaRouche, not Obama\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140413-candidate-in-democratic-runoff-likes-larouche-not-obama.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140404-kesha-rogers-16x9.ece/BINARY/original/kesha-rogers-16x9\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1595492\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-14T04:32:56Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"BEN KAMISAR\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140404-kesha-rogers-16x9.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/kesha-rogers-16x9", "publishtime": "2014-04-14T04:32:56Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f11\"", "article_summary": "State parties usually stay out of primaries, but the Texas Democratic Party has been vocal in its support of Alameel.\nThe Democratic Senate hopeful\u2019s platform calls for the impeachment of President Barack Obama and compares the Affordable Care Act to Nazism.\nKesha Rogers does not have that problem.\n\u201cEven though we still have a runoff, we need to lay the ground on how to send John Cornyn home,\u201d Alameel said.\n\u201cA nonpresidential year, out of the traditional primary cycle, and it\u2019s a runoff \u2014 you\u2019ve got the most committed core Democrats,\u201d he said."}
