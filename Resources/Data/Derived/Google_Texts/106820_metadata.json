Peter and Paul School at 36th and X Streets was intended to help bolster the literacy skills of her young students, all of whom speak Spanish as their first language. After the little ones were done, a handful of fourth-graders trooped in.\n\nSuch lessons, said Principal Cory Sepich, are just one of the steps that Sts. Peter and Paul is taking as part of the Omaha Archdiocese\u2019s efforts to reach deeper into South Omaha\u2019s Latino community.\n\nThe archdiocese committed to greater outreach in 2012 after seeing that the growing Latino population, which is heavily Catholic, was underrepresented in its schools. Its new schools superintendent reaffirmed the goal after he was hired in 2013.\n\nNow the archdiocese has hired its first Latino school enrollment coordinator, a move intended to bolster those efforts and to aid pastors and principals like Sepich.\n\nBeatriz Arellanes\u2019 twin focuses will be to reach out to more Latino families and to help raise funds to defray tuition costs.\n\nA former businesswoman and teacher, Arellanes came to Omaha from Mexico five years ago with her husband, a food industry executive, and their two children. The couple already have been helping with enrollment efforts in an informal way at their children\u2019s schools, volunteering at open houses, leading tours, helping with the language. They served on the school board at St. Thomas More School, and Arellanes\u2019 husband currently serves on an enrollment committee at Creighton Prep, where their son is a sophomore.\n\nArellanes said the church is the first institution people identify with when they arrive from another country. The Mass essentially is the same in English and Spanish.\n\nBut newer arrivals often don\u2019t know about Catholic schools, which typically were not available or were out of reach financially in their home countries. \u201cThey don\u2019t know there are people who can help them enroll (here), or they think it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d she said.\n\nArellanes already has visited Sts. Peter and Paul a number of times and appeared with Sepich on a forum broadcast on Radio Lobo, a Spanish-language station in Omaha. The school began advertising on the station about a month ago, and several Latino families from the school have been interviewed. The school has gotten calls every time a family has appeared.\n\n\u201cThe biggest advocates for Catholic schools are our families,\u201d Sepich said.\n\nMaking personal connections is among the strategies for increasing Latino enrollment laid out in a report published by the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Alliance for Catholic Education, which has been advising dioceses across the country.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, the words \u2018Latino\u2019 and \u2018Catholic schools\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be in the same sentence,\u201d said the Rev. Joseph Corpora, director of university-school partnerships with the alliance. \u201cNow everyone is talking about (it) and moving on it.\u201d\n\nCorpora spoke at an archdiocese luncheon in Omaha two years ago, and archdiocese officials have consulted with him since. Sepich, Arellanes and Patrick Slattery, the archdiocese\u2019s schools superintendent, hope to attend enrollment institutes at Notre Dame this summer.\n\nIn addition to reaching out to Latino families, the school also has been working to welcome and support them, an effort that began after a realignment of the archdiocese\u2019s southeast Omaha schools.\n\nThree schools closed in May 2013, including Assumption-Guadalupe, where the enrollment was majority Latino. A number of staff and families moved to Sts. Peter and Paul, which became part of a new five-school consortium with a common governance.\n\nSepich said Sts. Peter and Paul has changed its mission statement, which hadn\u2019t been revised since the mid-1980s, to reflect its two cultures \u2014 the Croatian and Bohemian immigrants who were its first students and the Latinos who now live in the neighborhood.\n\nIn the recently renovated lobby hangs a new picture of St. Joseph the Worker, patron saint of Croatia and of Mexico and a representation of the strong work ethic that area residents still pride themselves in.\n\nAnd there are two portraits of the Rev. Blase Cupich, the newly installed Archbishop of Chicago and grandson of Croatian immigrants who grew up nearby, graduated from the grade school and was ordained as a priest in Sts. Peter and Paul Church.\n\nThe aim, Sepich said, was to celebrate the school\u2019s past and at the same time welcome Latino families.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to honor our past, but not dwell in it,\u201d Sepich said.\n\nThe school\u2019s enrollment was about 190 students at the end of last year and had dropped to around 170 when Sepich arrived in June. It now stands at 204.\n\nThe school could have added more, he said, but he didn\u2019t want to create too large a first-grade class. And he wanted more updates in place before adding more students.\n\nMore construction is planned for summer. The main office will move into what is now the computer lab. The former office then will become a room where families can use the fax machine or computers. The resource and extended care room where Davis works with small groups will become a new library and media center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress, but we\u2019re getting there,\u201d Sepich said.\n\nOne way of growing is by using what the Notre Dame report defines as \u201cmadrinas,\u201d which translates to \u201cgodmothers\u201d \u2014 Latina moms who can provide a personal connection and help guide Latino families through the system. The school already has the beginnings of a informal Madrinas program in Estela Rangel, a bilingual secretary who was among those who made the move from Assumption-Guadalupe.\n\nSepich said Rangel helps provide translations for families. About 80 percent of the weekly information folders the school sends home to its 130 families are in Spanish.\n\nCorpora said Catholic schools need to get better at working with students who are just learning English. That doesn\u2019t mean every teacher has to become bilingual, as some fear. It does, however, take preparation and instruction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just learning how to work with kids whose first language is not English,\u201d he said.\n\nSepich, 32, said Sts. Peter and Paul has adopted the leveled literacy intervention program used by the Omaha school district and many others with large numbers of English language learners. He and other staff members have consulted with ELL program leaders in OPS and visited nearby Spring Lake Magnet Center to see it at work.\n\nSts. Peter and Paul\u2019s first-grade teacher already has an ELL endorsement, and Davis will seek the certification this summer. Sepich said the school also hopes to hire another resource teacher so Davis can focus on students in pre-kindergarten and primary grades. The goal is to have youngsters reading at grade level by third grade.\n\nBut in many ways, he said, the mission really hasn\u2019t changed since the days of those earlier settlers. \u201cThe Catholic church has always been that glue for a lot of immigrants.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: 402-444-1223, julie.anderson@owh.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "The archdiocese committed to greater outreach in 2012 after seeing that the growing Latino population, which is heavily Catholic, was underrepresented in its schools.
