The two chambers could not agree on how to get health insurance to the state\u2019s low income residents.\n\nDuring an appearance on WJCT's \u201cFirst Coast Connect,\u201d Armistead spoke out on the critical issue of hospital funding in Florida.\n\nArmistead says issues with health care funding are reoccurring, and he says UF Health Jax fights to retain its funding for indigent care every year.\n\n\u201cOur financial structure is weak,\u201d Armistead said. \u201cOur balance sheet is weak, and we live hand-to-mouth as unfortunately some folks in the community do.\u201d\n\nArmistead proposes the City of Jacksonville help fund UF Health through an independent tax district. He says this is how other cities like Tampa, Miami or Orlando provide funding for safety net hospitals.\n\n\u201cYou open your mouth about taxes politically, and you\u2019re not going to get elected,\u201d Armistead said. \u201cSo frankly unless the community thinks this is an important issue, it won\u2019t happen, and that\u2019ll be to everyone\u2019s detriment.\u201d\n\nIf UF Health Jax closes due to lack of funding, Jacksonville will lose its only Level I trauma center.\n\n\u201cPatients would [have to] go other places \u2014 Gainesville, Orlando \u2014 pick your spot,\u201d Armistead said.\n\nArmistead also says without UF Health other emergency rooms in the city will be overflowing with patients, and they won\u2019t be able to meet the demand.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the inpatient capacity to admit patients from the emergency room that would need hospitalization,\u201d Armistead said about the other hospitals in Jacksonville.\n\nThe main source of funding for hospitals, without taxes, comes from overcharging commercially insured patients says Armistead.\n\nHe says the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion won\u2019t lower healthcare costs for insured patients. Instead these programs shift the costs to cover uninsured patients from the hospitals to the insurance companies he says.\n\n\u201cWhen people don\u2019t have health insurance, [an emergency room] is the only option they have except for some of the free clinics we have around the city,\u201d Armistead said.\n\nBecause UF Health is a safety net hospital, it goes out of its way to provide care to low-income and uninsured patients.\n\n\u201cWe are one of 14 safety net hospitals in the state of Florida, and of those 14 we have the highest percentage of Medicaid and uninsured business,\u201d Armistead said.\n\nHe also says UF Health Jax has the lowest commercial business when compared to other hospitals in the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a $500,000 business in northwest Jacksonville, and the economic impact of us not being there would set Jacksonville back five to seven years,\u201d Armistead said.\n\nEven with the ongoing issues concerning healthcare funding, Armistead says he\u2019s confident the legislature will figure it out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable the legislature will keep us going,\u201d Armistead said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how many years in the future they will continue to solve our local problem.\n\nHe says this is why he believes a local tax for UF Health may be a solution in the future.\n\nListen to the full conversation with Russ Armistead on Monday\u2019s episode of the \u201cFirst Coast Connect\u201d podcast on iTunes.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "UF Health Jax will be forced to close if there is no resolution to Florida\u2019s health care funding crisis says CEO Russ Armistead.
