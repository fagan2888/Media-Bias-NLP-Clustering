Frank Garner speaks to a group during a health care town hall meeting, hosted by Americans for Prosperity, in Kalispell on Feb. 5, 2015. Greg Lindstrom | Flathead Beacon\n\nA conservative advocacy group targeting Republican state legislators it deems too liberal braved out a hostile reception in Kalispell Thursday night when the group took aim at local state Rep. Frank Garner, who has refused to sign a blanket pledge opposing Medicaid expansion in Montana.\n\nThe group, Americans for Prosperity-Montana, has been holding \u201cHealthcare Town Hall\u201d meetings across the state, singling out districts in which Republican lawmakers have declined to support AFP\u2019s pledges of opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nSo far, the group has targeted Garner, who represents House District 7, as well as Reps. Jeff Welborn, of Dillon, and Tom Berry, of Roundup, sending out a flurry of mailers to districts portraying the respective lawmaker\u2019s face superimposed over a photograph of President Barack Obama.\n\nA crowd of about 100 people attended the event at the Red Lion Inn in Kalispell. Some of them received word about the gathering through the postcard mailers, which read, \u201cTell Frank Garner to stand with us and vote no on ObamaCare\u2019s expansion in Montana.\u201d\n\nGarner, who made the eight-hour round trip from Helena to attend the meeting, took umbrage with the postcards and said the group never told him about the meeting, which he learned about from a reporter on the House floor at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI support their right to have an opinion. I just didn\u2019t like how they did it,\u201d Garner said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even extend the courtesy of telling me about the meeting. What does that say about their intentions?\u201d\n\nThe former Kalispell police chief said he understands his constituents better than an out-of-state group like AFP because he ran a campaign based on listening to and understanding the wants and needs of his district, and he\u2019s made good on that promise in Helena.\n\nGarner\u2019s mere presence had a chilling effect on the AFP presentation, which was frequently derailed by laughter, booing and shouting from audience members who overwhelmingly expressed support for Garner.\n\nFollowing a hasty exchange with AFP State Director Zach Lahn minutes before Thursday\u2019s meeting commenced, Garner took the podium to defend his record before the crowd of mostly supporters, who cheered the lawmaker on.\n\n\u201cI promised the people here when I ran that I would listen to you and not out-of-town special interests,\u201d Garner said to raucous applause. \u201cIf every time they want me to sign a pledge card and I don\u2019t do it they are going to rent a room and have a meeting, then this is going to get real expensive. Cause I\u2019m not signing the pledge card.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion is poised to be one of the most significant issues before the 2015 Montana Legislature as Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock has proposed accepting federal money to expand coverage to 70,000 low-income residents.\n\nThe governor\u2019s measure has received opposition from members of the majority Republican leadership, who say it\u2019s an unnecessary welfare program that will saddle the state with millions of dollars of debt.\n\nBut a faction of Republican lawmakers, including Garner, have refrained from taking a hardline against Medicaid expansion, saying they\u2019re open to considering some form of expansion, opening the possibility for a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans to approve it.\n\nGarner said he sees problems with full Medicaid expansion, but that won\u2019t stop him from considering other alternatives, such as helping low-income people who can\u2019t afford a federal subsidy to purchase health insurance. Moreover, he wants to examine the plans at the Legislature before making a decision.\n\n\u201cSure, I have problems with full expansion, but you can\u2019t know what a bill looks like and does until it\u2019s in front of you,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t sign a pledge card for or against any issue. My vote is my pledge card. And it\u2019s permanent.\u201d\n\nAFP-Montana is a branch of the conservative organization founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, David and Charles, who own Koch Industries, of Wichita, Kansas, a prominent opponent of Medicaid expansion.\n\nLast summer, the group ramped up its presence in Montana, expanding from two to 11 paid staffers, according to the group.\n\nLahn, the AFP-Montana director, said the group has been focusing its resources on legislators who did not answer a survey that the group distributed asking lawmakers about their stances on major issues. The group has circled back and asked those dozen-or-so lawmakers to sign pledge cards opposing Medicaid expansion.\n\nThose who don\u2019t sign have been targeted in their districts by telephone calls, mailers and local events, including the recent series of \u201cHealth Care Town Hall\u201d meetings, which feature speakers from groups like the Foundation for Government Accountability who inform locals about why Medicaid expansion is \u201cbad policy,\u201d encouraging them to tell their legislators to oppose it.\n\nLahn insisted the meetings were not an attack on specific legislators, but \u201ca crusade against bad policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a dig at Frank Garner. This is not and will not be a crusade against any legislator,\u201d Lahn said. \u201cThis is a crusade against bad policy.\u201d\n\nLahn said the group used an image of Obama on the postcards and flyers because the Affordable Care Act is the president\u2019s signature health care policy; its purpose was to let lawmakers know that their constituents oppose Obamacare, he said.\n\nThat comment prompted Garner to question why, if AFP\u2019s intent is to communicate a message to lawmakers, was he the only legislator in attendance.\n\n\u201cIf the purpose is to make sure legislators know, then why am I the only one here? And why didn\u2019t I get an invite?\u201d Garner asked to more applause.\n\nAny sense of order the meeting maintained at the beginning broke down toward its end, with audience members shouting questions and accusations, interrupting Lahn and defending Garner.\n\n\u201cYou have pissed me off,\u201d one man told Lahn. \u201cCharacter assassination does not go down well in Montana. If he has to take a pledge then I want it to be the Pledge of Allegiance, because they don\u2019t represent you, they represent me.\u201d\n\nReferencing a quote by Henry David Thoreau on the sanctity of town hall meetings, Nathan Kosted told Lahn the gathering smacked of exclusivity.\n\n\u201cWhy did you call this a town hall meeting? I didn\u2019t get an invite. I wish I\u2019d been invited, because I want to know how we get the Koch Brothers out of politics. I want to know how we get you out of politics,\u201d Kosted said.\n\nBefore concluding the meeting, Lahn said the \u201cmessage has been received\u201d on the group\u2019s tactics targeting specific lawmakers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "A conservative advocacy group targeting Republican state legislators it deems too liberal braved out a hostile reception in Kalispell Thursday night when the group took aim at local state Rep....  more", "title": "Conservative Group Targets Kalispell Lawmaker Over Medicaid - Flathead Beacon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150206_GARNER_012.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-06T16:47:23-06:00", "url": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/2015/02/06/conservative-group-targets-kalispell-lawmaker-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/themes/flathead-beacon/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FlatheadBeacon", "section": "Front Page", "published_time": "2015-02-06T12:55:15-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T16:47:23-06:00"}, "google-site-verification": "x7bqQRTLUVbNNQe0HUJ0bnx_EXmr6uOwcIs_ZIT9n9g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The group has circled back and asked those dozen-or-so lawmakers to sign pledge cards opposing Medicaid expansion.\nAnd it\u2019s permanent.\u201dAFP-Montana is a branch of the conservative organization founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, David and Charles, who own Koch Industries, of Wichita, Kansas, a prominent opponent of Medicaid expansion.\nBefore concluding the meeting, Lahn said the \u201cmessage has been received\u201d on the group\u2019s tactics targeting specific lawmakers.\nLast summer, the group ramped up its presence in Montana, expanding from two to 11 paid staffers, according to the group.\nGreg Lindstrom | Flathead BeaconA conservative advocacy group targeting Republican state legislators it deems too liberal braved out a hostile reception in Kalispell Thursday night when the group took aim at local state Rep.
