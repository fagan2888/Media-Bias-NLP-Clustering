Also, a pine tree was planted in his honor.\n\nA new annual award, in Clements\u2019 name, will honor a CDOC employee who helps inmates successfully transition out of prison.\n\nClements\u2019 name was the 16th on a list of correctional officers killed in the line of duty in Colorado dating to 1899, including Sgt. Mary K. Ricard.\n\nIt was just over a year ago that Clements stood at the same location to offer words of condolence and praise for Ricard, who was murdered Sept. 24, 2012, in a prison kitchen.\n\nA number of dignitaries, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, state legislators and directors of prisons from other states, attended Saturday\u2019s outdoor memorial under dark clouds.\n\n\u201cTom Clements represented the best of what we are capable of. \u2026 I will never think of Tom Clements as fallen. Tom always stood tall in that relaxed way,\u201d Hickenlooper said in his speech.\n\nHe added that he was \u201cprofoundly saddened\u201d by the loss of the great believer in redemption.\n\nClements\u2019 wife, Lisa, thanked the many people who have rallied around her family since her husband\u2019s murder, but particularly Roxane White, Hickenlooper\u2019s chief of staff, who helped out at her daughter\u2019s wedding the past year.\n\nShe also thanked El Paso County sheriff\u2019s investigators for continuing to seek answers in her husband\u2019s death.\n\nParolee Evan Ebel killed Nathan Leon on March 17, 2013, and shot Clements two days later at his Monument home. Investigators are determining whether others conspired to kill the two men.\n\nLisa Clements noted that her husband was a diligent student of good leadership. An admirer of fellow Missourian Harry S. Truman, he tried to live up to an admonition of the 33rd president: \u201cI learned that a great leader is a man who has the ability to get other people to do what they don\u2019t want to do and like it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Slain DOC chief Tom Clements honored at ceremony", "title": "Slain DOC chief Tom Clements honored at ceremony", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/15/slain-doc-chief-tom-clements-honored-at-ceremony/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140315__clements-1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140315__clements-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-15T17:47:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:38:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4386\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTom Clements represented the best of what we are capable of.\n\u2026 I will never think of Tom Clements as fallen.\nClements\u2019 name was the 16th on a list of correctional officers killed in the line of duty in Colorado dating to 1899, including Sgt.\nCA\u00d1ON CITY \u2014 Kellie Wasko recalled the time shortly after Tom Clements took the reins of Colorado\u2019s corrections system when he leaned over to her and made an unusual request.\nHe asked for her permission to step down from the lectern at the graduation ceremony of a new class of correctional officers and stand alongside them to recite the oath of office."}
