SEATTLE (AP) - Coast Guard crews and local responders rescued two surfers and a helper after they got into trouble near the Grays Harbor South Jetty.

A Jayhawk helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Astoria in Warrenton, Oregon hoisted two females and one male on Saturday and took them to nearby medical personnel.

Watchstanders at Coast Guard Sector Columbia River were called at 2:30 p.m. by dispatchers, who said two surfers were in distress.

They said a third person who tried to help the surfers also was in the water. All three people were pulled south by currents and dispatchers relayed their positions.

Winds were blowing at 10 mph and the water temperature was 51 degrees.

After being hoisted from the water, all three people were reportedly in good condition.
