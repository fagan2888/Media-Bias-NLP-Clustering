He said Columbus is easy to navigate and commutes from hotels around the city\u2019s outskirts average only 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cTwenty minutes is ideal really for a commute,\u201d Wickersham said. \u201cAt some of the conventions I\u2019ve worked in the past - Los Angeles, for instance - the average commute time was far, far greater than 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nDNC officials have stressed that a city must meet logistical requirements - fundraising, ample hotel rooms and local transportation - before political factors such as swing state status, labor union relations and cultural diversity are considered.\n\nA national political convention requires moving between 35,000 and 40,000 people throughout the city. That\u2019s about the number the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center stop, near New York\u2019s proposed convention site in Brooklyn, serves on an average weekday - a point Mayor Bill de Blasio highlighted when the convention committee visited this summer. The Barclays Center sits atop a transit hub with nine subway lines and a commuter rail line.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to transportation, no one compares to New York City,\u201d said spokeswoman Marti Adams. \u201cWe have the most extensive transportation network in the United States, hands down. As we demonstrate on a regular basis, New York City knows how to move large groups on our roads and waterways and in the subways without disrupting the flow of the city, and we\u2019ve developed a plan to move delegates between venues and boroughs.\u201d\n\nCritically for Columbus, Adams said part of New York\u2019s promise is to transport delegates from midtown Manhattan hotels to the Barclays Center in less than 15 minutes.\n\nPhiladelphia, too, has a well-established public transit network that includes both a subway and light rail system. But the City of Brotherly Love also has emphasized the walkability of its Wells Fargo Center convention site to cultural, hotels, food and history in its downtown.\n\nWickersham said the subway debate is misplaced. He said convention delegates almost always travel by private motor coaches, not on public transportation - whether subways, buses, or any other mode.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on the schedules, where the events are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe light rail system they had in Charlotte, for instance, didn\u2019t really have access from the hotels to where they needed to go to the convention center or to the convention hall.\u201d\n\nColumbus officials were in Washington, D.C., this week as part of ongoing convention talks. The final decision on a host city is expected by late January or early February.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's capital city is grappling with its role as a transportation underdog in the bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention by hiring one of the experts in the field.", "Author": "JULIE CARR SMYTH", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/17/transportation-guru-helps-columbus-in-dnc-conventi/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ohio\u2019s capital city is grappling with its role as a transportation underdog in the bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention by hiring one of the experts in the field.", "title": "Transportation guru helps Columbus in DNC convention bid"}, "twitter": {"title": "Transportation guru helps Columbus in DNC convention bid", "description": "Ohio's capital city is grappling with its role as a transportation underdog in the bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention by hiring one of the experts in the field.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded9e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen it comes to transportation, no one compares to New York City,\u201d said spokeswoman Marti Adams.\nHe said convention delegates almost always travel by private motor coaches, not on public transportation - whether subways, buses, or any other mode.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Ohio\u2019s capital city is grappling with its role as a transportation underdog in the bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention by hiring one of the experts in the field.\nBut the City of Brotherly Love also has emphasized the walkability of its Wells Fargo Center convention site to cultural, hotels, food and history in its downtown.\nHe said Columbus is easy to navigate and commutes from hotels around the city\u2019s outskirts average only 20 minutes."}
