Three Kansas National Guardsmen spent their Christmas at the Robert Dole VA Hospital, shaking hands and brightening the day of the injured veterans stuck in the hospital for the holidays.

Specialist Steven Woodin, Sgt. Adam Trabert and Specialist Aaron Reynolds spend their Christmas at the VA hospital, with the goal of making the holidays easier for injured veterans that cannot make it home.

"We just want to make sure to let them know that we appreciate all the things that they have done for us, and that they are not alone," said Sgt. Trabert, "we are looking for some smiles and some handshakes, if we can put a smile on someones face, that is the goal today."

Specialist Steven Woodin was deployed in Afghanistan for years. One of the men in his unit was injured and he knows how it helped that injured veteran to see the guys from his unit when they would visit.

"Joy, happiness, he loves seeing us come up here and see him; let him know that we are still thinking about him and that we are here for him," Specialist Woodin said.

Woodin and his fellow guardsmen know how hard it is to spend the holidays away from their families. They wanted to make sure that the injured service men and women who cannot make it home for the holidays have support from their fellow veterans.

"It's got to be hard, and obviously if they are in here, they are going through difficult times," Specialist Woodin said, "one thing that would make it harder would not be being able to see your family on a day like today when family are suppose to come together."
