Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” former Hewlett Packard CEO and Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina said since President Barack Obama’s selling points never match what is in the legislation he is pushing, she can not support giving him a fast track trade deal.

Fiorina said, “The devil is usually in the details. That’s particularly true with this president. We don’t know what’s in this deal. We know we have trading partners who have violated agreements in trade deals, China being one of them. I think it’s important to understand some of the fine print of this deal. for example, is China allowed to join this pacific trading agreement later on in a couple of years, yes or no? This is being sold as an opportunity for America to strengthen its lead and partnerships in the Asia Pacific region. I agree with that goal. On the other hand, if the truth is in these details China gets to join later, what are we doing here? I think the point is not free trade is bad. free trade is good for this nation. I think the point is, what exactly is in this agreement? This administration, unfortunately, has a track record of burying things in fine print, whether it’s the Iran nuclear deal or Obamacare or maybe this agreement that turn out to be very different from their selling points.”
