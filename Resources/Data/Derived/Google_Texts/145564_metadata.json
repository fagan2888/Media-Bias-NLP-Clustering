Because really, nothing says \u201celect me to run the government and keep watch over the nuclear launch codes\u201d like airing your business disputes on Twitter and attacking the leadership of a neighboring country.\n\nIt\u2019s a prime example of why, since the moment Trump announced that he was planning to run for the Republican presidential nomination, the GOP has been getting increasingly nervous. It\u2019s not because anybody expects him to win, but because if a combination of money and name recognition can earn him enough support in public opinion polls to muscle his way into the presidential debates, he could throw enough verbal bombs to screw things up for all the other candidates.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Gotta Trump: The Donald Is in for 2016\n\nDuring the 2012 Republican primary, which was often compared to a \u201cclown car\u201d as candidates blundered during debates, was a disaster for the GOP. It was expensive, and left Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee, much further to the right than he wanted to be, as well as substantially damaged by his opponents\u2019 concerted attacks.\n\nAvoiding needless acrimony in the primary is a major goal for the Republican National Committee this time around, but Trump\u2019s current status may subvert that plan and make history repeat itself in the 2016 cycle.\n\nTrump actually came in second in a Fox News poll last week, trailing only former Florida governor Jeb Bush. He also placed second to Bush in a Suffolk University poll of voters in the key primary state of New Hampshire. At the moment, Trump is safely ensconced among the GOP\u2019s top 10 candidates, which clears the bar for competing in the first debate to be held in Cleveland in August.\n\nThe Univision blow-up this week will probably be good for Trump, in that it grabbed attention and will focus many primary voters concerned about illegal immigration on Trump\u2019s strong anti-immigration stance. But what\u2019s good for Trump is decidedly not good for a GOP working hard to repair its image with Hispanics. And, it demonstrates exactly why the party is concerned about a Trump candidacy.\n\nRelated: Trump-mentum Storms the Granite State \u2013 Sort Of\n\nTrump, who in his presidential kickoff speech suggested that the majority of Mexicans who try to enter the United States illegally are rapists or drug dealers, got some unsurprising pushback from the good people south of the border, who took his remarks personally.\n\nOne fellow, with an evident taste for irony, decided to go all capitalist on The Donald. He designed a pi\u00f1ata highlighting the Republican presidential hopeful\u2019s oddly-coiffed head, which Mexican children can pummel with bats at parties. Apparently, he can\u2019t keep them in stock and has turned a tidy profit.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s most notable adversary in the past week has been Univision, which announced Thursday that it would no longer carry the Miss Universe Pageant on its network. The network had agreed to a five-year contract to show pageant, which is partly owned by Trump.\n\nThe parties might have settled their differences quietly, and in court. But this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about here. He told Politico\u2019s Dylan Byers that the company had folded due to pressure placed on it by the Mexican government.\n\nVia Twitter, Trump suggested that Univision might actually be controlled by the Mexican government.\n\nRelated: Trump Is the GOP Houseguest Who Just Won\u2019t Leave\n\n.@Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S. Are they controlled by the Mexican government? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2015\n\n(Univision, based in New York, is actually a U.S. company that got its start in San Antonio.)\n\nThen things began to get personal. Byers on Friday reported that a letter sent from Trump to Univision CEO Randy Falco, banned the network\u2019s employees from using the Trump National Doral Miami, a golf resort near the network\u2019s Miami offices.\n\nPart of the letter quoted by Byers read, \u201cPlease be advised that under no circumstances is any officer or representative of Univision allowed to use Trump National Doral, Miami\u2014its golf courses or any of its facilities. Also, please immediately stop work and close the gate, which is being constructed between our respective properties. If this is not done within one week, we will close it.\u201d\n\nUnivision responded by issuing an order to all its employees directing them not to stay at Trump properties when they travel or to host events at facilities owned by Trump.\n\nBy Friday, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, which is typically filled with his retweets of people making fawning remarks about him, was practically dedicated to the Univision spat, including this call for a boycott of the network.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Donald Trump Things Donald Trump Said in His Presidential Announcement\n\nAnyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2015\n\nUnivision, to be sure, was not totally blameless. The company\u2019s president, Alberto Ciurana used social media to post a picture comparing Trump to Dylann Roof, the white racist who murdered nine innocent African Americans at a church in South Carolina last week.\n\nCiurana later issued an apology, but Trump was not feeling magnanimous.\n\n\u201cApology not accepted,\u201d Trump said in a statement Friday. \u201cI call for his resignation as president of Univision. He added, \u201cUnivision should not be allowed to host the Presidential debate. It is a total conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s shtick may pay well in the primaries, but it doesn\u2019t paint the picture of a candidate ready to engage in delicate international negotiations let alone domestic politics.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s public spat with Univision last week was a prime example of why, since the moment Trump announced that he was planning to run for the Republican presidential nomination, the GOP has been getting increasingly nervous.", "title": "Trump Throws a Monkey-Wrench Into GOP Primary Hopes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/28/Trump-Throws-Monkey-Wrench-GOP-Primary-Hopes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06282015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/28/Trump-Throws-Monkey-Wrench-GOP-Primary-Hopes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06282015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s public spat with Univision last week was a prime example of why, since the moment Trump announced that he was planning to run for the Republican presidential nomination, the GOP has been getting increasingly nervous.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd648d\"", "article_summary": "But what\u2019s good for Trump is decidedly not good for a GOP working hard to repair its image with Hispanics.\nRelated: The 8 Most Donald Trump Things Donald Trump Said in His Presidential AnnouncementAnyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision.\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Gotta Trump: The Donald Is in for 2016During the 2012 Republican primary, which was often compared to a \u201cclown car\u201d as candidates blundered during debates, was a disaster for the GOP.\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about here.\nIt\u2019s a prime example of why, since the moment Trump announced that he was planning to run for the Republican presidential nomination, the GOP has been getting increasingly nervous."}
