According to reports, Democratic Governor Pat Quinn isn't totally opposed to the idea.\n\nGov. Pat Quinn says he would consider using state resources to help combat Chicago street violence, but only if city officials want the assistance.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on this week\u2019s mass shooting in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, Quinn was asked whether there have been discussions about sending in the state police or Illinois National Guard to assist Chicago police.\n\n\n\nThe governor said he\u2019s had no specific conversations but noted state police are helping patrol in East St. Louis, another city that has its challenges with violent crime.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has to be done in a coordinated fashion with the local law enforcement, with their full cooperation,\u201d Quinn told reporters Saturday.\n\n\n\nQuinn did not specifically veto the idea of deploying Guard members in Chicago. A press aide later told CBS 2 the governor was speaking only about the possibility of using state police to help out.\n\nJust last week, thirteen people were shot in what Chicago police called a \"gang related incident.\" Over the weekend, 23 people were shot and three were killed. Last year, we saw 500 murders in the Windy City. This years rates are on track to pass that number. The FBI has officially dubbed Chicago the murder capitol of the United States. The place is a war zone.\n\nWill the National Guard help? You bet. But the bottom line is this: until these communities are allowed to help themselves, nothing will change. As long as Chicago continues to suffocate citizens with victim inducing gun control, nothing will change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the violence in the streets of Chicago rages on abetted, it might be time for the local police to get some help from the National Guard..05/24/2016 10:42:12AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "As the violence in the streets of Chicago rages on abetted, it might be time for the local police to get some help from the National Guard.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - National Guard to Patrol Chicago's Gang Plagued Neighborhoods?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/09/23/national-guard-to-patrol-chicagos-gang-plagued-neighborhoods-n1707546", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2007/277/2007-10-04T155627Z_01_WAS802_RTRIDSP_0_USA-SOLDIERS.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "As the violence in the streets of Chicago rages on abetted, it might be time for the local police to get some help from the National Guard.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - National Guard to Patrol Chicago's Gang Plagued Neighborhoods?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/09/23/national-guard-to-patrol-chicagos-gang-plagued-neighborhoods-n1707546", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2007/277/2007-10-04T155627Z_01_WAS802_RTRIDSP_0_USA-SOLDIERS.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "National Guard to Patrol Chicago's Gang Plagued Neighborhoods?, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbf6\"", "article_summary": "Will the National Guard help?\nAs the violence in the streets of Chicago rages on abetted, it might be time for the local police to get some help from the National Guard.\nPat Quinn says he would consider using state resources to help combat Chicago street violence, but only if city officials want the assistance.\nA press aide later told CBS 2 the governor was speaking only about the possibility of using state police to help out.\nSpeaking on this week\u2019s mass shooting in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, Quinn was asked whether there have been discussions about sending in the state police or Illinois National Guard to assist Chicago police."}
