One top Republican candidate said that the focus should be on allowing Christians into the country.\n\nThe attacks, which killed 129 people and wounded 352 more in various public spaces around Paris, are believed to be the work of the terror group ISIS, which currently controls parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\nRelated: With ISIS Making Millions, U.S. Boosts Its Attacks on Oil Fields\n\nA wave of Syrian refugees fleeing the fighting in their home country has been overwhelming Europe this year, and the U.S. promise to take in thousands of refugees came in response to please for other nations to offer assistance.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the victims of the fighting in Syria are Muslim, but in two interviews Sunday morning, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is running for the Republican Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination, said that U.S. efforts to aid refugees should target only Christians.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Christians in Syria that have no place now,\u201d former Florida governor Jeb Bush said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ll be either executed or imprisoned either by [Syrian dictator Bashar al-] Assad or by ISIS. We should focus our efforts as it relates to the refugees to the Christians that are being slaughtered.\u201d\n\nHow are U.S. authorities supposed to determine who is and who is not Christian, asked host Jake Tapper.\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Has a New Price Tag -- $5 Billion and Counting\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time,\u201d Bush replied. \u201cIt takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed into the United States. We need to be, obviously, very, very cautious.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press later Sunday morning, he repeated his call to aid Christians above others. The majority of refugees should be kept in \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria, he said.\n\n\u201cI do think we have a responsibility to help with refugees, and I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThey\u2019re being beheaded, they\u2019re being executed by both sides, and I think we have a responsibility to help. But ultimately the best way to deal with refugees is to have a strategy to take out ISIS and Assad.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no question that ISIS has been persecuting Christians, the vast majority of the terror group\u2019s victims in Iraq and Syria have actually been other Muslims who do not adhere to the strict version of Sunni Islam.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Congress Still Won\u2019t Okay the Wars in Iraq and Syria\n\nThe White House has said emphatically that Friday\u2019s attacks will not change the Obama administration\u2019s plan to allow refugees from Syrian into the country. However, some in Washington are calling on the administration to stop allowing refugees into the country altogether.\n\nWhite House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Sunday that the Obama administration remains committed to taking in Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cSome of these people are people who have suffered to horrors of war, they\u2019re women, they\u2019re orphans, they\u2019re children who have suffered at the hands of ISIL,\u201d Rhodes said, using the administration\u2019s preferred acronym for the terror group. \u201cWe cannot close our doors to these people. We can focus on keeping terrorists out of the United States while having an open door to people who deserve a safe haven.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith respect to refugees we have the most extensive security vetting that we have ever had to deal with Syrian refugees coming into the United States.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Half-Truth About Trying to Enlist in the Marines\n\nRep. Peter King (R-NY), who chairs the counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on Sunday that Rhodes\u2019 claim was \u201cuntrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s virtually no vetting because there are no databases in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no government records. We don\u2019t know who these people are. And when you meet with the people doing the vetting, they tell us that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey are rolling the dice here, and we know that ISIS wants to bring in terrorists with these refugees.\u201d\n\nKing called for the refugee program to be suspended.\n\nRelated: Trump to Carson \u2013 There Can Be Only One of Us\n\nRep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who chairs the full Homeland Security Committee said Sunday, \u201cFrankly, I disagree with Ben Rhodes. I\u2019ve been briefed by the FBI and Homeland Security, and they tell me this cannot be properly done. We don\u2019t have the databases to vet them past.\n\nMcCaul said that he has been told that at least two of the Paris attackers were from Syria, adding that that makes him concerned about the safety of the refugee program.\n\n\u201cThis causes a grave concern on the part of policymakers because we don\u2019t want to be complicit with a program that could bring potential terrorists into the United States,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Paris changes everything,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said that in the wake of the Paris attacks, in which at least one purported Syrian refugee has been implicated, the U.S. should focus on helping \u201cChristian\u201d refugees.", "title": "Bush: U.S. Should Only Accept \u2018Christian\u2019 Refugees from Syria", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/15/Bush-US-Should-only-Accept-Christian-Refugees-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Syrian-refugees.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/15/Bush-US-Should-only-Accept-Christian-Refugees-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Syrian-refugees.jpeg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said that in the wake of the Paris attacks, in which at least one purported Syrian refugee has been implicated, the U.S. should focus on helping \u201cChristian\u201d refugees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Sunday that the Obama administration remains committed to taking in Syrian refugees.\n\u201cThere are a lot of Christians in Syria that have no place now,\u201d former Florida governor Jeb Bush said in an interview with CNN.\n\u201cI do think we have a responsibility to help with refugees, and I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\u201d Bush said.\nThe majority of refugees should be kept in \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria, he said.\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Has a New Price Tag -- $5 Billion and Counting\u201cWe do that all the time,\u201d Bush replied."}
