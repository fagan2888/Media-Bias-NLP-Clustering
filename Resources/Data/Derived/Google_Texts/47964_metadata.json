This time, 75 percent said yes. And, again, the numbers were right in line with what most Americans say.\n\nAs the pollsters concluded:\n\nAmericans who obtained new health insurance policies in 2014 using the government exchanges are roughly as positive about their healthcare coverage and the quality of healthcare they receive as the average insured American, and are more satisfied with the cost of their coverage. More than two-thirds of the newly insured who purchased coverage through federal or state exchanges intend to renew their exchange policies, while another 7% plan to look for a different policy through the exchanges.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time research has shown that people who bought coverage on the new marketplaces have been pleased with their coverage. A July study by the Commonwealth Fund produced nearly identical numbers, with 68 percent of respondents rating their coverage as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cvery good,\u201d or \u201cexcellent,\u201d and 70 percent saying they could afford the care they need. (See the infographic at the end of this item.)\n\nThese surveys don\u2019t tell us everything, obviously. For one thing, over the course of a year, relatively few people will have the kind of serious medical problems that truly test an insurance policy. The primary concern, with health care, is always with that minority of people who do\u2014and how they fare. A true universal coverage system that guaranteed truly comprehensive coverage would have numbers that were higher still, so that a higher percentage found their medical coverage affordable.\n\nBut the non-group market\u2014that is, people buying coverage on their own\u2014is traditionally the part of the insurance market where people have struggled the most, because decent coverage was so hard to find. The Gallup poll, which reinforces the Commonwealth Fund findings, is a sign of progress for millions of people.\n\nYou hear a lot about what\u2019s wrong with the coverage available through the marketplaces and some of these criticisms are legitimate. The narrow networks of providers are confusing, for example, and lack of sufficient regulations leaves some patients unfairly on the hook for ridiculously high bills. But overall the plans turn out to be as popular as other forms of private and public insurance. It\u2019s one more sign that, if you can just block out the negative headlines and political attacks, you\u2019ll discover a program that is working.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A casual reader of the news over the past few days might think Obamacare is an unmitigated failure\u2014an unfolding disaster that will be to President Obama what Katrina and the Iraq War were to Bush.
