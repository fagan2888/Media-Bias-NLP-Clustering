CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports authorities were on high alert across Europe. In Belgium, authorities moved swiftly to pre-empt what they called a major impending attack.\n\nFree speech\n\nAlthough last week's killings in France launched a massive movement in defense of freedom of expression, they also launched an inevitable debate on its limits. At some schools, especially in Paris' poor suburbs with large Muslim populations, some students would not observe last week's minute's silence for the dead cartoonists who worked at Charlie Hebdo. CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports they said what many were thinking: that the paper should have held back out of respect.\n\nSnooping\n\nPresident Obama will have more meetings Friday with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The two are expected to discuss topics ranging from international terror to Ebola. As CBS News White House correspondent Bill Plante reports, Cameron is also expected to press the president on the sensitive subject of government snooping.\n\nFund raising\n\nNot long after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he was actively exploring a 2016 presidential bid, he moved to set up two fundraising vehicles named \"Right to Rise.\" One is a leadership political action committee (PAC) and the other, a \"super PAC.\" The cash brought in by the two can be used to support other candidates, the party, or to fund Bush's travel to engage in those activities. And it is a way for Bush to start activating his potential donor network. Federal election law will enable him to take the money his super PAC is raising right now and turn it toward the support of his yet undeclared candidacy.\n\nLeading indicator\n\nThe U.S. economy is being buoyed by low gas prices, falling unemployment and a rebound in job creation, but for Wall Street, the real gauge of economic stability is corporate earnings.\n\nToo young?\n\nA hot debate is unfolding in a Washington, D.C., suburb over how much freedom is safe for young children. It all started when a 6- and a 10-year-old were taking a walk on a busy street and got picked up by police. CBS News correspondent Chip Reid reports from Silver Spring, Maryland that the parents are now in trouble with Child Protective Services.\n\nMovie warning\n\nThe movie \"Still Alice\" is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Lisa Genova, who it turns out isn't just a novelist. Before turning to writing fiction, Genova earned a PhD in neuroscience at Harvard University, and has since become an activist seeking to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions that are too often misunderstood.\n\nMass deaths\n\nThousands of birds falling from the sky. Millions of fish washing up on the shore. Honey bee populations being decimated. Bats being overtaken by a deadly fungus. Piglets dying in droves from a mysterious disease. It was tragic stories such as those that prompted a group of researchers embark on a broad review. Their analysis revealed that not only are these events becoming more frequent, they're increasing in magnitude. Here are the causes.\n\nL.A. landmark?\n\nA commission in Los Angeles is considering landmark status for Norms, a 24-hour diner beloved by fans of mid-century architecture. They're worried the iconic building could be wiped off the map. CBS News Correspondent Ben Tracy reports on the fight to preserve Southern California's disappearing post-war treasures.\n\nTop News\n\nWorld\n\nU.S. to send more than 400 troops to train Syrian rebels\n\nPope Francis urges Philippines to end corruption\n\nHomegrown terror threat higher in Europe than U.S.\n\nPolitics\n\nJoni Ernst to deliver GOP response to State of the Union\n\nChris Christie's 2016 presidential message: \"Relax\"\n\nRand Paul in the land of the free\n\nU.S.\n\nOklahoma puts first inmate to death since botched execution\n\nDuke reverses plan to allow Islamic call to prayer from campus chapel\n\nWomen get chance at Army Ranger course for first time\n\nMoneyWatch\n\nYou don't want to be in a car accident in this state\n\nHow Obamacare is affecting Americans' medical bills\n\nHealth\n\nLack of exercise may be twice as deadly as obesity\n\nRed Cross nurse dies of Ebola\n\nADHD drug could help treat binge eating", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arrests in anti-terror sweeps in 3 European nations; how free should free speech be amid terrorism concerns?; couple probed for practicing &quot;free-range parenting&quot;", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-jan-16-2015/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/01/16/788d9e6b-9a05-459d-b0eb-2aa7aaf39afb/thumbnail/1200x630/0ac204bd538f0a8b4670ea7b4a4224b5/2015-01-16t121144z87132269gm1eb1g1k0x01rtrmadp3belgium-security.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Arrests in anti-terror sweeps in 3 European nations; how free should free speech be amid terrorism concerns?; couple probed for practicing \"free-range parenting\"", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, Jan. 16, 2015"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arrests in anti-terror sweeps in 3 European nations; how free should free speech be amid terrorism concerns?; couple probed for practicing \"free-range parenting\"", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, Jan. 16, 2015", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-jan-16-2015/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-jan-16-2015/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-jan-16-2015/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/01/16/788d9e6b-9a05-459d-b0eb-2aa7aaf39afb/thumbnail/1200x630/0ac204bd538f0a8b4670ea7b4a4224b5/2015-01-16t121144z87132269gm1eb1g1k0x01rtrmadp3belgium-security.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-jan-16-2015/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-jan-16-2015/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1014\"", "article_summary": "One is a leadership political action committee (PAC) and the other, a \"super PAC.\"\nCBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports they said what many were thinking: that the paper should have held back out of respect.\nCBS News Correspondent Ben Tracy reports on the fight to preserve Southern California's disappearing post-war treasures.\nCBS News correspondent Chip Reid reports from Silver Spring, Maryland that the parents are now in trouble with Child Protective Services.\nCBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports authorities were on high alert across Europe."}
