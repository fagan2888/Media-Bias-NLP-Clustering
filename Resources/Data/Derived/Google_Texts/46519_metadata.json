David Vitter, left, with Republican Rep. John Fleming, who plans to run for Vitter's Senate seat. (Photo: File photo)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican Rep. John Fleming is on a mission to highlight his conservative record as gets ready to run for the Senate seat held by David Vitter.\n\nFleming and 30 other conservative House members recently wrote to GOP leaders saying they would refuse to support any measure that includes funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 even if doing so shuts down the federal government .\n\nIn keeping with that pledge, Fleming voted Wednesday against a stopgap spending bill that contains money for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cAmericans, not just Republicans, want a more conservative and a more activist member in the House and the Senate,\u2019\u2019 said Fleming, R-Minden. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m the most conservative among those interested in what we think will be an open seat here very soon... It\u2019s simply a reflection of where this country, and in particular the state of Louisiana, is going.\u2019\u2019\n\nFleming, a favorite of the tea party movement who is serving his fourth term, has said he will run for the Senate if Vitter wins the Louisiana governor's race. Others expected to run include Republicans Rep. Charles Boustany, retired Air Force Col. Rob Maness and state Treasurer John Kennedy.\n\nJeffrey Sadow, a political scientist at the Louisiana State University at Shreveport, called Fleming\u2019s campaign \u201cpre-emptive.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s out there laying claim to the conservative real estate,\u2019\u2019 Sadow said. \u201cBy all indications, he\u2019s doing a pretty decent job of it. If he\u2019s successful, there\u2019s no room for these other kinds of candidates and so they\u2019ve got to try to claim space elsewhere.\u2019\u2019\n\nFleming is a founding member of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus, which had pushed for a no-confidence vote in House Speaker John Boehner. That was the major reason Boehner recently announced he will leave Congress at the end of October.\n\nFleming also belongs to the Congressional Prayer Caucus.\n\nHe opposed the nuclear deal with Iran, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms passed in response to the Great Recession, and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which he called a \u201cdisaster for our economy and for businesses.\u2019\u2019\n\nLast week, Fleming introduced a resolution calling for President Obama to declare a National Day of Prayer for law enforcement officials.\n\nSadow said Fleming and other Republicans don't want a repeat of 2014, when Maness, also a tea party favorite, took votes away from Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy in the race to unseat Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Maness' participation forced Cassidy into a costly runoff against Landrieu, which Cassidy won.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want an insurgency candidate like that, whether it\u2019s him (Maness) or someone else,\u2019\u2019 Sadow said. \u201cIf (Fleming) can really demonstrate conservative credentials, there\u2019s no room for a guy like Maness.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut Maness already is working with national and state fundraisers and has interviewed a possible campaign manager.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fast and furious.\u2019\u2019\n\nManess said he hopes to take advantage of the \u201coutsider momentum\u2019\u2019 of Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Mr. Fleming is the most conservative voting member of the Louisiana delegation in the House,\u2019\u2019 said Maness. \u201cUnfortunately, he\u2019s not an outsider. I think the people of Louisiana are looking for someone that\u2019s got the leadership experience, and that\u2019s not leadership experience based on politics.\u2019\u2019\n\nPearson Cross, a political scientist at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette said the race for donors, campaign staff and super PAC support already is underway in the contest for Vitter's seat.\n\n\u201cAll the steps (candidates) take now will save them time and money later on,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nFleming spent much of the August recess ginning up support and raising money. He said he met with groups throughout the state, including pastors in the Bossier City/Shreveport area, bankers and law enforcement officials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically sitting down and talking with anybody that wants to talk about the future of our nation, especially in our state, and how we need to reform how government works for us, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be working for us,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2014 Contact Deborah Barfield Berry at dberry@gannett.com.
