The Supreme Court is wrapping up its term and issued four decisions Monday, but none were the half-dozen biggest cases pending. As in prior years, it looks like the court is saving the best for last: Ahead of a decision on the legality of a portion of the Affordable Care Act, hospitals, doctors and consumers are preparing for the fallout should the court strike down subsidies that help 6.4 million Americans buy insurance. The court is also expected to rule on a case challenging lethal injections, a suit seen as one of the most significant challenges in years to the way the death penalty is administered. A ruling on gay marriage is also expected.
