The state's move to force rates higher than those proposed is in response to concerns that Oregon's Obamacare prices were too low for what insurers were paying out to cover for customers' health benefits.



In 2014, Oregon insurers collected $703 million in premiums, but paid out $830 million on their plans, the Oregonian noted, citing insurers' financial reports.

"We need to ensure a market that long term is stable, competitive and insurers pricing that is much closer to the cost of delivering health care," Oregon's director of Consumer and Business Services Pat Allen told the newspaper.

The rates for 2016 won't become final until after public hearings later this month.

While the state is concerned about the finances of insurers, customers could be in for some big surprises, particularly if they do not have their premiums subsidized by federal tax credits.

Instead, the state is calling for Zoom Health to charge $291 per month, or 25 percent more.

Silver plans cover 70 percent of the in-network medical costs of their customers, with customers owing the balance in out-of-pocket payments. Silver plans are the second least-expensive type of Obamacare plans and are the most popular.
