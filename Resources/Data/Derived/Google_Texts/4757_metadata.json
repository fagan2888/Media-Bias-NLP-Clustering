One day, it was said, he was sitting at his desk when a neighbor called him. \u201cYour house is on fire!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, is it bothering you?\u201d the old man answered, and hung up the phone. Latest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number I tell this story to my students to illustrate the constitutional law principle of \u201cstanding to sue.\u201d \u201cStanding\u201d made the news last week when Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the House of Representatives, as a body, has \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the Obama administration\u2019s method of funding part of the Affordable Care Act. Judge Collyer did not decide that the administration has done anything wrong. All her opinion said was that the House is actually claiming to be on fire, and actually claiming that Obama set the blaze. Why do federal courts use the \u201chouse on fire\u201d principle? Because, under the Constitution, federal courts are courts of \u201climited jurisdiction.\u201d They can\u2019t decide issues\u2014even really, really important ones\u2014just because people really, really want them to. The language of Article III limits federal courts to deciding \u201ccases or controversies,\u201d meaning real disputes where each party has something real\u2014not just a difference of opinion about the law\u2014in the game.\n\nIn House of Representatives v. Burwell, the House claims that the administration\u2019s funding of one section of the ACA violates Congress\u2019s famous \u201cpower of the purse.\u201d The Constitution not only grants to Congress the power to tax and spend to \u201cpay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare;\u201d it adds that only Congress can authorize these payments (Article I Section 9 cl. 7: \u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law\u201d). Neither side disputes the basic rules. The administration does not claim authority to spend without Congressional approval; it argues that Congress actually did make an appropriation; the House says that Congress did no such thing. There\u2019s no easy answer to that question, because appropriating money isn\u2019t a matter of magic words; if Congress passing a statute directing the executive to make certain expenditures, the executive may be required to fund them out of \u201clump-sum\u201d appropriations (the entire sum approved for a given cabinet department) with no need for a special line item. Collyer will get to the issue of whose statutory reading is right later; first she had to decide that the House really could sue. The idea of \u201clegislative standing\u201d\u2014that a member of a legislative body, or the legislative body itself can sue the executive when it does something the legislature doesn\u2019t like\u2014has bounced around the federal courts for nearly a century. The claims often fall apart on the precise question of injury. If the executive simply ignores the \u201cno appropriation\u201d clause, then the House has a complete remedy\u2014impeachment of the executive official responsible (up to and including the President); such a violation could also later be prosecuted under a federal statute called the Anti-Deficiency Act. But mere misinterpretation or misapplication of the law, the argument goes, doesn\u2019t deprive any member of the House of his or her authority, or strip the body of its ability to enact law and appropriations. The legislature can amend the statute to remove any ambiguity.\n\nThe Court once held that a group of state legislators had standing to sue their secretary of state for (they claimed) wrongly certifying the legislature as having approved a constitutional amendment. Their claim was that this action nullified their votes. (It was a hollow victory: The Court immediately dismissed the case as a \u201cpolitical question.\u201d) It has also held that a group of members of Congress did not have standing to challenge a law providing the president a line-item veto; the law took power from the House, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote, but did not injure these members in particular: \u201cIn the vote on the Line Item Veto Act, their votes were given full effect. They simply lost that vote.\u201d Last term, the Court upheld standing for the Arizona Legislature in its suit against the independent commission set up by voters to draw electoral districts. The initiative would \u201cwould \u2018completely nullif[y]\u2019 any vote by the Legislature\u201d to draw districts, the Court reasoned, thus injuring the entire body, not just some members. (Another hollow victory; the Court then held that the voters had the power to evict the legislature from redistricting.) \u201cThe courts have often said that the fact that you don\u2019t want to go too far down a path doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t start down it.\u201d But for a court to intervene in state-government disputes over the Constitution is one thing; the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause suggests that any branch of state government is liable to federal jurisdiction. As far as my research shows, however, this is the first time in American history that a judge has found that one of the Houses of Congress has standing to sue the president over appropriations. Peter Shane of Ohio State University, a separation-of-powers guru, notes the difference: \u201cRelying on theories of legislative standing that supported past federal lawsuits by state legislators ignores the separation of powers considerations that undergird standing law.\u201d This is a fight between the other two co-equal branches; there is no Supremacy Clause to eliminate doubt about the Court\u2019s authority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge ruled that Congress has standing to sue Obama for his administration\u2019s health care spending.
