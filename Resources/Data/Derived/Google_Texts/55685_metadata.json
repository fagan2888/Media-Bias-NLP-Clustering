Connie Leyva D-Chino, Assembly members Ling Ling Chang, R-Chino Hills, and Marc Steinorth, R-Rancho Cucamonga \u2014 rejected Senate Bill 443, a bipartisan attempt to reform asset forfeiture in our state.\n\nI find it unethical that law enforcement and municipalities can seize property without conviction.\n\nAsset forfeiture is a controversial tool to reduce crime because the municipalities are given a percentage of the seized property and they are reluctant to give the property back, even when the person is found innocent or not charged with a crime.\n\nAsset forfeiture is legalized theft and the practice needs accountability if it continues to be used by law enforcement in our state.\n\nI know city governments are hurting for cash, but this is one technique that should not be their primary bread and butter.\n\nCities should learn to recruit business, residents and tourists instead of behaving like Mexican police officers. If you are fed up with this process, feel free to let your legislators know.\n\n\u2014 Matthew Munson, Ontario\n\nWhy no picture of car owner\u2019s 1970 Camaro?\n\nRe \u201cRoute 66 Cruisin\u2019 Reunion in Ontario celebrates classic cars\u201d (Sept. 19):\n\nAm I the only one that was disappointed by the front page story regarding Lawana Copeland\u2019s passion for restoring her 1970 Chevy Camaro?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it have been nice to see a picture of both her and her car in the story? Instead, we saw pictures of other owners\u2019 vehicles, but not hers. I just thought it would have made a more meaningful story.\n\n\u2014 Glenn Norden, Upland\n\nCal State San Bernardino has a lot to offer students\n\nRe \u201cCal State San Bernardino kicks off 50th year\u201d (Sept. 21):\n\nThe recent 50th anniversary convocation address presented by Cal State University San Bernardino (CSUSB) President Tom\u00e1s D. Morales summarized the amazing success of the university since its origination.\n\nBut beyond that, it was mind-boggling to learn that more than 20,000 students are enrolled in higher-education studies at the beautiful campus.\n\nI am pleased that two of my children hold a Cal State San Bernardino degree, and I was also able to advance my own knowledge within the university\u2019s academic studies program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a senior citizen, I want to encourage more \u201cover 50\u201d residents to investigate the educational enrichment that CSUSB has to offer, as I did while a senior citizen.\n\nThere should be ample opportunity to learn more about CSUSB during the upcoming year during special 50th anniversary events, academic lectures and conferences, as CSUSB celebrates continuous service to regional communities as well as serving its hometown city of San Bernardino!\n\n\u2014 Joan Marie Patsky, Beaumont\n\nSome thoughts on Pope Francis\u2019 visit to U.S.\n\nAfter reading newspapers, viewing news coverage on TV and then listening to Pope Francis\u2019 address to Congress and the United Nations, it was disturbingly obvious that the Pope has been unduly influenced by President Obama regarding the distribution of wealth, the Affordable Care Act, U.S. relations with Cuba, the bad Iran nuclear deal and climate change \u2014 which is a social, political and economic shame.\n\nIt was, however, heartening to hear Pope Francis\u2019 strong support of life at conception, traditional marriage, family and America.\n\n\u2014 Daniel B.
