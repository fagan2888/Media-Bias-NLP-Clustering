It has been corrected since it first published.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t made out either. Thanks for the call, you lush.\u201d\n\nI felt my body simultaneously go cold and hot at the horror of seeing this. I wanted to shut my laptop and throw it in a closet, as if hiding the object responsible for delivering this would fix things. \u201cThings\u201d being a private message between myself and a friend I, admittedly, drunk dialed\u2014back in 2006, when I was but a young, stupid, and yes, drunk, college sophomore.\n\nAnd there it was, for god and every one of my Facebook friends to see. Sitting on my Timeline, as if it were a public note posted to what used to be my Wall. It wasn\u2019t the only one. Not even close.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. Back in September 2012, about a year after Facebook introduced Timeline, users began reporting that responses to private messages were popping up. This means that they didn\u2019t see their own end of the conversations, just the other person\u2019s. Of course, it was sometimes difficult to tell: Facebook used to be a much smaller, more private place, where people would write more personal things on friends\u2019 Walls. The Timeline gave us instant-toggle access to revisiting those times, and while some of the posts could very well have actually been posted to Walls, some of them were absolutely private.\n\nFacebook extensively went on the defensive then, saying that inalmost all cases these were in fact old Wall posts we\u2019d simply forgotten about\u2014we must have been surprised at our earlier candor.But some did turn out to be private messages that had somehow found their way to a place they shouldn\u2019t have been. [Facebook reached out to me to correct this, saying: \u201cEvery post we investigated [last year] turned out to be a wall post.\u201d]\n\nAnd apparently, this bug is back.\n\nIt starts like a tick\u2014a small, almost-ignorable twinge beckoning you. You can try and suppress it, and even if you tell yourself you\u2019ve suppressed it, a part of you gives in. And then the inky, oily, unstoppable spread of shame washes over you\u2014not fast, like a wave, but slow. Like molasses being poured.\n\nThat\u2019s what recalling an embarrassing memory is like. It\u2019s a very visceral, physical effect\u2014painful, even. We are each an unwilling owner of memories unintendedly stumbled upon while wandering through our subconscious: No! I just wanted to remember who my 7th grade homeroom teacher was, not how I accidentally called her \u201cMom\u201d in front of the whole class that one time!\n\nWe have no choice in it. Anytime I accidentally come across the time I fainted while the Comcast guy was installing my cable or when I had a cast on my leg and got dog poop in it (two weeks before getting it off), I can feel my body trying to retreat into itself, to protect me from my previous horribleness.\n\nSuch an unfortunate experience isn\u2019t only spurred by real-life memories. A recent study found that Facebook can cause a significant amount of anguish. \u201cAlmost every participant in the study could describe something that happened on Facebook in the past six months that was embarrassing or made them feel awkward or uncomfortable,\u201d Northwestern University\u2019s Jeremy Birnholtz, one of the paper\u2019s authors, explains. \u201cWe were interested in the strength of the emotional response to this type of encounter.\u201d\n\nI can now vouch for that.\n\nThe investigation started shortly after I read the aforementioned study. I wanted to use my Timeline and that easy-to-access yearly toggle to go back and look at some of my posts from (relatively) long ago, to see if I could read the status updates and comments without embarrassment.\n\nI could not: I\u2019m ashamed of how clever I thought I was to write my status updates in third person (i.e., \u201c[Molly is] surprised by how many bowls of cereal she can consume in a week.\u201d) It\u2019s embarrassing how banal most of my posts were. Why I thought anyone was interested in my daily schedule or how sleepy I was in class is beyond me. And my short-lived enthusiasm for the Twilight saga (which lasted right up until I saw the first movie and then went into a recovery program) is so cringeworthy I want to travel back in time and slap my 22-year-old self.\n\nBut all of this pales in comparison to how it felt when I realized I was looking at private messages on my Timeline. A series of posts from my boyfriend at the time seemed oddly inane, and semi-related. As I kept reading them, I realized this was a message he\u2019d sent me\u2014either over Chat or Messages. He talked about some picture of us from a party, his homework plans that night, the tailgate that weekend, what we should make for dinner. Nothing terribly incriminating, yet terribly personal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A friend's response to my drunken come-on went public, and Facebook staff weren't much help", "title": "Facebook released my messages from college", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/15/facebook_outed_my_private_messages_from_college_partner/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "A friend's response to my drunken come-on went public, and Facebook staff weren't much help", "title": "Facebook released my messages from college"}, "twitter": {"description": "A friend's response to my drunken come-on went public, and Facebook staff weren't much help", "title": "Facebook released my messages from college", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Molly McHugh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Facebook, Facebook Private Messages, internet privacy, Social Media, the daily dot, Timeline", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Facebook, Facebook Private Messages, internet privacy, Social Media, the daily dot, Timeline, Technology News, Life News, NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily Dot .\nBack in September 2012, about a year after Facebook introduced Timeline, users began reporting that responses to private messages were popping up.\nBut all of this pales in comparison to how it felt when I realized I was looking at private messages on my Timeline.\nAs I kept reading them, I realized this was a message he\u2019d sent me\u2014either over Chat or Messages.\nAnd there it was, for god and every one of my Facebook friends to see."}
