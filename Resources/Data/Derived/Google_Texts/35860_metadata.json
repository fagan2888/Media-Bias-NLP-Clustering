Based in Africa, the company recruits individuals to train as software developers over the course of four months. The fellows then make a four-year commitment \u2013 they're placed to work remotely with a technology company that partners with Andela, and receive continual training and professional development while they live on campus. Most of the companies Andela partners with \u2013 such as Microsoft, 2U (the company Johnson co-founded in 2008) and Udacity \u2013 are based in the United States.\n\n[READ: Coding Companies Fill a Gap Between Higher Education and the Workforce]\n\nThe venture-backed company \u2013 which received funding from high-profile individuals such as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, AOL co-founder Steve Case and Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks \u2013 invests about $10,000 in salary and training costs per student during the training process before the fellows are placed with a company.\n\nJohnson says he was inspired to focus on training individuals in Africa after he visited Nairobi about a year and a half ago\u200b to speak to industry donors and partners about the state of online education.\n\n\"I just became kind of blown away by the incredible under-utilized human capital that I saw everywhere,\" Johnson says.\n\nOlajumoke Oladimeji, 30, was Andela\u2019s first female fellow. Courtesy of Chidi Ashimole/Andela\n\nIn some African nations \u2013 such as South Africa \u2013 youth unemployment is higher than 50 percent. In Nigeria, where Andela's main campus is located in the city of Lagos, more than 11 million people between 15 and 34 were unemployed in 2012 \u2013 and college graduates accounted for 20 percent of that population, according to an analysis by\u200b the Brookings Institution. And Johnson says when youth underemployment is taken into account, about 90 percent of young people are considered unemployed or underemployed in some parts of the continent.\n\n\"[That] means even the brightest young people just don't have paths into the formal economy,\" Johnson says.\n\nOlajumoke Oladimeji, 30, graduated from Lagos State University in 2009 with a degree in computer and electronic engineering, but says she was unable to find a job afterward.\n\nShe says she set out on her own to start a catering business in her neighborhood before later joining a brokerage\u200b firm \u2013 a job, but not one where she could use her degree.\n\n[ALSO: Making it Count: Computer Science Spreads as Graduation Requirement]\n\n\"I had always wanted to be a software developer. I had even applied for a job as a developer and built an app as part of the application process, but I didn't get the position,\" Oladimeji says. \"Nevertheless, I was still determined to be a programmer, so when a friend told me about Andela I saw it as an opportunity to fulfill my dream.\"\n\nOladimeji became Andela's first female fellow earlier this year. She's also one of a very select group of people that makes it through Andela's selection process. Johnson says the company has received 14,000 applications in the last 10 months, and has an acceptance rate of less than 1 percent. By comparison, the most selective universities in the United States \u2013 Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton and Columbia, for example \u2013 all have acceptance rates between 5 percent and 8 percent.\n\nFrom left, Yetunde Sanni, instructor Nadayar Enegesi, Kosi Anyanwu and other developers attend the Andela all-female boot camp in December 2014. Courtesy of Mohini Ufeli/Andela\n\n\"Our plan is to train 100,000 genius-level young people across the continent over the next 10 years, but we're always going to have very selective approaches,\" Johnson says. \"What we care about is being able to train in a really high-quality way. And the reason we're able to do that is because the people that are in the program and the developers that Andela produces are head and shoulders above what you'd expect for a junior developer.\"\n\nBut there's a mix of experience levels and education among the fellows: Some have a college degree in math, engineering or computer science, and some don't. Some \u2013 including Oladimeji \u2013 have taught themselves basic computer science skills. Some have taken other types of free, online courses, while others just show a strong interest and aptitude for software development, but there's no requirement for any kind of formal training, Johnson says.\n\n[MORE: Tech Companies Work to Combat Computer Science Education Gap]\n\nEven after they're placed with a company \u2013 working a standard 40-hour week \u2013 the fellows have 15 to 20 additional hours each week of optional professional development courses to strengthen either their technical experience or soft skills.\n\nMoving forward, Johnson says Andela has plans to expand to either Kenya, Ghana or South Africa.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "STEM home/articles", "keyword": "Pulse", "title": "Andela: An African Company Paying People to Learn Computer Science", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "In Africa, millions of young people can't find work.
