Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n3 On the Shameful and Skewed \u2018Redskins\u2019 Poll\n\n4 Clinton Needs Sanders Supporters to Win, But Sanders Needs Clinton Supporters to Change the System\n\n5 Benjamin Netanyahu Just Formed the Most Right-Wing Government in Israeli History\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like political ads,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like them either. But healthcare isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about people. It\u2019s not about a website that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not about polls numbers or approval ratings, it\u2019s about people.\u201d\n\nUp until this point, this could be an ad from Planned Parenthood, or any group supporting the ACA. Healthcare, it seems to say, shouldn\u2019t be based on the GOP\u2019s cynical politics, and getting rid of Obamacare is going to hurt people\u2014real, uninsured and poorly insured pre-existing people.\n\nBut the actress (Where have we seen her before? Anyone?) continues: \u201cAnd millions of people have lost their health insurance. Millions of people can\u2019t see their own doctors. And millions are paying more and getting less. Obamacare doesn\u2019t work. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Onscreen at the end: #PeopleNotPolitics.\n\nWho knew the Kochs were such people persons? At this rate, they\u2019ll one day add Orwellian hashtags like #PeopleNotProfits or #PeopleNotPipelines.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell which people this ad is targeting. People who are sick of the scare tactics that the Koch millions are incessantly hitting them with? Politically moderate people who\u2019d like a plausible but un-angry bottom line (\u201cObamacare doesn\u2019t work\u201d) to take to the voting booth? Harry Reid and the fact-checkers, who might figure that this time the ad is too vague to be lying?\n\nTurns out, though, that even this seemingly \u201cfact-checker-proof\u201d ad is rife with falsity, particularly the claim that under Obamacare people are \u201cpaying more and getting less.\u201d PolitiFact, noting \u201csigns that the rate of the increase [of premiums] has declined since the law was passed,\u201d said: \u201cMost people on the individual market are getting more benefits under the law. At worst, they\u2019re paying more to get more, though in many cases they\u2019re actually paying less.\u201d It rated the ad as \u201cFalse.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nAnyway, the new toned-down ad isn\u2019t new and isn\u2019t a reaction to backlash over the horror story spots. It ran before and simultaneously with some of them, in November of last year against Senator Kate Hagan of North Carolina and in early February in Arkansas, against Senator Mark Pryor. Nor have the Kochs \u201cabandoned\u201d the personal victim MO. Just last week AFP dropped $700,000 to launch another real person ad against Pryor. This time a woman named Wanda says her insurance company told her that because of Obamacare it would no longer cover her. Though this claim, too, hits a big pothole.\n\nAnd Julie Boonstra is still the first one to greet you at the AFP website, which maintains, \u201cShe lost her insurance and now the left is trying to discredit her, silence her and all Americans.\u201d\n\nHowever, we should definitely believe the Koch group when it says it has no intention of abandoning the horror stories. \u201cWe are currently on-air with many different types of ads, including personal testimony of Obamacare impact,\u201d AFP spokesman Levi Russell told TPM. \u201cThis is the same strategy we\u2019ve been using for 6 months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to take far more than Harry Reid and dogged fact-checking to blunt their campaign. The real question is, as Dave Weigel asks, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t Democrats running ads showcasing the people who have been helped by Obamacare?\u201d It\u2019s a strategy, he notes, the Dems \u201cperfected\u201d in ads featuring workers who were laid off by Mitt Romney\u2019s Bain Capital. (PolitiFact gave one of those ads a \u201cFalse\u201d rating, too.)\n\nThe Democratic Senate Campaign Committee sent out an e-mail a couple days ago, saying \u201cour grassroots fundraising is on pace to match the Kochs\u2019 $30 million dollar-for-dollar.\u201d\n\nGood. But what are they going to do with it?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/koch_ap-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Leslie Savan", "description": "AFP goes all nice with #PeopleNotPolitics.
