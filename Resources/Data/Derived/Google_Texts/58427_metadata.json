However, the agency said the duodenoscopes serve an important purpose in treating patients and should not be recalled.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nAt UCLA\u2019s Ronald Reagan Medical Center, as many as 179 patients over the past year could have been exposed to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae after having an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Seven patients were confirmed to have CRE infections, and two of those patients died, according to the Advisory Board.\n\nIn March, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles reported four patients had been infected with CRE and up to 67 more might have been exposed after being treated with the duodenoscopes.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/virginia-mason-medical-center-joins-suit-over-scopes-tied-deadly-superbug-infections", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/surgical-supplies-feature_1_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Between 2012 and 2014, 39 people in Virginia Mason Medical Center were sickened by highly-resistant strains of E.coli bacteria, and 11 of those patients died", "title": "Virginia Mason Medical Center joins suit over scopes tied to deadly 'superbug' infections"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/surgical-supplies-feature_1_0.gif"}, "description": "Between 2012 and 2014, 39 people in Virginia Mason Medical Center were sickened by highly-resistant strains of E.coli bacteria, and 11 of those patients died", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Virginia Mason Medical Center joins suit over scopes tied to deadly 'superbug' infections"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle has joined a lawsuit against Olympus America, claiming the company put patients at risk by failing to disclose design flaws in their endoscopy scopes that led to superbug infections and death.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb27\"", "article_summary": "In a highly unusual move for a hospital, on May 11, Virginia Mason joined Bigler\u2019s lawsuit, according to the Advisory Board.\nMiller added that the company is working with the FDA and other regulators to enhance safeguards against superbug infections linked to its scopes.\nThe 39 patients were infected through contaminated duodenoscopes made by Olympus, according to Virginia Mason.\nVirginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle has joined a lawsuit against Olympus America, claiming the company put patients at risk by failing to disclose design flaws in their endoscopy scopes that led to superbug infections and death.\n[Also: 'Superbug' infections sicken four patients at Cedars-Sinai]Virginia Mason\u2019s head of gastroenterology Andrew Ross, said the hospital was misled about the risk to patients."}
