These preferred pharmacies are willing to offer better price concessions than other pharmacies in the plan's network to increase their market share.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the proposed rule, the CMS said it wants to \u201crevise the regulatory definition of negotiated prices to require all price concessions from pharmacies to be reflected in negotiated prices.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rule \u201cwould require greater cost savings for beneficiaries in return for offering preferred cost sharing so that sponsors cannot incentivize use of selected pharmacies, including the sponsors' own related-party pharmacies that charge higher rates than their competitors,\u201d the CMS said.\n\nCMS Concerns\n\nIn the 2014 Call Letter (63 HCDR, 4/2/13), issued in April 2013, the CMS said that, although regulations permit lower cost sharing at some network pharmacies, they also require that the reductions not increase the CMS's payments to the plans.\n\nThe Call Letter expressed concern that an agency analysis of costs for the top 25 brand and top 25 generic drugs showed that costs might be higher in preferred networks than in nonpreferred networks in some plans.\n\nIn the proposed rule, the CMS said it wants to revise the provision on preferred cost sharing in network pharmacies to state that: \u201cA Part D sponsor offering a Part D plan that provides coverage other than defined standard coverage may reduce copayments or coinsurance for covered Part D drugs obtained through a subset of network pharmacies, as long as such preferred cost sharing is offered in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 423.120(a)(8) and for Part D drugs with consistently lower negotiated prices than the same drugs when obtained in the rest of the pharmacy network.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cconsistently lower,\u201d the CMS said it means that plan sponsors must offer beneficiaries and the Part D program lower negotiated prices on all drugs in return for the lower cost sharing.\n\nLower Pricing Standard\n\n\u201cIn practice we believe this would mean that whatever pricing standard is used to reimburse drugs purchased from network pharmacies in general, a lower pricing standard must be applied to drugs offered at the preferred level of cost sharing,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we solicit comments on whether we should also establish standards on how much lower drug costs should be in return for preferred cost sharing,\u201d the CMS said. \u201cWe are aware that there is a wide range of savings projections associated with the use of limited networks.\u201d\n\nOther Changes\n\nAmong other changes, the proposal would:\n\n\u2022 establish U.S. citizenship and lawful presence as an eligibility requirement for enrollment in MA and Part D plans;\n\n\u2022 streamline the Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit process by combining error rate calculation appeals and medical record review-determination appeals into one combined process;\n\n\u2022 expand the release of unencrypted prescriber, plan and pharmacy identifiers contained in prescription drug event records to give researchers broader access to health-care data;\n\n\u2022 require that physicians or nonphysician practitioners who write prescriptions for covered Part D drugs be enrolled in Medicare for their prescriptions to be covered under Part D; and\n\n\u2022 modify the agent/broker compensation structure.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mindy Yochelson in Washington at myochelson@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ward Pimley at wpimley@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/cms-proposes-changes-n17179881203/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Jan. 6 --The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Jan. 6 proposed a variety of policy changes to the Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug benefit programs, including...", "title": "CMS Proposes Changes to MA, Part D Including Protected Classes, Service Areas"}, "csrf-token": "_GLUPAnzKDW5u_NgbkHl4HWaF90A4sbqVgik61fWFlDYL_XNL-JlaSZl6bkmlvoazHVsqr36TzxDvthVcdcYxPf5QBipzdNKkI7sbItKWSo1:DzSjgbNjiKr9qVHYkEMAtNlrERdNe-odlB_QLYk8uphYiqty2Wb2W5dfQsT9JYbRNgdOi2v5WGs_JZALn3rNQt6yDPHrRhSedyN99Z5Q4Ys1", "description": "Jan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3a7\"", "article_summary": "The proposal, which would affect plans beginning in 2015, would also put additional conditions on prescription drug plans' preferred pharmacies.\nProtected ClassesThe CMS said it wants to change the criteria for protected drug classes and said it plans to eliminate some classes from that status.\nThese preferred pharmacies are willing to offer better price concessions than other pharmacies in the plan's network to increase their market share.\n\u201cIn addition, we solicit comments on whether we should also establish standards on how much lower drug costs should be in return for preferred cost sharing,\u201d the CMS said.\nSome Medicare drug plans have contracts with pharmacies that are part of the plan's network and give the plans--and consumers--a larger discount than other pharmacies."}
