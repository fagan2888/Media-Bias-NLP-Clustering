Less than a week after San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the NFL, Chris Borland has confirmed that he will be retiring from professional football at the age of 24 amid fears over the relationship between football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), ESPN reported.

"I just honestly want to do what's best for my health," Borland told ESPN’s Outside the Lines. "From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk."

Borland, who was expected to be an integral part of San Francisco’s defense this upcoming season following a notable rookie season, has become one of the youngest and most prominent NFL players to retire early in his career due to concussions.

Borland’s teammate at the University of Wisconsin and opponent from the Seattle Seahawks, Russell Wilson, along with St. Louis Rams defensive end Chris Long, took time to commend Borland on his decision:

Pleasure playing with you Chris Borland @UWBadgers and against you for the @49ers Praying for you. #OnWisconsin — Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) March 17, 2015

WOW. I loved Chris Borland's game but I can't fault him for calling it quits. His concerns are real. Still it takes a man to do the logical. — Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) March 17, 2015

While some members of the NFL chose to stand behind Borland in his decision, others feel his relatively young age and $530,000 expected payout next year should’ve factored into his decision. Borland recalled being diagnosed with two sports-related concussions since the eighth grade.

No offense to anyone but I'm playing until I can't anymore. I love this game to much. — Bobby Wagner (@Bwagz54) March 17, 2015

Chris Borland was scheduled to make $530K this year, plus $10K workout bonus. Not many jobs pay 24-year-olds $540K for 6 months of work. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 17, 2015
