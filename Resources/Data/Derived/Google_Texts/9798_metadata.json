That puts the size of the local nonprofit sector on par with manufacturing and construction industries.\n\nMore than 5,400 nonprofit organizations from all 50 states \u2014 including 158 from Pennsylvania \u2014 participated in this year's anonymous survey.\n\nPennsylvania respondents' annual budgets ranged from less than $50,000 to more than $20 million. Their origins date from the late 19th century to two years ago. Most have missions dedicated to human services or the arts.\n\nHalf said they could not meet demand in 2014, and 79 percent said demand was on the rise.\n\nIt's not unusual for social service needs to grow amid a broader economic rebound, said Kate Dewey, president of The Forbes Funds, a nonprofit consulting arm of The Pittsburgh Foundation.\n\n\u201cWhen you go through a real traumatic time, that trauma doesn't evidence itself right away,\u201d said Dewey, offering an example of lingering psychological repercussions in children who were homeless or went hungry.\n\n\u201cAnd while we may be doing better when you look at the whole picture, there are a whole lot of people who are doing worse,\u201d she said.\n\nRay Wolfe, chief operating officer of the nonprofit health care provider Pittsburgh Mercy Health System, said the survey \u201cunderstates the need,\u201d particularly for smaller nonprofits. \u201cIn the long term, the viability of all of the missions in this country is in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're going to have to find ways to group up; administrative costs are simply too great for us right now to operate at a $1 million to half-million-dollar size.\u201d\n\nAffordable housing was the most critical community need cited by Pennsylvania nonprofits at 33 percent, followed by job availability (25 percent), access to health care (23 percent), high-performing schools (22 percent), youth development programs (20 percent) and early childhood education (19 percent).\n\nLarry Swanson, executive director of Downtown-based nonprofit ACTION-Housing, said he's seen a steady rise in demand for three to four years. He cited as an example a 23-unit Uptown low-income housing development that opened in February. Within a week, it received 106 qualified applications. ACTION-Housing has two people on waiting lists for every unit across its 1,200-unit portfolio.\n\n\u201cThere is such a deficit of affordable and accessible housing in the region, it drives demand for these units and keeps turnover miniscule,\u201d said ACTION-Housing spokesman Andrew Shull.\n\nNationally, 47 percent of nonprofits reported finishing 2014 with an operating surplus, compared to a low of 35 percent in 2009. In Pennsylvania, 55 percent reported an operating surplus in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt's a little bit of savings, but they are not rolling in dough,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nMercy Health, which employs 2,000 and serves more than 35,000 clients annually, has a $90 million budget and more than six months of cash on hand, Wolfe said.\n\n\u201cIt's a good place to be,\u201d said Wolfe, \u201cbut managing to stay there and at the same time trying to address the needs on the street is a balancing act that's tough to do.\u201d\n\nMany nonprofits breaking even may be \u201cdoing so only by not giving pay raises, not growing benefits, increasing the size of deductibles on their health plans and trying to cut expenses,\u201d said Wolfe.\n\n\u201cOver the long haul, that deteriorates the quality of the services because young talent simply moves on,\u201d he said.\n\nPennsylvania nonprofits reported \u201cseeing government dollars shrink more than in other states,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nForty-five percent of Pennsylvania nonprofit respondents said they had a significant drop in state funding as a percentage of revenue during the past three years, compared to 31 percent nationally. Forty-two percent saw federal funding go down, compared to 32 percent nationally.\n\nSamantha Balbier, executive director of the Greater Pittsburgh Nonprofit Partnership, pointed out the state slashed its human services grant funding to counties by 10 percent in 2012. Those cuts have not been restored and funding to some social services for adults has been flat for a decade.\n\nMcKinley observed more nonprofits discussing with funders how to achieve capitalization, which requires saving money to plan for strategic growth several years out.\n\n\u201cIt's becoming part of the lexicon of our sector,\u201d McKinley said. \u201cThe question now becomes how are we really able to invest in our organizations, to hire back staff that we had to let go during the recession.\u201d\n\nNatasha Lindstrom is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
