But in the recovery room, doctors began to notice she wasn\u2019t breathing. Fluid from her amniotic sac had flooded into her bloodstream, causing what\u2019s known as an amniotic fluid embolism. The incoming fluid created a vacuum in Graupera-Cassimiro\u2019s heart, ceasing circulation and lung function. For hours the medical team performed chest compressions to jump start her breathing.\n\n\u201cWe had to intubate her immediately,\u201d said Dr. Michael Fleischer, Graupera-Cassimiro\u2019s gynecologist, to Fox News. \u201cAs soon she was intubated, we brought her back to the operating room. That\u2019s when I came and I assessed her. Everything from the surgery went perfectly, so we weren\u2019t worried about that. But we were worried that she had stopped breathing.\u201d\n\nStrangely, however, none of the various attempts to resuscitate her left visible wounds. The paddles the doctors used to defibrillate the heart left no burns from the shocks, the chest compressions left no bruising, and the lack of blood flow to the brain left no neurological damage. She was back at home in a matter of days.\n\nAmniotic fluid embolisms are rare and not entirely understood. Generally, they occur in mothers over 35, during C-sections, and several other pregnancy-related complications. They occur between one in every 8,000 and one in every 80,000 deliveries, which means few doctors will ever come across one in their careers. When they do, sometimes science falls short.\n\n\u201cThere's very few things in medicine that I've seen \u2026 that really were either unexplainable or miraculous,\u201d Dr. Anthony Dardano, president of the hospital's medical staff, told the Florida Sun-Sentinel. \u201cAnd when I heard this story, that was the first thing that came to my mind.\u201d\n\nGraupera-Cassimiro was taken off her life support machine a day after the incident, perhaps the only reasonable explanation for what the doctors and nursing staff have come to call \u201cdivine providence.\u201d One of the only cases a medical staff will attempt to defibrillate the heart when it has no pulse is a case of pulseless ventricular tachycardia, a condition in which the ventricles of the heart can\u2019t pump blood out to make a pulse. The muscle is moving but not beating.\n\nWhile doctors have not determined the exact reasoning, Graupera-Cassimiro and her family are simply happy to have her home and healthy. \u201cI don't know why I was given this opportunity,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I'm very grateful for it.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at &lt;a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com\"&gt;video.foxnews.com&lt;/a&gt;", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "florida, woman, survives, c, section, complications, after, no, pulse, 45, minutes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Forty-year-old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro lost her pulse after a successful C-section, but doctors aren't sure why it came back.", "title": "45 Minutes Without A Pulse \u2014 And Surviving", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/florida-woman-survives-c-section-complications-after-no-pulse-45-minutes-310010", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/10/rubycassimiro.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Forty-year-old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro lost her pulse after a successful C-section, but doctors aren't sure why it came back.", "title": "45 Minutes Without A Pulse \u2014 And Surviving", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/florida-woman-survives-c-section-complications-after-no-pulse-45-minutes-310010", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/10/rubycassimiro.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/10/rubycassimiro.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-11-10T11:41:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-10T11:41:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Forty-year-old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro lost her pulse after a successful C-section, but doctors aren't sure why it came back."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9ab\"", "article_summary": "But in the recovery room, doctors began to notice she wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\u201cThere's very few things in medicine that I've seen \u2026 that really were either unexplainable or miraculous,\u201d Dr. Anthony Dardano, president of the hospital's medical staff, told the Florida Sun-Sentinel.\nA Florida mother who underwent a routine cesarean section is now at home caring for her baby, despite major scares just over a month ago when the woman lost a pulse for 45 minutes after giving birth.\nFluid from her amniotic sac had flooded into her bloodstream, causing what\u2019s known as an amniotic fluid embolism.\nWhile doctors have not determined the exact reasoning, Graupera-Cassimiro and her family are simply happy to have her home and healthy."}
