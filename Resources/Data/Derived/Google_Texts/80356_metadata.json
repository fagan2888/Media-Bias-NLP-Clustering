Rob Maness is making waves in the Louisiana Senate race.\n\nWhen Maness, a political rookie, first threw his hat into the ring to challenge Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, he did not make much of a splash. Republicans already had one candidate in the race, Louisiana Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, and the $4 million he had raised made Maness\u2019s low six-figures look paltry.\n\nBut last week, Maness got the endorsement of the Senate Conservatives Fund.\n\n\u201cThat changes the picture dramatically,\u201d Maness said of the endorsement. The truth in Maness\u2019 statement is evidenced in his fundraising: Maness raised just over $100,000 over the past two quarters. After the endorsement, he told The Daily Caller, \u201cwe\u2019ve raised more than half of that in the last five days.\u201d\n\nThat gives Maness the potential to shake up the race. Louisiana has a jungle primary, so instead of each party having its own party and then sending one nominee to a general election, everybody goes straight into the general election. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote, the top two candidates go to a run off. If Republicans divide their support between Maness and Cassidy, that could give Landrieu an edge. But Maness dismissed that logic, calling it \u201ca concern for the establishment GOP,\u201d a group he makes it quite clear he does not think highly of. \u201cThey\u2019re coalescing behind a candidate that doesn\u2019t have the right message, doesn\u2019t have the right voting history in congress and his time in the state legislature \u2026 and has supported and defended Mary Landrieu and her approach and the Democratic Party\u2019s approach to things for many, many years, and even criticized President [Ronald] Reagan a time or two in public letters to the editor,\u201d he told TheDC.\n\nAll of that is a dig at Cassidy, who once wrote a letter to the editor criticizing Reagan and encouraging people to vote for Dukakis, gave money to Landrieu in 2002, and as a state legislator, proposed healthcare bills that had components similar to Obamacare.\n\nManess makes a point, however, of not going after Cassidy by name, in what is perhaps a nod to Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment. Asked why Cassidy is the wrong candidate, Maness replied: \u201cThe question really is, is what\u2019s the right candidate and the right set of principles to defeat Mary Landrieu\u2026 And that\u2019s the question I\u2019ll answer.\u201d\n\nManess spoke about the political landscape in terms of \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alexis Levinson", "description": "Air Force Col.
