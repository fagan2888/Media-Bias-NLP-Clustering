The traditional looking vehicle with a beanie bot on the roof will be available in 10 years, Google says. Aside from the taxi and limousine companies that may want to dump their human drivers, I think there\u2019s a ready-made market for robotic cars among baby boomers who have had their licenses revoked because of age-related physical afflictions.\n\nFor anyone who has been homebound because they could no longer drive, an autonomous car is a godsend \u2014 it will drive them around town as if they had a personal chauffeur. Google isn\u2019t the only company developing self-driving vehicles. Mercedes, Nissan, Volkswagen, BMW, Lexus, and Nissan Motor to name a few, are all in the game.\n\nRelated: Self-Driving Cars Will Rule the Road--Report\n\nIf you owned one, the car would detect your identity through a sensor and the car doors will automatically open either on command or as you approach (depending on how you program the car). Once comfortably seated in back, the \u201cchauffeur\u201d will ask where you want to go, the GPS system will enter the request, and you\u2019re off.\n\nPretty cool, but autonomous cars are only the beginning. Let\u2019s talk about trucks. Daimler has just demonstrated its autonomous Mercedes 40-ton tractor trailer. Like Google\u2019s driverless car, Daimler is shooting for full production by 2025. (As of now, you can\u2019t pre-order either vehicle on Amazon.)\n\nAutonomous commercial trucks face certain challenges, even when they do get the bugs out\u2014like the inability to change lanes. First, in a sop to truck drivers, Daimler claims that a human driver will be in the car to perform certain \u201cadministrative\u201d duties while the truck is doing the heavy lifting.\n\nLaws will have to be changed to allow drivers to take their eyes off the road and their hands off the wheel, but once that\u2019s done we all know that human drivers\u2019 main duty will be to grab a Big Mac and take a nap. That is, until they are replaced by humanoids.\n\nRelated: Google Preps Self-Driving Cars for City Traffic\n\nNext, Congress still hasn\u2019t funded the Highway Trust Fund, which means that the clear highway markings that must be read by the truck\u2019s sensors are a long shot. Beyond that, our potholes haven\u2019t been fixed, so who\u2019s going to change the tires?\n\nSo what if America\u2019s infrastructure is no better than Afghanistan\u2019s -- we might still order a few Mercedes autonomous trucks\u2026except for one thing. Jimmy Hoffa. Well, not just Hoffa, but some of 1.4 million members of the Teamsters Union.\n\nEven if the Teamster drivers don\u2019t mind napping while the robot does her thing, I can almost guarantee that if the truck survives the trip to the loading dock, it won\u2019t get loaded.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Everyone knows about Google\u2019s driverless car.", "title": "Driverless Truck of the Future Will Crash into Labor Laws of the Past", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/08/Driverless-Truck-Future-Will-Crash-Labor-Laws-Past", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07082014_Mercedes_Driverless_Truck.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/08/Driverless-Truck-Future-Will-Crash-Labor-Laws-Past", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07082014_Mercedes_Driverless_Truck.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Everyone knows about Google\u2019s driverless car.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "So what if America\u2019s infrastructure is no better than Afghanistan\u2019s -- we might still order a few Mercedes autonomous trucks\u2026except for one thing.\nPretty cool, but autonomous cars are only the beginning.\nFor anyone who has been homebound because they could no longer drive, an autonomous car is a godsend \u2014 it will drive them around town as if they had a personal chauffeur.\nDaimler has just demonstrated its autonomous Mercedes 40-ton tractor trailer.\nFirst, in a sop to truck drivers, Daimler claims that a human driver will be in the car to perform certain \u201cadministrative\u201d duties while the truck is doing the heavy lifting."}
