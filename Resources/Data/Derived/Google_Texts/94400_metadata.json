John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Mitt Romney both had their shortcomings. They didn\u2019t connect with Americans on an emotional level and failed to articulate an agenda that working- and middle-class voters believed could help them. But their sins were not unseriousness or flightiness on foreign policy; both identified our foes, counseled determination and advocated sufficient funding for our armed forces. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said of the man who beat them and now occupies the Oval Office. What\u2019s worse, with each new crises his response to provocation gets weaker.\n\nPresident Obama greets then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at his State of the Union address in 2012. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nIn putting forth Russian sanctions so slight that \u201cpin prick\u201d overstates their impact, President Obama merely cemented his image as a man who delivers empty threats but lacks the nerve or skill to exact a price for our foes\u2019 aggression. Former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton aptly assessed the president\u2019s action as \u201cso weak that it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Vladimir Putin swiftly moved to annex Crimea.\n\nThe Wall Street editorial board pointed out that the seven sanctioned Russians did not include important names. \u201cDefense Minister Sergei Shoygu, Mr. Putin\u2019s chief of staff Sergei Ivanov and Alexander Bortnikov, who runs the FSB (formerly the KGB), belong to the circle of hard-liners on the Russian national security council, where the decisions on Ukraine are taken. Mr. Shoygu\u2019s department has deployed some 20,000 men to Crimea. Mr. Bortnikov\u2019s charges are running special operations in eastern Ukraine to whip up separatist demonstrators.\u201d Obama gives new meaning to the phrase \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\nObama repeats the same empty phrases whether the adversary is Iran, Syria or Russia. \u201cCountry X will find itself isolated.\u201d \u201cCountry X\u2019s actions show its weakness.\u201d \u201cCountry X will come to rue the day it defied the international community.\u201d It never dawns on him that Country X doesn\u2019t consider itself isolated (or doesn\u2019t care), thinks it has shown up the United States and doesn\u2019t give a fig about the international community. For a man who billed himself as an internationally aware sophisticate, Obama knows precious little about how other countries operate and what motivates our enemies. He makes the most basic error of foreign policy novices: He imagines adversaries share our values and make the same assessments we do. Again and again they surprise him by showing they don\u2019t.\n\nLikewise, the president never ceases to complain, \u201cThere are no good options.\u201d He demands to know, \u201cDo you want boots on the ground?\u201c And he insists those calling for more robust action are warmongers or rubes. It has been his own delinquency, obviously, that now leaves us with no good options, gives us the Hobson\u2019s choice of war or defeat and causes members of both parties to pull their hair out over our foreign policy blunders.\n\nYou can forgive Mitt Romney for a bit of \u201cI told you so,\u201d given he was mocked unmercifully for calling Russia our greatest strategic challenge. But he also gets to the root of the matter in this Wall Street Journal op-ed: \u201cIt is hard to name even a single country that has more respect and admiration for America today than when President Obama took office, and now Russia is in Ukraine. Part of their failure, I submit, is due to their failure to act when action was possible, and needed.\u201d When the president and his advisers peevishly demand critics say what they would do, the answer must begin with an election of a different president, retention of missile defenses in Eastern Europe, resolve in Iraq and Afghanistan, support for the Green Revolution, etc. This disaster has been in the making for five years, the result of serial weakness. (As a practical pointer, however, one idea would be for Obama to stop talking to Putin; with each hour on the phone Putin becomes more convinced the president is spineless.)\n\nIn his determination to retrench and his self-serving delusion that a decade of war was ending, Obama refused to take measured steps until aggressors were emboldened, economic sanctions became useless and no one took him seriously. He was so intent on kicking the can down the road that he left the United States and its allies vulnerable to dangerous foes. His foreign policy of wishful thinking and willful neglect now has come back to bite him.\n\nIn this both Hillary Clinton and left- and right-wing anti-interventionists share the blame. In varying degrees, they endorsed Obama\u2019s world view or turned the other way \u2014 when he withdrew entirely from Iraq, did a 180 on his red line in Syria, exacted no consequences for the deaths of four Americans in Libya, slashed the defense budget and foolishly lifted sanctions against Iran.\n\nNational security is fast becoming our most acute problem. Budgets can be fixed and Obamacare repealed and replaced, but the damage to our international standing and the proliferation of nuclear weapons Obama may allow will plague presidents for decades to come. The dead, displaced and maimed in Syria will remain a permanent legacy of this president.\n\nIf we would not elect someone who, for example cheered Obamacare, why would the country turn to leaders whose judgment on foreign policy was just as flawed? To invest responsibility to those such as Hillary Clinton \u2014 or Sen. Ran Paul (R-Ky.), for that matter \u2014 who suffer the same infirmities as Obama would be sheer folly. The American people have been badly served by one commander in chief; they need a much better one to clean up the mess he\u2019ll leave behind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Laughable Russian sanctions are the latest evidence of the president's cluelessness.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Laughable Russian sanctions are the latest evidence of the president's cluelessness.", "title": "Russian \u2018sanctions\u2019 from the failed commander in chief", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/03/18/russian-sanctions-from-the-failed-commander-in-chief/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/01/28/National-Politics/Videos/Images/137676003.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/03/18/russian-sanctions-from-the-failed-commander-in-chief/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obama Russia sanctions, Hillary and Obama foreign policy, rand paul foreign policy,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obama Russia sanctions, Hillary and Obama foreign policy, rand paul foreign policy,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e3e\"", "article_summary": "President Obama greets then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at his State of the Union address in 2012.\nBut their sins were not unseriousness or flightiness on foreign policy; both identified our foes, counseled determination and advocated sufficient funding for our armed forces.\nHe makes the most basic error of foreign policy novices: He imagines adversaries share our values and make the same assessments we do.\nHis foreign policy of wishful thinking and willful neglect now has come back to bite him.\nThe American people have been badly served by one commander in chief; they need a much better one to clean up the mess he\u2019ll leave behind."}
