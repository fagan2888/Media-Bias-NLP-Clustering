Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, formed as part of civil rights reforms in the 1960s, serves an important function but is \u201cincreasingly demonstrating poor judgment and using questionable tactics\u201d that hurt its overall mission.\n\nWhile victims are reaping more funds through settlements, the EEOC recovered $341 million through litigation during the first five years of President Obama\u2019s tenure, compared to $526 million during the same period under President George W. Bush, according to the report.\n\nThe report says the commission suffered losses in court because it pursued high-impact lawsuits without performing due diligence. Specifically, it has failed to resolve cases before filing suit \u2014 6,967 resolutions in Mr. Obama\u2019s first five years compared to 8,273 under Mr. Bush \u2014 relied on flawed expert analysis and pursued \u201cnovel cases unsupported by law,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe EEOC said it is still reviewing the report from Mr. Alexander, who is the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions, and who voted against the renomination of P. David Lopez as general counsel for the commission.\n\nAn EEOC spokeswoman pointed to recent Senate testimony from Mr. Lopez, in which he said his team resolved more than 90 percent of cases that agency litigators file, \u201cincluding landmark cases involving disability, pregnancy, age and religion.\u201d\n\nThe report says in one case the EEOC claimed U.S. Steel\u2019s random alcohol and drug tests on new probationary employees violated the Americans with Disabilities Act because the tests were not job-related or necessary for business.\n\n\u201cU.S. Steel conducted these tests on new hires who were less familiar with their working environment to ensure safety at a busy steel factory with numerous hazardous working conditions,\u201d the report says. \u201cYet, in EEOC\u2019s view, the company needed an individualized, reasonable suspicion of intoxication to perform such tests. The court disagreed.\u201d\n\nThe report says the EEOC did not visit the plant to investigate whether the policy was justified and suffered embarrassing media scrutiny.\n\nAlso, the EEOC has been forced to pay attorney\u2019s fees 10 times since 2011, although not all of the cases were initiated by the current administration.\n\nCourts ordered the commission to pay the fees because it failed to produce evidence in a timely fashion or to preserve key documents in some cases.\n\nIn another case, the commission accused a company of discriminating against black applicants by refusing to hire people with a criminal record. As it turned out, the company had no such policy.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, taxpayers have been left to foot the bill for some of these litigation failures,\u201d the report says. \u201cCourts award attorney\u2019s fees only in rare cases that are considered particularly egregious.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, the agency said Mr. Lopez feels that any award of fees or sanctions against EEOC is \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why he developed and implemented systems and procedures for attorneys across the EEOC to learn from judicial decisions, including those instances mentioned in the report, where cases filed by predecessors had sanctions and fees,\u201d the agency told The Washington Times.\n\nThe staff report found the general counsel has broad discretion over which cases are brought to the agency's five-member commission for a vote. For instance, only three of 122 lawsuits were brought to the commission for approval in fiscal 2012.\n\n\u201cSuch broad delegation of litigation authority to the general counsel detracts from the commission\u2019s ability to perform its statutorily obligated duties and ensure prudent litigation decisions are made on behalf of EEOC,\u201d the report said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A government commission that probes workplace discrimination is chasing shaky legal cases that result in embarrassing and costly losses, a Republican senator charged Monday in a report that says the body has underperformed of late compared to the Bush era.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A government commission that probes workplace discrimination is chasing shaky legal cases that result in embarrassing and costly losses, a Republican senator charged Monday in a report that says the body has underperformed of late compared to the Bush era.", "title": "Lamar Alexander: Anti-discrimination board undermining own mission", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/24/lamar-alexander-eeoc-undermining-own-mission/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/05/a809d4ed83a7822b640f6a706700ad73.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/05/a809d4ed83a7822b640f6a706700ad73.jpg", "description": "A government commission that probes workplace discrimination is chasing shaky legal cases that result in embarrassing and costly losses, a Republican senator charged Monday in a report that says the b", "card": "summary", "title": "Lamar Alexander: Anti-discrimination board undermining own mission"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, P David Lopez, Lamar Alexander"}, "article_summary": "The report says the commission suffered losses in court because it pursued high-impact lawsuits without performing due diligence.\n\u201cUnfortunately, taxpayers have been left to foot the bill for some of these litigation failures,\u201d the report says.\nThe staff report found the general counsel has broad discretion over which cases are brought to the agency's five-member commission for a vote.\nFor instance, only three of 122 lawsuits were brought to the commission for approval in fiscal 2012.\nThe court disagreed.\u201dThe report says the EEOC did not visit the plant to investigate whether the policy was justified and suffered embarrassing media scrutiny."}
