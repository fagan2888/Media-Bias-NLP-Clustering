It turns out they also like to vogue.\n\nThe Internet was graced with the presence of one EMT driver on May 6, who happened to tune in to the radio right as a song, which he\u2019s apparently rather fond of, came on. Dangerously, the unnamed EMT driver takes his hands off the wheel, mid-traffic, to swing his hands, arms, and head to the music. (Meanwhile, a guy waiting on a new heart was probably in the back, praying for death.)\n\nWe don\u2019t know who this EMT is or where he\u2019s from (though he mentions the radio station 97.1, a popular hip-hop and pop station in the New York tri-state area). All we know is he likes to vogue, and he\u2019s probably the happiest EMT on the job right now. And given the long, erratic hours many paramedics work, coupled with the mediocre pay for doing a hero\u2019s work, there could be worse people to save your life than someone with a little too much rhythm.\n\nOne disclaimer, however: Distracted driving is dangerous. In 2012, an estimated 421,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver. We respect your dance moves, nameless EMT, but stay safe out there.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dancing, emt, reminds, us, saving, lives, doesnt, have, be, cuts, and, concussions, all, day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Saving lives doesn't have to be depressing, but dancing behind the wheel may not be the safest mood-picker-upper.", "title": "This Is The Happiest EMT You've Ever Seen [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dancing-emt-reminds-us-saving-lives-doesnt-have-be-cuts-and-concussions-all-day-283082", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/emt.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saving lives doesn't have to be depressing, but dancing behind the wheel may not be the safest mood-picker-upper.", "title": "This Is The Happiest EMT You've Ever Seen [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dancing-emt-reminds-us-saving-lives-doesnt-have-be-cuts-and-concussions-all-day-283082", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/emt.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/16/emt.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-16T16:40:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T16:40:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Saving lives doesn't have to be depressing, but dancing behind the wheel may not be the safest mood-picker-upper."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf67\"", "article_summary": "Saving lives doesn't have to be depressing, but dancing behind the wheel may not be the safest mood-picker-upper.\nAll we know is he likes to vogue, and he\u2019s probably the happiest EMT on the job right now.\nDangerously, the unnamed EMT driver takes his hands off the wheel, mid-traffic, to swing his hands, arms, and head to the music.\nWe don\u2019t know who this EMT is or where he\u2019s from (though he mentions the radio station 97.1, a popular hip-hop and pop station in the New York tri-state area).\nThe Internet was graced with the presence of one EMT driver on May 6, who happened to tune in to the radio right as a song, which he\u2019s apparently rather fond of, came on."}
