A teenage boy or young man was killed late Friday night when he walked onto train tracks near Loveland as a train approached and was struck and later found beneath the train, authorities say.

Authorities have identified the victim, who didn’t have a driver’s license or any other identification with him, but have not yet released his name, according to a Loveland police news release.

Police described the victim as being between the age of 15 and 20. He was between 5-feet-6 and 5-feet-9 with a medium build.

Train employees told police that the person was walking beside the tracks between at 10:56 p.m. Friday as a southbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe train approached, traveling from Cheyenne to Denver.

Within sight of the train, the person walked directly onto the tracks. The engineer immediately applied the train’s emergency brakes to try to avoid a collision, but it was already too close to the pedestrian to stop in time.

The train hit the person, who was later found underneath the train.

The person was wearing a white T-shirt, grayish blue gym shorts and black DC brand shoes.

The collision happened between 37th and 29th streets on the 3200 block, the news release says.

Loveland Police have turned the case over to the Larimer County Coroner’s office, which is investigating the circumstances of the accident.
