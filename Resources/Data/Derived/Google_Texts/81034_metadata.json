Joe Heck is playing a familiar role in Nevada political theater: a villain in the Democrats' \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nIt is the Democrats\u2019 standard line of attack, Heck said during an editorial board interview with the Las Vegas Sun on Monday.\n\nNevada\u2019s District 3 Republican is in a re-election battle against Democratic hopeful Erin Bilbray.\n\nBilbray is painting him as a lawmaker who\u2019s \u201cno advocate for women\u2019s equality, choice or health.\u201d And Democratic honchos from across the country are doing the same.\n\nIn the last month, three party leaders have traveled to Nevada to stand on the soapbox for Bilbray and criticize Heck.\n\nIn July, it was Vice President Joe Biden and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nOn Monday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking at a United Steelworkers union convention, got a jab in.\n\nHeck isn\u2019t fazed by the parade of support and the negative campaign. It\u2019s the fourth campaign cycle he\u2019s dealt with the \u201canti-women\u201d attacks (one in a re-election battle he lost in the state Senate and in all of his congressional races).\n\n\u201cTo say that I am anti-women tries to feed into this national narrative that Democrats try to use against male candidates, especially when they\u2019re running against a female challenger,\u201d he said.\n\nHeck has a wife and two daughters. He is a physician who spent his career working in emergency rooms and as a soldier who served during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nHe said he spent his 25-year career in medicine taking care of women \u201cat their most vulnerable times in their life \u2014 not just from trauma or generic medical illness but as victims of sexual assault or domestic violence.\u201d\n\nHis voting record and Bilbray\u2019s attacks offer a mixed view of where the congressman stands.\n\nHe supported the Violence Against Women Act, a law signed by President Barack Obama that provided funding for programs, organizations and law enforcement to combat domestic violence.\n\nHeck is pro-life, but does not support bills that would make abortion illegal in the case of rape and incest. He has voted to defund planned parenthood and made a procedural vote to prevent a bill promoting equal pay for women from reaching the floor of the House.\n\nHeck said the move to bring up the vote on wages was a strategy by Democrats to gain fodder.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that everybody doing the same job at the same level should get the same pay,\u201d he said.\n\nCorrection: This story has been revised to remove a reference to Heck's chances of winning re-election. The original story overstated the certainty of a Heck victory.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This campaign season, U.S. Rep.
