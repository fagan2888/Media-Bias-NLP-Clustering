Kellogg Foundation.\n\nWith economic development being the Nation's core focus, \"we've neglected the more basic components of human existence: having access to food,\u201d according to Amber Crotty, the Policy Institute's director.\n\nThe study was the outcome of the Din\u00e9 Food Sovereignty Initiative, a project created by the Policy Institute in 2011 with the goal of better understanding the systemic issues that have shaped the current Din\u00e9 food system, which has contributed to a host of problems, such as poor health and negative community, economic, cultural and environmental impacts. The report aimed to identify strategies to achieve food sovereignty for the Din\u00e9 people\u2014 to provide enough food within reservation borders to feed the Din\u00e9 people.\n\n\u201cThe objective of this research is to promote a self-sufficient food system and the revitalization of Navajo traditional foods which, in return, will foster greater self-sufficiency and sustainability for the Din\u00e9 People,\u201d Crotty explains.\n\nRoughly half of the Navajo population suffer from diabetes or obesity, stemming from a lack of options for obtaining healthy food. \u201cWhat is available in gas stations and the few grocery stores [in the Navajo nation] is of poor quality \u2014 often molding vegetables,\u201d Dana Eldridge, the lead author of the report, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the report\u2019s conclusion:\n\n\u201cThrough an assertion of sovereignty on the part of the Navajo Nation, and through community based policies and programs, the Navajo Nation can begin to rebuild a self-sufficient food system that will directly improve nutrition and health on the Navajo Nation. In light of federal budget cuts to food assistance programs, the need for the Navajo Nation to move toward self-sufficient programs, services, and ultimately a self-sufficient food system, is very apparent.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the threats to Din\u00e9 wellness and lifeways described in this report are only growing. Rates of nutritionally-related illness are projected to increase at alarming rates. In addition, legal developments increasingly threaten Din\u00e9 peoples\u2019 rights to maintaining agricultural and food practices. Therefore immediate action to address these issues is critical to ensuring for the well-being of the Din\u00e9 People.\n\n\u201cAs a most fundamental element of life, food provides a way to strengthen Din\u00e9 peoples\u2019 connections to each other, all living things and Mother Earth, and fosters sovereignty for the Navajo Nation in a way that maintains the values, principles, lifeways and language that make us Din\u00e9. In this regard, revitalizing traditional foods and rebuilding a self-sufficient food system will ensure for the resilience (Sih hasin) of the Din\u00e9 people for generations to come.\u201d\n\nRead or download the full report here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the largest food scarcity survey to take place across the Four Corners, results revealed that nearly 40 percent of Navajo Reservation residents don\u2019t have access to eno", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/16/navajo-report-illustrates-need-food-system-sovereignty-154898", "type": "article", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Navajo Report Illustrates Need for Food System Sovereignty"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-05-16T11:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Report Illustrates Need for Food System Sovereignty"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/16/navajo-report-illustrates-need-food-system-sovereignty-154898", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Navajo Report Illustrates Need for Food System Sovereignty"}, "article_summary": "The report, titled Din\u00e9 Food Sovereignty: A Report on the Navajo Nation Food System and the Case to Rebuild a Self-Sufficient Food System for the Din\u00e9 People, was recently released by the Din\u00e9 Policy Institute and funded by the First Nations Development Institute with assistance by the W.K.\nIn light of federal budget cuts to food assistance programs, the need for the Navajo Nation to move toward self-sufficient programs, services, and ultimately a self-sufficient food system, is very apparent.\nThe report aimed to identify strategies to achieve food sovereignty for the Din\u00e9 people\u2014 to provide enough food within reservation borders to feed the Din\u00e9 people.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the report\u2019s conclusion:\u201cThrough an assertion of sovereignty on the part of the Navajo Nation, and through community based policies and programs, the Navajo Nation can begin to rebuild a self-sufficient food system that will directly improve nutrition and health on the Navajo Nation.\nIn this regard, revitalizing traditional foods and rebuilding a self-sufficient food system will ensure for the resilience (Sih hasin) of the Din\u00e9 people for generations to come.\u201dRead or download the full report here."}
