It\u2019s life changing, and often quite painful as well. It\u2019s certainly not an ordeal most women would like to experience without medical support, but Kristin Allred didn\u2019t really get a say when she went into labor in her car last Friday.\n\n\u201cWe were really close [to the hospital]; I just felt like I needed to start pushing,\u201d she told ABC News.\n\nAllred\u2019s husband, Shay, had called 911 as soon as his wife began to deliver their daughter, and was met with the voice of William Kalaher, a dispatcher who had begun work only two weeks before. Within a minute from the time he had called 911, Kristin had given birth. She quickly realized there was something wrong with her baby. \u201cI pushed her out and placed her up on my chest and then we realized she wasn\u2019t breathing,\u201d Allred said.\n\nThe dispatcher on the phone jumped in. Allred said he kept his cool even when she explained the baby was not breathing because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck. \u201cHe was great\u2026 he was good at helping us focus on what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving him there helped us focus and this is what we really needed to do.\u201d\n\nKalaher explained to the couple how to position the baby to encourage her to breathe. It worked \u2014 the couple now has a healthy baby girl named Anne. Allred says they\u2019re grateful Kalaher was able to help them through the scary delivery.\n\nABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "baby, born, highway, saved, quick, thinking, 911, dispatcherafter, just, 2, weeks, job", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "What happens if there's a problem during childbirth and no doctors around?", "title": "New 911 Dispatcher Talks Woman Through Highway Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/baby-born-highway-saved-quick-thinking-911-dispatcherafter-just-2-weeks-job-366762", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/12/23/newborn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What happens if there's a problem during childbirth and no doctors around?", "title": "New 911 Dispatcher Talks Woman Through Highway Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/baby-born-highway-saved-quick-thinking-911-dispatcherafter-just-2-weeks-job-366762", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/12/23/newborn.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/23/newborn.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-23T14:57:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-23T14:57:44-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "What happens if there's a problem during childbirth and no doctors around?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6bc6\"", "article_summary": "Allred said he kept his cool even when she explained the baby was not breathing because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck.\n\u201cWe were really close [to the hospital]; I just felt like I needed to start pushing,\u201d she told ABC News.\n\u201cHaving him there helped us focus and this is what we really needed to do.\u201dKalaher explained to the couple how to position the baby to encourage her to breathe.\nIt\u2019s certainly not an ordeal most women would like to experience without medical support, but Kristin Allred didn\u2019t really get a say when she went into labor in her car last Friday.\n\u201cI pushed her out and placed her up on my chest and then we realized she wasn\u2019t breathing,\u201d Allred said."}
