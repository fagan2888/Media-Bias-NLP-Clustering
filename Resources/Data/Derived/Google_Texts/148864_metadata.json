The soldiers used the living room as a communal space to eat and sleep.\n\nA generator powered a TV that was playing a women\u2019s boxing match. A couple of soldiers sat on an old leather couch with Kalashnikov assault rifles propped against it, watching silently.\n\nOut in the adjacent garage, which faced away from the trenches and was left open, soldiers were coming and going, grabbing weapons, ammunition, and bottles of water as they shuttled back and forth to the trenches.\n\nThe sectional garage door hung from the ceiling, suspended on tracks. A conical divot punctured the front right section, where the door was warped and the metal tracks twisted. A few weeks ago, one of the soldiers explained, a mortar had come through the roof; the suspended garage door trapped the round and stopped it from exploding at ground level.\n\nThe unit stationed at position 18 was OUN, a volunteer battalion recently incorporated into the Ukrainian regular army\u2019s 93rd Brigade.\n\nThe 93rd Brigade was holding the line several kilometers outside the combined Russian-separatist stronghold of Donetsk. OUN stands for the \u201cOrganization of Ukrainian Nationalists,\u201d a partisan group dating back to before World War II.\n\nWith the sun settling outside on the late summer afternoon, about a dozen Ukrainian soldiers stood casually inside the garage, talking and joking. They seemed unconcerned by the sounds of artillery and gunfire in the distance.\n\nThe soldiers ranged widely in age, some as young as 19, some in their 40s and even 50s. They wore mismatched military uniforms purchased off the Internet, or which civilian volunteers had donated. Some soldiers were cleaning their rifles or tinkering with equipment, while others relaxed, enjoying the relative safety of the garage.\n\nOne of the soldiers was a 22-year-old named Julia. She had just returned from the trenches and stood with a Kalashnikov assault rifle slung across her chest as she talked and laughed with the others.\n\nJulia\u2019s dark black hair was pulled back in a bun, but it was a little wild and disheveled. She wore a body armor vest, camouflage pants cut off below the knee, and high black combat boots. Her jewelry was simple\u2014a silver necklace, silver gauge earrings through her earlobes, and a black stud in the upper ear. Two woven bracelets were on her right wrist and a ring on her left index finger.\n\nJulia, whose nom de guerre is \u201cBlack,\u201d seemed relaxed. She rolled her eyes and cocked her head in a dismissive laugh when a fellow soldier made a joke about Playboy magazine.\n\nSuddenly, there was the sound of separatist machine gunfire only a hundred meters or so away. Everyone in the garage moved swiftly toward the walls for protection\u2014a few went straight for the door leading into the house.\n\nJulia reacted calmly and purposefully. She barely budged, standing her ground while some of the other soldiers, and this correspondent, scrambled for cover. The smile left her face like a balloon letting out air, and she looked in the direction of the gunfire with a flat, focused expression.\n\n\u201cWith regard to her reaction to the fighting, then I would say that she bore them normally and was even more careless than most of the other soldiers,\u201d said Andrey Mikheychenko, an OUN soldier who served with Julia in Pisky.\n\n\u201cAs to her personal courage,\u201d Mikheychenko continued, \u201cthen, of course, she is very brave\u2014braver than many male soldiers.\u201d\n\nUnofficial Warriors\n\nSince the beginning of the Ukraine war, women have played a key role for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. They have served on the front lines as infantry, combat medics, and even snipers. And they help sustain the war effort from the home front as civilian volunteers by procuring vital supplies and equipment and delivering them to the front lines.\n\n\u201cI always felt ashamed that I wasn\u2019t in the war when some 18-year-old guys, even if they\u2019re not patriots, have to go,\u201d said Lera Burlakova, 29, who quit her job as a journalist last December to serve as a front-line soldier with the Karpatska Sich volunteer battalion in Pisky.\n\n\u201cIf you want to look in the mirror and not turn away, you have to go,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think all people have to do it. Some people are really scared, and that\u2019s the way they are. And maybe they shouldn\u2019t be there, in the war, and die without reason.\u201d\n\nWomen are still officially barred from front-line service in Ukraine\u2019s regular army, and most of the women who have served in combat have done so as members of civilian volunteer battalions.\n\nSo, as Ukraine continues to rein in the volunteer battalions by integrating them into the regular army or National Guard, new questions are emerging about the future role of female soldiers who have proven themselves in combat and are consequently reluctant to be relegated to support roles behind the lines.\n\n\u201cWe have a war, and women are serving,\u201d Burlakova said. \u201cAnd if a woman wants to be in combat, if she passes the tests, doesn\u2019t break, and has already taken part in the war \u2026 then yeah, of course she should be allowed\u2014she shouldn\u2019t have to be a cook.\u201d\n\nA Grassroots War\n\nAs Ukraine\u2019s civilian volunteer battalions merged into the Ukrainian National Guard and regular army this year, women serving in combat roles had to officially register for support positions such as cooks or headquarters staff.\n\nThose who wanted to remain in combat roles skirted the rules by registering for non-combat jobs, and then remained on the front lines with their old units, which, despite moving under government control, remained largely intact.\n\nThe resulting problem is that there is no official documentation of a female soldier seeing combat, excluding her from awards and benefits.\n\nDue to her unofficial status, for example, Burlakova never received a salary for the five months she spent as a soldier in Pisky. And she is not eligible to receive awards and benefits awarded to male combat veterans, because, as a woman, it was not technically permitted for her to be on the front line.\n\n\u201cYou never get official status as someone who was in the war,\u201d Burlakova said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the status of combat veteran gives. But I see the guys are so proud of it, and yeah, it would be nice to have it be official.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, 67,697 Ukrainian soldiers have been granted \u201cATO participant status,\u201d indicating combat zone service. This designation entitles certain Social Security benefits as well as free public transportation, first-in-line status for housing and land lots, zero-percent loans for private construction, and a 75-percent discount on public utility service bills.\n\nGovernment data on the number of women granted ATO participant status was not immediately available, although according to Ukrainian media reports, about 25 percent of Ukraine\u2019s 250,000 military personnel are women.\n\nIn 2014, about 100 women were mobilized for military service as part of an emergency program, and the Ministry of Defense announced plans this year to potentially open up the national draft to include women between 20 and 50 years old.\n\nOn Equal Footing\n\nUkraine\u2019s female soldiers serve alongside their male counterparts, enduring the same risks and battlefield living conditions. And while some of the male soldiers demonstrate a protective disposition toward the female soldiers, the women are resistant to special treatment and work to prove themselves as equals.\n\n\u201cJulia faced all the same problems, as everyday problems, physical and mental, as the male fighters,\u201d Mikheychenko said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the commanders tried in every way to protect her,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, Julia rarely came out on duty in a combat patrol, but she always asked that we put her in, in order to be on an equal footing with everyone else. At the same time, sometimes she was allowed to participate in reconnaissance raids on neutral territory, or even behind enemy lines.\u201d\n\nBurlakova decided to become a soldier after visiting front-line positions while working as a journalist. She attended a military training camp but was initially dissuaded from combat service, thinking it would be too difficult.\n\nBut after visiting Pisky on a five-day journalism assignment and experiencing combat firsthand, Burlakova decided that she was capable of being a soldier.\n\n\u201cI was scared for the first two or three hours, but after that I was OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw other women there, and I saw young soldiers learning to shoot out there on the front lines. I realized that I could do it.\u201d\n\nBurlakova called her editor and quit her job. And after a short trip back to Kyiv to arrange her affairs, she returned for five months of combat.\n\n\u201cMy dad said I\u2019m an idiot, in a nice way,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom was crying, probably praying.\u201d\n\nBurlakova\u2019s grandfather, who was a pilot in the Soviet air force and currently lives in Moscow, was at first against the idea but ultimately supported his granddaughter\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019re a girl and you shouldn\u2019t do it,\u2019 he told me. \u2018But if you have to, I understand,\u2019\u201d Burlakova said, recalling her grandfather\u2019s reaction.\n\nBurlakova said she ultimately earned the trust and respect of male comrades by performing well under fire.\n\n\u201cMaybe they [the men] would give you the last piece of candy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they give the women opportunities to prove themselves. It depends on how you act and if you don\u2019t give anyone reasons to treat you differently.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Burlakova explained, it was easier to be a woman on the front lines because there was less of a stigma for a woman to admit fear. \u201cSome men never show their fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt allowed to show that I was scared. But you have to be careful so people don\u2019t treat you differently.\u201d\n\nAnd the fear was real, Burlakova admitted. Yet it was also mixed with exhilaration and a feeling of purpose, sensations that are hard to match in civilian life.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand you feel like you really don\u2019t want to die today,\u201d Burlakova said. \u201cAnd the other hand it\u2019s fun, not really exciting \u2026 but you realize how much you want to live.\u201d\n\nTradition\n\nUkraine has a historical tradition of women in combat. Women played an active role in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (the red and black flag of which is a ubiquitous symbol of wartime patriotism in modern Ukraine), which fought a guerrilla war against both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Red Army during World War II.\n\nUkrainian women also served in the Red Army during World War II, including Russian-Ukrainian sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko, who was credited with killing 309 German soldiers.\n\nA contemporary example of a Ukrainian woman in combat is Nadiya Savchenko, a 33-year-old Ukrainian combat helicopter navigator who volunteered to serve with the Aidar battalion as a soldier in eastern Ukraine in 2014.\n\nCombined Russian-separatist forces captured Savchenko on June 18, 2014. She was accused of being a spotter during a mortar attack, which Russian authorities claim killed two Russian journalists. She is now being held in Russia after a year in custody in Donetsk and faces up to 25 years in prison.\n\nOn March 2, 2015, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko awarded Savchenko the title \u201cHero of Ukraine\u201d\u2014the nation\u2019s highest military honor.\n\n\u201cNadiya Savchenko is a symbol of the struggle for Ukraine,\u201d Poroshenko said in a July 2 statement. \u201cWhile in captivity she has demonstrated the true, strong, martial Ukrainian spirit of a serviceman who doesn\u2019t betray the motherland.\u201d\n\nTotal War\n\nWhile the Ukraine war affects only a small portion of the country geographically, Ukrainian society has mobilized across all spectrums to sustain the war effort.\n\nAfter a year and a half, the war is still a grassroots effort, sustained by civilian volunteers who, often with no military background or training, raise money to buy supplies for Ukrainian soldiers and then deliver those supplies to the front lines.\n\nThe volunteer movement is essential to Ukraine\u2019s war effort, and many combat units are still dependent on civilian volunteers for basic necessities\u2014including uniforms, food, water, first aid kits, body armor, and medical supplies.\n\nUkrainian women play a key role in the volunteer movement.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t step aside and look away,\u201d said Julia Minaeva, a 26-year-old university instructor in Kyiv. Minaeva collects supplies, including letters from children, for deployed troops, and she visits the wounded in hospitals, speaking to them about \u201canything but the war\u201d to raise their spirits.\n\n\u201cEvery day when I go to sleep, I had a peaceful day because of the soldiers,\u201d Minaeva said. \u201cThey\u2019re sleeping in trenches and in block posts, and they\u2019re giving us the opportunity to live peacefully. It\u2019s our duty to help them, and I feel like I need to do something for our country.\u201d\n\nMinaeva says wounded soldiers are often in need of conversation with people outside their families\u2014and to not talk about the war.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still men,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re still clever and handsome, even if they don\u2019t have an arm, or a leg. They\u2019re really great people. They never complain. They just want to get back on their feet and get back out there to protect us.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s War\n\nJulia Dimitrova, 28, is a civilian volunteer in Dnipropetrovsk. The mother of two sons (4 and 2 years old) lived in Donetsk for 14 years and still has many friends there, including some who have taken up arms with the combined Russian-separatist forces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult that I live here and realize that I help the soldiers that kill my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s life. That\u2019s war.\u201d\n\nIn July 2014, Dimitrova and four other women started a grassroots supply drive to gather equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. They raise money on Facebook to buy supplies like boots and first aid kits, and, about once a week, Dimitrova travels to the front lines to deliver what she has collected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really good out there; our guys need a lot of support,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country wasn\u2019t ready for a war. Not a year ago, not now.\u201d\n\nDimitrova said she rarely wears body armor when she travels to the front, even though she faces the same risks of artillery and sniper fire as the soldiers to whom she is delivering supplies. She also said there are separatist diversion groups, which try to intercept civilian supply runs\u2014sometimes kidnapping or murdering the volunteers.\n\n\u201cMy family thinks I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Dimitrova said. \u201cA year ago, my husband wanted a divorce, but he got used to it.\u201d\n\nDimitrova works in a rented office in downtown Dnipropetrovsk. The walls are lined with various supplies and memorabilia from the war zone. Like many civilian volunteers, Dimitrova had no prior military experience before deciding to support the war effort. She used to do a little modeling and was a housewife before the war started. But, echoing a common refrain among Ukraine\u2019s volunteers, she said she couldn\u2019t sit idly by while others fought.\n\n\u201cI saw that I could do this, and I could do it well,\u201d Dimitrova said. \u201cAnd now the volunteers are like a second family for me. I know that if we met in normal life, we\u2019d never get together. But this experience has bonded us.\u201d\n\nThe war also takes a psychological toll on the civilian volunteers, who are firsthand witnesses to the suffering of the soldiers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you never get used to,\u201d Minaeva said, fighting back tears as she spoke about a soldier she knew who was killed. \u201cIt\u2019s a war and this is what we have to do. I have no right to complain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always cry when there\u2019s a funeral,\u201d Dimitrova said. \u201cWar never has a happy end.\u201d\n\nAn Unfinished Fight\n\nJulia entered service on the front lines in Pisky in April 2015, and was pulled off the lines after being wounded in July. She is currently an instructor at OUN\u2019s training camp outside Kyiv.\n\nMikheychenko praised Julia\u2019s courage under fire and her skills as a soldier, which he witnessed firsthand, but he also retains some misgivings about women serving in combat.\n\n\u201cIn general, I personally think that in war, women should not be in combat,\u201d Mikheychenko said. \u201cIt is hard to see how they are injured or killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he added, \u201cthey mobilize men by their brave behavior and give them courage. These men are too embarrassed to show cowardice because some women do not stop.\u201d\n\nBurlakova, who is currently back at work as a journalist, said she plans to return to the front lines in September.\n\n\u201cThe main problem is you want to go back,\u201d Burlakova said, explaining what it was like to return to Kyiv after her time in combat. \u201cYou make better friends in the war than in real life. \u2026 As a soldier it\u2019s easier sometimes. You just stand there with weapons and fight; it\u2019s simple. In some way, being a soldier is an escape. Kyiv is more difficult and depressing.\u201d\n\nMinaeva expects that the work of caring for soldiers and their families will last long after the war has ended. \u201cWhen the war ends, I will give myself two days to sleep, and then there are a lot of things to do to help these families, and to help the soldiers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMost of all,\u201d Minaeva added, \u201cI want every soldier to get back with victory, alive and healthy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, women have played a key role for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, women have played a key role for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.", "title": "Meet Ukraine\u2019s Women Warriors", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_WarriorWomen_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-11T21:06:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UzhmPE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, women have played a key role for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.", "title": "Meet Ukraine\u2019s Women Warriors", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_WarriorWomen_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "conflict,europe", "published_time": "2015-08-11T17:00:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-11T21:06:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, women, combat"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s war.\u201dIn July 2014, Dimitrova and four other women started a grassroots supply drive to gather equipment for Ukrainian soldiers.\n\u201cAs to her personal courage,\u201d Mikheychenko continued, \u201cthen, of course, she is very brave\u2014braver than many male soldiers.\u201dUnofficial WarriorsSince the beginning of the Ukraine war, women have played a key role for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\n\u201cIn general, I personally think that in war, women should not be in combat,\u201d Mikheychenko said.\nWith the sun settling outside on the late summer afternoon, about a dozen Ukrainian soldiers stood casually inside the garage, talking and joking.\nThey wore mismatched military uniforms purchased off the Internet, or which civilian volunteers had donated."}
