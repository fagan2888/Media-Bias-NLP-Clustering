People who go to Washington are elected to govern. What they\u2019re doing is a complete and total absence of governance. They don\u2019t realize how damaging it is going to be to them personally as well as to the party. People need to come to the table and they need to negotiate. This country is about compromise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you how upsetting it is for me to see 30 extremists in Washington control the entire government,\" he added. \"There\u2019s something very, very wrong doing on.\"\n\nLhota's comments come just days after his campaign released a statement distancing himself from the shutdown crisis in Washington and denouncing Tea Party politicians in their fight to defund Obamacare.\n\n\"I think what they're doing is flat out wrong,\u201d Lhota said of House Republicans last Tuesday. \"Anybody who wants to tag me with what's going on in Washington I think is going to be making a very big mistake. Not all Republicans believe what\u2019s going on is the right thing to do.\"\n\nLhota, however, has also said he would not be enrolling in the new health care program, citing certain \"issues\" he had with it.\n\nLhota and his opponent, Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio, have engaged in efforts to paint their opponents as party extremists--de Blasio as a left-wing radical and Lhota as a Goldwater supporter.\n\nDe Blasio leads the mayoral race by a huge margin.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke out against the shutdown on Sunday, blaming the impasse in Congress for stalling critical aid for Hurricane Sandy victims.\n\nRelated on HuffPost: NYC Primary Day 2013 NYC Primary Day 2013\n\n1 of 26 Anthony Weiner, Jordan Weiner Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner holds his son Jordan as he leaves the voting booth after casting his vote at his polling station during the primary election in New York, Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2013.
