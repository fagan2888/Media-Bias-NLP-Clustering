The ILO in 2012 estimated 20.9 million people are nonetheless engaged in forced labor. Some 14.2 million are forced to work in fields like agriculture, construction, mining and domestic care, while 4.5 million are sexually exploited. An additional 2.2 million are engaged in \u201cstate-imposed forms of forced labour, such as prisons, or in work imposed by military or paramilitary forces,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMore than half \u2014 55% \u2014 are women and girls. A quarter are under the age of 18. Some 56% are in the Asia-Pacific region and 18% are in Africa. Smaller numbers are in Latin America and the Caribbean (9%), developed economies including the European Union (7%), central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (7%) and the Middle East (3%).\n\nInvoluntary workers generate $150.2 billion per year in illegal profits, the agency said. That\u2019s more than triple the agency\u2019s 2005 estimate of at least $44 billion a year in profits from forced labor.\n\nThe ILO calculated the new profit estimate using data from its 2012 Global Estimate of Forced Labor, which covered the period from 2002 to 2011. It excluded the 2.2 million people engaged in state-imposed forced labor, due to a lack of reliable information and \u201ctheoretical difficulties\u201d in calculating profits generated by, for example, child soldiers, the report said.\n\nSexual exploitation alone generates $99 billion in annual profits. \u201cProfits per victim are highest in forced sexual exploitation, which can be explained by the demand for such services and the prices that clients are willing to pay, and by the low capital investments and low operating costs associated with this activity,\u201d the report said. \u201cWith a global average profit of US$21,800 per year per victim, this sector is six times more profitable than all other forms of forced labour, and five times more profitable than forced labour exploitation outside domestic work.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 21 million forced laborers and the illicit profit generated by their work \u201cexceeds the population and GDP of many countries or territories around the world,\u201d the report said. \u201cYet this vast nation of men, women and children, along with its resources, remains virtually invisible, hidden behind a wall of coercion, threats and economic exploitation.\u201d\n\nIt concluded that forced labor represents \u201ca practice that has no place in modern society and should be eradicated as a matter of priority.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Millions of slaves and other forced laborers around the world are generating an estimated $150.2 billion a year in profits for their exploiters, according to a new report from the International Labour Organization .", "title": "Modern Forms of Slavery Generate $150 Billion a Year in Profits for Exploiters", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/05/19/modern-forms-of-slavery-generate-150-billion-a-year-in-profits-for-exploiters/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Modern Forms of Slavery Generate $150 Billion a Year in Profits for Exploiters", "description": "Millions of slaves and other forced laborers around the world are generating an estimated $150.2 billion a year in profits for their exploiters, according to a new report from the International Labour Organization .", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Ben Leubsdorf", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Millions of slaves and other forced laborers around the world are generating an estimated $150.2 billion a year in profits for their exploiters, according to a new report from the International Labour Organization .", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-05-20T00:01:32-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/05/19/modern-forms-of-slavery-generate-150-billion-a-year-in-profits-for-exploiters/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-25406", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Millions of slaves and other forced laborers around the world are generating an estimated $150.2 billion a year in profits for their exploiters, according to a new report from the International Labour Organization .", "title": "Modern Forms of Slavery Generate $150 Billion a Year in Profits for Exploiters", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/05/19/modern-forms-of-slavery-generate-150-billion-a-year-in-profits-for-exploiters/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-25406", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-19T21:23:42-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0acd\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s more than triple the agency\u2019s 2005 estimate of at least $44 billion a year in profits from forced labor.\nThe ILO calculated the new profit estimate using data from its 2012 Global Estimate of Forced Labor, which covered the period from 2002 to 2011.\nThe ILO in 2012 estimated 20.9 million people are nonetheless engaged in forced labor.\nSome 14.2 million are forced to work in fields like agriculture, construction, mining and domestic care, while 4.5 million are sexually exploited.\nInvoluntary workers generate $150.2 billion per year in illegal profits, the agency said."}
