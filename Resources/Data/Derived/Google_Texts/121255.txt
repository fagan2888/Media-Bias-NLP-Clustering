Leon Fairley is trying to enjoy himself on the island of Hawaii (“The Big Island”). Unfortunately, his vacation keeps getting interrupted by phone calls from people trying to enroll him in Covered California (California’s Obamacare health insurance exchange).

Fairley doesn’t want to enroll in Obamacare. He has insurance through his employer, Accenture. He has had this coverage for the past five years. He says he has never expressed any interest in enrolling in one of Covered California’s plans.

@CoveredCA I have been insured the entire time. STOP the CALLS!!! #fb — Leon Fairley (@LeonF63) April 7, 2015

A reasonable request, one would think.

@CoveredCA you are posing me of. 12 agencies representing have called me now. This is harassment. I'm insured through my employer. — Leon Fairley (@LeonF63) April 7, 2015

@CoveredCA I have never indicated interested in coverage through program. You are making it very hard for me to support you. 11 calls today — Leon Fairley (@LeonF63) April 7, 2015

@CoveredCA 12 calls in 5 3/4 hours. Note that I am on vacation in Hawai‘i (3 hrs earlier) and you are not helping my attitude. #fb — Leon Fairley (@LeonF63) April 7, 2015

To paraphrase Covered California: “most likely this was a mistake.”
