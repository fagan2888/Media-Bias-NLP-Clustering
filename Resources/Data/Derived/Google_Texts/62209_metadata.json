It will also avoid penalties associated with failing to meet those requirements.\n\nFranklin Medical Center Administrator Blake Kramer said ending the hospital's 501(c)(3) status will have little impact on the hospital's operations. The hospital is already tax exempt because it is considered a government entity under the Franklin Parish Policy Jury, according to the report.\n\n\"We may miss out on some grants, but the only big change is not having to worry about the IRS coming and saying 'you owe us a bunch of taxes,'\" said Mr. Kramer.\n\nAt Thursday's meeting, Franklin Medical Center CFO Billy Page said \"accounts receivable is big,\" which indicates the hospital is struggling with collections. Without 501(c)(3) status, the hospital will be able to more aggressively pursue collections because it will no longer have to wait 120 days to pursue claims for nonpayment as is required to maintain charitable status under the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nMore articles on healthare finance:\n\nCalifornia hospital to close after restructuring plan fails\n\nSouth Dakota hospital to lose Medicare funding\n\nMayo operating income dips 36.9% as expenses rise\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
