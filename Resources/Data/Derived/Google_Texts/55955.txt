(CBS) — There will be no Chicago homecoming for the Obama family in 2017.

While having lunch with a small group in Milwaukee on Thursday, President Obama told them that he plans to stay in Washington after he leaves the White House.

At least for a few years, he said, until his youngest daughter, Sasha, finishes high school.

The Obama’s family home is in the Kenwood neighborhood, near the University of Chicago.

However, it appears they won’t be returning there after January 2017, when he turns over the White House keys to a new president.

During the lunch he was asked if he was going back to Chicago after his presidency.

“We haven’t figured that out yet,” he said. “We’re going to have to stay a couple of years in D.C., probably, so Sasha can graduate. Transferring someone in the middle of high school — tough.”

Obama lived in Chicago for about 30 years and Michelle Obama grew up here. Sasha, 15, attends Sidwell Friends School in Washington. Malia, who also attends the exclusive private school, is going off to college in the fall.

Plans are in the works to build his presidential library at one of two locations on the South Side.

Obama met with a small group who had written him about how his health care reform law had helped them.
