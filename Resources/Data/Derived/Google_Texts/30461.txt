Health Facts: Confused about health care reform's impact? Here's help

If there's one thing that seems to unite employers and employees right now, it's that there is confusion when it comes to health care.

Employers struggling with rising costs now have a lump of potential taxes, fines, fees and requirements. Deadlines have moved â€” for example, the 2015 requirement for employers to offer qualified plans.

Employees are getting a lot of communication from insurance companies, from their employer and the things written in the papers. Meanwhile, there are things that apply to folks at small companies that don't apply to folks at large companies.

There's no easy answer for anyone.

However, there are people who study this for a living. And there are employers that have ideas and strategies. There are resources for employees as well. That's the basis for this project.

Crain's Detroit Business is proud to partner with the Greater Detroit Area Health Council on this HealthFacts project. The goal is to make information available.

In this collaboration, GDAHC has been a resource to Crain's for ideas on health care, the impact of the Affordable Care Act and the perspective of health care providers.

CEO Kate Kohn-Parrott, formerly the director of benefits at Chrysler Group LLC, offers some advice to employees.

In addition to this package of stories, there has been a series of webinars through the year. Six employer-related webinars were hosted, and the second employee-related webinar will occur Thursday. Register at crainsdetroit.com/webinars. And this series will continue with a series of speakers addressing 2014 health care strategies at the Crain's Health Care Leadership Summit.

The event, to be held Oct. 29 at the San Marino Club in Troy, will approach the health care situation with ideas of innovative ways that the health care community is approaching challenges right now. For more information or to register, go to crainsdetroit.com/events.
