Earlier this year, Christie stirred controversy by saying parents should have \"some measure of choice\" in vaccinating their children.\n\nWhile Christie has not made a decision on running - and may not until early summer - he acted like a candidate in New Hampshire, where during a packed two-day trip he announced an entitlement reform proposal; met with a newspaper editorial board; did interviews with a local radio broadcaster, two conservative national radio show hosts, and NBC's Matt Lauer; and met with voters in pizzerias and pubs.\n\nHe also repeatedly criticized President Obama's leadership on foreign affairs and the Affordable Care Act, questioned what Republican rival Jeb Bush's policy positions were, and knocked Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, who officially entered the race this week.\n\nChristie said during the town-hall meeting that Clinton wants to raise large sums of money for her campaign, but \"she then wants to get the corrupting money out of politics. It's classic politician speak.\"\n\nHe told a woman who asked how he would reduce the \"corrupting\" influence of money in politics that he supported disclosure within 24 hours of all campaign contributions, rejecting the suggestion that such donations automatically bought influence. \"I think to be an effective politician, you need to be a professional ingrate,\" he said.\n\nBrian Dooley, 57, of Nashua, said Christie demonstrated \"a grasp on, I think, all the important issues.\" A former Romney campaign volunteer, Dooley said Christie \"has a special energy and passion.\"\n\nWhile undecided, Richard D'Agostino, 60, of Salem, said Christie \"really reached me\" with a story he tells often in New Jersey about his mother's last words - instructions that Christie should go to work because \"there is nothing left unsaid between us.\"\n\nD'Agostino, a lawyer, said the Republican Party needs a \"standout\" candidate who can win a general election. \"I still don't completely see that person yet,\" he said. \"But I love the way Christie speaks his mind.\"\n\nDavid McConville, a Republican activist who asked Christie about immigration, said the governor had addressed the topic in \"broad strokes, which is what he needed to do at a town hall.\"\n\n\"At this juncture, it's not wise for him to get too specific with his answers,\" he said.\n\nChristie is scheduled to return Friday to New Hampshire, where he will hold another town-hall meeting and participate in a leadership summit featuring other prospective Republican presidential candidates.\n\nmhanna@phillynews.com856-779-3232 @maddiehanna", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "philly-archives", "description": "LONDONDERRY, N.H. - Gov.
