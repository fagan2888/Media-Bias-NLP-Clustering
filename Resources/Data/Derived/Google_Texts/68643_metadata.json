Those included many of the failed co-ops not identifying senior leadership and seven of the 12 failed co-ops having serious problems with their enrollment strategy.\n\nMany co-ops also \"submitted budgets that were incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective or that didn't align with the co-op's own financial projections,\" Portman's statement read.\n\nHowever, HHS approved all of the loan applications for the failed co-ops, doling out $1.2 billion.\n\nMany of the co-ops said the reason for their failure was a lack of government funding through the risk adjustment program, which pays out insurers for major losses.\n\nPortman noted that while HHS had the information on the co-op problems, it \"did not step in.\"\n\nAdministration officials said Congress cut funding for the co-op program from the original $6 billion included in the Affordable Care Act to $2.2 billion.\n\nAndy Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in his opening statement that entering the insurance market is tricky, with multiple pressures and challenges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Senate panel found that the government ignored warning signs that Obamacare co-op plans were a bad bet when it doled out $1.2 billion in taxpayer funds to them.\nThe report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released during a hearing Thursday, found that in 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services gave out loans to failed consumer-oriented and operated plans, called co-ops, despite clear warning signs they weren't reliable.\nThe co-ops were created to spur more competition on the Obamacare exchanges.
