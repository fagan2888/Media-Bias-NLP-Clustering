The measure now moves to the GOP-controlled Senate. If the full legislature ends up approving the bill, Mississippi will be the 13th state to pass a 20-week abortion ban, although some of those state laws are currently being blocked from taking effect for violating the protections under Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut even if this latest threat to abortion access becomes law, it won\u2019t have any impact on women in the state. It\u2019s currently impossible to get an abortion after 20 weeks in Mississippi.\n\nThanks to lawmakers\u2019 persistent attacks on reproductive freedom, Mississippi has just about every possible abortion restriction on the books, and the women who live there already struggle to exercise their right to choose. There\u2019s only one abortion clinic left in the entire state, and it only performs abortions up to 16 weeks \u2014 so women who need later abortion care are already forced to travel to a different state.\n\n\u201cPeople in Mississippi need to be demanding why they\u2019re considering legislation that has little impact on the state and is wasting taxpayer dollars,\u201d the owner of Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic, Diane Derzis, told Reuters. \u201cThis is grandstanding at its worst.\u201d\n\nBut Gov. Phil Bryant (R), who recently reiterated his goal to put an end to all abortion in Mississippi, sees the legislation as an important symbol. \u201cAnother strong step for life in Mississippi as the House passes a ban on abortions after 20 weeks,\u201d the governor wrote on his Facebook page after Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nIndeed, 20-week abortion bans have become a big symbol in the anti-choice community\u2019s effort to chip away at Roe v. Wade. Although 20 weeks is an arbitrary deadline that isn\u2019t supported by any scientific logic, abortion opponents have seized on the opportunity to exploit public opinion about third-trimester procedures. They have positioned the 20-week ban as a logical, moderate policy \u2014 which allows them to construe anyone who opposes it as a radical who wants to allow doctors to dismember babies.\n\nIn reality, abortions after 20 weeks are already extremely rare, making up just 1.5 percent of all abortion procedures nationwide. The women who need later abortion care are simply individuals in dire circumstances. They typically fall into one of several categories: economically disadvantaged women who struggle to save up the money and get to a clinic, women who encounter health risks that make it unsafe to continue the pregnancy, and women who discover serious fetal abnormalities that weren\u2019t evident earlier in the pregnancy. Imposing 20-week abortion bans doesn\u2019t dramatically lower the abortion rate; it simply provides a convenient talking point for right-wing lawmakers, while unfairly targeting women in the most heartbreaking situations.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Mississippi lawmakers have wasted their time banning an abortion procedure that doesn\u2019t even exist in the state. The state also has a preemptive ban on telemedicine abortion \u2014 the practice of allowing doctors to use video technology to remotely prescribe an abortion pill to women in rural areas \u2014 to block that type of program from ever getting off the ground.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Mississippi lawmakers are advancing a 20-week abortion ban even though it's already impossible for women in the state to get an abortion after 20 weeks.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Mississippi lawmakers are advancing a 20-week abortion ban even though it's already impossible for women in the state to get an abortion after 20 weeks.", "title": "Mississippi Advances A Stringent Abortion Ban That Doesn\u2019t Even Apply To Any Clinics In The State", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/13/3290871/mississippi-abortion-ban-clinics/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mississippi lawmakers are advancing a 20-week abortion ban even though it's already impossible for women in the state to get an abortion after 20 weeks.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1-321x214.jpg", "title": "Mississippi Advances A Stringent Abortion Ban That Doesn\u2019t Even Apply To Any Clinics In The State", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T15:18:24+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacbe\"", "article_summary": "Health Mississippi Advances A Stringent Abortion Ban That Doesn\u2019t Even Apply To Any Clinics In The State CREDIT: AP Photo/Manuel Balce CenetaOn Thursday, the Mississippi House passed a 20-week abortion ban without any exceptions for victims of rape and incest.\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Mississippi lawmakers have wasted their time banning an abortion procedure that doesn\u2019t even exist in the state.\nIndeed, 20-week abortion bans have become a big symbol in the anti-choice community\u2019s effort to chip away at Roe v.
