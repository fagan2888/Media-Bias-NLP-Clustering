“I look forward to steering the association and its members through this tumultuous time of change in health care,” said Souza. “Rhode Islanders count on hospitals to be there in their greatest times of need. We must ensure hospitals are able to continue their important mission.”

Souza joined HARI in 2009 from Signature Healthcare in Brockton, Mass., where he served as corporate controller and was responsible for the accounting, reporting and control functions of the corporation’s various entities. He also served as director of financial planning at Landmark Medical Center. Souza was awarded a Master of Science management degree by Bridgewater State College.
