Attendings can be brutal, and medical school and residency requires, on average, 84 hours / week. A recent poll of Stanford medical residents showed an average of 54 hours/week across rotations and specialties. That time tends not to include off hours and the other duties as an aspiring physician. The combination of long hours, poor sleep schedules, the hyper competitive nature of MDs, and financial pressure may be contributing to a suicide rate that is 2.5-4X higher than the general population.\n\nThe financials of the bus driver:\n\nThe average bus driver works anywhere from 35-40 hours/week, and requires no debt. The median income for bus drivers is $36,600. On average, bus drivers are happy and have a lower suicide rate than the national average. Though, to be fair, those driving around urban suffer from higher stress levels.\n\nThe Math: After 19 years, the bus driver and the doctor will have taken home the same amount of money.\n\nHow do we fix the doctors' salary problem?\n\nStop cutting Medicare Advantage reimbursements\n\nAllow Student Interest Deductions for those making more than $60k (it's currently capped)\n\nFederally fund digital learning programs that reduce the ongoing education costs (ATI, Board Vitals, USMLERx)\n\nTuition discrimination - Pre-med and other STEM fields receive subsidized education\n\nExpand federal loan forgiveness programs, particularly for primary care physicians that have practiced for at least 2 years.\n\nFollow Dan Lambert on Twitter: www.twitter.com/boardvitals\n\nFOLLOW EDUCATION\n\nGET THE NEWSLETTER Enter your email address to get top stories and blog posts emailed to you each day.\n\nDespite the 'Million dollar mistake,' we're really glad to have a doctor there when we need them - let's find ways to make the physician training and practice process a little more bearable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I should have been a bus driver instead of a doctor\" announced a friend of mine at a recent dinner. \"I made the million dollar mistake\" she continued la...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-12-16 18:13:08 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "\"I should have been a bus driver instead of a doctor\" announced a friend of mine at a recent dinner. \"I made the million dollar mistake\" she continued la...", "title": "Is Medical School a Million Dollar Mistake?", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-lambert/is-medical-school-a-milli_b_6320796.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2278278/images/o-BLONDE-DOCTOR-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I should have been a bus driver instead of a doctor\" announced a friend of mine at a recent dinner. \"I made the million dollar mistake\" she continued la...", "creator": "boardvitals", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2278278/images/o-BLONDE-DOCTOR-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Is Medical School a Million Dollar Mistake?", "site": "@HuffPostEdu", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-15 18:13:08 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6320796", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "education", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "medical school,doctors,higher education,STEM education,education costs,higher education costs,higher education reform", "article": {"section": "Education", "tag": "medical school,doctors,higher education,STEM education,education costs,higher education costs,higher education reform", "published_time": "2014-12-15 18:13:08 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-02-14 05:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce75\"", "article_summary": "\"I made the million dollar mistake\" she continued later in the discussion, referencing the recent Yahoo news article \"$1 Million Mistake: Becoming a Doctor\" on why doctors are struggling to pay their bills.\nThe financials of the bus driver:The average bus driver works anywhere from 35-40 hours/week, and requires no debt.\nOn average, bus drivers are happy and have a lower suicide rate than the national average.\nAttendings can be brutal, and medical school and residency requires, on average, 84 hours / week.\nThe Math: After 19 years, the bus driver and the doctor will have taken home the same amount of money."}
