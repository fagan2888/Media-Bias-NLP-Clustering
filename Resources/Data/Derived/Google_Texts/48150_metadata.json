Some workers are complaining that new employees are enjoying the pay increase, while others aren\u2019t seeing any raise at all.\n\n\u201cIt is pitting people against each other,\u201d Charmaine Givens-Thomas, a 10-year Wal-Mart veteran, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt hurts morale when people feel like they aren\u2019t being appreciated. I hear people every day talking about looking for other jobs and wanting to remove themselves from Wal-Mart and a job that will make them feel like that.\u201d\n\nSome workers suspect that their hours are being cut and annual raises reduced in order to pay for the wage increase for newer workers \u2014 a claim that Wal-Mart denies.\n\n\u201cIt took me four four years to get to $10.80. When minimum wage goes up we don\u2019t receive a pay increase unless we are under the minimum,\u201d one worker wrote in a comment on Walmart\u2019s corporate blog, CBS reported. \u201cNow our 2 newest associates are making $10.75 and my annual raise is going from 40 cents down to 26 cents. Apparently experience doesn\u2019t get rewarded.\u201d\n\nKristin Oliver, Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. human resources chief, said executives understand why the minimum-wage hike could make some workers feel disenfranchised. She said the company has tried to remedy that by changing its scheduling system to help workers get the hours they want and started a new training program for employees looking to advance within the company, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly looking and evolving what the right pay should be and we were aware of the issue,\u201d Ms. Oliver said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t prepared to go forward with any additional increases but have continued to look at it to see if there is something else we should do for those in the middle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wal-Mart's minimum-wage hike this year, intended to improve morale and retain employees, is having the opposite effect for many senior workers who didn't get a raise, according to a new Bloomberg report.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wal-Mart\u2019s minimum-wage hike this year, intended to improve morale and retain employees, is having the opposite effect for many senior workers who didn\u2019t get a raise, according to a new Bloomberg report.", "title": "Wal-Mart\u2019s pay raise backfires: \u2018It is pitting people against each other\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/7/wal-marts-pay-raise-backfires-it-is-pitting-people/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/4_7_2015_ap3554882565818201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/4_7_2015_ap3554882565818201.jpg", "description": "Wal-Mart's minimum-wage hike this year, intended to improve morale and retain employees, is having the opposite effect for many senior workers who didn't get a raise, according to a new Bloomberg repo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wal-Mart\u2019s pay raise backfires: \u2018It is pitting people agai"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Wal Mart, Bloomberg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbee\"", "article_summary": "Some workers are complaining that new employees are enjoying the pay increase, while others aren\u2019t seeing any raise at all.\nApparently experience doesn\u2019t get rewarded.\u201dKristin Oliver, Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. human resources chief, said executives understand why the minimum-wage hike could make some workers feel disenfranchised.\nNew Wal-Mart workers started making a minimum of $9 an hour in April and will get at least $10 an hour in February.\nWhen minimum wage goes up we don\u2019t receive a pay increase unless we are under the minimum,\u201d one worker wrote in a comment on Walmart\u2019s corporate blog, CBS reported.\n\u201cWe are constantly looking and evolving what the right pay should be and we were aware of the issue,\u201d Ms. Oliver said."}
