Jindal, to repeal the Stelly tax changes that voters passed in 2002,\u201d says Louisiana Budget Project director Jan Moller. \u201cThat has taken about six to seven hundred million dollars our of our tax base every year.\u201d\n\nMoller says legislators need to revisit those higher income tax brackets.\n\n\u201cThe economy has grown. Incomes have grown at the top of the income pyramid. And I think we need to talk about how they can pay a larger share,\u201d Moller states, unequivocally.\n\nThe decline in oil revenues has also enlarged the projected deficit for the upcoming fiscal year. Moller says that could be partially alleviated by repealing the state\u2019s two-year immunity from severance taxes, given to fracking operations.\n\n\u201cThis tax break was originally passed more than 20 years ago, when horizontal drilling was an experimental technology,\u201d Moller notes.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer experimental As Legislative Fiscal Analyst Greg Albrecht puts it \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re not ever going to forget how to get oil out of shale now.\u201d\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s a large pot of federal money available through Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Moller says it would help many of the currently uninsured:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more than a quarter-million people in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nAnd it would help the state\u2019s budget woes.\n\n\u201cThis would be 100 percent funded by the federal government, which would free up the money we\u2019re spending right now on uncompensated care,\u201d Moller explains. That 100 percent funding is good through 2016. After that, the state just pays 10 percent of the expanded Medicaid costs.\n\nThis combination of solutions would cover the expected deficit, using recurring revenue to achieve a balanced 2016 budget. The major problem with implementing any of these solutions is Governor Jindal. Because of signing a Grover Norquist-prompted pledge not to increase taxes\u2014and because of Jindal\u2019s national ambitions\u2014he steadfastly objects to anything that could be branded a tax hike. The governor also refuses to consider Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nTomorrow, we\u2019ll look at more options \u2014 possibly more palatable \u2014 for getting down off the fiscal cliff.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Finding the way down off the fiscal cliff could be as simple as turning around, and looking back at the path that brought us here. \u201cThe root of our current", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Capitol Access", "og": {"url": "http://wrkf.org/post/finding-path-fiscal-cliff", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wrkf/files/styles/medium/public/201502/Higher-Taxes-Road-Sign356x235.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Finding the way down off the fiscal cliff could be as simple as turning around, and looking back at the path that brought us here. \u201cThe root of our current", "title": "Finding a Path Off the Fiscal Cliff"}, "story_id": 383984914, "twitter": {"site": "@WRKF", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lacapaxs"}, "author": "Sue Lincoln", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Finding a Path Off the Fiscal Cliff"}, "nid": 37464, "datePublished": "2015-02-05", "keywords": "WRKF News, Stelly Plan, Jan Moller, Medicaid expansion, fracking tax break", "wordCount": 411, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c89\"", "article_summary": "Finding the way down off the fiscal cliff could be as simple as turning around, and looking back at the path that brought us here.\nTomorrow, we\u2019ll look at more options \u2014 possibly more palatable \u2014 for getting down off the fiscal cliff.\nAnd I think we need to talk about how they can pay a larger share,\u201d Moller states, unequivocally.\nMoller says it would help many of the currently uninsured:\u201cThat\u2019s more than a quarter-million people in Louisiana.\u201dAnd it would help the state\u2019s budget woes.\nJindal, to repeal the Stelly tax changes that voters passed in 2002,\u201d says Louisiana Budget Project director Jan Moller."}
