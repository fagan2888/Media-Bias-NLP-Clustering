MARYSVILLE, Mich. (AP) - The city of Marysville is preparing for the upcoming implosion of a power plant.

In an effort to ensure no one is injured during the implosion scheduled for 8 a.m. Saturday, officials are enforcing a safety zone in the St. Clair River and an exclusion zone for buildings and homes near the Mighty Marysville power plant. Public safety chief Tom Konik tells the Times Herald of Port Huron (http://bwne.ws/20zpNOG ) that people who live or work within the zone have been asked to either clear the area or stay indoors.

Firefighters, police officers and contractor employees will patrol the zone to make sure no one enters a potentially dangerous area.

Konik expects many spectators will watch the implosion from the Market Square shopping plaza or along the Canadian shore.
