Their latest target is Virginia Delegate Barbara Comstock, now the Republican nominee in the state\u2019s open 10th congressional district, whom veteran Clinton operative Paul Begala is now calling a stalker.\n\nReferring to her past work as a congressional staffer investigating alleged White House lawbreaking during the Clinton years, Begala said Comstock has a \u201creally almost sick, sort of stalker-like obsession with President Clinton,\u201d Politico reported Thursday.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Hillary Clinton]\n\nSick? Stalker-like? Obsession? Begala would never say that about a man, but apparently thinks he can get away with using such loaded terms because Comstock\u2019s a woman. It\u2019s an attack that is without basis and is lower than low \u2013 but discrediting opponents, real and imagined, is what the Clinton spin machine is all about. It turned the politics of personal destruction into a fine art.\n\nThe Democrats think they have a chance to win the 10th district Virginia seat from the Republicans \u2013 they don\u2019t really \u2013 so they\u2019ve adopted a no holds barred, all bets are off approach to the campaign. But there are still limits, and calling Comstock\u2019s sanity and stability into question, because she\u2019s a woman, is beyond the pale.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nThe question now is whether women leaders in the Democratic Party like former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (who will no doubt consider employing Begala on her behalf if she runs for president in 2016), Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the host of Democratic women in the U.S. Senate and House, such as Sens. Barbara Boxer and Jeanne Shaheen or former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are going to call him on it. Will they let him get away with calling Comstock a stalker or will they draw the line, saying finally that enough is enough?\n\nToo many liberal men like Begala think they can engage in a war on conservative women because nobody ever tells them it\u2019s wrong. They think they can say anything they want, cast any aspersion, make any crack and that folks will laugh \u2013 all the while subtly undermining the credibility of an accomplished woman like Comstock who refuses to stay on the feminist plantation.\n\nBegala went over the top, crossed the line and got outside the box. He should apologize and, more than that, the responsible women who are in leadership positions in the Democratic Party ought to demand that he do so.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "\ufeffHillary Clinton and Democrats Must Disavow Paul Begala Stalker Comments", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Democrats must disavow a Clinton operative's anti-woman remark.", "title": "War on Women, Clinton Style", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/07/24/hillary-clinton-and-democrats-must-disavow-paul-begala-stalker-comments", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/cf/32/082ed22b469991a2e48ccd9e814b/140724-comstock-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "\ufeffHillary Clinton and Democrats Must Disavow Paul Begala Stalker Comments", "description": "Democrats must disavow a Clinton operative's anti-woman remark.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Clinton administration,Clinton, Bill,Clinton, Hillary,feminism,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Democrats must disavow a Clinton operative's anti-woman remark."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0107\"", "article_summary": "Too many liberal men like Begala think they can engage in a war on conservative women because nobody ever tells them it\u2019s wrong.\nWill they let him get away with calling Comstock a stalker or will they draw the line, saying finally that enough is enough?\nTheir latest target is Virginia Delegate Barbara Comstock, now the Republican nominee in the state\u2019s open 10th congressional district, whom veteran Clinton operative Paul Begala is now calling a stalker.\nReferring to her past work as a congressional staffer investigating alleged White House lawbreaking during the Clinton years, Begala said Comstock has a \u201creally almost sick, sort of stalker-like obsession with President Clinton,\u201d Politico reported Thursday.\nBegala went over the top, crossed the line and got outside the box."}
