Witt also told officers she punched the window on the passenger side of the vehicle before asking officers to give her a drink of antifreeze, the report said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, Witt continued to behave erratically and was placed under arrest for public intoxication. Officers verified that there was a hit-and-run incident in that two utility poles were struck near the saw mill.\n\n\n\nThe report said Witt continually yelled \u201cOff with your head!\u201d at the officer and told the officer that he would die in a crash which she would cause if she were not released from custody.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, Witt refused to walk into the detention center on her own and had to be escorted. Once inside she screamed she was pregnant and would not tell jail personnel what types of narcotics she had taken, the report said.\n\n\n\nOfficers attempted to take her back outside to go to the hospital, but they said Witt flopped into the floor. Officers were able to get her into a patrol car and transport her to the hospital.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, Witt screamed and yelled obscenities for several hours while in the emergency room. Her shouts could be heard throughout the emergency room area and multiple attempts were made to get Witt to calm down, with each attempt being met with louder shouts of obscenities.\n\n\n\nTest results, which were rushed in an attempt to get Witt out of the hospital, showed Witt was not pregnant and was under the influence of cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. Witt was then given medical clearance and taken back to the detention center.\n\n\n\nCopyright: gwdtoday.com", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 01 Jan 2016 08:28:13 EST", "description": "A Greenwood woman is facing an array of charges following outbursts at a local motel and hospital,\u00a0according to a Greenwood police report.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "A Greenwood woman is facing an array of charges following outbursts at a local motel and hospital,\u00a0according to a Greenwood police report.", "title": "Report: Woman asks cops for drink of antifreeze, screams 'Off with your head'", "url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/report-woman-asks-officers-for-drink-of-antifreeze-screams-off-with-your-head-during-arrest/37223234", "image": "http://www.wyff4.com/image/view/-/37223258/highRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/xjklk8z/-/Meagan-Witt-gif.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/report-woman-asks-officers-for-drink-of-antifreeze-screams-off-with-your-head-during-arrest/37223234", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wyff://content/article/37223234", "iphone": "wyff://content/article/37223234", "googleplay": "wyff://content/article/37223234"}, "name": {"ipad": "wyff", "iphone": "wyff", "googleplay": "wyff"}, "id": {"ipad": 505507641, "iphone": 505507641, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}}, "site": "@wyffnews4", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wyff://content/article/37223234", "app_name": "wyff", "package": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}, "ios": {"url": "wyff://content/article/37223234", "app_store_id": 505507641, "app_name": "wyff"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 135671321180}, "keywords": "local greenville news, breaking greenville news, live greenville alerts", "google-site-verification": "LWpc590JPr9qDk05qHGWcq1nIo4PF7VlkN6wQmjiOb8", "news_keywords": "local greenville news, breaking greenville news, live greenville alerts"}, "article_summary": "According to the report, Witt refused to walk into the detention center on her own and had to be escorted.\nAccording to the report, Witt continued to behave erratically and was placed under arrest for public intoxication.\nThe report said Witt told police she was driving a pickup truck and struck utility poles near Clendenin Lumber in Ware Shoals.\nWitt also told officers she punched the window on the passenger side of the vehicle before asking officers to give her a drink of antifreeze, the report said.\nAccording to the report, Witt screamed and yelled obscenities for several hours while in the emergency room."}
