Lukashenko has been in a very public dispute with the Kremlin over the Russia\u2019s decision to ban meat imports from Belarus.\n\nRelated: Putin Just Sent Nuclear Bombers Over the English Channel. Seriously.\n\nThe ban was put in place after Belarus was accused of re-exporting European goods to Russia. This was a problem, because the Russian government had placed an embargo on the purchase of these goods \u2013 mostly foodstuffs \u2013 in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the European Union and the U.S. after Russia invaded Crimea.\n\nLukashenko said trade battles within the EEU were unacceptable.\n\nThe Belarusian leader\u2019s remarks were delivered just a day before representatives of Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced they would meet in his capital city, Minsk, to try to restart peace talks. Rebels in Eastern Ukraine are fighting to establish an autonomous region more aligned with Russia than the capital in Kiev.\n\n(Those talks failed on Saturday, as additional reports of civilian and military deaths came out of the troubled region.)\n\nRelated: Putin Throws $2.5 Billion at \u2018Anti-Crisis\u2019 Plan\n\nThe rebels, widely believed to receive materiel and even fighters from Russia, despite the Kremlin\u2019s denials, rose up after Russia invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last spring and then declared the region had been \u201cannexed\u201d by Russia.\n\nIn recent months, multiple European countries, including former member states of the Soviet Union, have reported incidents in which the Russian military \u2013 usually military aircraft \u2013 have violated other countries\u2019 airspace. Belarus has a 600-mile, largely unguarded border with Russia.\n\nLukashenko\u2019s threat on the trade pact came as Russian officials admitted their economy is in even worse shape than they\u2019d previously acknowledged. On Saturday, the country\u2019s economic ministry said it was forecasting a 3 percent decline in gross domestic product this year. Private sector analysts have been even more pessimistic, suggesting the decline could be as much as 5 percent.\n\nLast week, the Russian Central Bank announced a surprise cut in interest rates, from 17 percent to 15 percent. The move represents a shift in stance and may have depositors experiencing a bit of whiplash. It was only mid-December when the bank hiked rates from 10 to 17 percent overnight in an effort to halt the ruble\u2019s slide against the dollar and other global benchmark currencies.\n\nThe bank appears to be trying to strike a balance between protecting the ruble and choking off credit to an economy that needs all the growth it can get.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the Russian economy shrinking and fighting continuing to rage in Ukraine, cracks have begun appearing in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union \u2013 suggesting more potential trouble down the road for the Russian economy.", "title": "Russia\u2019s Eroding Economy Risks Putin\u2019s Economic Union", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/02/Russia-s-Eroding-Economy-Risks-Putin-s-Economic-Union", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-putin_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/02/Russia-s-Eroding-Economy-Risks-Putin-s-Economic-Union", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-putin_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With the Russian economy shrinking and fighting continuing to rage in Ukraine, cracks have begun appearing in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union \u2013 suggesting more potential trouble down the road for the Russian economy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last week Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president and a cautious supporter of Moscow in the past, said his country could not rule out quitting the fledgling economic union, created at the beginning of January.\nIn recent months, multiple European countries, including former member states of the Soviet Union, have reported incidents in which the Russian military \u2013 usually military aircraft \u2013 have violated other countries\u2019 airspace.\nLukashenko has been in a very public dispute with the Kremlin over the Russia\u2019s decision to ban meat imports from Belarus.\nLukashenko\u2019s threat on the trade pact came as Russian officials admitted their economy is in even worse shape than they\u2019d previously acknowledged.\nOn Saturday, the country\u2019s economic ministry said it was forecasting a 3 percent decline in gross domestic product this year."}
