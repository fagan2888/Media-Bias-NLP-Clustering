Evacuation orders were being evaluated as firefighting officials declared the blaze \u201cin a good place,\u201d as InciWeb described it.\n\nRELATED: Colville Reservation Fire of Nearly 20,000 Acres Prompts Evacuations\n\nFirefighting personnel expected to have the blaze fully contained by Thursday August 21.\n\nProgress was made elsewhere in Washington as well, with containment of the Carlton Complex of fires, the state\u2019s largest ever, finally in sight after burning for more than a month.\n\n\u201cThe Carlton Fire is in patrol and mop up,\u201d InciWeb reported on August 18. \u201cThe 256,108-acre Carlton Fire will continue to smoke and flare in the interior.\u201d\n\nAt least 300 homes were burned and critical infrastructure was destroyed, but no lives were lost, InciWeb said. The fire scorched 400 square miles.\n\nThree people have been arrested and charged with arson for trying to set their own backburn fires and instead damaging property, endangering firefighters and exacerbating the Carlton Complex Fire. Police arrested Keith Strickland, 60, and Larry Smith, 63, for \u201clighting a fire that he set in hopes of slowing a wildfire\u2019s growth by burning off brush in its path,\u201d The Spokesman-Review reported on August 14. Instead they lost control of it, and it helped spread the fire that torched a large part of Methow Valley. In a separate incident police arrested Radley Hastings, 62, who set a fire that \u201cwent the wrong way,\u201d Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers told The Spokesman-Review, nearly trapping firefighters in a canyon.\n\n\u201cThe fire crews called law enforcement after escaping the flames,\u201d The Spokesman-Review reported.\n\nIntent didn\u2019t matter, given their lack of expertise and, in the case of Smith and Stickland, the direct disobeyment of safety orders even as firefighting crews watched.\n\n\u201cHere these guys are, lighting fire where there\u2019s no fire,\u201d Rogers told the newspaper. \u201cIf you\u2019re lighting a fire that endangers firefighters in the area, that\u2019s arson.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Devil\u2019s Elbow Complex Fire on the Colville Reservation in Washington State was at 26,428 acres on August 18, but firefighters were encouraged by a Sunday rainstorm thaColville Reservation fire, Devil's Elbow, 60 percent contained and Carlton Complex finally 95 percent contained, at 256,108 acres.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/18/weekend-rain-helps-firefighters-battling-colville-reservation-flames-carlton-fire", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/colville_rez_fire_near_san_poil_river-inciweb.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Weekend Rain Helps Firefighters Battling Colville Reservation Flames; Carlton Fire Contained"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Weekend Rain Helps Firefighters Battling Colville Reservation Flames; Carlton Fire Contained"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/18/weekend-rain-helps-firefighters-battling-colville-reservation-flames-carlton-fire", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-18T14:30-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Carlton Complex Fire, Devil's Elbow Fire, Colville Reservation, Washington State, Wildfires", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Weekend Rain Helps Firefighters Battling Colville Reservation Flames; Carlton Fire Contained"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef0b\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Colville Reservation Fire of Nearly 20,000 Acres Prompts EvacuationsFirefighting personnel expected to have the blaze fully contained by Thursday August 21.\nProgress was made elsewhere in Washington as well, with containment of the Carlton Complex of fires, the state\u2019s largest ever, finally in sight after burning for more than a month.\nThree people have been arrested and charged with arson for trying to set their own backburn fires and instead damaging property, endangering firefighters and exacerbating the Carlton Complex Fire.\nEvacuation orders were being evaluated as firefighting officials declared the blaze \u201cin a good place,\u201d as InciWeb described it.\n\u201cThe Carlton Fire is in patrol and mop up,\u201d InciWeb reported on August 18."}
