We lost our health coverage under her employer\u2019s plan, and because we are not 65, had to get insurance through MNsure.\n\nFor decades I\u2019ve heard people complain they \u201chad to keep working for health insurance.\u201d I had budgeted $950 a month to bridge the gap between retirement and Medicare. Our insurance costs $20.54 per month! Thank you Obama for being so generous with other people\u2019s money. (Dripping with sarcasm here!)\n\nWe saved for retirement and live quite comfortably. We should not be receiving $885 a month, the Advance Premium Tax Credit, from the taxpayer.\n\nOne of my objections to entitlements to individuals is the unintended consequences. Or is it unintended?\n\nAPTCs, as well as cost-sharing for deductibles and copays, are based on income only. Eligibility is not based on assets such as retirement savings. It should be!\n\nBy drawing primarily from our Roth funds, which do not count as taxable income, we have the ability to \u201cset\u201d our income low enough to qualify for free insurance, while still spending as much as we desire.\n\nCitizens should be required to spend their savings and sell their assets, with the exception of a house and car, before receiving taxpayer money.\n\nAsset testing is required for Medical Assistance (Medicaid in MN) as well as Medicare Savings Plans and many other forms of public assistance. So why not Obamacare? I can think of only one reason \u2013 it was politically important for the Affordable Care Act to be successful as measured by maximum participation.\n\nSo why are we taking the money? Four reasons: 1) to make a point, 2) to give more to charity, 3) to recoup some of the excessive taxation by Minnesota liberals, and 4) so my wife and I can afford first class on our monthly air travel.\n\nAgain, thank you Obama!\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2016/05/24/asset-test-part-aca/84864732/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Asset test should be part of ACA", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Asset test should be part of ACA", "title": "Asset test should be part of ACA", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2016/05/24/asset-test-part-aca/84864732/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Asset test should be part of ACA", "title": "Asset test should be part of ACA", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/17/StCloud/B9322191704Z.1_20160517114312_000_G1TEDD71J.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac68\"", "article_summary": "Eligibility is not based on assets such as retirement savings.\nAsset testing is required for Medical Assistance (Medicaid in MN) as well as Medicare Savings Plans and many other forms of public assistance.\nWe lost our health coverage under her employer\u2019s plan, and because we are not 65, had to get insurance through MNsure.\nCitizens should be required to spend their savings and sell their assets, with the exception of a house and car, before receiving taxpayer money.\nWe should not be receiving $885 a month, the Advance Premium Tax Credit, from the taxpayer."}
