The utility is still enforcing \u201cDo not flush\u201d zones for neighborhoods from U.S. 36 south to Kiowa Trail and Little Valley on the southeast side of town, as well as some areas along Fall River.\n\nThe city of Estes Park said Saturday there is no timeline yet for the repairs to be completed and restrictions to be lifted.\n\nThe Left Hand Water District, which serves customers in rural Boulder and Weld counties, lifted its boil-water advisory Thursday for all but a few homes.\n\nMandatory water limits, however, continue. Residents cannot run sprinklers or wash vehicles or driveways, and they cannot refill ponds or swimming pools.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clean water, working toilets continue to be Colorado flood issues", "title": "Clean water, working toilets continue to be Colorado flood issues", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/21/clean-water-working-toilets-continue-to-be-colorado-flood-issues/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130919__Mobile_home_park_evansp1.jpg", "height": 376}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130919__Mobile_home_park_evansp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-21T12:03:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T10:09:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ccf\"", "article_summary": "In Estes Park, Boy Scouts are going door to door to hand out information about issues facing the Upper Thompson Sanitation District.\nThe Left Hand Water District, which serves customers in rural Boulder and Weld counties, lifted its boil-water advisory Thursday for all but a few homes.\nClean water continues to be an issue for flooded Front Range and northeast Colorado communities.\nTreatment plants in Boulder, Longmont, Loveland, the St. Vrain Sanitation District, Sterling and the Denver Metro Reclamation District were operating Saturday, but repairs to broken pipelines are ongoing, according to the utilities.\nResidents cannot run sprinklers or wash vehicles or driveways, and they cannot refill ponds or swimming pools."}
