The other, though, knows what he wants, knows exactly who he has to please to get it and doesn\u2019t care who he annoys while he\u2019s going about it.\n\nIn Colorado on Friday, Ted Cruz showed Trump why it is that at the end of the day, the first kid winds up as a minor character in a Bruce Springsteen song while the other buys a mansion in the Caribbean that he rents out to Springsteen six months a year.\n\nWhile Trump was on Twitter alternately discussing NATO and Jennifer Hudson, Cruz had his people on the ground in Colorado harvesting delegates that the Trump team had made little effort to secure. Because of its strange primary system, Colorado awards its congressional district-level delegates to the Republican nominating convention at district conventions and its at-large delegates at a state convention, which will take place tomorrow.\n\nAs of late Friday afternoon, the Cruz team had engineered the selection of their candidate\u2019s supporters as delegates in all 15 of the delegate slots available in the state\u2019s congressional districts where the contest had been decided. Trump, by contrast, appeared not to have won so much as an alternate delegate.\n\nRelated: The Cruz Campaign Signaled Its Strategy for New York\n\nTrump this week made a great production of hiring a high profile delegate-wrangler in Paul Manafort, but it\u2019s hard to avoid the suspicion that this is the equivalent of doing his homework on the bus. The Cruz team has, from day one, laid the groundwork for this sort of delegate-by-delegate battle, and not only does he have people in place in key primary states, but those people know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nManafort, whose years of experience no doubt raise the political IQ of Team Trump dramatically, is still starting in an organizational hole that will be tough to dig out of.\n\nAgain, Colorado provides another example. Tomorrow, the statewide convention will select another 13 delegates. Ted Cruz will be in Colorado Springs personally to make his case. Trump, by comparison, has nothing on his schedule.\n\nWith his huge lead in delegates, Trump is still overwhelmingly likely to make it to the convention in Cleveland with a lead over Cruz, but his chance for a first-ballot majority appears to be slipping away. And if the convention goes to multiple ballots, where delegates are freed to vote however they please, it\u2019s hard to see a scenario in which Trump is able to out-organize Cruz, because it pays to do your homework.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As of late Friday afternoon, the Cruz team had engineered the selection of their candidate\u2019s supporters as delegates in all 15 of the delegate slots available in the state\u2019s Congressional districts where the contest had been decided.
