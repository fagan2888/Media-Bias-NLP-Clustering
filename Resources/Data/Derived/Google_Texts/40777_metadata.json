We didn't know if he'd be around for one or two years, or if it'd be five years, but now we're going on 19 year career and it's been really amazing. He's done really well,\" Vinatieri's sister Christine Erickson said.\n\nErickson is Vinatieri's only sister and is a Sioux Falls City Council member.\n\nVinatieri's career has been nothing short of amazing. In his 19th season Vinatieri has missed only one field goal all season and on Sunday he surpassed the legendary Jerry Rice; playing in more playoff games of any NFL player.\n\n\"It's been exciting to watch that and just kind of see how he embraces that. He's very modest. He's very humble and at the ended of the day he still does his job like he needs to do his job,\" Erickson said.\n\nVinatieri is now 42-year-old and the oldest player in the NFL. It's a career that started at Rapid City Central. Kim Nelson - who now coaches at Sioux Falls Roosevelt - was his high school coach.\n\n\"I think the key for him is he never stopped believing in himself,\" Nelson said.\n\nVinatieri wasn't drafted by an NFL team out of South Dakota State but continued to work toward his goal of being a professional kicker and has never looked back.\n\n\"He just decided I'm good enough to kick there and I'm going to do it and he found a way to get it done. So, I think it's a great example of believing in yourself and sticking with it and good things happen,\" Nelson said.\n\nVinatieri played ten years with the Patriots and won three Super Bowls before signing with his current team, the Indianapolis Colts, where he's won one Super Bowl. The South Dakota native has won more Super Bowls than any kicker, kicked more playoff field goals than any other kicker, and scored more points in the playoffs than any other player.\n\nErickson says it\u2019s more than her family could have imagined when his career began in 1996.\n\n\"For him to be so blessed and fortunate to be on good teams, to make it to Pro Bowls, and Super Bowls, and playoff championship games because there are a lot of players that don't make it to Super Bowls or don't make it to the playoffs. So, to have that and to watch that has been fun to walk alongside him,\" Erickson said.\n\nBut after nearly 20 years in the NFL the question is how long can he keep it up?\n\n\"That's kind of the golden question is how much longer does he have and as his kids get older, and he wants to coach them in football and soccer, and be dad and be home with them more often,\u201d Erickson said.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now he's healthy, he's doing well, and if the contracts keep being renewed, and he's feeling well and playing well I think you can continue to see him a few more years,\" Erickson said.\n\nA South Dakota native who keeps on kickin'.\n\nFeatured Stories\n\nEye on KELOLAND {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
