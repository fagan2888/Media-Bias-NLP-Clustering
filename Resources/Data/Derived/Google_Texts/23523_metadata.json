And while hosting an hour-long show that runs four nights a week is already a significant challenge, Meyers inherits the show from former \u201cSNL\u201d colleague Jimmy Fallon, who turned \u201cLate Night\u201d into a variety show and viral video hit machine.\n\nNew York Times national media reporter and bestselling author Bill Carter, who has covered the turbulent past of late night television in \u201cThe Late Shift,\u201d and \u201cThe War for Late Night,\u201d told Salon over the phone that Fallon will be \u201ca tough act to follow.\u201d Fallon, who has had a gangbusters week at \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d closed \u201cLate Night\u201d with a finale that pulled in the show\u2019s biggest audience in more than 10 years.\n\nBut Carter is quick to put the shift in perspective. \u201cI thought Conan [O\u2019Brien] felt like it would be almost impossible to follow [David] Letterman, and Fallon thought it would be almost impossible to follow Conan,\u201d Carter recalled. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of a strange run of history but you know the guys who leave, leave behind big popular shows and Seth is well aware of that.\u201d\n\nMeyers will have to brand the show as his own, but talking to Salon over the phone, the host was hesitant to provide too many details as to how he will do that. \u201cIt just feels so strange to talk about comedy before you do it,\u201d he said.\n\nWe do know, however, that he\u2019ll be leaning heavily on his \u201cSNL\u201d experience. His former cast mates won\u2019t be too far from his new office, which remains in NBC\u2019s 30 Rockefeller Center. Former \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Fred Armisen will lead the 8G Band, and, from time to time, the show will call back to Meyers\u2019 \u201cWeekend Update\u201d days with fake guest interviews. (Bill Hader\u2019s iconic Stefon, for example, is likely to be a guest.)\n\nThough he is not looking to reinvent late night television, the 12-year \u201cSNL\u201d veteran does hope to take some risks with the show. \u201cThe nice thing about having a nightly show at 12:30,\u201d he explained, \u201cis the previous hosts have all shown that it\u2019s a piece of real estate where you can try to be as creative as possible and take some risks that you probably can\u2019t take in prime time, and to some degree maybe can\u2019t take at 11:30.\u201d\n\nCrucial to maintaining this philosophy will be the show\u2019s writing staff, many of whom are also performers. Meyers said that his \u201cbiggest takeaway\u201d from \u201cSNL,\u201d where he was a sketch performer in 2001 before he transitioned to the writing staff in 2005, was that \u201cI enjoyed being out onstage with someone else and it was often helpful if that person was funnier than me.\u201d For \u201cLate Night,\u201d he said, \u201cI tried to hire as many people as I could find that were funnier than me.\u201d\n\nAnother unique aspect of \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d is that it boasts a diverse staff, reportedly the first network late night talk show to hire a black female writer. The consideration is, at least from the public\u2019s perspective, in line with \u201cSNL\u201d executive producer Lorne Michaels\u2019 recent push to bring black women to the show in 2014.\n\nFor his part, though, Meyers stated that he didn\u2019t specifically look for diversity in his staff \u2014 it just sort of happened. \u201cI have to say the field of applicants for these jobs is becoming more diverse, I\u2019ve just noticed in my 12 and a half years of doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, you know we have diversity in our new writing staff, but it wasn\u2019t because we went out and looked for it. It was just because some of the many funny people we saw, it was a very diverse field.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest challenge for Meyers, whose screen time has been largely limited to monologue-type jokes on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d for the past eight years, will be interviews. \u201cThe interview part of the show is the thing I have the least experience with, and I feel like it\u2019s a skill you have to learn by doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just looking forward to starting doing it because I feel like I\u2019ll make a lot of mistakes along the way but I can\u2019t make them until we start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I tried to hire as many people as I could find that were funnier than me,\" Meyers told Salon of his new staff", "title": "The Salon interview: How Seth Meyers got ready for \u201cLate Night\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"I tried to hire as many people as I could find that were funnier than me,\" Meyers told Salon of his new staff", "title": "The Salon interview: How Seth Meyers got ready for \u201cLate Night\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/22/how_seth_meyers_got_ready_for_late_night/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/seth_meyers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I tried to hire as many people as I could find that were funnier than me,\" Meyers told Salon of his new staff", "title": "The Salon interview: How Seth Meyers got ready for \u201cLate Night\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/seth_meyers.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comedy, Editor's Picks, Jimmy Fallon, late night television, late night with seth meyers, Lorne Michaels, Seth Meyers, SNL", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae1b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Comedy, Editor's Picks, Jimmy Fallon, late night television, late night with seth meyers, Lorne Michaels, Seth Meyers, SNL, Entertainment NewsOn Feb. 24, former \u201cSNL\u201d head writer and \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Seth Meyers will become the fourth man to host one of the most prominent mainstays of late night television.\nThough he is not looking to reinvent late night television, the 12-year \u201cSNL\u201d veteran does hope to take some risks with the show.\n\u201cCertainly, you know we have diversity in our new writing staff, but it wasn\u2019t because we went out and looked for it.\nNew York Times national media reporter and bestselling author Bill Carter, who has covered the turbulent past of late night television in \u201cThe Late Shift,\u201d and \u201cThe War for Late Night,\u201d told Salon over the phone that Fallon will be \u201ca tough act to follow.\u201d Fallon, who has had a gangbusters week at \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d closed \u201cLate Night\u201d with a finale that pulled in the show\u2019s biggest audience in more than 10 years.\nFormer \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Fred Armisen will lead the 8G Band, and, from time to time, the show will call back to Meyers\u2019 \u201cWeekend Update\u201d days with fake guest interviews."}
