Following regulations: Med device entrepreneurs must leap a higher hurdle

Special report: Fall 2013

Like other startups, medical device entrepreneurs need to demonstrate a market for their products or services.



Then there's another obstacle to clear before most investors will write a check: reimbursement.



As health care reform and hospital consolidation change the industry landscape, investors are increasingly looking for proof that new product will be reimbursable through Medicare and insurers. That takes more research, data and time.



"You may have physicians all day long tell you they love your device," but with purchasing groups and regulators all around, "you've got constituents well beyond the actual provider of service," said Mark Olesnavage, managing director at Hopen Life Sciences Ventures LLC, a venture capital firm in Grand Rapids.



Purchasing groups wield a lot of power now, whereas 20 years ago all a surgeon had to do was say a product was needed and it would be ordered, said Chris Williams, president of Grand Rapids contract manufacturer Medbio Inc.



"Just because you provide a better outcome anymore doesn't guarantee a product is going to get in if it's more expensive," he said. "Twenty years ago, you could pretty much charge the moon for it."



Meanwhile, U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval is more difficult to obtain than it used to be as worries about overly speedy approvals come to bear. At the same time, the health care industry at large is looking to reduce the use of unnecessary, expensive tests.



It's little wonder that investors aren't as trigger-happy for medical device companies as they were 10 years ago.
