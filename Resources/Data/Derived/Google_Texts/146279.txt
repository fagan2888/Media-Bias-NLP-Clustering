Fox’s Lauren Ashburn: MSNBC ‘doesn’t care that they’re blurring the lines’ between journalism and activism

A panel on Fox News “MediaBuzz” discussed the media coverage of the protests in Ferguson, Mo. Sunday and came to one major conclusion — journalists are playing activists instead of news reporters.

“It’s been very disappointing to watch straight journalists taking sides as I think we’ve seen in a lot of the cases,” panelist and Fox News contributor Lauren Ashburn said.

She said most of the people on the scene have not worked in local news and do not know the “art of covering police.”

Ashburn said MSNBC is the worst offender, particularly “arm of the government” Al Sharpton, who has hosted anti-police rallies in Missouri and worked with the Obama administration on this topic.

“The lines in journalism right now almost don’t exist,” Ashburn said. “Very rarely can you find straight news reporting. It’s either infotainment or activism. In this case, I just think MSNBC doesn’t care that they’re blurring the lines.”
