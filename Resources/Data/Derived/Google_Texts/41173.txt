SAO PAULO (AP) — Netflix has let out some of the prisoners in its signature series “Orange is the New Black” to party and dance in Brazil at one of the world’s largest gay pride parades.

Three actresses who play lesbian inmates in the show and at least two other actors of the new series “Sense8″ celebrated the LGBT community on Sunday atop a giant red-carpeted Netflix float surrounded by exuberant fans in Sao Paulo.

Actress Samira Wiley wore a hat sideways with the words “I love girls,” while she waved to the crowds alongside Natasha Lyonne and Uzo Aduba, other stars in the show.

Organizers say the parade is mostly a day of celebration but also serves as a reminder of the discrimination lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people still face.
