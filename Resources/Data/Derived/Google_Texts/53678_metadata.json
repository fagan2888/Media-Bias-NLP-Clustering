But hasn't this engagement been going on for some years now? Glenn Greenwald's politics have long been a subject of debate among liberals. Haven't Julian Assange's politics also been up for debate, particularly among feminists? I guess Edward Snowden's politics haven't been as closely examined, but that only leads to deeper critique\u2014Edward Snowden is significant because of what he told us about the NSA, not because he's Paul Wellstone reincarnated.\n\nIn short, I think we know quite well what \"the leakers\" are thinking, but we're much more interested in what the NSA is doing. I know Wilentz is a prominent and celebrated historian, this piece just reads like elongated ad hominem. If Edward Snowden was a white supremacist, I would still be concerned about NSA officers spying on their exes, and James Clapper lying to the Senate.\n\nSee Henry Farrell's thorough response for more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How much does it really matter what Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Assange believe about politics?", "author": "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "How much does it really matter what Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Assange believe about politics?", "title": "Sean Wilentz Tries to Change the Subject", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/RTX12C6G/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/sean-wilentz-tries-to-change-the-subject/283323/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc445\"", "article_summary": "I know Wilentz is a prominent and celebrated historian, this piece just reads like elongated ad hominem.\nI think it's worth knowing the politics that animate \"the leakers,\" as Wilentz dubs them, and engaging them.\nUeslei Marcelino/ReutersEminent Princeton historian Sean Wilentz has published a piece titled, \"Would You Feel Differently About Snowden, Greenwald, and Assange If You Knew What They Really Thought?\"\nIn short, I think we know quite well what \"the leakers\" are thinking, but we're much more interested in what the NSA is doing.\nGlenn Greenwald's politics have long been a subject of debate among liberals."}
