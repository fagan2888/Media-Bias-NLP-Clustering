Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has done his best to stay neutral in the intra-Republican war over whether to shut down the government in order to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Although he acknowledged in August that the plan wouldn’t actually work, he told The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent that he did not mean to take sides in the dispute.

That’s not exactly leader-like behavior, but perhaps he calculated that, politically, his best bet was to stay quiet.

Turns out he bet wrong. The Senate Conservatives Fund, a Tea Party affiliated group, has launched a $340,000 ad campaign against Mr. McConnell that characterizes him as a weak leader. Of course from the Tea Party perspective, leadership doesn’t involve speaking out against an ill-conceived scheme that’s bound to fail—it means backing that scheme.



“Obamacare starts in October but Congress can stop its funding,” the ad states. “What’s Mitch McConnell doing? Nothing. McConnell is the Senate Republican leader, but he refuses to lead on defunding Obamacare. What good is a leader like that?”

The ad, which is airing in Mr. McConnell’s home state of Kentucky starting today through Sept. 17, makes no mention of the fact that “defunding Obamacare” would involve opposing any continuing resolution that funds the law—i.e. shutting down the entire government. Perhaps that’s because the Senate Conservatives Fund realizes that this niggling detail would put off moderate viewers.
