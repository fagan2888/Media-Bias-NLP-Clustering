Caleb Jones, R-Columbia, the legislature may need to approve a new type of healthcare facility known as a transitional care facility (TCF), a burgeoning type of health care center separate from independent senior living communities, assisted living facilities (ALF) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF).\n\nThe development of TCFs currently mirrors the same way ALFs emerged in the 1990s. ALFs were a middle ground between living independently in a senior facility or neighborhood and confining oneself to a nursing home for more intensive care.\n\n\u201cIt started out with basically independent living and skilled nursing facilities, and over time they realized that even people as they get older, they don\u2019t need to be in a 24-hour care nursing home,\u201d Jones says.\n\nThese ALFs provided certain amenities helpful for senior citizens, such as cooked meals, regulated prescriptions, and some nursing services among others, while not restricting independence as much as a traditional nursing home.\n\nNow, a new niche has popped up in the market to fill in a new gap, according to Jones.\n\n\u201cElderly people who are still in physically good shape have to get surgery to replace knees, hips, elbows, shoulders, back injuries, and their recovery takes longer than a younger person,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSo this is creating a boutique cottage industry. Now, we have something completely different\u2026 The step between the hospital and wherever you\u2019re going to end up is transitional care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever assisted living statutes came in to create this industry, we are now seeing a discussion and a realization that we need to do statutes for the [TCFs],\u201d he says.\n\nJones says that TCFs have cropped up as a reconciliation of two truths in healthcare; that senior citizens have longer recovery rates after surgery and take up valuable bed space in a hospital and hospitals are trying to increase their turnover as quickly as possible to see more patients to provide more care and make more money. TCFs, such as the Landmark Hospital Transitional Recovery Centers in Columbia and Joplin, offer more attentive care for longer periods of time (the average stay at Landmark Columbia is 21 days) than traditional hospitals.\n\nThe reason for the burgeoning market has to do with a provision in the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, that penalizes hospitals if they \u201cexcessively\u201d readmit Medicare patients after 30 days for certain conditions by docking Medicare reimbursements paid to the hospital. It incentivizes hospitals to ensure quality care, but it makes it difficult for high turnaround, especially with older patients.\n\n\u201cBy having a facility like a transitional hospital or transitional treatment facility they\u2019re able to properly recover with the same intensive monitoring,\u201d Jones says.\n\nUnfortunately for the CON, TCFs are currently designated as SNFs instead of reflecting their unique status on the healthcare spectrum. This distinction matters a great deal because of main quantifier the committee looks at for facilities they certify: bed needs. If TCFs fall under the SNF category, they will be judged the same way by the committee for the number of beds they provide when the two types of facilities serve vastly different purposes.\n\nThe committee will next meet in approximately two months time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2013 The attendees of a Certificate of Need (CON) meeting discussed a new development in the healthcare industry Monday, one that could affect how senior citizens recover from surgical care.
