The Democrats favor tax hikes on high earners, and the Republicans favor tax cuts all around. But with voters currently struggling with tax-return filing, all the candidates should be addressing the tax code\u2019s appalling complexity.\n\nDonald Trump did complain that his tax return \u201cwould literally probably be 10 feet high if I put them together, it is so complicated and so terrible.\u201d Most people have smaller returns, but federal tax-code compliance overall consumes more than 6 billion hours of time each year, which is like having a \u201ctax army\u201d of 3 million people just filling out tax returns year-round.\n\nThe problem is getting worse. Federal tax rules span about 75,000 pages today, which is three times more than when President Jimmy Carter called the code \u201ca disgrace to the human race.\u201d The problem is that Congress micromanages us with ever more tax credits, deductions and exemptions for education, energy, health care, saving, working and other activities.\n\nThe latest layer of complexity was added by the Affordable Care Act, which manipulates our health choices through the tax system. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, you calculate how much you get penalized. If you do have individual insurance, you calculate the tax credits you receive. If you get advance credits during the year, then you recalculate your benefits when you file. And so on.\n\nYou can try to figure all this out by looking at the IRS\u2019s 24-page Affordable Care Act overview, its 19-page guide for penalties and its 71-page guide for credits. Or you can go to a tax practitioner who is familiar with the thousands of pages of related regulations.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has become a tax-filing nightmare, but so have other parts of the code, such as the earned income tax credit. The IRS guide for the earned income tax credit is 37 pages long, and the rules are so complicated that the credit\u2019s error rate is 27%, according to the IRS. That amounts to $18 billion of mistakes every year for just for this one credit.\n\nThese days, most people get their returns done by tax-preparation firms, but that doesn\u2019t solve the complexity problem\u2014indeed, the pros make many errors as well. A 2014 investigation by the Government Accountability Office of 19 paid tax preparers found that most of them calculated incorrect refund amounts on sample returns. Furthermore, expert tax preparation costs money\u2014last year the average charge for 1040 return prep was $273.\n\nIn addition to the monetary costs, the tax code\u2019s complexity:\n\n1. Increases avoidance and evasion. The earned income tax credit\u2019s complexity has spawned an industry of fraudulent return filing, which costs billions of dollars a year. There is a similar problem with large corporations. We have the highest-rate and most complex corporate tax code in the world, which has created a breeding ground for widespread tax avoidance.\n\n2. Undermines financial planning. For families, the tax code complicates decisions about retirement savings, paying for education and other life events. For businesses, the tax effects of hiring workers, investing in capital equipment, and other decisions are constantly changing as new laws and regulations are imposed. The IRS Taxpayer Advocate counted 4,428 federal tax rule changes over a 10-year period.\n\n3. Creates \u201chorizontal inequity.\u201d People with similar incomes pay different amounts of tax because of all the special breaks. Homeowners, for example, can have a tax advantage of thousands of dollars a year over renters. Such inequities violate the principle of equality under the law.\n\nThankfully, some presidential candidates are promising to simplify the tax code. It will be a challenge because members of Congress love to add narrow breaks. The number of \u201ctax expenditures,\u201d or official breaks, under the income tax increased from 125 in the 1990s to about 200 today, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Each break has separate tax forms, instructions, regulations and other paperwork.\n\nThe best solution would be to rip out the individual income tax and replace it with a flat tax that has no deductions or credits. That would vastly simplify financial planning, reduce tax avoidance and boost the economy. Both taxpayers and the government would win as administrative costs plunged.\n\nNo president has pulled off a major tax overhaul since Ronald Reagan in 1986. But the next president will have an ace in his hole, and that is the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan is committed to tax restructuring, and he proposed major reforms in his past position on the House Budget Committee.\n\nReagan kicked off his drive for tax reform with an impassioned speech to the nation in May 1985: \u201cWe must\u2026transform a system that\u2019s become an endless source of confusion and resentment into one that is clear, simple, and fair for all\u2014a tax code that no longer runs roughshod over Main Street America but ensures your families and firms incentives and rewards for hard work and risk-taking in an American future of strong economic growth.\u201d\n\nAmericans should press the presidential candidates to commit to a Reagan-style drive for tax reform in 2017. But for this year\u2019s returns, we\u2019re still stuck with a complex disgrace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'The best solution would be to rip out the individual income tax and replace it with a flat tax that has no deductions or credits'", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "'The best solution would be to rip out the individual income tax'", "title": "Our Complex Tax Code Is Crippling America", "url": "http://time.com/4286921/complex-tax-code/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/tax-forms.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/tax-forms.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "'The best solution would be to rip out the individual income tax'", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Our Complex Tax Code Is Crippling America"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "law, politics, taxes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "tax code, income tax, april 15, flat tax, individual income tax, tax policy, taxes, tax, tax return, irs, taxes 2016, deductions, credits, affordable care act, obamacare"}, "article_summary": "We have the highest-rate and most complex corporate tax code in the world, which has created a breeding ground for widespread tax avoidance.\nFor families, the tax code complicates decisions about retirement savings, paying for education and other life events.\nThe number of \u201ctax expenditures,\u201d or official breaks, under the income tax increased from 125 in the 1990s to about 200 today, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nIf you do have individual insurance, you calculate the tax credits you receive.\nThe best solution would be to rip out the individual income tax and replace it with a flat tax that has no deductions or credits."}
