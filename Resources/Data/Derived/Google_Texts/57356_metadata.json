Likewise, a late-night checkpoint can mark the spot where experience has shown patrolmen they\u2019re likeliest to catch a drunken driver behind the wheel.\n\nTHP\u2019s top brass, however, admit that while the agency\u2019s chief mission is to save lives, much of their work historically has been a matter of reacting to tragedies rather than anticipating the worst before it happens.\n\nNow, in effort to make a major reduction in highway deaths without adding manpower, the highway patrol has turned to sophisticated data mining, the same sort that optimizes Internet advertising, to make near-pinpoint predictions about crashes to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to work smarter,\u201d said Col. Tracy Trott, head of the THP. \u201cWe have really made a conscious decision to not just be responding to people\u2019s tragedy. We\u2019ve got to become a more data-driven department.\u201d\n\nTHP has begun tailoring its day-to-day patrol routes across the state with the use of predictive analytic computer software. The program, deemed Crash Reduction Analyzing Statistical History, or CRASH, considers myriad variables beyond traffic volumes and crash statistics, incorporating other external factors such as weather forecasts, scheduled special events and even licensed liquor retailer locations.\n\n\u201cAnything we can input that gives it more data,\u201d Trott said. \u201cSo far that model has been effective and accurate in over 70 percent of its predictions. It\u2019s the wave of the future.\u201d\n\nThe results are presented as a percentage of probability that a serious or fatal crash will occur within a specific 5-by-6-mile area during a four-hour window.\n\nThe software, purchased from IBM with a $243,000 federal grant secured by the Governor\u2019s Highway Safety Office, was tested over a six-month trial period in Jackson, Nashville and Cookeville earlier this year.\n\nCRASH went into use statewide June 30, and the early results have proved promising.\n\nPromising Results\n\nDuring this year\u2019s Labor Day holiday weekend \u2014 traditionally, one of the busiest travel times of the year \u2014 10 traffic fatalities among 10 crashes were reported in Tennessee, according to THP. That\u2019s down from 15 fatal crashes that resulted in 16 deaths statewide during the same period in 2013.\n\nTrott expects the program to be become more effective as the agency continues to refine its use of the software.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface,\u201d he said.\n\nAs cutting-edge as the technology may appear, predictive analytics actually is based on the same principles as programs long used in the private sector to predict retail shopping preferences, to calculate risks for insurance companies and even to build weather forecasting models.\n\n\u201cPredictive analytics is an evolution of statistical modeling \u2014 it just adds that extra dimension,\u201d said Mike Reade, public safety consultant with IBM. \u201cThe beauty of it, though, is the options are wide open to consider these what-ifs.\u201d\n\nAnd its use is becoming increasingly common among police agencies.\n\nIn other\n\ndepartments\n\nThe Memphis Police Department was an early adopter of the IBM software in 2006, using the technology to forecast the likeliest times and locations for serious and violent crime. The result was a 36 percent reduction in homicides and robberies over six years and a 55 percent drop in car thefts, according to the Commercial Appeal.\n\nIn a similar approach, the Miami-Dade County Police Department began using the technology in robbery investigations to identify probable suspects among known criminal offenders.\n\nThe THP, though, may be the first police agency to adapt the software to traffic enforcement, Reade said.\n\nTrott says CRASH is the highway patrol\u2019s latest strategy in a larger, concerted effort to focus enforcement on those factors that most often contribute to traffic-related deaths \u2014 impaired driving, speeding, seat belt violations and, increasingly, distracted driving.\n\n\u201cWe decided we wanted to concentrate on those things that kill people,\u201d the colonel said.\n\nSince 2011, THP has made a 160 percent increase in DUI arrests, and issued 240 percent more seat belt citations, he noted.\n\nIn turn, Trott said Tennessee has recorded three of its four lowest annual fatality rates in that same time.\n\nAccording to Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security preliminary figures, 995 people were killed in vehicular crashes in 2013. Traffic fatalities totaled 1,014 in 2012, and 937 roadway deaths were recorded statewide in 2011.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not by accident,\u201d Trott said. \u201cWe\u2019re on a record-setting pace this year.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers\n\nAs of Monday, Sept. 15, 666 traffic-related deaths have been recorded statewide so far this year, versus 718 fatalities during the same time frame in 2013 \u2014 an approximately 7 percent reduction.\n\nThat includes 34 traffic deaths reported in Knox County this year, compared with 42 at this point in 2013, according to state figures.\n\nNo clear trends were apparent in a review of Knox County traffic deaths reported among all investigating law enforcement agencies since 2009. The majority of those local fatalities occurred on Interstate 40, totaling 28 deaths within a five-year span, according to reports compiled by the state.\n\nIn District 7 \u2014 which encompasses Maury, Bedford, Giles, Hickman, Lawrence, Lewis, Lincoln, Marshall, Moore, Perry and Wayne counties \u2014 a total of 46 fatalities have been reported so far in 2014, down 11 from 2013. So far this year, Giles, Lewis, Moore, Perry and Wayne counties have already exceeded the number of fatal crashes reported in 2013.\n\nA total of 11 fatalities have been reported this year in Maury County, down three from last year.\n\n\u201cPredictive analytics is not the silver bullet, but it\u2019s part of the answer,\u201d Trott said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly better off with (CRASH) this year than we were last year without it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper with any experience on the road already knows where the worst traffic crashes are likely to occur.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "HAYES HICKMAN The Knoxville News-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "A Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper with any experience on the road already knows where the worst traffic crashes are likely to occur.", "title": "THP program aims to end fatal crashes", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/state/thp-program-aims-end-fatal-crashes", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_THPcrashes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/state/thp-program-aims-end-fatal-crashes", "title": "THP program aims to end fatal crashes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=984548", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=984548", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "State,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-21T23:30:15-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e4e\"", "article_summary": "So far this year, Giles, Lewis, Moore, Perry and Wayne counties have already exceeded the number of fatal crashes reported in 2013.\nA Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper with any experience on the road already knows where the worst traffic crashes are likely to occur.\nNo clear trends were apparent in a review of Knox County traffic deaths reported among all investigating law enforcement agencies since 2009.\nThat includes 34 traffic deaths reported in Knox County this year, compared with 42 at this point in 2013, according to state figures.\nThat\u2019s down from 15 fatal crashes that resulted in 16 deaths statewide during the same period in 2013."}
