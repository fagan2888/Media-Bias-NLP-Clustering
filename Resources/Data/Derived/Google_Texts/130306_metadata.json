Amy Klobuchar (DFL-Minn.), who filed the complaint along with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), said in a statement. \u201cIt is imperative that the Administration investigate any possible anti-competitive behavior by the oil companies that might limit consumers\u2019 access to renewable fuels.\u201d\n\nAllegations of market manipulation\n\nThe Renewable Fuel Act, created through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, instituted a program mandating that 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel (ethanol) be blended into gasoline by 2012.\n\nFor the oil industry, the inclusion of ethanol in fuel supplies meant its market share for its product was threatened.\n\nIn 2011, 13.9 billion gallons of ethanol produced meant 485 million fewer barrels of oil needed to be imported, according to Iowa Corn, a trade group representing Iowa\u2019s ethanol industry.\n\nGasoline stations typically have two tanks. To produce the E15 gasoline blend, which includes 15 percent ethanol and is designed to fuel E15-friendly vehicles, the station must designate one tank for ethanol only. Blender pumps are used to mix the ethanol and gasoline, producing E10, which can be used in most vehicles, and the E15 special blend.\n\nThe allegations claim oil companies have been pressuring independent stations to allow both pumps be used for gasoline, eliminating room for ethanol and adding more room for high-priced premium gasoline.\n\nThis, according to Sens. Klobuchar and Grassley, amounts to anticompetitive practices by oil companies that work against the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, created to level the playing field and allow domestic clean and renewable fuel.\n\nIn a letter sent to Attorney General Eric Holder and Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, the senators called for an investigation into the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe promise of renewable fuels is rapidly becoming a reality and introducing much needed competition to the transportation fuels sector,\u201d the letter states. \u201cGiven the implication these alleged activities, if true, could have on competition in the marketplace, we urge you to investigate them and consider whether any action is necessary.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers\u2019 call for justice is one applauded by those in the ethanol industry and those who own independent gas stations. Ron Lamberty, senior vice president of American Coalition for Ethanol, is also a gas station owner \u2014 for him, the stakes of the allegations are high.\n\n\u201cAs a fuel station owner, every time I hear some Big Oil mouthpiece saying we should \u2018let the market decide\u2019 how much ethanol is used, I think of these kinds of restrictions the oil companies have been jamming down station owners\u2019 throats for decades, making sure only one decision is possible \u2014 oil,\u201d he told Ethanol Producer. \u201cSenators Grassley and Klobuchar are right.\u201d\n\nIf the allegations prove true, the oil companies would be responsible for altering the market to lock out clean energy alternatives, ethanol in particular.\n\nOil companies rally against ethanol\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that oil companies have long opposed EISA, which was intended to allow for fair market introduction of cleaner fuels with the ultimate aim of reducing costs for consumers. The oil industry has never rallied behind EISA.\n\n\u201cFaced with growing competition from new sources of fuel promoted by the (renewable fuel standard), the oil industry has publicly\n\nIn July, the American Petroleum Institute launched an advertising campaign spanning print, TV radio and online platforms with the message that the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard is bad news for consumers.\n\nThe advertising campaign depicted the mandate as one that leads to higher food prices, low mileage and engine damage \u2014 a claim that\u2019s already advertised at the pump for those opting for E15, the higher ethanol-content fuel intended for ethanol-friendly cars only.\n\nLarge oil companies also have refining companies on their side, who say they have seen their share of the market dwindle after the introduction of ethanol.\n\nMeeting muscle with muscle, the clean energy industry vowed in August to fight back against the pro-oil campaign blitz, with plans underway to launch a multimillion campaign that will take on the oil industry\u2019s claims point-by-point.\n\nIt\u2019s called the \u201cYou\u2019re No Dummy\u201d campaign, already set up online with sections pointing out \u201cthe lies\u201d of the oil industry.\n\n\u201cIf the oil industry was concerned about your food prices they would lower the prices of fuel because a recent World Bank study showed that high fuel prices are the cause of higher food prices,\u201d the campaign site states. \u201cIn actuality, the ethanol industry only uses the starch in the corn kernel to produce ethanol and the valuable proteins and micronutrients are returned back to the food chain. So the net effect is that the U.S. ethanol industry uses 17.5 percent of the net U.S. corn crop for ethanol production.\u201d\n\nThis is in direct contrast to the American Petroleum Institute campaign, which states the ethanol industry uses up 40 percent of America\u2019s corn crops \u2014 a move they say is leading to higher food prices.\n\nThe campaign is also calling out the oil industry\u2019s expenditures \u2014 and tax breaks. In 2012, more than $140 million was spent by the oil industry in lobbying efforts alone. Shell spent just shy of $16 million, followed by Exxon at just over $12 million.\n\nWith every $1 contributed to the lobbying pool, the top oil companies received $30 in tax breaks, according to the campaign.\n\nIn 2011, subsidies for the oil industry rose to $7 billion. In 2012, British Petroleum received task breaks worth $300 million, according to figures provided through profit reports and the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has taken up the suggestions by Klobuchar and Grassley to move forward with an investigation, yet the consequences, if oil companies are found guilty, aren\u2019t yet clear.\n\nFor the senators, it\u2019s a matter of protecting an industry that flourishes within their states, while constituents are looking to their lead as they struggle against an oil industry that has long controlled the game. Ramirez did not follow through with calls for a full investigation, but told the senators in a letter that the Federal Trade Commission will make every effort to persecute those violating competition rules.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see the Federal Trade Commission is taking steps to investigate whether certain practices by oil companies may be impeding competition, and I will continue to work to ensure that Americans can continue to realize the benefits of cheaper, cleaner renewable fuel,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nKlobuchar comes from Minnesota, a key ethanol producer. Al-Corn, an ethanol cooperative, puts the amount of ethanol produced in the state at 862 million gallons. The number of ethanol plants sits at 21, with more than 1.1 billion gallons of production capacity in 2010. The state\u2019s net ethanol export is roughly 619 million gallons, with 243 million gallons consumed by Minnesota drivers.\n\nGrassley\u2019s state of Iowa ranks sixth in ethanol production, producing nearly 30 percent of the nation\u2019s ethanol supplies. According to Iowa Corn, the industry supports more than 50,000 jobs and accounts for more than 5.4 percent of the state\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThe allegations from retailers about possible anti competitive practices from Big Oil are disheartening, but not surprising, knowing the lengths Big Oil will go to in order to keep biofuels out of the fuel supply,\u201d Grassley said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take an \u2018all-of-the-above\u2019 approach to wean the United States off of foreign sources of oil, so it only makes sense that we all work together. I appreciate the FTC \u2026 taking a look at the allegations and look forward to their conclusion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators demand feds investigate allegations that gas station owners are being strong-armed by oil companies., Amy Klobuchar, Chuck Grassley, ethanol, Federal Trade Commission, gasoline, Iowa, Minnesota, Oil, renewable energy,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Trisha Marczak", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Senators demand feds investigate allegations that gas station owners are being strong-armed by oil companies., Amy Klobuchar, Chuck Grassley, ethanol, Federal Trade Commission, gasoline, Iowa, Minnesota, Oil, renewable energy,", "title": "Ethanol Proponents Accuse Oil Industry Of Forcing Out The Competition", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/ethanol-proponents-accuse-oil-industry-of-forcing-out-the-competition/169016/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Higher-Gas-Prices_Webf-690x453.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-14T10:25:12-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senators demand feds investigate allegations that gas station owners are being strong-armed by oil companies., Amy Klobuchar, Chuck Grassley, ethanol, Federal Trade Commission, gasoline, Iowa, Minnesota, Oil, renewable energy,", "creator": "@TrishaMarczakMP", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Higher-Gas-Prices_Webf.jpg", "title": "Ethanol Proponents Accuse Oil Industry Of Forcing Out The Competition", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "renewable energy", "published_time": "2013-09-14T05:00:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-14T10:25:12-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcde\"", "article_summary": "Ethanol Proponents Accuse Oil Industry Of Forcing Out The CompetitionSenators demand feds investigate allegations that gas station owners are being strong-armed by oil companies.\nOil companies rally against ethanolIt\u2019s no secret that oil companies have long opposed EISA, which was intended to allow for fair market introduction of cleaner fuels with the ultimate aim of reducing costs for consumers.\nFor the oil industry, the inclusion of ethanol in fuel supplies meant its market share for its product was threatened.\n\u201cIn actuality, the ethanol industry only uses the starch in the corn kernel to produce ethanol and the valuable proteins and micronutrients are returned back to the food chain.\nIn 2011, 13.9 billion gallons of ethanol produced meant 485 million fewer barrels of oil needed to be imported, according to Iowa Corn, a trade group representing Iowa\u2019s ethanol industry."}
