It was essentially a robot art critic, tweeting jumbles from Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto published in 1909.\n\nEven though it was just a vehicle of critique, Smith said it's why he thinks the robots are great cultural engagement pieces.\n\n\"So the idea of sending a robot on an adventure became an interesting one,\" he added.\n\nHitchbot's 'family' never knew who Hitchbot ended up with or which route would be taken, but Smith said they were never concerned about its safety.\n\n\"People have been making sure to take very good care of it like leaving it in nice places,\" he said.\n\nHitchbot was made of a bucket with pool noodles for limbs. It can send out progress reports, Tweets and uses GPS tracking.\n\nSmith said that it is a good example of maker culture \u2014 a movement where people can create multimedia objects out of repurposed technology.\n\n\"What's ironic and beautiful at the same time is that Hitchbot is a robot, but it's engendering people and meeting new people so its becoming a social facilitator in a way.\"\n\nHitchbot may be hours or a few days away from its destination in Victoria, B.C.\n\nSmith said that the team plans to throw Hitchbot a party when his adventure ends.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "There\u2019s a little bit of Waterloo Region in the famous hitchhiking robot that has crashed a wedding, attended powwows...", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
