They also must report their travel plans, in or out of the state.\n\n\u201cIn the event a traveler does not report in, state or local public health officials will take immediate steps to locate the individual to ensure that active monitoring continues on a daily basis,\u201d the CDC said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama phones Texas hospital workers at center of Ebola outbreak\n\nThe fight to contain the virus in the U.S. got some good news late Wednesday: The family of a Texas nurse who flew to Ohio and was diagnosed with Ebola said doctors no longer detect the virus in her body.\n\nA family statement said officials at Emory University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention couldn\u2019t detect Ebola in Amber Vinson as of Tuesday evening. The statement said Ms. Vinson\u2019s mother spoke to her Wednesday and the nurse has been approved for transfer from isolation.\n\nSix states that take in 70 percent of affected travelers \u2014 New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia \u2014 have laid the groundwork for enhanced monitoring and will start Monday. The remaining states will roll out their programs in the ensuing days.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ebola-country travelers to be funneled to five airports\n\nOne day earlier, the Homeland Security Department said travelers from West Africa must funnel into the U.S. through five international airports equipped to screen passengers for Ebola \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s Newark Liberty, New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy, Virginia\u2019s Dulles, Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare.\n\nTravelers will receive a CARE (Check and Report Ebola) kit at the airport to help them follow the new monitoring guidelines.\n\nThe White House characterized the move as a federal-state partnership that allows states to tailor their Ebola-tracking programs to their needs.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama remains opposed to a flat travel ban among passengers from countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, saying it could force travelers underground and hinder efforts to track people at-risk for Ebola.\n\n\u201cHe is not philosophically opposed to a travel ban, but it is his view, based on the guidance that he\u2019s received from medical experts and other scientists, that putting in place a travel ban only exposes the American people to more vulnerability at this point,\u201d Mr. Earnest told reporters.\n\nSome lawmakers said half-measures are not good enough.\n\n\u201cGiven the seriousness of this situation, the United States should temporarily enact a visa ban on nationals from Ebola-affected countries,\u201d Sen. Dan Coats, Indiana Republican, said. \u201cEnsuring that citizens from these countries cannot enter the United States is a common-sense step to contain this virus and protect American citizens.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s move coincided with Ron Klain\u2019s first day as the nation\u2019s \u201cEbola czar\u201d to beef up the U.S. response to the viral disease, which has killed more than 4,000 in West Africa and a Liberian man who traveled to Texas in late September.\n\nThomas Eric Duncan tested positive for Ebola in late September and died Oct. 8. Two Dallas nurses who treated him have contracted the virus and are being treated at specially equipped treatment centers.\n\nMr. Obama, who met with Mr. Klain in the afternoon, said he had spoken Wednesday with colleagues of the nurses, 26-year-old Nina Pham and 29-year-old Ms. Vinson, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. He reported their \u201cspirits were good.\u201d\n\nWhile he is cautiously optimistic any ripple effect of infection from Duncan has ebbed, he said he remained concerned about the rampant outbreak in West Africa.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People traveling to the U.S. from West African countries reeling from the Ebola epidemic will be monitored for symptoms for three weeks after their arrival, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "People traveling to the U.S. from West African countries reeling from the Ebola epidemic will be monitored for symptoms for three weeks after their arrival, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.", "title": "CDC: Travelers from West Africa to U.S. will be monitored for 21 days for Ebola", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/22/cdc-travelers-west-africa-us-will-be-monitored-21-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/22/28971b466b662f29630f6a706700d222.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/22/28971b466b662f29630f6a706700d222.jpg", "title": "CDC: Travelers from West Africa to U.S. will be monitored for 21 days", "description": "People traveling to the U.S. from West African countries reeling from the Ebola epidemic will be monitored for symptoms for three weeks after their arrival, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Vinson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1c0\"", "article_summary": "Travelers will receive a CARE (Check and Report Ebola) kit at the airport to help them follow the new monitoring guidelines.\n\u201cHe is not philosophically opposed to a travel ban, but it is his view, based on the guidance that he\u2019s received from medical experts and other scientists, that putting in place a travel ban only exposes the American people to more vulnerability at this point,\u201d Mr.\nDirector Dr. Tom Frieden said travelers must take their temperature and report the measurements or any Ebola-like symptoms to state and local health officials.\nThey also must report their travel plans, in or out of the state.\nTwo Dallas nurses who treated him have contracted the virus and are being treated at specially equipped treatment centers."}
