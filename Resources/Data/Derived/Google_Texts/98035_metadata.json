Organizers hope it will help hundreds of uninsured and underserved people while also sending a message to Missouri and Kansas lawmakers.\n\nMore than five years ago, the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics held a massive free clinic at the Kansas City Convention Center. Twenty-four hundred people received medical and dental care over two days. The clinic is coming back to the convention center for one day, Saturday, April 18th.\n\n\"We found it's just too difficult to do during the week when the providers that we need to volunteer are working in their own offices, so we're doing it on a Saturday,\" said Sheri Wood.\n\nWood heads Kansas City CARE Clinic which is the local organizer. She says the need wasn't eliminated with the Affordable Care Act. Missouri and Kansas haven't expanded Medicaid which means tens of thousands are in the so-called coverage gap. The free clinic is being held near the end of the legislative sessions.\n\n\"Because we want to also allow the legislators to come and talk to people if they would like to, and for us to keep the need of the uninsured up on the forefront,\" said Wood.\n\nThat's even though Medicaid expansion in either state appears unlikely again this session. Opponents say they're concerned about long-term costs to the states and about expanding a program that is already stressed.\n\nWood says even with good safety net clinics for the uninsured and underinsured in the metro, there's still a need for a one-day event.\n\n\"We know there's many, many people that still don't come in for care and they'll come to a free one-day clinic,\" said Wood.\n\nShe says hundreds of medical professionals and other volunteers are needed.

Walk-ins will also be welcome on April 18th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "KANSAS CITY,\u00a0Mo. -- A huge, free one-day health clinic is coming to Kansas City next month.
