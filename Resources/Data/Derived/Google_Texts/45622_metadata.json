Americans are realizing that they better buckle down when it comes to saving for unexpected expenses such as medical costs. \u201cPeople understand healthcare costs are rising,\u201d said Lauren Brouhard, senior vice president, at Fidelity Investments during an interview with FOXBusiness.com.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFidelity Investment\u2019s Annual Study, now in its seventh year, reports that 62% cite \u201cunexpected expenses\u201d as the top concern going into 2016. \u201cHealthcare costs in retirement\u201d are right behind at 47%. On average, a couple aged 65 retiring this year, can expect to pay an estimated $245,000 on healthcare throughout retirement, up from $220,000 during the prior year, according to Fidelity\u2019s Retirement Health Care Cost Estimate. As a result, 41% will now make saving for retiree healthcare costs a long-term goal.\n\nThose concerns may be on the rise. Earlier this month United Healthcare (UNH) CEO Stephen Hemsley, who oversees the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, said the company may exit Obamacare by 2017. During an investor presentation, he said participating in the program\u2019s health exchanges was \u201ca bad decision.\u201d His comments have put the future of Obamacare, also formerly known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), in question.\n\nIt\u2019s not just health care worrying Americans, the stock market volatility that rocked investors in late August, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered an intra-day dip of 1,000+ points, also snapped many folks out of complacency. \u201cAny level of uncertainty, it can cause some paralysis for some people,\u201d said Brouhard who notes 37% now plan to make financial resolutions next year, compared to 31% in 2015. Fidelity oversees $5.2 trillion in total customer assets.\n\nSource: Fidelity Investments\u2019 New Year Financial Resolutions Study, 2015\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a result, their financial resolutions for 2016 will include saving more, spending less and paying down debt, according to the survey. The resolution to specifically tackle credit card debt hit an all-time high, more than doubling from the year-ago period.\n\nConsumer credit, which measures most debt excluding mortgages, rose 5.5% or $16 billion in October according to data published on Monday by the Federal Reserve. That is slightly below September\u2019s reading which reflected a 9.9% jump.\n\nFor some, the pullback is a sign consumers may already be reigning in their spending.", "article_metadata":
