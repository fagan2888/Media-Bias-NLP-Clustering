An estimated 15,000 other workers at Cablevision are nonunion, the company says.Cablevision cheered the ruling \u2014 which is not the final step in the NLRB\u2019s process \u2014 but also said the charges have been a way to distract workers from taking a vote on recertify their representation by CWA.\u201cObviously, we are gratified that the CWA\u2019s baseless charges that blocked an employee vote have been rejected by an NLRB judge, but unfortunately this does not clear the way for Cablevision employees in Brooklyn to vote for or against the CWA. Instead, the CWA and the NLRB have continued to use baseless charges simply designed to prevent Cablevision employees from voting,\u201d the company said in a release on Friday.\u201cIn light of the decision, we call on the NLRB and the CWA to finally cease their efforts to block the vote that Brooklyn employees have twice petitioned for the right to hold,\u201d the release says.\n\nCharges were first leveled last year by the regional NLRB office, which said the company was negotiating in bad faith and unlawfully dismissed 22 union supporters. They were later reinstated after political pressure on the company, but many were not given back pay.\n\n\n\nMore recent claims by the labor board against Cablevision said that Dolan, also an owner of the New York Knicks, illegally offered workers bonuses for opposing unionization.\n\nThe employees have twice petitioned to hold a vote whether to decertify the union, but the NLRB has said a vote would be unfair, since the company is being faced with so many violations.\n\n\n\nCWA also lauded the NLRB judge\u2019s ruling on Friday, vowing to press on against the company\u2019s alleged continued violations.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe long-awaited decision is a major boost to the Brooklyn Cablevision workers' campaign for a fair and just contract,\u201d the union said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cFinally the NLRB has spoken in an unprecedented 300 page decision that outlines the deliberate law breaking of James Dolan. In any other jurisdiction he would face arrest,\u201d said Larry Cohen, the president of the Communications Workers of America, in a statement. \u201cSince the trial Jim Dolan and Cablevision have escalated their attacks on their employees and their union. The NLRB needs to take immediate action.\u201d\n\nThe administrative law judge\u2019s decision now heads to the NLRB\u2019s five-member board in Washington. After that, it could head to a federal appellate court.\n\n\n\nCablevision dismissed CWA\u2019s charges against it, and the ruling of the \u201clesser findings\u201d in the judge\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with several lesser findings that have no impact on a prospective Brooklyn employee vote, and we look forward to being vindicated as the NLRB and court process continues,\u201d the company said in its statement.\n\nCablevision spokeswoman Lisa Anselmo also fired back against the allegations in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cThe allegations against the CEO are false and will ultimately be rejected, but only in the CWA\u2019s twisted world would a union attack Cablevision for giving employees wage increases in the Bronx and other locations,\u201d she said.\n\nThis post was updated at 8:16 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "But the ruling included no finding that the firm negotiated in bad faith.", "description": "But the ruling included no finding that the firm negotiated in bad faith.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
