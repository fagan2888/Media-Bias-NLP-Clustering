The duo begins discussing their stressful weeks as Obama takes a sip of beer from a bottle. Putin, to the contrary, swigs straight vodka.\n\n\u201cLook, don\u2019t you see what you\u2019re doing, though? You\u2019re forcing people to accept something that the majority of them don\u2019t even want,\u201d Obama tells Putin of his country\u2019s attempt to take power over Crimea.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the faux-Putin responds. \u201cIn Russia, we have word for this. Obamacare. Does Obamacare cover burns?\u201d\n\nThe world leaders continue discussing Russia\u2019s takeover of the disputed peninsula \u2014 after busting out a rendition of \u201cInsane in the Membrane\u201d as \u201cMcCain in the Ukraine\u201d \u2014 and Obama tells Putin to let his desire to take control of Ukraine go.\n\nOf course, the presidents sing a foreign policy-laced version of \u201cLet It Go\u201d from the Disney film \u201cFrozen.\u201d\n\nFallon then takes a jab at President Obama\u2019s failed leadership over the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\u201cVlad, Vlad, just to recap our call, no progress was made here, right?\u201d faux Obama asks.\n\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d responds Putin.\n\nWhen Fallon first took the helm of late-night\u2019s signature show, many criticized him for going soft on the Obama administration. During his first week of hosting, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum was joined by fellow funnyman Will Ferrell and First Lady Michelle Obama to promote her \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFallon has been known to go easy on Democrats while slamming Republicans.\n\nWatch \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d skit below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "\"Tonight Show\" host and funnyman Jimmy Fallon sent a message Wednesday night that his show isn't a playground for liberal bullies to stomp on Republicans, as Fallon took several jabs at President Barack Obama for his signature healthcare law and wimpy foreign policy.", "title": "Fallon zings Obama on Obamacare, Ukraine - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/03/Obama-Putin-600x329.jpg", "height": 329}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/20/watch-fallon-zings-obama-on-obamacare-ukraine/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "will-ferrell", "published_time": "2014-03-20T12:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T23:08:43+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1549\"", "article_summary": "The duo begins discussing their stressful weeks as Obama takes a sip of beer from a bottle.\nDoes Obamacare cover burns?\u201dThe world leaders continue discussing Russia\u2019s takeover of the disputed peninsula \u2014 after busting out a rendition of \u201cInsane in the Membrane\u201d as \u201cMcCain in the Ukraine\u201d \u2014 and Obama tells Putin to let his desire to take control of Ukraine go.\nThe comedic assault begins with Obama placing a call in to Putin to discuss the increasing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\nWhen Fallon first took the helm of late-night\u2019s signature show, many criticized him for going soft on the Obama administration.\nYou\u2019re forcing people to accept something that the majority of them don\u2019t even want,\u201d Obama tells Putin of his country\u2019s attempt to take power over Crimea."}
