However, a new report from the Drug Policy Alliance found that such measures haven\u2019t stopped law enforcement agencies from using federal forfeiture laws to circumvent state policies.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance, an organization focused on drug policy reforms, examined the cities that lead California in seizures per capita. The cities\u2014Baldwin Park, Beverly Hills, Gardena, Irwindale, La Verne, Pomona, South Gate, Vernon and West Covina\u2014are all located around Los Angeles County and collected more than $43 million in revenue from forfeitures between 2006 and 2013.\n\n\u201cWe use federal forfeiture,\u201d Baldwin Park Police Capt. David Reynoso told the Drug Policy Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s just more beneficial to us.\u201d\n\nBaldwin Park, with a population of 75,390, collected $4.9 million in federal forfeiture revenue from 2006 to 2013 and participated in 565 seizures from 2008 to 2013.\n\nThe city of Irwindale, meanwhile, saw $802,800 in revenue from the Justice Department\u2019s forfeiture program and has a population of 1,422.\n\nAccording to the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s findings, law enforcement agencies in the California cities studied used revenue from civil asset forfeiture to pay for overtime, communications and computers, and to purchase and maintain vehicles. However, the money was also used to pay informants.\n\nThe La Verne Police Department alone spent $1 million of revenue gained from federal asset forfeiture on informants over the last three years, according to public records.\n\n\u201cPolice cars and communications equipment may indeed be legitimate law enforcement expenditures, but those purchases should be justified to elected representatives just the same as every other government agency,\u201d Jason Snead, research associate at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement should not be a self-financing enterprise,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat, of course, means that it is incumbent on governments to adequately fund their law enforcement agencies. And if agencies truly need larger budgets, the appropriate means for raising that revenue is taxes or offsets, not forfeiture.\u201d\n\nIn examining data gathered through Freedom of Information Act requests and forfeiture reports at the state and federal level, the Drug Policy Alliance identified instances of Los Angeles County police departments budgeting for future forfeiture revenue, which is prohibited by the federal government.\n\n>>> Advocates Tell Congress: Reform Civil Asset Forfeiture Now\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s report focused on police departments participating in the Department of Justice\u2019s Equitable Sharing Program, which allows local law enforcement agencies to team up with federal agencies to seize property under federal law. Under the program, local police departments receive a portion of the proceeds from seizures while the federal government keeps the rest.\n\nIn some instances, police departments keep up to 80 percent of assets\u2019 worth, making the program more attractive in states with stringent state forfeiture laws. At the state level, law enforcement agencies see a 50 percent return on forfeiture.\n\n\u201cEquitable sharing certainly offers law enforcement the means to circumvent state laws which might make it harder to conduct forfeitures, or restrict how forfeiture funds are spent,\u201d Snead said.\n\nHe went on to point out how states with strict forfeiture laws receive \u201chigher payouts\u201d through the Equitable Sharing Program than those with looser forfeiture laws.\n\n\u201cThis certainly suggests that some law enforcement agencies are turning to the federal program to get around their state laws,\u201d Snead said.\n\nAccording to state and federal forfeiture reports, California law enforcement agencies have increasingly relied on federal forfeiture revenue. Since 2002, money collected under state forfeiture has remained around $18.3 million. However, federal forfeiture revenue collected by California police departments has grown from $36 million in 2002 to roughly $100 million in 2013.\n\nSnead noted that nationwide, more than $433 million was distributed to state and local law enforcement agencies through the Department of Justice\u2019s Equitable Sharing Program last year.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture is a decades-old tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize property if it\u2019s suspected of being related to a crime.\n\nThough the procedure started with good intentions\u2014as a way to curb money laundering and drug trafficking\u2014a trend of law enforcement agencies seizing property and money for profit has developed.\n\nThe issue has created an alliance in organizations such as The Heritage Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, which argue the practice stacks the deck against innocent property owners refuting forfeitures. The groups also believe civil asset forfeiture is counter to criminal justice system\u2019s presumption of innocence and creates perverse incentives for law enforcement, as often the proceeds from seized property benefit police departments and prosecutors\u2019 offices.\n\nTo eliminate abuses of civil asset forfeiture by law enforcement, the ACLU joined 23 groups calling on Congress to enact federal forfeiture reforms. In a letter to top lawmakers with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees sent earlier this month, the groups called on policymakers to end the Equitable Sharing Program, restore the Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and direct forfeiture proceeds to the Department of Treasury\u2019s general fund.\n\n\u201cProperty rights and due process are fundamental American principles,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cCongress has an enormous opportunity to address civil forfeiture abuses that undermine property rights, due process and economic freedom.\u201d\n\n>>> Civil Asset Forfeiture: Good Intentions Gone Awry and the Need for Reform", "article_metadata": {"description": "In cities clustered in Los Angeles County people are seeing their property and money seized by law enforcement, and it\u2019s making police departments millions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In cities clustered in Los Angeles County people are seeing their property and money seized by law enforcement, and it\u2019s making police departments millions.", "title": "CA Cities Making Millions Seizing Property, Money", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150427_ForfeitureReport_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-28T21:09:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Jyjnsi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In cities clustered in Los Angeles County people are seeing their property and money seized by law enforcement, and it\u2019s making police departments millions.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150427_ForfeitureReport_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "CA Cities Making Millions Seizing Property, Money", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-04-28T15:30:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T21:09:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "civil asset forfeiture, Drug Policy Alliance, Los Angeles County, Department of Justice, Equitable Sharing Program, American Civil Liberties Union, David Reynoso, Beverly Hills, Irwindale"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf930\"", "article_summary": "Though the procedure started with good intentions\u2014as a way to curb money laundering and drug trafficking\u2014a trend of law enforcement agencies seizing property and money for profit has developed.\n\u201cCongress has an enormous opportunity to address civil forfeiture abuses that undermine property rights, due process and economic freedom.\u201d>>> Civil Asset Forfeiture: Good Intentions Gone Awry and the Need for Reform\nIn a small number of cities clustered in Los Angeles County, Calif., people are seeing their property and money seized by law enforcement through civil asset forfeiture, and it\u2019s making police departments tens of millions of dollars.\nAccording to state and federal forfeiture reports, California law enforcement agencies have increasingly relied on federal forfeiture revenue.\nCalifornia has safeguards in place to protect innocent people from the harmful practices of civil asset forfeiture."}
