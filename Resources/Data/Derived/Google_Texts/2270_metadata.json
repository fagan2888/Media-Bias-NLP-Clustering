We don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones. Please don\u2019t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\u201d\n\nSwift previously removed her albums from Spotify in a dispute over compensation for streaming music. She explained her decision about Apple in a Tumblr blog post on Sunday morning, several days after her music label confirmed that \u201c1989\u201d wouldn\u2019t be available on the service at launch.\n\nThe blog post, \u201cTo Apple, Love Taylor,\u201d was immediately shared tens of thousands of times, showing the power of the artist\u2019s megaphone and potentially creating a publicity nightmare for Apple.\n\nApple announced its Apple Music streaming service earlier this month. The free trial period is seen as a crucial part of the company\u2019s strategy to attract paying subscribers.\n\nThe company had no immediate comment on Swift\u2019s blog post, but an Apple executive previously told Re/code that Apple\u2019s payments for songs \u201care a few percentage points higher than the industry standard, in part to account for the lengthy trial period; most paid subscription services offer a free one-month trial.\u201d\n\nIn the blog post, Swift expressed her love for Apple and said she wasn\u2019t speaking up for herself, but rather for \u201cthe new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success.\u201d\n\nSwift said she\u2019s been discussing the Apple policy with others: \u201cThese are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taylor Swift is withholding her album \"1989\" from Apple's streaming service because she says the company is unfairly withholding royalties from artists.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX40", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Taylor Swift is withholding her album \u201c1989\u201d from Apple\u2019s streaming service because she says the company is unfairly withholding royalties from artists.
