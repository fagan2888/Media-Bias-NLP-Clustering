It's Mitt Romney like you've never seen him before.

Netflix has released an intriguing new trailer for its documentary on two-time presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's. The film is slated to debut on Jan. 24.

The company boasts "an intimate, rarely seen, behind-the-scenes look at a candidate running for the presidency."

The two-minute teaser shows Romney and his family huddled together on election night as it becomes apparent that he's likely to loose to President Obama.

"I just can't believe you're going to lose," says Craig Romney, the youngest of Romney's five sons.

"Yeah, yup," Mitt Romney replies matter-of-factly.

Later he jokes, "By the way, does someone have a number for the president?"

"Hadn't thought about that," he adds with a chuckle.

The film is directed and produced by Greg Whiteley, who followed Romney's presidential ambitions from 2006 and his first failed run for the Republican nomination, to his concession speech in 2012.
