Yet he was also a hero and an honored veteran. The contradictions of Segu\u00edn\u2019s life illustrate how complicated loyalty was during the struggle for Texas independence\u2014especially for Tejano citizens of the Republic.\n\nSegu\u00edn was born in San Antonio in 1806. As a young man, he formed a militia of Texians to resist President Santa Anna\u2019s oppressive rule. Segu\u00edn was a dedicated and able soldier, and he joined fellow Texians at the Alamo. He escaped death only because Colonel William Travis sent him out of the fort to seek reinforcements.\n\nAfter the war, Segu\u00edn served in the Texas Senate and as mayor of San Antonio, but his unwavering defense of Tejano rights earned him political enemies. Segu\u00edn also had business dealings in Mexico that aroused suspicion, and he was labeled a traitor. Fearing for his safety, he fled to Mexico in 1842.\n\nSanta Anna remembered Segu\u00edn\u2019s role in the Texas revolution and as punishment, compelled him to join the Mexican army during the U.S.-Mexico War. Segu\u00edn was finally able to return to Texas in 1848.\n\nAfter his death in 1890, Segu\u00edn was buried in the town that bears his name. A statue was erected as a tribute, showing belated respect for a founding father who once said, Texas treated me like \u201ca foreigner in my native land.\u201d\n\nSources:\n\nDe la Teja, Jes\u00fas F. \u201cSEGU\u00cdN, JUAN NEPOMUCENO.\u201d Handbook of Texas Online. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/SS/fse8.html\n\nDe la Teja, Jes\u00fas F., ed.
