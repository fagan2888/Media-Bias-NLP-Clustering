In fact, on average, a healthy 30 year old male nonsmoker will see his lowest cost insurance option increase 260 percent,\u201d reads AAF\u2019s report.\n\nA healthy 30-year-old would see his health insurance costs rise in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nPre-Obamacare premiums average about $62 per month, according to AAF, while post-Obamacare premiums average about $187 per month \u2014 a 202 percent difference. The average change between 2013 and 2014 low-cost premiums is 260 percent.\n\nPremium increases vary by state. The biggest increase is in Vermont, where young people will face a $332, or 600 percent, increase in insurance costs. Young people in Massachusetts, on the other hand, will only see premiums go up by nearly $20, or 9 percent.\n\nAAF notes that Massachusetts is an outlier because it has been under an Obamacare-like system since 2006 and has already experienced premium spikes to pay the highest premiums before the new federal health law.\n\nYoungsters in other states won\u2019t get hit as hard as Vermonters, but still will see huge premium increases. South Carolinians will see premiums spike by 227 percent and Californians will pay 247 percent more for low-cost health plans.\n\n\u201cVermont, Georgia, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Wisconsin. Vermont, Wyoming, Mississippi, Alaska, and Indiana all experience the highest actual dollar amount changes between 2013 and 2014,\u201d AAF reports.\n\nThese cost increases raise questions about whether even the individual mandate will be able to keep younger workers in the health insurance market.\n\n\u201cAlthough an inexact science, the numbers clearly illustrate a problem for the Affordable Care Act, the individual mandate, and the exchange system,\u201d AAF concludes. \u201cPremiums for those required to subsidize the system have risen too much and the mechanisms meant to defray those costs and encourage people to participate in the system are too weak. As such, a significant portion of the uninsured \u2018young invincible\u2019 population will purposefully choose to remain without coverage. Should this be the case, the American insurance market will experience widespread premium spiral.\u201d\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
