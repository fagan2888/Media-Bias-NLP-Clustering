AUSTIN – Attorney General Greg Abbott’s campaign for governor acknowledged that the federal health care reform law “will surely not be on Vice President Biden’s agenda” as he visits the Port of Houston, but it nevertheless prompted the Republican to release a web video on the topic.

The campaign also used the Biden visit to (once again) seek to tie Sen. Wendy Davis to the Obama administration as she runs for governor, and to slam her position on health care.

Here’s the statement from Abbott campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch:

“As one of Sen. Wendy Davis’ biggest fans travels to Texas today, one topic that will surely not be on Vice President Biden’s agenda is ObamaCare. While Texans have expressed their strong desire to keep ObamaCare out of Texas, Sen. Davis has not been shy in her attempts to expand this disastrous law in the Lone Star State. In the most recent legislative session, Sen. Davis co-authored and voted for a series of amendments designed to impose ObamaCare, and even more offensive to Texans, she co-authored a measure to tap the Rainy Day Fund to expand ObamaCare. Simply put, a vote for Sen. Davis will be a vote to expand ObamaCare in Texas.”

Davis is among senators who sought to find a way to lure billions of dollars available under the federal law for health care for Texas’ needy, uninsured population. She and other Democrats supported expanding Medicaid. A number of top GOP lawmakers also sought to find a way to get the money to insure Texans, although the Republicans didn’t want to do it through Medicaid expansion.
