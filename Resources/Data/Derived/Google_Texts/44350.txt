Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., a pro-gun lawmaker who won his Democratic primary despite the $150,000 that Michael Bloomberg tossed in the race to defeat him, said the former New York City mayor “made a huge miscalculation.”

“He didn’t understand the political climate on the ground here in Milwaukee County,” Sheriff Clarke said, during a “Fox & Friends” interview about his victory in the face of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns co-creator who tried to unseat him. “I have a lot of support for my position on support for the Second Amendment, for people to be able to defend themselves and the pro-gun movement.”

Sheriff Clarke, who rose to national prominence when he advised local residents to arms themselves because of police budget cuts, also took shots at others he described in the Journal Sentinel as “soft on crime” who wanted nothing more than to see him lose.

“People in this city decided they wanted me to lead the office on public safety and not the city fathers,” he said, characterizing County Executive Chris Abele and Mayor Tom Barrett — who didn’t fully support his bid for re-election — as “soft on crime,” the Journal Sentinel reported.

Sheriff Clarke defeated Milwaukee police Lt. Chris Moews in Tuesday’s primary, with a 52 percent to 48 percent margin.

Mr. Bloomberg, on a crusade to curb Second Amendment freedoms, bought more than $150,000 in broadcast ads to try and beat Sheriff Clarke. Citizens for Responsible Government and Citizens for Urban Justice spent $70,000 total for the same reason, the Journal Sentinel reported.
