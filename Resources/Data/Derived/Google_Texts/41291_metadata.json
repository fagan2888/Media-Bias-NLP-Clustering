A farm house with outbuildings is nestled on the northwest corner of Hover and what is now Clover Basin Drive, where Chili's now sits.\n\nStudying the photo, a longtime resident might be amazed at how much this city has changed since the mall opened. But it has been a generation since Twin Peaks Mall opened \u2014 a few weeks shy of 29 years \u2014 and the world today is as different from 1985 as 1985 was from the mid-1950s.\n\nNeighborhoods now spill west and south of the mall, and shopping centers line the roads across from Twin Peaks. As much as mall traffic has waned in recent years, shoppers have flocked to those other stores, several of which \u2014 anecdotally \u2014 are among the best performing in the state for sales. Even J.C. Penney, one of the original mall anchors, moved across the street.\n\nAs a generation has passed, and as tastes and habits have changed, Twin Peaks mall has slowly gone dark and quiet.\n\nIt wasn't always like that.\n\nFor years, Twin Peaks was the center of activity in Longmont, hosting concerts, art displays, fashion shows, baseball card shows and blood drives \u2014 that is, in addition to being packed with shoppers. As the aerial photo and other archive photos illustrate, hundreds of people could be found at the mall on any given day, drawn by more than 70 retailers, fountains, the food court, and even a carousel. During busy shopping seasons, thousands filled the massive structure.\n\nOne might conclude that the neighboring shopping centers can thank Twin Peaks for their success. For decades, the mall was the draw along South Hover Street. It helped move Longmont south and west. It delivered the sales tax dollars that helped build a vibrant city.\n\nToday, after the last afternoon showing at the mall theater, Twin Peaks Mall's doors will close for the last time. In less than two weeks, machines will begin tearing down the walls that were erected more than 29 years ago.\n\nLongmont, take one last look at your mall, because it's about to give way to another generation.\n\nAnd be thankful for those who more than 30 years ago had the vision to build it, and to those who for years have kept it operating.\n\nGoodbye, Twin Peaks Mall.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/editorial/ci_26181508/goodbye-twin-peaks-mall-and-thank-you", "modificationDate": "2014-07-20T08:02:31-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCEDI~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2024-07-19T19:16:17-0600", "description": "An aerial photo of Twin Peaks Mall taken in 1987 reveals where the edge of town was when the mall  had opened two years earlier.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26181508:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-20T07:51:50-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/editorial/ci_26181508/goodbye-twin-peaks-mall-and-thank-you", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCEDI~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An aerial photo of Twin Peaks Mall taken in 1987 reveals where the edge of town was when the mall  had opened two years earlier.", "title": "Goodbye, Twin Peaks Mall; and thank you"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "An aerial photo of Twin Peaks Mall taken in 1987 reveals where the edge of town was when the mall  had opened two years earlier.", "title": "Goodbye, Twin Peaks Mall; and thank you", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/editorial/ci_26181508/goodbye-twin-peaks-mall-and-thank-you", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCEDI~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-20T07:51:50-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.title": "Goodbye, Twin Peaks Mall; and thank you", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Editorials", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCEDI~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-07-20T07:54:35-0600", "news_keywords": "opinion editorial editorials letters editor Longmont Times Call"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc876\"", "article_summary": "Goodbye, Twin Peaks Mall.\nAn aerial photo of Twin Peaks Mall taken in 1987 reveals where the edge of town was when the mall had opened two years earlier.\nAs a generation has passed, and as tastes and habits have changed, Twin Peaks mall has slowly gone dark and quiet.\nToday, after the last afternoon showing at the mall theater, Twin Peaks Mall's doors will close for the last time.\nNeighborhoods now spill west and south of the mall, and shopping centers line the roads across from Twin Peaks."}
