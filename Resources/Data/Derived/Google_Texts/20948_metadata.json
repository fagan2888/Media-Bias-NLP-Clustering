Bush. He will not come close to the 635 vetoes that President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued during his 12 years in office or the 414 by President Grover Cleveland during his first term. But Mr. Obama might match the 37 by President Bill Clinton or the 44 by the first President George Bush.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe statistics reflect how rare the veto has become in the modern presidency. Although the veto was once an accepted step in back-and-forth negotiations between presidents and lawmakers, historians say the increased partisanship and gridlock on Capitol Hill have made it more of a last-ditch measure.\n\nSome lawmakers say partisanship could in fact hold down Mr. Obama\u2019s veto count by preventing Republican-sponsored legislation from reaching the president\u2019s desk in the first place. Republicans hold 54 seats in the Senate, and most legislation requires 60 votes to avoid a filibuster that would block passage. That means the Democratic minority led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada can still stop Republican efforts to pass legislation if Senate Democrats hold together.\n\nAs an example, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, noted that Senate Democrats were holding up Republican efforts to pass a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security because it includes provisions that would undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. That has so far spared the president from having to veto the Republican legislation.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve seen so far, Democrats in the Senate are for the most part wanting to protect him on his priorities,\u201d Mr. Portman said.\n\nJosh Earnest, the president\u2019s press secretary, said presidents must always be mindful of the fact that Congress can override a president\u2019s veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. An overridden veto is an indication of weakness that presidents try to avoid, which gives Mr. Obama\u2019s Democratic allies in the Senate another incentive to block legislation before it gets to him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, members of both parties are bracing for a future in which Republicans muscle through legislation that the president will reject. Lawmakers in both parties have proposed legislation to add sanctions against Iran, despite warnings by Mr. Obama that such a move could harm nuclear negotiations. Senators have already drafted a bill to eliminate the medical devices tax, a highly contested part of Mr. Obama\u2019s health law. Last year, House Republicans pushed to roll back child nutrition standards that were backed by the first lady, Michelle Obama. Republicans could well start by pushing through budget measures, some of which require only 51 votes in the Senate and cannot be blocked by Democrats, and then dare Mr. Obama to veto them.\n\nMr. McConnell has described another prospect in which Republicans would move to pass individual appropriations bills to provide funding for the different agencies of government, rather than passing one overall bill to fund the government. Republicans would attach to each of the bills \u201criders\u201d \u2014 contested provisions likely to be offensive to Mr. Obama \u2014 that would most likely lead the president to veto the bill.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. McConnell has vowed to attach riders to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s annual budget bill that would stop the enactment of two major climate change regulations.\n\nJody Freeman, director of Harvard\u2019s environmental law program and a former senior counselor to the president, said there was no doubt that Mr. Obama would veto such an effort if Republicans got it through Congress.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Keystone bill, which White House officials have promised the president will veto, passed on Feb. 11, but Republicans said they would not officially deliver it to Mr. Obama\u2019s desk until this week, when they were back from a break. Their strategy is to have Mr. Obama reject the bill when they are in session, giving them the opportunity to rally and denounce the president on the floors of the Senate and House.\n\nCongressional aides said they expected that Mr. Obama would get the bill on Monday, and White House officials said the president would veto it soon after.\n\nEnvironmentalists have spent years marching and protesting against the pipeline, and have long urged Mr. Obama to reject the permit application from TransCanada, the company hoping to build it. White House officials say, however, that the president will veto the bill because it would shift the authority to approve the pipeline from the White House to Congress \u2014 essentially reducing the president\u2019s power.\n\nA veto would not mean the end of the Keystone project; rather, it would allow Mr. Obama to retain the authority to make a final decision on whether to approve it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Price said that even though Democrats had voted for the Keystone bill, they would rally behind Mr. Obama\u2019s veto to make sure Congress did not override it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the substance of the decision,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the blatant challenge of the president\u2019s authority. That\u2019s why the veto will be upheld.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and conservative advocacy groups said they intended to denounce the veto of the bill as a rejection of a project that has bipartisan support among most Americans.\n\nThe conservative \u201csuper PAC\u201d Americans for Prosperity, which is partly funded by the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles and David Koch, has already launched a media campaign criticizing the expected veto.\n\nBill Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said both parties needed to work together to avoid repeated clashes that ended with a veto pen. A wave of vetoes, he said, serves no one.\n\n\u201cTo avoid just vetoing everything and becoming the president of no,\u201d Mr. Hoagland said, \u201che\u2019s going to have to work with Congress, and they are going to have to work with him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150222131854, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama\u2019s veto of the pipeline bill this week, the third and most significant one of his six years in office, would most likely be followed by others.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Expected Keystone Pipeline Veto Is Likely to Be the First in a Wave", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/us/politics/with-expected-keystone-veto-obama-to-open-new-era-of-presidency.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003527227"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/23/us/23veto-web02/23veto-web02-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/us/politics/with-expected-keystone-veto-obama-to-open-new-era-of-presidency.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003527227", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/us/politics/with-expected-keystone-veto-obama-to-open-new-era-of-presidency.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 22, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Vetoes (US),Keystone Pipeline System,United States Politics and Government,Pipelines,House of Representatives,Senate,Presidents and Presidency (US),McConnell  Mitch", "news_keywords": "Pipelines,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael D.
