Krasnohorivka and Marinka are on fire,\u201d Ukrainian Member of Parliament and Kyiv-1 Battalion Commander Yevhen Deidei wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday.\n\n\u201cClose combat is taking place along the front line,\u201d he added. \u201cThe militants are going for a breakthrough.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, about 1,000 pro-Russian separatists launched the attack around 3 a.m. Wednesday in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv Wednesday afternoon, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were successfully repelling the ongoing attacks and holding their positions.\n\n\u201cThe situation is under control,\u201d Lysenko said. He added that 25 Ukrainian soldiers had so far been wounded in the fighting, with no fatalities. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparatist leaders issued contradictory statements, claiming they had seized control of Marinka.\n\nFifteen separatist fighters died in the fighting, according to separatist statements reported by Ukrainian and Russian media. Eduard Basurin, defense spokesman of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, blamed Kyiv for provoking Wednesday\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cWe are not conducting offensive operations, we just take adequate measures against strengthening the genocide of the people of Donbas,\u201d Basurin said, according to the Russian news agency TASS.\n\n\u201cDPR cities have been shelled by the Ukrainian army, not by battalions or other units,\u201d he added, using an acronym for the separatist republic. \u201cOnly commanders of the Ukrainian armed forces can issue an order to open fire.\u201d\n\nThere was widespread speculation throughout Ukrainian social media Wednesday as to whether the early-morning barrage was the beginning of a large-scale combined Russian-separatist offensive, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials have been warning about for months.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, however, there did not appear to be concurrent attacks of similar intensity at other places along the contact line, leading the Ukrainian military to downplay fears of a major offensive. \u201c[T]his attack is taking place on a narrow part of the front and therefore we currently cannot speak about a massive offensive by the enemy,\u201d Lysenko said.\n\nThe heavy weapons allegedly used Wednesday are banned from the front lines, according to the Feb. 12 cease-fire, which is now in danger of complete collapse.\n\nThe attack comes one day after members of the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, comprising delegates from Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, were set to meet in Minsk to discuss the Ukraine conflict and the fragile truce.\n\nThe attack also precedes a June 7 meeting of the G7 in Germany. On the group\u2019s agenda are sanctions on Russia due to its support for Ukrainian separatists.\n\nThe G7 comprises the world\u2019s seven major developed economies, including Germany, the United States, Canada, Japan, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. Russia joined the G7 in 1998, making it the Group of Eight, but was dropped from the group last year after annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula.\n\n\u201cToday, Russia once again violated the Minsk agreement,\u201d Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Wednesday, speaking from the military facility in western Ukraine where the U.S. Army is training the Ukrainian National Guard.\n\n\u201cBefore the G7 meeting, Russia deliberately disrupted the trilateral meeting of the contact group yesterday, and today instructed its terrorists to launch a military operation,\u201d Yatsenyuk said. His remarks were published on the Ukrainian government\u2019s website.\n\nWednesday\u2019s attack on Marinka followed a string of attacks across the contact line on Monday and Tuesday, with the heaviest fighting in Shyrokyne, 10 miles east of Mariupol, and around the separatist stronghold of Donetsk farther to the north.\n\nMarinka is about six miles west of Donetsk. Separatists also attacked the village of Krasnohorivka, three miles north of Marinka, on Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military.\n\nTanks and armored personnel carriers have been sent to reinforce Ukrainian units in the area, Kyiv said, and Ukrainian checkpoints into the separatist territories, which had been allowing civilians to pass, have been shut down.\n\nIn earlier interviews with The Daily Signal, U.S. military officials said there were no plans to pull U.S. soldiers out of Ukraine early if the fighting in eastern Ukraine escalated. About 300 U.S. Army paratroopers are currently deployed to Yavoriv in western Ukraine, about 800 miles from the front lines, to train the Ukrainian National Guard.\n\nLast month U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, published a letter calling on the United States to do more to help Ukraine defend against a \u201cblatant Russian invasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs multiple global crises compete for our attention, we must not neglect the situation in Ukraine,\u201d Portman wrote in the letter published on Cleveland.com.\n\n\u201cThe current cease-fire is not credible, and the Obama administration and some of our European allies need to stop pretending that it is,\u201d he added. \u201cThousands of Russian troops remain inside Ukraine and thousands more are right across the border. Every day, Ukrainian positions come under attack.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Portman pushed for the U.S. to send Ukraine military hardware and weapons, and framed the conflict as part of a broader struggle to deter Russian aggression in the region.\n\n\u201cRussian aggression in Ukraine won\u2019t go away or resolve itself simply because we wish it to be so,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the president to start shaping outcomes, and stop getting shaped by them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Russian separatists bombarded Ukrainian troops Wednesday, suggesting that a major offensive in the conflict may have begun.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Pro-Russian separatists bombarded Ukrainian troops Wednesday, suggesting that a major offensive in the conflict may have begun.", "title": "Separatists Launch Attack as Ukraine Braces for Offensive", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/UkraineOffensive1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-03T15:33:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QpZHWx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Pro-Russian separatists bombarded Ukrainian troops Wednesday, suggesting that a major offensive in the conflict may have begun.", "title": "Separatists Launch Attack as Ukraine Braces for Offensive", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/UkraineOffensive1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-06-03T13:53:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T15:33:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Donetsk"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd218a\"", "article_summary": "Speaking to reporters in Kyiv Wednesday afternoon, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were successfully repelling the ongoing attacks and holding their positions.\n\u201cThe militants are going for a breakthrough.\u201dAccording to the Ukrainian military, about 1,000 pro-Russian separatists launched the attack around 3 a.m. Wednesday in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces.\nSeparatists also attacked the village of Krasnohorivka, three miles north of Marinka, on Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military.\n\u201cRussian aggression in Ukraine won\u2019t go away or resolve itself simply because we wish it to be so,\u201d he wrote.\nThe attack comes one day after members of the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, comprising delegates from Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, were set to meet in Minsk to discuss the Ukraine conflict and the fragile truce."}
