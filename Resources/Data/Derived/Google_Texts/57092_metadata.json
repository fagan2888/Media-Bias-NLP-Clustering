It gave the batter enough time to round first base and look at his work.\n\nHopefully he enjoyed it. Liriano\u2019s hit was one of only three allowed by Matzek. And by the time Liriano lined a comebacker to the mound in the eighth \u2014 one that Matzek nonchalantly caught with a shrug \u2014 the Rockies\u2019 rookie left-hander was well on his way to Colorado\u2019s best pitching performance of the season.\n\nMatzek (5-9) needed just 103 pitches, 75 of them strikes, to toss the Rockies\u2019 first complete game of the season \u2014 a 3-0 victory over the Padres at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been finding my groove the last two or three games,\u201d said Matzek, whose streak of scoreless innings is now at 21. \u201cJust everything is working \u2014 fastball location, slider, changeup, curveball. Everything feels right right now.\u201d\n\nIt was the Rockies\u2019 first complete game since Tyler Chatwood did it July 13 last year against the Dodgers in Los Angeles. It was Colorado\u2019s first complete-game victory at Coors Field since Jhoulys Chacin did it April 15, 2011 (a 5-0 win over the Chicago Cubs). It was the 12th complete-game shutout in Rockies\u2019 history at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gaining more and more confidence in each outing,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cAnd he was able to go strike one. I think I heard 24 first-pitch strikes. When you do that, you\u2019re gonna go deep into the game.\n\n\u201cHis maturity and his poise, for me, are what stand out.\u201d\n\nMatzek dominated the Padres, facing just four more batters than the minimum. He struck out six and walked just one.\n\nIn the third, around Liriano\u2019s single, Matzek struck out three. He fanned Cameron Maybin swinging at a slider, caught Eric Stults looking at a fastball, then punched out Abraham Almonte on just three pitches.\n\nThrough seven innings, just five balls had left the infield, four for outs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another steppingstone to where I want to be,\u201d Matzek said. \u201cI just have to keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nMatzek also had help. Catcher Michael McKenry tracked a Rene Rivera foul back to the Rockies\u2019 dugout in the fourth, reaching over the railing to snag the popup.\n\nAnd Charlie Blackmon, after a 30-yard sprint, slid feet-first through the dirt into the right- field wall in foul territory in the eighth to get Maybin.\n\nAbraham Almonte\u2019s line drive over Corey Dickerson\u2019s head in left field in the ninth and Almonte\u2019s check-swing dribbler outside the batter\u2019s box for an infield hit in the sixth were San Diego\u2019s only other hits.\n\n\u201cWhen Tyler doesn\u2019t walk guys, he\u2019s going to be really tough,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHis last pitch in the eighth inning was 94-95 mph. So he showed me that he was still strong at that point.\u201d\n\nDrew Stubbs\u2019 solo home run in the first inning gave the Rockies all the room they needed. Nolan Arenado also homered, a solo shot in the sixth. And Blackmon got an RBI single in the fifth.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nLooking ahead\n\nPadres\u2019 Tyson Ross (13-12, 2.60 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (13-10, 4.26), 6:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nIn his team-leading 29th start of the season (it\u2019s his second consecutive season with at least 25 and third overall), De La Rosa will pitch against a team he\u2019s handled in recent years. Since 2010, De La Rosa is 8-1 with a 3.66 ERA against the Padres. But the Rockies left-hander went just 2-4 in August with a 4.42 ERA. That was after a brilliant July, when he went 3-0 with a 2.30 ERA.
