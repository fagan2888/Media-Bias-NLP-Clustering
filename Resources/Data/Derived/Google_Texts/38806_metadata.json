However, after news of the toxicology report, I am no longer surprised.\n\nThe article stated he had a blood-alcohol level of .218 and that \u201cValium was also detected, but at a level so low to have a negligible effect.\u201d But I know firsthand about a little-known side effect of Valium, \u201cextreme rage,\u201d especially when combined with alcohol.\n\nThirty-four years ago, just before going out partying with friends, I took a 2-milligram (low dose) Valium from my new prescription. With my \u201cnegligible\u201d dose of Valium and a few drinks, the world seemed to disappear, and to this day I do not remember most of that night. My memory begins when I woke up in ICU the next morning. Over the years in talking to witnesses, I now know I was in an extreme rage and could easily have killed anyone who crossed me. To this day that scares me to death. I no longer drink alcohol, nor will I touch Valium.\n\nI hope Mr. Bironas\u2019 family understands that he probably had no idea of how much he had to drink and no realization of what he was doing. Please let everyone know that Valium and alcohol can be deadly, no matter the dosage!\n\nBill Burns\n\nMadison 37115\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1vKTEVp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mixing valium and alcohol can be fatal, no matter the dosage.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Mixing valium and alcohol can be fatal, no matter the dosage.", "title": "Valium, alcohol a deadly mix", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/10/07/valium-alcohol-deadly-mix/16814157/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mixing valium and alcohol can be fatal, no matter the dosage.", "title": "Valium, alcohol a deadly mix", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc8e59b842c7cd27a5b67d19d9bfd014097dbb8c/c=170-0-853-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Rob Bironas", "gci-categories": "Persons/Rob Bironas", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Valium, alcohol a deadly mix", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b528a7eac22cc5cd1908eba51a8107fe161d07a/c=256-0-768-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c92e25f510c9b23dbabc529941195a50a3815bd3/c=56-0-967-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46e362b5c8a42f83e67d9ae3b3126cb697ee5c08/c=0-54-1024-630&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-06T23:05:34.430000-05:00", "shorthed": "Valium, alcohol a deadly mix", "articleid": 16814157, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5761a5644dbbbc0d07f1118b0a22ef5d2dbaa88b/c=0-54-1024-630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0228b51f267028c240180b67da039bf980e3fa9/c=320-0-704-683/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/06/drugsalcohol.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4d6\"", "article_summary": "Please let everyone know that Valium and alcohol can be deadly, no matter the dosage!\nThirty-four years ago, just before going out partying with friends, I took a 2-milligram (low dose) Valium from my new prescription.\nThe article stated he had a blood-alcohol level of .218 and that \u201cValium was also detected, but at a level so low to have a negligible effect.\u201d But I know firsthand about a little-known side effect of Valium, \u201cextreme rage,\u201d especially when combined with alcohol.\nI no longer drink alcohol, nor will I touch Valium.\nOver the years in talking to witnesses, I now know I was in an extreme rage and could easily have killed anyone who crossed me."}
