As the Affordable Care Act enters its third week, more than 8 million Americans have tried to log on to the health insurance marketplace to browse federal or state exchanges, despite the site’s persistent software glitches and the even more persistent attempts from House Republicans to censure the reform.

Although uninsured Americans across the country have until Dec. 15 to enroll in coverage for next year, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 7 million uninsured Americans out of a total of 48 million will sign up during the first three months.

The following study reviews the overall effect Obamacare will have on individual insurance rates and premiums in eight states. Each state highlighted has its own state-run insurance exchange marketplace, has made public the insurance carrier filings available and contains more than 3 million residents affected by price changes for premiums.

California: 38 million Residents

Per the Los Angeles Times, California aims to enroll more than 2 million people with affordable health insurance through next year, the most of any other state. There are almost 3.7 million uninsured California residents eligible for government subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to Forbes.

From Oct. 1 to 5, Covered California reported 987,440 unique visits to the state-run online enrollment system, as well as 59,003 phone calls.

Though open enrollment has been popular, some physicians, private insurers and residents are wary of the overall change taking place within the California health care system.

“It will be a fast-food chain type of health care,” Dr. Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist based out of California, told GoBankingRates. “Doctors will not have time or resources to treat patients comprehensively enough, since they will have to rush them through in order to survive financially.”

Here’s how the Affordable Care Act will affect health insurance rates for uninsured Californians:

Men/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act

Post-Affordable Care Act

% Increase Age 27 $145 a month $179 a month 23% Age 40 $192 a month $219 a month 14% Age 64 $542 a month $514 a month -5%

New York: 19.6 million residents

Unlike many other states, New York already has a lot of the same benefits and requirements that the Affordable Care Act is now enforcing. The state already doesn’t allow insurers to reject applicants with pre-existing conditions and maintains a standard set of deductibles and co-pays.

However, New York’s individual market has a small pool of sick residents at very high costs for healthier residents, which is why currently only 17,000 New Yorkers buy their own insurance and 2.6 million lack coverage.

New York expects to see more than 600,000 residents enter its individual insurance market, most of whom are looking to avoid the penalty fee attached to the Affordable Care Act if they remain uninsured. About 70 percent of this group is eligible for federal subsidies.

“The people who are going to come in are healthy people who can’t afford the coverage now,” Gary Claxton, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told CNNMoney. “That will substantially lower the average cost of care.”

Here’s how much the Affordable Care Act will lower the individual health insurance premiums in New York:

Men/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act

Post-Affordable Care Act

% Decrease Age 27 $500 a month $356 a month -29% Age 40 $500 a month $356 a month -29% Age 64 $500 a month $356 a month -29%

Ohio: 11.5 million residents

In the past, Ohio residents who tried to buy health insurance through the individual market were refused coverage 33 percent of time, one of the highest rates of any state, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Nearly 1.7 million residents of Ohio who are uninsured can buy coverage through the new government-operated online marketplace. The majority of Ohio’s population currently receives employer-based health insurance.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) estimates that 916,000 Ohioans will qualify for government subsidies to buy insurance premiums, according to Cleveland.com. While many uninsured residents of Ohio are looking forward to finally receiving coverage, some are wary about the changes they will see in the day-to-day health care system.

“From what I can tell, Obamacare assumes that keeping prices low merely is a matter of regulating what health care can charge, as though that isn’t going to result in rationing, shortages and long waits,” Joel Selmeier, a self-employed resident of Cincinnati who buys his own insurance, told GoBankingRates.

Here’s how the Affordable Care Act will affect health insurance rates and premiums for uninsured individuals living in Ohio:

Men/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act

Post-Affordable Care Act

% Decrease Men % Decrease Women Age 27 $174/$227 a month $169 a month -3% -26% Age 40 $264/$372 a month $206 a month -22% -45% Age 64 $852/$841 a month $484 a month -43% -42%

Virginia: 8 million residents

Although residents of many states are receiving information on the Affordable Care Act from state-run organizations, Gaylene Kanoyton, an organizer with Enrollfest in Hampton, Va., told NPR that the state of Virginia is not providing any resources. “It is a grassroots effort,” Kanoyton said. “It is up to all of us citizens to come together.”

With more than 8 million residents, 14 percent of them uninsured as of 2011, Virginia will require substantial grassroots efforts to launch the government insurance marketplace, especially with more than 600,000 Virginians qualifying for government subsidies to pay for exchanges.

Here’s how the Affordable Care Act will affect health insurance rates and premiums for uninsured Virginia residents:

Men/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act

Post-Affordable Care Act

% Increase Men % Increase Women Age 27 $109/$151 a month $182 a month 67% 21% Age 40 $161/$207 a month $222 a month 38% 7% Age 64 $643/$506 a month $521 a month -19% 3%
