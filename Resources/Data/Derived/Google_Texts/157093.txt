Wellcome Middle School hosted its first ever Fall Festival today.

The Wellcome Revolution helped organize the event. The group plans events for the school and surrounding community.

The festival included a bounce house, a basketball game, and a Zumba instructor to teach the students and their parents some dance moves. Various vendors were also there.

Media assistant and Chairwoman of the Wellcome Revolution, Kiersa Stricklen, said they were expecting over 400 people to come out Saturday.

"Wellcome is a Title 1 school, and the majority of our kids generally wouldn't have access to things like this. So, we're trying to plan things that we know are affordable," Stricklen said.

They're already looking forward to their next festival in the spring.
