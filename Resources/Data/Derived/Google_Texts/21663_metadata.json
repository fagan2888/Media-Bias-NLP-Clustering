William Gortney, told reporters that he believes North Korea has the ability to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the West Coast of the U.S. with a nuclear weapon from a mobile launcher.\n\nThough Gortney said he was concerned about North Korea\u2019s capabilities, he said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that the U.S. has the ability to \u201cknock it down.\u201d\n\nThose comments come just days after reports highlight an extremely grim picture of some of the U.S.\u2019s major missile defense systems.\n\nIn fact, more than a decade and $10 billion later, at least three of those programs have been scrapped\u2014while a fourth is under intense scrutiny for not working properly while continuing to rack up an enormous price tag at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\nA new investigation by the Los Angeles Times concluded that the $2.2 billion Sea Based X-Band Radar, which is responsible for spotting enemy missiles, doesn\u2019t work and is essentially nothing more than an enormous waste of tax dollars that has left the U.S. vulnerable to an attack.\n\nRelated: Anti-Missile System Will Counter N. Korean Threat\n\nThe report says that although SBX is supposed to scope out missiles soaring toward the United States, it has an extremely \u201cnarrow field of vision\u201d that could prevent it from identifying a large stream of missiles.\n\nPentagon officials, for their part, are fiercely pushing back against those allegations\u2014calling the paper\u2019s description of the program\u2019s capabilities \u201ctotally inaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Combatant Commanders who operate our missile defense system have time and again stressed the importance of the role SBX has played and continues to play during real-world operations, and the radar has also performed extremely well supporting a large number of tests of our ground and sea-based missile defense systems,\u201d Rick Lehner, an official from the Missile Defense Agency, said.\n\nHe disputed the LA Times\u2019 description of the program that classifies SBX\u2019s \u201cnarrow field of vision\u201d as a flaw, saying its narrow focus is what makes it valuable.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the X-band radar so effective is its ability to use a finely focused beam to track and identify small objects at great distances,\u201d Lehner said. \u201cFor missile defense, this is especially important in order to discriminate countermeasures and debris from the incoming warhead.\u201d\n\nRelated: With the U.S. F-35 Grounded, Putin\u2019s New Jet Beats Us Hands-Down\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nHe explained that SBX\u2019s sensors are supposed to detect and track targets. The other land-based and sea-based radars cue the SBX and other X-band radars\u2026to zero in on specific objects to provide precise target tracking and discrimination in order to guide the interceptor missile to intercept and destroy the lethal object using only the force of a direct collision, called \"hit to kill\" technology.\u201d\n\nLehner also refuted the article\u2019s claims that SBX has sat on the sidelines in Hawaii\u2019s Pearl Harbor.\n\n\u201cContrary to assertions that the SBX has been \"mothballed,\" the SBX has deployed 13 times since 2006 and successfully participated in 11 individual flight tests and \"real world\" operational scenarios. It will continue to be a vital asset for many years to come.\u201d Lehner said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been operational for years,\u201d he said adding that \u201cthe SBX has been and continues to be a vital asset for both homeland and regional missile defense.\u201d\n\nWhile the DOD defended SBX, it didn\u2019t have much to say about the three other programs that cost nearly $8 billion only to be scrapped years later.\n\nRelated: Hagel Announces More Missile Defense on West Coast\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the Airborne Laser, which was supposed to be a fleet of Boeing 747\u2019s that could fire laser beams at enemy missiles. That idea didn\u2019t pan out, since officials realized that the planes would have to get dangerously close to its targets\u2014putting pilots at an unnecessary risk. That program was canceled in 2012 after more than 10 years of testing at a price tag of $5.3 billion.\n\nThen, the Kinetic Energy Interceptor was scrapped in 2009 after costing about $1.7 billion. The program was a rocket that was created to be fired from land or sea to intercept and destroy missiles shortly after they were launched. However, after six years of testing, officials concluded that the interceptor couldn\u2019t fit on any Navy ship\u2014so, it couldn\u2019t be fired from sea. And apparently the missile had to be positioned so close to its target that it would put its operators at risk.\n\nThe third program was the Multiple Kill Vehicle, which was a bunch of small interceptor missiles that were supposed to be able to stop an enemy missile as well as any accompanying decoys. However, it was shelved after four years of development at a cost of about $700 million.\n\n\u201cThese expensive flops stem in part from a climate of anxiety after Sept. 11, 2001, heightened by warnings from defense hawks that North Korea and Iran were close to developing long-range missiles capable of reaching the United States. The Times\u2019 David Willman wrote. \u201cThe project not only wasted taxpayer money but left a hole in the nation\u2019s defenses. The money spent on it could have gone toward land-based radars with a greater capability to track long-range missiles, according to experts who have studied the issue.\u201d\n\nStill, DOD officials defend the department\u2019s \u201cexcellent\u201d investment in all four of the programs.\n\n\u201cWe are very confident of our ability \u2026 and we will continue to conduct extensive research, development and testing of new technologies to ensure we keep pace with the threat,\u201d Vice Adm. James D. Syring said in a statement.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion--and counting--missile defense system is under intense scru", "title": "A $10 Billion Missile Defense System Gets Added to \u2018Government Waste\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/09/10-Billion-Missile-Defense-System-Gets-Added-Government-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR41HY6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/09/10-Billion-Missile-Defense-System-Gets-Added-Government-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR41HY6.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion--and counting--missile defense system is under intense scru", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc3b\"", "article_summary": "The Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion--and counting--missile defense system is under intense scrutiny after new reports suggest that the entire operation is a \u201cboondoggle\u201d that isn\u2019t capable of protecting the United States.\nAfter the September 11 terrorist attack, the Pentagon allocated billions of dollars to build a massive defense system that was supposed to have the capabilities to identify and destroy any type of missile heading toward U.S. shores.\nRelated: Hagel Announces More Missile Defense on West CoastFirst, there\u2019s the Airborne Laser, which was supposed to be a fleet of Boeing 747\u2019s that could fire laser beams at enemy missiles.\nThat program was canceled in 2012 after more than 10 years of testing at a price tag of $5.3 billion.\nAnd apparently the missile had to be positioned so close to its target that it would put its operators at risk."}
