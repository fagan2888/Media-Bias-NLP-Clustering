Three high-profile politicians opted to decline the opportunity to enter the contest for the top spot in the eighth largest city in the United States. That\u2019s like three customers going into a Starbucks paying for a latte with a hundred dollar bill and saying \u201ckeep the change\u201d\u2026or a camel passing through the eye of a needle.\n\n\u2026DeMaio deferred to his Congressional ambitions, Todd Gloria said that the job of being interim mayor demanded his full attention and County Supervisor Ron Roberts opted out of the race.\n\nOn the surface anyway, this leaves Democratic convert Nathan Fletcher and the GOP\u2019s District 2 Councilman Kevin Faulconer as front runners in the race. Both can be considered \u201csafe\u201d choices. It\u2019s center-left vs center right.\n\nThe \u201ceverybody knows\u201d crowd is already at it, as in [insert name of candidate here] is the obvious choice for [insert political leanings here]. And discussion or even mention of the other 15 already declared or or potential candidates is summarily dismissed, as in \u201ceverybody knows\u201d they can\u2019t win because [insert reason here].\n\nPerhaps we should just call off the primary just to keep the \u201ceverybody knows\u201d crowd happy. Why bother with campaigns, or platforms when we can have the wisdom of \u201ceverybody knows\u201d?\n\nOf course this consensus masks a larger, and some would say more sinister, picture.\n\nOn the Republican (Tweedle-dee) side the power plays were obvious. Carl DeMaio, really, really wanted to be mayor. Word has it that he was strongly discouraged from pursuing that course by the \u201cnon-partisan\u201d Lincoln Club with a push from UT-San Diego publisher \u201cPapa\u201d Doug Manchester.\n\nFrom UT-San Diego\u2019s reporting on DeMaio\u2019s presser yesterday:\n\nThe decision by DeMaio comes after lengthy behind-the-scenes deliberations among Republican power brokers this past weekend in which they urged DeMaio to stay in the congressional race and unanimously agreed to back Councilman Kevin Faulconer in the mayor\u2019s race. Faulconer is expected to announce his candidacy at 10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nLest DeMaio not get the message (and they were obviously worried that he wouldn\u2019t), the UT-San Diego editorialized:\n\nAs this editorial page has said in the wake of Filner\u2019s resignation, quality of character must be the hallmark of the new mayor \u2014 and the standard by which voters should judge the candidates. Never before have integrity, stability, long-standing core values and leadership style been so important.\n\nThis election is a time for statesmen. There is no room for political opportunism\u2026\n\n\u2026DeMaio will announce Tuesday whether he will remain a candidate for Congress or demonstrate his own political opportunism by switching to the race for mayor. His decision will mark him as a future Republican star, or could end his political career. The U-T editorial board urges DeMaio to stick with his congressional candidacy; he can count on our editorial support if he does so.\n\nSo Carl DeMaio did the \u201cright thing\u201d and announced he was still running for Congress. He was rewarded with a very nice editorial today in the Daily Fishwrap.\n\n\u2026Not everybody was trilled with the GOP\u2019s move to the center on Faulconer. As one commenter at the Daily Fishwrap put it:\n\nNow get ready for the repackaging of Kevin Faulconer. Wherein Barney Fife gets transformed into John Wayne.\n\nWhile the GOP has cleared the deck of potential distractions, local Democrats (Tweedle-Dum) are still working on it.\n\nCity Councilman Todd Gloria\u2019s announcement that he was not running was a step forward towards consolidating their package. Nathan Fletcher\u2019s candidacy got a big boost even as he was releasing the official video saying he was in the race.\n\nThere are those pesky progressive types lurking in the shadows that have yet to be convinced that a figurative battle of the Titans (Manchester vs Jacobs) is the best way forward. And then there\u2019s labor.\n\nWhile the Metropolitan Employees Association and the Firefighters have already endorsed Fletcher\u2014and the Police Officers Association won\u2019t be far behind\u2014the rest of the Labor Council isn\u2019t convinced of the former Assemblyman\u2019s ideological conversion, especially given his legislative vote history.\n\n#2 Neighborhood is the New Sustainable\n\nIt seems like \u2018neighborhood\u2019 is the new \u2018sustainable\u2019 for candidates in San Diego as the campaigns for the mayoral special election on November 19th get underway. Yes, indeedy, it seems as though this buzzword is on everybody\u2019s lips.\n\nWhat the word \u2018neighborhood\u2019 actually means to the various candidates is what we\u2019ll be looking to find out in the coming weeks. Both the effen (my new shorthand for the anointed candidates that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d will win) brothers emphasized the new \u2018n word\u2019 in their initial pronouncements.\n\nMeanwhile things are going on in San Diego\u2019s neighborhoods and communities of interest that are symptomatic a return to the business as usual mentality that has dominated the local landscape for generations\u2026\n\n\u2026I had a long chat with Bruce Coons, the mayoral candidate \u201ceverybody knows\u201d can\u2019t win yesterday.\n\nHe\u2019s a smart guy. His heart\u2019s in the right place. He\u2019s totally NOT a one issue candidate.\n\nAnd, no, this is not an endorsement. It\u2019s waaay too early yet. I can\u2019t even name most of the candidates, much less understand what they all stand for.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from the meeting was that the strength and popularity of the \u201cwe\u2019re pro-neighborhoods\u201d argument being advanced by the big name candidates could turn out to be their biggest weakness.\n\nIf they want to define neighborhoods as the funding mechanism for future privatized city services, as in \u201csure, just pay a few fees and you can have [fill in the service]\u201d, which is what I suspect they\u2019ll end up endorsing, then this special election represents an opportunity to do some real work on exposing just how rotten the system is.\n\nCoons\u2019 arguments (which I interpreted as) building democracy through neighborhood empowerment struck me as a real antidote for our historical flavors of \u2018business as usual.\u201d\n\n#3 David \u2018Who?\u2019\n\nA mayoral contest best characterized thus far by the quantity of candidates took a turn towards being much more interesting yesterday as Democratic City Councilman David Alvarez entered the race.\n\nShould he end up in the winner\u2019s circle come February (which is when a final runoff will decide the victor), Alvarez will be the first mayor of Mexican descent since the city emerged from being ruled by trustees (bankruptcy) back in 1887.\n\nThis is no small thing in a city with a growing Hispanic (28.8%) population. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that brown-skinned people were prohibited from buying homes in many San Diego neighborhoods.\n\nAlvarez is also popular with many on San Diego\u2019s Labor Council, whose participation in get out the vote efforts in recent elections has boosted turnout in less affluent neighborhoods. His electoral base is mostly south of Interstate 8, which changes the dynamics of an election many thought would be decided by mostly white, older voting blocs in other areas of the city\u2026\n\n\u2026Kevin Faulconer was in Ocean Beach this morning touting his endorsement by the California Restaurant Association (CRA) San Diego County chapter.\n\nThe CRA has been active in opposing increases in minimum wage legislation and Obamacare, so this endorsement is telling for those wondering where Faulconer might stand on the local implications of such issues\u2026.\n\n\u2026And no, Mr. Faulconer, standing in front of the OB Noodle House for your press conference doesn\u2019t qualify as campaigning for \u201cethnic\u201d votes.\n\n#4 Impoverished Downtown Developers Beg for Spare Change?\n\nUT-San Diego, the daily newspaper that went so far last fall as to rig a poll along with discounted ad rates for negative ads to gin up support for a Republican candidate, has proposed hosting a series of six debates for this fall\u2019s mayoral primary.\n\nThis is the sort of \u201coffer\u201d is in keeping with right wing publisher Doug Manchester\u2019s ongoing attempts to control the political narrative in San Diego.\n\nYou can be sure the questions will be tailored along the lines of whether or not the candidates support the publisher\u2019s various schemes for our city. I can envision Roger Hedgecock with probing inquiries like: \u201cDo you favor a new Chargers stadium or do you beat your wife?- pick one\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily Fishwrap\u2019s Sunday sermon:\n\nThe U-T San Diego ownership and its editorial board are proposing a series of six mayoral campaign debates before the Nov. 19 election. These debates would be co-sponsored by the U-T and a consortium of local universities and community groups. All would be televised, with varying formats and panelists. Key topics could include the candidates\u2019 vision and leadership style, the $1 billion backlog in municipal infrastructure, implementing pension reform, revising the city charter, boosting the region\u2019s economy, education and keeping the Chargers in San Diego. Each of the candidates who can demonstrate that they have a viable campaign will be invited to participate.\n\nSee any mention of neighborhood vs. downtown development, prevailing wages, bike infrastructure, or minority issues? Nope. That\u2019s why they want to host the debates.\n\nAfter all, the city \u201cwas broken in important ways by the nine months of Filner\u201d. All those poor developers on street corners with plastic cups begging for spare change are all the proof the UT-San Diego needs.\n\n#5 A New Stadium is Suggested as The Cure\n\nThe Daily Fishwrap has hammered home the meme that ours is a city teetering on the edge of ruin following nine months of bullying and grabbing on the eleventh floor of city hall. Hotel executives are metaphorically scattered throughout the Gaslamp District with tin cups in hand trying stave off the looming economic disaster brought on by the former Mayor\u2019s insistence that taxpayers be protected.\n\nInto this power vacuum have stepped the San Diego Chargers, a professional football team owned by an ultra-wealthy family that believes it\u2019s entitled to taxpayer assistance in building a new football stadium.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s been a full court media press on over the last few days extolling the virtues of a recycled proposal for a downtown venue that would turn San Diego into a world class city overnight. Former Mayor Jerry Sanders was on KUSI TV this morning saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll find the Chargers a new stadium in the not-too-distant future, I predict.\u201d\n\nYes indeedy, a new stadium will make everything okay. Our long regional nightmare will be over.\n\nGone would be our collective horror at the antics of the masher Mayor. Gone would be the need to mar our city\u2019s waterfront with an expanded Convention Center build expressly to serve the needs of those freaks of nature otherwise known as Comic-Con. Gone would be poverty, as the economic miracles trickling down from this behemoth would miraculously restore neighborhoods, eliminate racism and end homelessness.\n\n#6 Heaping Helpings of Civic Shame\n\nThe Monday Morning Quarterback blog on Sports Illustrated.com trotted out a stadium horror story so scary it should have been prefaced with a warning against letting small children near any screen displaying it.\n\nEntitled \u201cAn Insult to Dumps Everywhere\u201d, the SI account ladles up heaping helpings of civic shame:\n\nActually, calling Qualcomm a dump really is an insult to dumps. The JumboTron is so old that some replacement parts can only be found on eBay. There\u2019s no capacity for a hi-definition video board or for new electronic signage. In an era in which the NFL is trying to heighten the stadium experience to allow fans to keep up with scores and stats from other games via their smartphones, connectivity is limited in part by structural issues within the stadium. (At the preseason opener this year, one Chargers exec could not communicate via email with his staff during the game because of poor wifi.) White trash bags cover large electrical connectors that hang from a lower wall, and cracks are visible in the concrete in various places. Heavy rains often cause the drainage systems to back up, which is why the team has rubber boots on hand for fans whose seats are flooded. It\u2019s not uncommon for sewage to leak onto the field and into the visiting locker room. According to an independent audit performed for the city, the stadium needs $70 million in maintenance and repairs.\n\nWhereupon the writer follows up with the eminent reasonableness of the Spanos family\u2019s ideas for building a new facility. A mere $300 million in public funding is needed for the $1 billion project, monies that could easily be raised if it wasn\u2019t for the FACT we\u2019ve had the \u201cmost dysfunctional city government in the country\u201d for the past God-only-knows-how-long.\n\nCity Attorney Jan Goldsmith is quoted : \u201cThe city needs mayoral leadership for big projects, and right now it is not there. But, we will get through this turmoil.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u2026The Chargers repackaged an old stadium plan and rolled it out last week via a \u201cselfie\u201d interview on their own website. Contrary to rumors spread via social media, they did not promise a free pony for everybody in San Diego.\n\nLast night on ESPN Monday Night Football we got The Lecture on what a great city San Diego could be if we only had a football field. Then, as if to prove the point about what a bunch of losers we collectively are, the Chargers went into full dis-function mode.\n\n#7 I Return from Vacation\u2026And Unclutter my Inbox\n\nI\u2019ve been \u201cunplugged\u201d from events outside the CNN/USAToday/Faux news horizon over the past week as I vacationed in the great Midwestern region of the US. (It was a swell trip!)\u2026\n\nHere are the greatest hits:\n\nDistrict Attorney Bonnie Dumanis has a challenger for the coming election cycle and he\u2019s picking up steam. Lawyer Bob Brewer picked up key endorsements from a coalition of unions representing law enforcement officers. CBS/8 News has the story here.\n\nMayoral Candidate David Alvarez is on a hot streak. Yesterday he was endorsed by former Assemblywoman Lori Salda\u00f1a. Today Donna Frye is giving him a thumbs up.\n\nIt\u2019s looking like several Mayoral Debates will be conducted under the auspices of Doug Manchester\u2019s Mission Valley minions. The first will be taped Friday afternoon and rebroadcast on UT-TV that evening, so expect to see any gaffs committed by the UT\u2019s anointed favorite Kevin Faulconer edited out for time considerations. A second tape-delayed event featuring only Alvarez, Fletcher and Faulconer will be broadcast on September 27th. It would appear that Bruce Coons and Mike Aguirre have both been excluded from participating.\n\nMike Aguirre has released an Open Letter to Voters via his website, just in case you\u2019re curious.\n\nSan Diego \u2019s City Beat is a virtual fountainhead of insight this week into Marco Gonzalez/Donna Frye/Cory Briggs involvement in calling out former Mayor Bob Filner\u2019s transgressions. Do read all about it. Do read Donna Frye\u2019s letter of resignation from last April. And understand that this is only one part of the sordid saga, one that existed in addition to City Attorney Jan Goldsmith\u2019s nine month long effort, among other things.\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019ll assume the effin brothers (Faulconer/Fletcher) are busy counting up their big bucks campaign donations. You can watch their piles of big money ($1000 plus donations) grow on a daily basis by clicking through to inewsource.org\u2019s Follow the Money page. As of yesterday Faulconer was over $140,000 and Fletcher was just past $80,000.\n\n#8 Lest We Forget\u2026\n\nThe Center for Policy Initiatives (CPI) released its annual number crunching report for San Diego yesterday based on 2012 Census data, and picture painted within isn\u2019t pretty.\n\nDespite media reports about how \u201cthings are getting better\u201d, CPI\u2019s data point to the reality that the economic recovery has passed by most households and employees in the San Diego region.\n\n\u201cPeople have less money to spend, even those working full-time,\u201d said CPI Research Director Peter Brownell in a press release. \u201cThe wealthiest saw their incomes increase in 2012, but when we hear talk of economic recovery, it hasn\u2019t reached most people in our region.\u201d\n\n#9 UT-TV Sexist, Much?\n\nPapa Doug Manchester\u2019s UT-TV (which thus far has the franchise on mayoral debates) continues to prove there is no low to which they won\u2019t sink.\n\nThis morning\u2019s \u201cnews chatter\u201d included an interview with Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who\u2019s proven her ability to walk out of the Mission Valley lion\u2019s den unscathed many times. But this particular visit was over-the-top stupid\u2026\n\nHost Scott Kaplan (paraphrased, via Evan McLaughlin): \u201cDid Filner ever ask you out? Because he should\u2019ve: You\u2019re hot.\u201d\n\n#10 Alvarez Gets the Nod, Sweet Tweets Get Traded\n\nTuesday night\u2019s vote by the San Diego Democratic Central Committee was a clear victory for backers of Councilman David Alvarez\u2019s mayoral aspirations. If for no other reason, the endorsement was important in raising the councilman\u2019s name recognition, both for the headlines it produced and the cash that will now flow from Democratic Party coffers boosting his candidacy.\n\nOthers with skin in this game reacted in differing ways.\n\nA much heralded spat between United Food and Commercial Workers President Mickey Kasparian (who supports Alvarez) and Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (Nathan Fletcher\u2019s booster), appears to have passed. After all, the vote is over, and the party did vote to support whichever of those candidates wins the November 19th primary.\n\nKasparian and Gonzalez traded Sweet Tweets yesterday, agreeing to disagree on their candidates but vowing support for each others\u2019 causes, even as Voice of San Diego published an article talking about how their relationship had devolved into \u201cinsults and strange maneuvering.\u201d\n\n#11 Countdown for the Government Shutdown\n\nThere\u2019s only one story that counts today: the confrontation on Capitol Hill over passing a continuing budget resolution allowing the government to function for another 45 days.\n\nMini-Mayor Todd Gloria, along with members of the City Council and a Chamber of Commerce delegation headed by former Mayor Jerry Sanders are on the Hill this week \u201cto advocate for policies vital to the region.\u201d This trip has been on the books for some time\u2014in fact it\u2019s the same outing that former Mayor Bob Filner was uninvited from by Sanders back when reports of bad behavior surfaced.\n\nA proposal by House Speaker John Boehner to push back the deadline for GOP demands to coincide with legislation allowing the debt ceiling to rise was rejected by Tea Party elements last week.\n\nAlthough there are enough Republican votes in the House to pass a \u201cclean\u201d, (i.e., unencumbered by conditions tied to defunding the Affordable Healthcare Act) continuing budget resolution, the Speaker will be committing political suicide by even allowing such legislation to be considered.\n\n#12 Weasel Words on Obamacare\n\nCongressman Scott Peters sent out a press release saying that, while he was against shutting down the government, he wanted everybody to know he was willing to leave a $30 billion dollar hole in funding healthcare reform by repealing the medical device tax.\n\n\u201cI voted for the amendment to repeal the medical device tax because I strongly support its repeal. This excise tax hinders innovation in health care that leads to cost savings in the long run and hurts a significant sector of San Diego\u2018s economy. I would much prefer if we would be able to vote for this repeal separate from the continuing resolution. Attaching amendments that threaten the shutdown ofAmerica\u2019s government is a lousy way to pass good laws. I\u2019ll continue to fight to keep America at work and to support a bipartisan plan to fix pieces of the ACA that need fixing, including the repeal of this nonsensical tax.\u201d\n\n\u2026GOP Congressional candidate [DeMaio] issued a press release Thursday afternoon, trying to seem \u201creasonable\u201d about the impending government shutdown and hoping to shift the \u201cblame\u201d on Congressman Scott Peters. Using his usual mealy mouthed approach, any mention of the Affordable Health Care Act was omitted by DeMaio in favor of calling for \u201creform of wasteful spending.\u201d\n\nVia Dave Rice at the San Diego Reader:\n\n\u201cHey \u2013 We just learned that Scott Peters is backing a permanent rule for \u201cautomatic\u201d increases in the debt limit. Yes, he wants it to be \u201cautomatic.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Peters sent a letter to Barack Obama urging him to reject any conditions for reforming wasteful spending as part of a larger compromise package for addressing our ballooning debt.\u201d\n\nTomorrow \u2013 October The Light at the End of the Shutdown Yesterday-\n\n\n\nOn This Day: 1892 \u2013 Ellis Island opened as America\u2019s first federal immigration center. Annie Moore, at age 15, became the first person to pass through. 1974 \u2013 President Nixon signed a bill requiring all states to lower the maximum speed limit to 55 MPH. The law was intended to conserve gasoline supplies during an embargo imposed by Arab oil-producing countries. Federal speed limits were abolished in 1995. 1979 \u2013 The trial of ex-Sex Pistol, Sid Vicious for the October 1978 murder of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, opened in New York City. Vicious died of a heroin overdose, thereby not living to hear the verdict.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?
