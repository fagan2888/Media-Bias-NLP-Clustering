After all, previous winners include Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, two candidates who exclusively appealed to evangelical voters (and pretty much no one else).\n\nIn Iowa, the most devout and outwardly preachy Republicans get the nod. Donald Trump mistakenly thought making up bible verses and quoting \u201ctwo Corinthians\u201d at Liberty University would be a sufficient religious test. It clearly wasn\u2019t \u2014 he came in \u201ctwo.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio, who won the night by coming in third, has been offering on the stump, \u201cAmerica was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don\u2019t come from government our rights come from god.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz, the official winner of the Iowa caucus this election cycle, repeated this idea in his victory speech. \u201cThat our rights do not come from the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or even from the tea party. Our rights come from our creator,\u201d the first-term Texas Senator said.\n\nSure, if you believe god is everything, then yes, those statements can be technically true for you. But when it comes to rights, it\u2019s not some magical mystical nebulous force which gifted us liberty.\n\nRights are something for which humans have fought, struggled and died. Rights are liberties people have demanded and governments have acquiesced. Saying rights are just given to us because an omnipotent force wills it, robs all the notables who\u2019ve laid down their lives.\n\nOver 50,000 people posthumously dubbed Americans died in the Revolutionary War. Those men fought for our right to self-rule.\n\nObedience is a biblical principle; America was founded by rebels who rejected obedience.\n\nThere were 620,000 Americans who died in the Civil War \u2014 a war about human rights \u2014 one side killing and dying to keep their fellow humans as property, the other side killing and dying to liberate them.\n\nTelling a crowd of Iowa caucus-goers god just amended our Constitution so that African Americans were no longer three-fifths a person \u2014 giving them \u201camnesty\u201d and full citizenship mocks the blood-soaked struggle our ancestors waged. It sanitizes the brutality of American history with pithy pandering.\n\nSuffragettes were arrested and tortured in a battle for the right to vote. That right was not bestowed upon the gender the bible views as servants to men.\n\nCivil Rights were not just passively given to people in the segregated South. There were activists \u2014 champions and casualties. There were brave men and women subjected to fire hoses, German Shepherds and batons (or worse). They were kicked down yet they stood back up and demanded their rights again. And again. And again.\n\nBut the worst part of Rubio and Cruz offering this boilerplate baloney is they\u2019re saying god gave us our rights while hoping to take away rights from their fellow (at least in the case of Rubio) Americans.\n\nThey both want to take away the right to marry whomever you choose \u2014 a right fought for by courageous regular people ostracized because of their sexuality. They both want to make women into public incubators, making health-care decisions for them \u2014 infantilizing a huge swath of the American electorate.\n\nBoth oppose equal pay for women. And they each want to repeal Obamacare.\n\nAnd before you tell yourself these men are really just for, as they claim, religious liberty, they are not. They both have expressed contempt for religions that are not their own, specifically Islam.\n\nRubio wants to shutter mosques and \u201cany facility that\u2019s being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States, should be a place that we look at,\u201d he said. Cruz wants to deny Muslim refugees sanctuary. So if you\u2019re for your freedom but not for someone else\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re not for freedom. You\u2019re for subordination.\n\nDon\u2019t take the credit away from those who\u2019ve died for our rights. Our liberties are stained with blood. And our liberties have been opposed by men like Rubio and Cruz \u2014 men who use faith for obfuscation.\n\n\u2014 Tina Dupuy is a nationally syndicated columnist and host of the podcast, Cultish.
