There are gowns that look like you\u2019re wearing a neck tie or even one that looks like a super hero chest is being exposed through the illusion of a ripped gown. Most of the gowns are under $60.\n\nWithings Aura: Many people have a difficult time sleeping, but there is a lot of new technology out there to help with this issue. In this case, a bedside device, a sleeping sensor mat and your mobile device work together to ensure that you get a better night sleep. The light therapy works to increase natural Melatonin and the device also helps time when you wake up to better match a health sleep cycle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today is the biggest shopping day of the year, and it\u2019s when most people (a lot of the slightly crazy and/or more \u201cdetermined\u201d folks) start taking care of their holiday shopping.
