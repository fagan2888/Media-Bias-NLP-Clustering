Jared participated in the Half Ironman to raise research money for Justin and Lexi, who were diagnosed with a rare, fatal genetic mutation called giant axonal neuropathy. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nAt the Nashville Kids' Triathlon on Saturday, 9-year-old Lexi Clark was aiming for more than a medal. By training and competing, she is trying to slow the progression of a fatal disease that affects both her and her brother \u2014 GAN, or giant axonal neuropathy.\n\nThe odds of being affected are tiny: only about 50 kids in the world have it. For a family to have two kids with GAN is even less likely, according to Lexi's mother, Lagenia Clark.\n\n\"My husband and I literally had a larger chance of winning a multimillion-dollar lottery than of meeting up and both having this rare recessive gene,\" she said.\n\nBut they did, and now Lexi and her brother Justin, 13, are both fighting the progressive nerve disorder. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, few kids afflicted with GAN make it to young adulthood. Difficulty in walking usually shows up before age 5. Symptoms later extend to a lack of feeling in limbs and a slowing down of mental processes. Lexi and Justin have been luckier than most so far.\n\n\"Right now Lexi is not affected outwardly, but tests show she already has neuropathy in one leg and foot,\" Clark said. \"Her brother [Justin] didn't have trouble walking until he was 11.\"\n\nBecause GAN is so rare, researchers haven't solidified a cure yet, Clark said.\n\n\"Right now there is no treatment,\" she said. \"There is a potential cure and we're waiting for approval by the FDA to inject the first human patient.\"\n\nSo while most of the 750 kids in the Nashville Kids' Triathlon this year competed for fun, Lexi Clark entered on a mission. Her mother says she plans to race as long as she can. Justin's fraternal twin brother Jared, who is unaffected by the disease, also races to raise funds and awareness for GAN.\n\nClark, whose family lives in Texas but who attended Vanderbilt University and helped organize the Nashville Kids' Triathlon this year, says her kids have raised $150,000 for research, mostly through sponsorship for completing triathlons.\n\n\"If they can stay weight-bearing, then they can slow progression of the disease,\" Clark said of her children, \"so it's important we keep [them] as active as possible.\"\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFor more information about giant axonal neuropathy, visit Justinstriumph.org.\n\nKids\u2019 triathlon competitor Lexi Clark (Photo: Submitted )\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2014/06/14/kids-race-triathlon-fight-rare-disease/10532929/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sister, brother both affected by giant axonal neuropathy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Sister, brother both affected by giant axonal neuropathy.", "title": "Kids race in triathlon to fight rare nerve disorder", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2014/06/14/kids-race-triathlon-fight-rare-disease/10532929/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sister, brother both affected by giant axonal neuropathy.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d985dd064282de03e3641f7f22054a79ef058802/c=0-122-1196-1318&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg", "title": "Kids race in triathlon to fight rare nerve disorder", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37afe659b5e6abe56d216f4348892a571a3fae7e/c=0-101-1196-1697/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5a16e608c2224a278220590aedbf9ac9105fb03b/c=0-122-1196-1318/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9280f82a633c3dc22822b0add43be5c3a849cc1f/c=0-450-1196-1347/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f97a9a6250fa30d01f46d8bce8f615abab1cc76d/c=0-562-1196-1236&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-14T23:59:37.587000-05:00", "shorthed": "Kids race in triathlon to fight rare nerve disorder", "articleid": 10532929, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8fd19f2ce06b379dba40b842aa11da2bd3c4945/c=0-562-1196-1236/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9835ea9578f0e6231cd7d952a5c48b273980ca9/c=90-0-1102-1800/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/14/photo-172.jpg"}, "author": "Alisha Foster", "title": "Kids race in triathlon to fight rare nerve disorder", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca44c\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Submitted)At the Nashville Kids' Triathlon on Saturday, 9-year-old Lexi Clark was aiming for more than a medal.\nSo while most of the 750 kids in the Nashville Kids' Triathlon this year competed for fun, Lexi Clark entered on a mission.\nKids\u2019 triathlon competitor Lexi Clark (Photo: Submitted )Read or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2014/06/14/kids-race-triathlon-fight-rare-disease/10532929/\nBut they did, and now Lexi and her brother Justin, 13, are both fighting the progressive nerve disorder.\n\"Her brother [Justin] didn't have trouble walking until he was 11.\""}
