'Twas the night before Caucus and all through the States

Voters were gauging campaigns and debates

Trump was ahead by a fairly wide margin

'Til smarmy Ted Cruz decided to barge in



Some voters saw Trump as a welcome outsider

While others believed him a nasty divider

Like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, Trump set out to win

He huffed and he puffed like a cocky kingpin



If your name was Rodriguez, Ortiz or Garcia

You thought you were living in North Korea

A woman who covered her head like a nun

Was no doubt a terrorist hiding a gun



Trump’s bromance with Putin was causing a stir

With the GOP leadership which seemed to concur

That Russia was neither an ally nor friend

Trump’s Putin crush should come to an end



Republicans panicked knowing ahead

Their chances of winning the White House were dead

Was anyone left who Trump hadn’t trashed?

Could the party recover without being thrashed?



Reince Priebus was desperate and fit to be tied

And so he took charge and yelled out and cried

"Now Marco, Now Carly, Now Christie and Rand,

On Carson, On Bush, On Kasich and Graham



"There must be a way to defeat and expose

This billionaire bully for his hateful prose

If we can’t convince voters it’s all propaganda

I guess we should pick up and all move to Canada"
