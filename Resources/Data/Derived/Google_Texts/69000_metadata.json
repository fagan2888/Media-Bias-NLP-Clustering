And the repeat overdose calls alone are nearly three times what the overall total was for July 2014.\n\nChief Stephen Krivjanik with Manatee County Public Safety Department\u2019s EMS Division called July 2015\u2019s numbers \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\n\"That includes -- and this really was shocking to me -- 35 repeat overdose cases just in the month of July,\u201d Krivjanik said Thursday afternoon during Manatee Tiger Bay Club\u2019s meeting in Bradenton. \u201cSo that means they overdosed, went around the corner and overdosed again. Got out and overdosed again. So that just illustrates the impact that this addiction has on these folks.\"\n\nSo far this year, 1,008 doses of Narcan (naloxone) have been administered by EMS, some to repeat overdose patients, he said.\n\nPublic safety officials say part of the problem is that heroin is now relatively inexpensive.\n\nThe Manatee County Sheriff's Office says heroin is selling for about $15 a dose, while prescription pain pills are going for about $20 to $25 on the street.\n\nHeroin users who are debriefed by law enforcement say they\u2019re seeking out heroin that\u2019s being laced with opioids, according to Capt. Todd Shear with the sheriff\u2019s special investigations division.\n\n\"Today what we're seeing is opiods and other things such as Fentanyl being placed in there,\u201d Shear said. \u201cAnd just to tell you a little more about Fentanyl, it's 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and it's 50 more times more potent than heroin. It's some serious, serious stuff -- really bad stuff -- and when you're mixing it with heroin, you can see where it's going to end up.\"\n\nHe said that's why many heroin overdoses in Manatee County have been deadly.\n\nEmergency responders say 911 calls for heroin overdoses have jumped more than 1,500 percent since last summer.\n\nLottie Watts is a reporter and producer with WUSF in Tampa.
