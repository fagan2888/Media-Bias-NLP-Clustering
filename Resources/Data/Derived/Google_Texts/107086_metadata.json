Most exchange customers received an advance tax credit, which was applied to their monthly premium throughout 2014.\n\nWhen they applied for their coverage and the tax credit, they had to provide an estimated household income, which determined the size of their tax credit.\n\nIf their income turned out to be more then they estimated, they might have to pay back part or all of the credit, which would likely be done through a reduction in their tax refund.\n\nWithin a week they should receive, or already have received, a document from the federal government stating the the amount of their tax credit, and containing the information they need to fill out their tax return.\n\nMore details can be found here.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care", "title": "Obamacare tax return impact: most can simply check a box", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare tax return impact: most can simply check a box\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/obamacare_taxes_tax_return.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/taxesjpg-bc91615960679f37.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15074965\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-29T14:31:34Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"health care\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/10842362-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "description": "The upcoming tax filing season will be the first in which Americans deal with the requirement to have health insurance.", "card": "summary", "site": "@pennlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 29, 2015,  9:31 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/taxesjpg-bc91615960679f37.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The upcoming tax filing season will be the first in which Americans deal with the requirement to have health insurance.", "title": "Obamacare tax return impact: most can simply check a box", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/obamacare_taxes_tax_return.html", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_penn.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, January 29, 2015,  9:30 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "The upcoming tax filing season will be the first in which Americans deal with the requirement to have health insurance."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cff\"", "article_summary": "But about 75 percent will simply have to check a box on their tax return indicating they have coverage, according to federal officials who spoke to reporters Wednesday about tax return implications of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nWhen they applied for their coverage and the tax credit, they had to provide an estimated household income, which determined the size of their tax credit.\nMost exchange customers received an advance tax credit, which was applied to their monthly premium throughout 2014.\nIt will be more complicated for people who obtained coverage through the online marketplaces known as exchanges, and who obtained an advance tax credit to help cover the cost of their coverage.\nWithin a week they should receive, or already have received, a document from the federal government stating the the amount of their tax credit, and containing the information they need to fill out their tax return."}
