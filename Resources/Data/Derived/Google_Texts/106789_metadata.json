It seems the government of President Xi Jinping is so determined to crack down on dissent that it is even willing to stifle commerce and scientific research.\n\nGovernment censorship has been a fact of life in China for many years. But the country has imposed even more burdensome controls on the Internet in recent months by blocking online libraries, text messaging applications and cloud computing services, including those provided by American companies like Google.\n\nFor example, the government has made it very hard to use web services that were previously available, like Google Drive, which many businesses use to share documents among employees. And virtual private networks that allow employees to log on to their corporate servers remotely have also come under attack. These restrictions follow on the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to block Google\u2019s search engine and some Western news sites, including The New York Times.\n\nGroups that monitor Chinese censorship say the intensified clampdown is part of the policy unveiled in a speech Mr. Xi gave to propaganda officials in August 2013, a few months after he took charge, in which he described the Internet as a \u201cbattleground\u201d on which the Communist Party \u201cmust not be marginalized.\u201d Losing control over public opinion, especially among young people, has been a serious fear. Mr. Xi\u2019s latest effort against the Internet and the media is also about consolidating his power in the party.\n\nThe tougher line will certainly make it harder for foreign companies to do business in China \u2014 one American executive told The Times the new controls were \u201ca frustrating and annoying drain on productivity.\u201d But multinational businesses can work around these restrictions by, for example, moving some executives outside China, as companies like General Motors have done recently.\n\nMost Chinese people and businesses, however, cannot easily get around these controls. They will have a harder time getting access to information stored on foreign computer servers or communicating with people outside China.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere has always been tension between pursuing economic development and maintaining the party\u2019s control over how people communicate with one another and with outsiders. It is only getting worse.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140927143007, "twitter": {"description": "Businesses, researchers and ordinary people are finding it hard to complete even basic and innocuous tasks.", "title": "Beijing\u2019s Internet Crackdown Hurts the Chinese Economy", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/opinion/sunday/beijings-internet-crackdown-hurts-the-chinese-economy.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003142642"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/opinion/sunday/beijings-internet-crackdown-hurts-the-chinese-economy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003142642", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/opinion/sunday/beijings-internet-crackdown-hurts-the-chinese-economy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "The Great Firewall Gets Bigger", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 27, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "China,Computers and the Internet,Censorship,Editorials,Xi Jinping,Enterprise Computing", "news_keywords": "China,Censorship,Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Xi Jinping", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Businesses, researchers and ordinary people are finding it hard to complete even basic and innocuous tasks.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Businesses, researchers and ordinary people are finding it hard to complete even basic and innocuous tasks.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-10-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Enterprise Computing", "published": "2014-09-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "China", "slug": "28sun3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141002154025, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/opinion/sunday/beijings-internet-crackdown-hurts-the-chinese-economy.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Businesses, researchers and ordinary people are finding it hard to complete even basic and innocuous tasks.", "title": "Beijing\u2019s Internet Crackdown Hurts the Chinese Economy"}, "pdate": 20140927, "des": "Enterprise Computing", "articleid": 100000003142642, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Beijing\u2019s Internet Crackdown Hurts the Chinese Economy", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22c7\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Xi\u2019s latest effort against the Internet and the media is also about consolidating his power in the party.\nMost Chinese people and businesses, however, cannot easily get around these controls.\nThese restrictions follow on the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to block Google\u2019s search engine and some Western news sites, including The New York Times.\nAnd virtual private networks that allow employees to log on to their corporate servers remotely have also come under attack.\nThey will have a harder time getting access to information stored on foreign computer servers or communicating with people outside China."}
