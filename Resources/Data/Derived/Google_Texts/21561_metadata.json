At least it seemed that way. At the time there were meetings and workouts and commercial shoots, flight after flight after flight. Mudiay was living at a breakneck pace just a couple of months after being drafted seventh overall by the Nuggets.\n\nHeading into his rookie season Mudiay wanted the big bang, a splashy first season. He knew there would be growing pains. But he would not shy away from any player, he would not back down from any challenge. He hasn\u2019t.\n\nBut slower has been better, even if it took him a while to realize it.\n\nAs Mudiay looks back on his rookie season \u2014 which has 20 games remaining \u2014 he\u2019s never been more clear on that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to play, relax,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nPoint guards know his plight. Kyle Lowry chuckled as the question was asked.\n\nHow difficult is it to learn being a point guard in the NBA?\n\n\u201cIt takes a while, it\u2019s a process,\u201d said Lowry, an all-star point guard with the Toronto Raptors. \u201cIt takes a while for you to get a feel for the NBA. It took a while for me to figure it out. It\u2019s a hard position to learn quick.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because Russell Westbrook is screaming down the lane at you. Because Chris Paul is hounding you, digging to get a steal. Because Stephen Curry is raining 3-pointers from 40 feet. Because Lowry is putting constant pressure on you to keep you out of the lane.\n\nAnd while Mudiay was trying to adjust to elite competition, he also had to run his team.\n\n\u201cThe speed, the contact of the game, making sure you know who to get involved and when to get them involved and how to get yourself involved,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cAnd still have the assertiveness of being a good point guard. It\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nDetroit Pistons point guard Reggie Jackson, a Palmer High School graduate, simplified everything down to one goal.\n\n\u201cWin. Just win,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou have all different ranges of point guards in this league. As long as you win, nobody cares.\u201d\n\nMudiay hasn\u2019t gotten to the winning part. The Nuggets are 24-38 and will miss the playoffs for the third consecutive season. To get there, Mudiay still must go through the learning process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s had some ups and downs,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cBut that was to be expected, being a rookie, first year, 19 years old in the West.\u201d\n\nPlaying time reduced\n\nThere had been stern talks with Malone, requesting Mudiay to reduce his turnovers and eliminate bad shots. Nothing out of the ordinary for young players needing to exorcise bad habits.\n\nBut then, after an eight-game losing streak, Mudiay barely played in the fourth quarter of a Dec. 3 game at Toronto, and didn\u2019t get any minutes down the stretch. The Nuggets won. Then, a carbon copy of that in the next game at Philadelphia on Dec. 5. The Nuggets won again. Malone talked about finishing games using players he trusted. Mudiay was on the outside of that group, which ate at him.\n\nThen came a couple of uninspiring performances before an ankle injury shelved him for nearly a month. The true pivot point of Mudiay\u2019s season, Malone said, had arrived. Mudiay watched. He began to understand what was truly meant by slowing down. He studied his own team and players on other teams. Then he and Malone talked again.\n\nMore aggressive now\n\n\u201cHe was either going to rebound, come back and have a very good rookie season, or he was going to go down further,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe had a couple of very honest, open, heart-to-heart talks. I didn\u2019t try to tell him things that he wanted to hear, I told him things he needed to hear. I told him you have a choice, you can feel sorry for yourself or you can just continue to work harder and commit yourself that much more to the game.\u201d\n\nMudiay buckled down. He scored in double figures in 10 of the next 11 games and looked more aggressive, more focused. He is averaging 23.5 points, 7.0 assists and 5.0 rebounds in his past two games, looking every bit the elite player the Nuggets believe they drafted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been most impressed about Emmanuel,\u201d Malone said. \u201cFor a 19-year-old kid, to kind of go through the adversity that he was going through, he bounced back in a big way. That gives me so much hope and excitement for the future.\u201d\n\nGiven an opportunity to think about it, Mudiay pinpointed the most difficult challenge of his first season in the NBA.\n\n\u201cI think just trying to get people to buy in, being a point guard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get people\u2019s respect.\u201d\n\nMudiay has made progress in that department. Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried said he is seeing Mudiay, who turned 20 on Saturday, grow \u201cinto a better point guard, a leader on the floor.\u201d Malone has continually praised Mudiay\u2019s growth in the game over the last month.\n\nMudiay shrugs that off, saying he still has far to go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still growing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s the main thing.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nDALLAS AT DENVER 3 p.m. Sunday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Chandler Parsons:\n\nThe forward has cranked up his play of late, and when he gets going, the 6-foot-10 shooter is difficult for anyone to handle. He scored 28 points on 12-of-17 shooting, including three 3-pointers, in his last game, a 104-101 Dallas loss to Sacramento on Thursday. He had 27 points in the Mavs\u2019 122-116 win over Denver on Feb. 26 in Dallas. He is averaging 13.6 points and 4.4 rebounds and is shooting 49.9 percent from the field and 42.3 percent from the 3-point line. Parsons has a player option at the end of this season, so he could hit the market as a free agent.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nMavericks:\n\nDallas has won four straight regular-season games against the Nuggets and five of the last six. They beat the Nuggets in overtime Feb. 26 to take a 2-0 lead in the season series.
