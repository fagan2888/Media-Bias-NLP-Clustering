Lanier Anderson then questioned Windham about the government\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in curbing unintended pregnancies \u2014 the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s stated purpose for the federal law \u2014 and the \u201cadverse health outcomes that an unintended pregnancy\u201d can bring.\n\nWindham quickly reminded the judge that the government has exempted many other employers, but not religious nonprofits like EWTN that had undisputed faith-based beliefs opposing the use of contraception.\n\n\u201cThirty-four million others are being exempted by the government,\u201d she said.\n\nOther Options\n\nMeanwhile, the health-care exchanges, established under the Affordable Care Act, which also authorized the contraceptive mandate, \u201ccould be made available to the 350 EWTN employees,\u201d said Windham.\n\nShe asserted that the government had failed to effectively explain why it had not taken this path.\n\nFinally, she noted that the government spent an estimated $300 million annually for family planning and concluded that the government could amend Title 10 regulations to provide EWTN employees with access to free birth control \u2014 another possible solution the Obama administration has not pursued.\n\nEWTN does not object to the government offering these services to employees who want them, Windham emphasized. But the Catholic media company \u201cobjects to providing contraception on its insurance plans and objects to the government coming in and taking over a part of its insurance plan.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s accommodation for nonprofits like EWTN requires that the employer write a letter confirming that it wants to opt out for religious reasons.\n\nBut EWTN, and other Catholic employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor, argues that writing such a letter serves to trigger services it opposes on moral grounds.\n\nThe government has consistently challenged such legal arguments, and, while two of the 11th Circuit judges appeared sympathetic to EWTN\u2019s free-exercise claims, they may still conclude that the government accommodation was adequate.\n\nThat said, John Manos, EWTN\u2019s general counsel, said he was heartened by the judges\u2019 questions and comments. Not only did they press the government lawyer to prove that the White House had no other option for providing the contraceptive services to EWTN, Judge Anderson also expressed concern that employees who objected to contraception had no opt-out plans available to them.\n\n\u201cNews media talks about EWTN imposing its objections on women who want these services,\u201d Manos told the Register.\n\n\u201cBut there is another question: Where do individuals who don\u2019t want to pay for this go to get their health insurance?\u201d\n\nThe Legal Context\n\nBack in 2012, EWTN was among the first Catholic nonprofits to file a legal challenge to the HHS mandate. That initial lawsuit was dismissed on technical grounds, and after it was filed again, a lower court ruled against EWTN.\n\nThe company obtained an emergency injunction from the 11th Circuit to shield it from financial penalties it would incur if it failed to comply with the mandate.\n\nBut while EWTN waited for its appeal to be heard by the circuit court, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark free-exercise ruling in favor of a for-profit plaintiff, Hobby Lobby, in a key HHS mandate case.\n\nHobby Lobby\u2019s victory has posed a fresh challenge to the Obama government, which had insisted that for-profit companies had no free-exercise rights. Hobby Lobby successfully argued that that the federal law, which had excluded for-profit companies from its narrow religious exemption, imposed a substantial burden on the company\u2019s religious freedom.\n\nBut EWTN, like the Little Sisters of the Poor and other nonprofit plaintiffs in such cases, faces a slightly different and more challenging test. It must show that the government\u2019s interim final rule, or accommodation \u2014 which does not require the media company to directly approve or pay for the mandated services \u2014 still violates its rights, as protected under RFRA.\n\nDuring the oral arguments, Joshua Salzman, the Obama administration\u2019s lawyer, argued that the White House accommodation was valid and EWTN had failed to prove that the provisions of the accommodate violated its religious freedom.\n\nThe government, said Salzman, had \u201cbent over backwards to accommodate religious freedom.\u201d\n\nQuestions for the Administration\n\nStill, Judge Anderson pressed Salzman to explain why the White House could not provide an alternative path for EWTN employees to obtain contraception.\n\nThe government lawyer responded that women need to receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, adding that, when health services are not readily available or cost money, usage goes down, and health problems increase.\n\nAny alternative, he insisted, would not work, \u201cbecause it [places] burdens upon the female employees of EWTN.\u201d\n\nJudge Gerald Tjoflat asked the lawyer if \u201cthe government policy covers all women.\u201d\n\nSalzman acknowledged not all women are covered, but said that the government is trying to cover everyone. The judge asked how many women were not covered, and Salzman hesitantly responded, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s millions.\u201d\n\nJudge Tjoflat wondered why so many women had not been reached, given the stated importance of access to contraception. He also questioned what would happen if an uninsured woman was forced to go to the marketplace for coverage but opposed the available health plans due to religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that information,\u201d replied Salzman, who looked visibly shaken at the line of questioning.\n\nBecket Fund senior counsel Mark Rienzi, who was present for the oral arguments, told the Register that the 11th Circuit panel appeared relatively sympathetic to EWTN\u2019s claims and that the government lawyer was under pressure to defend the administration\u2019s position.\n\nIt could take up to six months for the 11th Circuit to deliver its ruling. And Rienzi said it is very likely that one or more lawsuits brought by nonprofit plaintiffs could be decided by the Supreme Court \u2014 though not during the current term.\n\nWhat\u2019s at Stake\n\nBut as the 11th Circuit began its deliberations, Michael Warsaw, EWTN\u2019s CEO, said the threat posed by the HHS mandate remains clear and unambiguous.\n\n\u201cThis is about the broader issue of religious freedom,\u201d Warsaw said.\n\n\u201cWe have a right to be able to bring our faith to bear on everything we do, on every aspect of our lives,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.\n\nMichelle Fritz writes from Atlanta.\n\nCatholic News Agency also contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legal counsel for the Catholic network presented oral arguments in support of its challenge to the\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "Legal counsel for the Catholic network presented oral arguments in support of its challenge to the federal contraception mandate.", "title": "EWTN Takes Its Appeal in HHS Mandate Lawsuit to 11th Circuit", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/ewtn-takes-its-appeal-in-hhs-mandate-lawsuit-to-11th-circuit/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/Michael_Warsaw_11_Circuit_Court_CNA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/ewtn-takes-its-appeal-in-hhs-mandate-lawsuit-to-11th-circuit/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/Michael_Warsaw_11_Circuit_Court_CNA.jpg", "description": "Legal counsel for the Catholic network presented oral arguments in support of its challenge to the federal contraception mandate.", "card": "summary", "title": "EWTN Takes Its Appeal in HHS Mandate Lawsuit to 11th Circuit"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, 11th circuit, becket fund for religious liberty, ewtn, hhs mandate, hobby lobby, little sister of the poor, michael warsaw, obama administration", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "ATLANTA \u2014 Today, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta heard oral arguments in EWTN Global Catholic Network\u2019s legal challenge to the federal contraception mandate.\nIt could take up to six months for the 11th Circuit to deliver its ruling.\nWhat\u2019s at StakeBut as the 11th Circuit began its deliberations, Michael Warsaw, EWTN\u2019s CEO, said the threat posed by the HHS mandate remains clear and unambiguous.\nThe company obtained an emergency injunction from the 11th Circuit to shield it from financial penalties it would incur if it failed to comply with the mandate.\nThe government has consistently challenged such legal arguments, and, while two of the 11th Circuit judges appeared sympathetic to EWTN\u2019s free-exercise claims, they may still conclude that the government accommodation was adequate."}
