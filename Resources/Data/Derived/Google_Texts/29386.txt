Speaking on The View on Wednesday, actress Whoopi Goldberg threatened to leave the United States if Donald Trump is elected president. While she's not entirely sure where she would actually go, she expressed displeasure with Trump's views and said that she would like to vote for a candidate that actually fixes things rather than blames a person or group for society's problems.

In 2000, many celebrities posited that they would leave the country if George W. Bush were elected. Only one actually followed through.
