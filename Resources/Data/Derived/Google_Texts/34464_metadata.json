As he showed his audience, the acrimony is even seeping into GOP political ads.\n\nKimmel set up the current scenario in Washington by taking a shot at the Democratic side as well. \u201cEarlier today President Obama said he was hopeful an agreement would be reached tonight,\u201d the host said, \u201cbut then again he was also hopeful that the Obamacare website would work and that isn\u2019t really happening.\u201d\n\nHe described the discord between moderate and tea party Republicans before showing a new ad in which two conservatives stand side by side and explain what their party stands for. \u201cWe\u2019re Republicans,\u201d the graying moderate says. \u201cWe believe in the principles America was built on: capitalism, free enterprise, individual initiative. We believe that every American should have the opportunity to succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept for the ones that snuck over the border to take our jobs,\u201d the upstart tea partier cuts him off by saying. Things only get more tense from there, with the younger Republican jumping in with comments about the \u201chalf-breed\u201d in the Oval Office and calling his colleague a \u201cCommie.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, that did it, you fucking nutjob!\u201d the moderate says, before physically attacking the tea partier. The party\u2019s new slogan says it all: \u201cThe Republican Party: Let\u2019s Bring America Together.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via ABC:\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the government shutdown grinding on into its third week and the debt ceiling deadline fast approaching, Jimmy Kimmel noticed on his show last night just", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/JK1.jpg", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Sums Up \u2018Major Rift\u2019 in GOP: \u2018That Did It, You F*cking Nutjob!\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the government shutdown grinding on into its third week and the debt ceiling deadline fast approaching, Jimmy Kimmel noticed on his show last night just how big the \"rift\" in the Republican Party has grown.
