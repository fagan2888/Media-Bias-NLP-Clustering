Stine said one violation was a \"threat of violence\" toward one of the Interfraternity Council's leaders.\n\nA woman also reported being fondled and groped at the Kappa Sigma fraternity house on April 12, 2015, according to Boulder police records.\n\nFraternity leaders are concerned primarily about safety at events and parties hosted by the two chapters, Stine said.\n\nFraternity party registration\n\nMembers of the Interfraternity Council must register all parties, which means fraternity leaders and police do walk-throughs at most events. They also frequently hire third-party security and emergency medical personnel for large parties and create risk-management plans.\n\nThe Interfraternity Council also has banned hard alcohol at functions and all chapters \"go dark\" on traditionally party-heavy holidays like Halloween and St. Patrick's Day.\n\nThey also worry that any negative event that occurs at the two ousted chapters will damage the reputation of the Greek community at large, even though local fraternities cut ties with them.\n\n\"There's a belief that if, God forbid, there was a significant incident at one of those two chapters, the nuance of membership in the IFC might be lost on the university, the Boulder community and in the media,\" Stine said.\n\nSororities seeking 'community input'\n\nStephanie Baldwin, a university employee who works with sororities, said the groups will discuss the letter as a community, likely when classes resume.\n\n\"They will not make a public stand unless they have community input,\" she said. \"There's plans moving forward to get together and have a discussion.\"\n\nOfficials at Kappa Sigma international headquarters declined to be interviewed and instead sent an emailed statement.\n\nThe local chapter unsuccessfully appealed its expulsion from the Interfraternity Council, according to executive director Mitchell Wilson.\n\n\"The chapter and our local alumni are pursuing disciplinary action in accordance with our rules against individuals who are alleged to have violated our code of conduct, including removal from membership in some instances,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nMichael Ayalon, executive director of Sigma Pi, acknowledged that the Boulder chapter had \"some issues,\" but is working with the international organization on a rebuilding plan.\n\nAyalon said eventually Sigma Pi will reapply for membership in Boulder's Interfraternity Council.\n\nHe declined to comment on the Interfraternity Council's warning to sororities, saying he is focused on the chapter moving forward.\n\n\"We did a full membership review, which basically consists of finding out who shares the values of the organization and removing those members who do not share the values of the organization,\" he said.\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url":
