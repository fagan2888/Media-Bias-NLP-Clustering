AdColony helps marketers place video ads across a network of Apple iOS and Android mobile applications, such as those published by ABC News and A&E Networks.\n\nOpera is paying $75 million in cash for AdColony, plus potential earn-out payments of up to $275 million, Opera said.\n\nAccording to Mahi de Silva, CEO of Opera\u2019s Mediaworks unit, the purchase reflects his company\u2019s focus on so-called \u201crich media\u201d and interactive ad experiences, as opposed to mobile banner ads which large brand marketers have never invested heavily in.\n\n\u201cTaking the banner ad and shrinking it 70 percent has not proved a very fruitful experience for consumers or advertisers,\u201d Mr. de Silva explained. \u201cOur customers are asking for better ad units and better inventory, so this is opportunity to better augment our platform,\u201d he added.\n\nThere are no shortage of ad networks and brokers offering access to mobile video ads. But AdColony says its major selling point is its \u201clow-latency\u201d ad serving technology. In other words, it\u2019s figured out a way to load video ads quickly, which is especially important when delivering them to mobile devices with relatively slow connections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve focussed on eliminating the pain points of mobile advertising,\u201d said AdColony CEO Will Kassoy, who will now additionally take on the role of Chief Marketing Officer of Opera Mediaworks.\n\nFollowing the acquisition AdColony will operate as a subsidiary of Opera Mediaworks and continue to serve its existing customers, which include both mobile app publishers and major ad agencies.\n\nMeanwhile Opera hopes it can cross sell its ad offerings to AdColony customers. It\u2019ll also help it reach more users.\n\n\u201cThis is a scale company that\u2019s coming into Opera. It really helps expand not just our value proposition but also our reach,\u201d Mr. de Silva concluded.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Browser manufacturer and mobile ad company Opera is acquiring AdColony to bolster its mobile video ad capabilities.", "title": "Opera Buys Mobile Video Ad Firm AdColony", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/24/opera-buys-mobile-video-ad-firm-adcolony/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DJ753_opera__P_20140623232735.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Opera Buys Mobile Video Ad Firm AdColony", "description": "Browser manufacturer and mobile ad company Opera is acquiring AdColony to bolster its mobile video ad capabilities.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Jack Marshall", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "Browser manufacturer and mobile ad company Opera is acquiring AdColony to bolster its mobile video ad capabilities.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-24T15:45:34-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/24/opera-buys-mobile-video-ad-firm-adcolony/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-944", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Browser manufacturer and mobile ad company Opera is acquiring AdColony to bolster its mobile video ad capabilities.", "title": "Opera Buys Mobile Video Ad Firm AdColony", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/24/opera-buys-mobile-video-ad-firm-adcolony/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DJ753_opera__P_20140623232735.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-944", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-24T15:45:34-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceab4\"", "article_summary": "Browser maker and mobile ad company Opera is acquiring AdColony to bolster its mobile video ad capabilities.\nThere are no shortage of ad networks and brokers offering access to mobile video ads.\nAdColony helps marketers place video ads across a network of Apple iOS and Android mobile applications, such as those published by ABC News and A&E Networks.\n\u201cOur customers are asking for better ad units and better inventory, so this is opportunity to better augment our platform,\u201d he added.\nOpera is paying $75 million in cash for AdColony, plus potential earn-out payments of up to $275 million, Opera said."}
