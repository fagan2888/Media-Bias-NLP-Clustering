First Lady Michelle Obama is challenging the uninsured in Las Vegas to get covered before the health care deadline arrives.

Las Vegas is among 20 communities across the country participating in the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to get their uninsured constituents covered. Other communities participating in the challenge include:

Atlanta, GA

Milwaukee, WI

Charlotte, NC

Nashville, TN

Chicago, IL

New Orleans, LA

Dallas, TX

Oakland, CA

Denver, CO

Philadelphia, PA

Detroit, MI

Phoenix, AZ

Great Falls, MT

Richmond, VA

Kansas City, MO

Salt Lake City, UT

Seattle, WA

Long Beach, CA

Tampa, FL

The goal for each community is to sign up as many people as possible to help ensure that every American has health coverage. Las Vegas is one of the communities with the highest percentages of uninsured. Through this challenge, the White House hopes to change that.

The Department of Health and Human Services along with State-based Marketplaces will determine the winner of the challenge. The community with the highest amount of enrollment at the end of this third open enrollment period will get bragging rights, a healthier community and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success.

According to the White House, "As the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have taken effect, 17.6 million Americans have gained coverage, and, since 2010, we've reduced the uninsured rate in this country by 45 percent. The nation's uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever."

Consumers across the country can continue to explore their health insurance options by reaching out to a call center representative at 1-800-318-2596, attending enrollment events in the Las Vegas community, or visit HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov.
