But even when \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d which opened nearly every episode with a death, failed to provide uplift, there was some insight other than that suffering is no fun. \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d in its early episodes, does an expert job of sketching out a brutal world much like our own. It\u2019s done a terrible job of convincing us why we ought to care.\n\n\u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d based on the Tom Perrotta novel of the same title, takes place three years after the events of \u201cOctober 14,\u201d a cataclysmic day on which 2 percent of the world\u2019s population simply disappeared; no explanation is provided in the novel or so far in the series, and none is needed. But the show needs to, as it goes on, give us something other than the unremitting misery of the Garvey family. All four members of our central clan were effectively broken by the experience of the 14th: Dad, the town\u2019s police chief, is falling apart, not least because his son\u2019s gone AWOL to follow a religious leader, his daughter\u2019s off partying in scenes imported from a different show, and he\u2019s forced to deal with the law-enforcement issues around the cult Mom joined, one whose members take vows of silence and smoke constantly.\n\nJustin Theroux (a \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d alumnus) does a serviceable job as Kevin Garvey, with some pretty lame material. He punches a framed picture of his once-perfect family on the wall at one point, and later on grows enraged at a toaster. He\u2019s not a character yet, just the personification of rage, and it feels a bit easy: If Kevin\u2019s not in touch with his emotions, the writers don\u2019t have to deal with those emotions yet. (The novel gives us access to his internal monologue, without which he just seems like a ragey lump.) We aren\u2019t allowed to get to know his wife, played by Amy Brenneman, really, but that\u2019s by design. Her membership in the Guilty Remnant and that group\u2019s odd bylaws \u2014 following those citizens who are just trying to move on with lives to mutely watch them, cigarettes in hand \u2014 and murky endgame are the show\u2019s most interesting ideas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new HBO drama about the Rapture is intensely gloomy -- but underneath all its brooding, it has nothing to say", "title": "\u201cThe Leftovers\u201d confuses darkness for depth", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The new HBO drama about the Rapture is intensely gloomy -- but underneath all its brooding, it has nothing to say", "title": "\u201cThe Leftovers\u201d confuses darkness for depth", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/the_leftovers_confuses_darkness_for_depth/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/leftovers2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new HBO drama about the Rapture is intensely gloomy -- but underneath all its brooding, it has nothing to say", "title": "\u201cThe Leftovers\u201d confuses darkness for depth", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/leftovers2.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, HBO, justin theroux, the leftovers, Tom Perrotta, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d in its early episodes, does an expert job of sketching out a brutal world much like our own.\nJustin Theroux (a \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d alumnus) does a serviceable job as Kevin Garvey, with some pretty lame material.\nWe aren\u2019t allowed to get to know his wife, played by Amy Brenneman, really, but that\u2019s by design.\nTopics: HBO, justin theroux, the leftovers, Tom Perrotta, TV, Entertainment NewsIt\u2019s tempting, given the network\u2019s rich back catalog and the sense it fosters of being self-consciously different from the rest of television, to compare each new HBO series to the ones that came before.\nBut the show needs to, as it goes on, give us something other than the unremitting misery of the Garvey family."}
