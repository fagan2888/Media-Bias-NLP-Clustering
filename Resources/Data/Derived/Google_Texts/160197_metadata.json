Rick Scott has made health-care cost transparency a priority this year, and a Northeast Florida lawmaker is sponsoring a version of Scott\u2019s vision.\n\nSen. Rob Bradley (R-Fleming Island) has filed a bill would make average prices for common hospital procedures easily accessible to patients.\n\nListen to the version of the story airing on 89.9 WJCT\n\nOn Friday, James Riley anxiously waited for his wife to get out of surgery inside St. Vincent\u2019s hospital in Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cThey don't tell you what\u2019s what up front. Like my wife, she\u2019s having surgery, but I don't even know what the price is going to be \u2014 you know, my co-payment \u2014 I don't know yet,\u201d he said.\n\nRiley himself recently underwent surgery for cataracts. He says he didn\u2019t learn he had a $350 co-pay until he arrived to go under the knife. Had he known, he says he would\u2019ve been more financially prepared.\n\nIt\u2019s situations like Riley's that Sen. Rob Bradley (R-Fleming Island) says his bill aims to avoid.\n\n\u201cPeople purchase health care, but they often don't know what they\u2019re paying for it, and they have really no way to compare prices between different providers,\u201d Bradley says. \u201cSo it really isn't a true market-based system.\u201d\n\nUnder his bill, the state would create a claims database, a website using hospital pricing data, to inform patients about the average cost of common procedures.\n\nIt would also mandate hospitals give patients an itemized list of estimated costs upon request. If a hospital fails to do so, they\u2019d be fined.\n\nFlorida Hospital Association President Bruce Rueben says he supports all of that in principle, but he\u2019s vehemently opposed to a provision in Bradley\u2019s bill penalizing a provider with at least a $2,500 fine if a procedure\u2019s cost far exceeds the average price listed in the state database.\n\n\u201cThere isn't anything about the government getting involved in setting rates that would be helpful or productive,\u201d he says.\n\nRueben says the hospital association is more supportive of the House version of Bradley\u2019s bill, filed by Rep. Chris Sprowls (R-Palm Harbor). If passed, Sprowls\u2019s bill would have the same transparency requirements, but wouldn\u2019t levy penalties against providers if their prices exceed posted averages.\n\nBradley wouldn't say whether he\u2019d be willing to nix his penalty provision to match the House version.\n\nPhoto used under Creative Commons license.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida Gov.
