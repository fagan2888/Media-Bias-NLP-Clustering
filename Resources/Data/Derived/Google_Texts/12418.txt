Shortly before Interfaith Medical Center was to submit a final closure plan for approval by the judge overseeing its bankruptcy case today, the Brooklyn hospital's legal team was told by New York state health officials that state funding was on its way.

The surprise move by the state Department of Health gives Interfaith more time and money to remain open. The amount of money and the length of the reprieve is still being worked out, said a spokeswoman for Interfaith.

On Friday, weeks of mediation among Interfaith's unions, creditors, management and New York State officials appeared to have failed. The court was expected to file a closure order today. Interfaith would have started to shut operations on Jan. 7. The bankruptcy court already approved the transfer of some of Interfaith's outpatient facilities to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center.
