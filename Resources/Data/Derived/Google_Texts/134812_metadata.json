LOUIS, MO (KTVI)-- ConnectCare, a healthcare hub for the less fortunate in St. Louis, confirms it will close its doors on November 15th. The move comes on the heels of layoffs and cuts that were supposed to allow them to maintain the busy Smiley Urgent Care Center on Delmar. Those cuts, apparently, did not work.\n\nAnnette Weaver is 99 years old, and was shocked by the news that this place, where she has been coming for so long, would soon be shuttered.\n\n\u201cWell it meant a lot to me because this is the only place I\u2019ve been coming for years,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just surprised that they\u2019re gonna leave here.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. It was August that the non-profit announced nearly 100 layoffs and the end of specialty care they offered. But ConnectCare said the urgent care center and some other operations would keep going. At the time they said the State of Missouri\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid to comply with Obamacare was the reason they had to make cuts. The cuts apparently weren\u2019t enough.\n\nOfficials from ConnectCare wouldn\u2019t appear on camera or answer questions, but they did issue this statement from President and CEO Melody Eskridge:\n\n\u201cSt. Louis ConnectCare (ConnectCare) announced the closing of all operations effective close of business on November 15, 2013.\n\n\u201cConnectCare recently underwent a major restructuring of its services to concentrate on community health, urgent care and related services to reduce the amount of subsidy needed to support its care to the uninsured and underinsured in the region. Despite the restructuring, financial support for the organization was not moving forwardand the Board made the difficult decision to close.\n\n\u201cIn its last fiscal year ConnectCare provided over 19,000 specialty medical visits, 16,500 urgent care visits, 6,000 communicable disease encounters, 12,000 radiology exams, and filled 34,000 prescriptions.\n\n\u201cWith the downsizing announced in August, ConnectCare expected to, and was on track to provide 23,000 medical visits, 10,000 radiology exams, and 25,000 prescriptions to approximately 17,000 people.\u201d\n\nThey did not say how many people would lose their jobs.\n\nPatients at the Delmar location are frustrated. Many aren\u2019t sure where they will go next.\n\n\u201cFor the elderly people in the area it\u2019s very important because they don\u2019t have to go so far out,\u201d Linda Dean said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s kind of a shame to have to move it out. I wish it could stay open.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ST.
