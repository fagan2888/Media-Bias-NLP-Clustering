Supporters say abstinence is the only guaranteed way to avoid that. Esteban Felix/AP\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 would eliminate funding for abstinence-only education.\n\nThe bulk of federal funding for school programs that encourage waiting until marriage to have sex currently comes from the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama\u2019s signature legislative achievement set aside $50 million in annual funding for abstinence education block grants to states through fiscal year 2014. The grant program would end if the budget proposal becomes law.\n\nThe proposed budget, unveiled Tuesday, would also discontinue $5 million in annual funding for the Competitive Abstinence Education program, which provides grants to specific pro-abstinence programs. That funding was approved for two years in the fiscal year 2012 budget.\n\nDespite signing both funding streams into law, Obama does not support abstinence-only education. The issue has been a budgeting tug-of-war since he took office, with the president's effort to eliminate such spending hindered by Republicans in Congress.\n\nThe block grant program \u2013 originally funded by the 1996 Welfare Reform Act \u2013 was eliminated in the fiscal year 2010 budget, passed when Democrats held a majority in the House of Representatives. But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, successfully resurrected the grant program months later by attaching it to the health care law in committee.\n\nSupporters of school-provided lessons that teach students how to reduce the risk of pregnancy and venereal disease if they have sex were glad to see the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the budget eliminates funding for abstinence-only sex education, while continuing investments in comprehensive sex education programs that provide young people with accurate information to make responsible decisions about their health,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards, in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with Congress to see these investments protected.\u201d\n\nBut advocates of abstinence-only education doubt the funding cut will stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Valerie Huber, president of the National Abstinence Education Association. \u201cEvery year the president sends his budget over to Congress he proposes the elimination of sexual risk avoidance programs. For six months in the last two terms he was successful and the rest of the time Congress chose to ignore that request.\u201d\n\nHuber says states generally don\u2019t contribute much money toward sex education or pro-abstinence programs and rely on federal funding for those classes. She also says before Obama took office abstinence programs enjoyed bipartisan support.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "sex education", "title": "Obama's Budget Proposal Slashes Obamacare Abstinence Grants", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Abstinence-only education is here to stay, supporters say.", "title": "Obama's Budget Proposal Slashes Obamacare Abstinence Grants", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/03/05/obamas-budget-proposal-slashes-obamacare-abstinence-grants", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/4d/c5/1825bd6047ba8a256055fe3efa71/140305-abstinence-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Abstinence-only education is here to stay, supporters say.<br>", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's Budget Proposal Slashes Obamacare Abstinence Grants"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "March 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Steven Nelson,Steven Nelson,Pulse,Collections: Political,Collections: US,K-12 education,sex,sex education", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Abstinence-only education is here to stay, supporters say."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f1c\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement set aside $50 million in annual funding for abstinence education block grants to states through fiscal year 2014.\nEsteban Felix/APPresident Barack Obama\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 would eliminate funding for abstinence-only education.\nThe proposed budget, unveiled Tuesday, would also discontinue $5 million in annual funding for the Competitive Abstinence Education program, which provides grants to specific pro-abstinence programs.\nShe also says before Obama took office abstinence programs enjoyed bipartisan support.\nOpponents of abstinence-only education say students can avoid pregnancy and disease if they know how to safely have sex."}
