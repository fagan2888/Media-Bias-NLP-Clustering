Ted Cruz\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff Nick Muzin, who blamed Ebola on President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nOther controversial voices in the Ebola conversation include radio personality Rush Limbaugh, who, according to Flournoy, recently told his 14 million listeners that Obama refused to ban flights from Ebola-infected countries because he wants white Americans infected with the disease as payback for slavery.\n\nAndrew Lewis, an assistant political science professor at UC, stated that comments like these are largely due to a broader political landscape in which the opposite party always dissents from the party in leadership.\n\n\u201cRepublicans largely think that President Obama\u2019s handling of politics is poor, but the out party always believes that. It\u2019s simply a partisan effect,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nShaunak Sastry, a department of communications assistant professor, says that the idea of public health as an institution has always ended up on the issue of controlling what Sastry calls \u201cthe native bodies,\u201d or bodies that are stigmatized or considered lesser because of their disease.\n\n\u201cThe history of public health has roots in controlling the savage body,\u201d Sastry said. \u201cThe very suggestion of Ebola being an airborne disease is reminiscent of the idea of \u2018bad air\u2019, especially used in reference to places like Africa or India.\u201d\n\nSastry also spoke to the larger history of the perception of Africa being a place of poverty and disease in the eyes of U.S. media, and how these portrayals tamper with the native understandings of the native colonies where these diseases are present.\n\nWalter Baker, a first-year UC student, said that while a lot of measures have been taken to prevent Ebola from becoming widespread in the U.S. \u2014 from airports scanning travelers for the virus to actions such as sending medical assistance from the U.S. and European countries to West African countries \u2014 there is still a sense of alarm in the U.S. media.\n\n\u201cThere are certain media spots that have called this an epidemic in America; they have blown the cases that have been brought to America,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThey kind of made a bit of a panic in the sense of people worrying that this virus would be the next swine flu.\u201d\n\nEmily Hoff, a first-year nursing student, agreed with this statement, but likewise believes that the issues are not being reported in the areas where the issue hits hardest.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably being blown out of proportion, with the thought of it being spread throughout the United States or a concern to the United States,\u201d Hoff said. \u201cOn the same page I don\u2019t think they are giving enough information to what is actually happening in West Africa where it actually is an epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe event concluded with a questionnaire with the speakers.\n\nThroughout the representation of Ebola in the media, Flournoy concluded that only one thing must be remembered in one\u2019s research.\n\n\u201cNever trust The Man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The News Record", "description": "While concerns of the Ebola virus swirl around media outlets, University of Cincinnati professors examined and debated the portrayal of the illness through the lenses of journalism, political science, communications and African studies.", "title": "UC professors examine multiple perspectives of Ebola in the media", "url": "http://www.newsrecord.org/news/uc-professors-examine-multiple-perspectives-of-ebola-in-the-media/article_2aab74f0-6876-11e4-8073-ab23a7b71aab.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newsrecord.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/03/803b3a4a-6876-11e4-af1c-9b06d48690e1/546010f73b7db.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NewsRecord_UC", "card": "summary"}, "description": "While concerns of the Ebola virus swirl around media outlets, University of Cincinnati professors examined and debated the portrayal of the illness through the lenses of journalism, political science, communications and African studies.", "fb": {"admins": 73522214945, "app_id": 493985217293682}, "keywords": "ebola,media,news,campus,city,nation_world", "news_keywords": "ebola,media,news,campus,city,nation_world"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb07e\"", "article_summary": "Throughout the representation of Ebola in the media, Flournoy concluded that only one thing must be remembered in one\u2019s research.\n\u201cThe Dallas media tends to base their Ebola reporting on what elected officials say,\u201d Flournoy said.\nWhile concerns of the Ebola virus swirl around media outlets, University of Cincinnati professors examined and debated the portrayal of the illness through the lenses of journalism, political science, communications and African studies.\nCraig Flournoy, a UC journalism professor, opened the discussion \u2014 which was held on Wednesday in the Senate room of the Tangeman University Center \u2014 by detailing the coverage of Ebola in Dallas, Texas, versus its representation nationally.\n\u201cRepublicans largely think that President Obama\u2019s handling of politics is poor, but the out party always believes that."}
