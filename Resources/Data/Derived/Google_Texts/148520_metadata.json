We also need to talk about the effect that hydraulic fracturing is having on the communities where it\u2019s taking place, and to ask whether that cost \u2014 to people\u2019s health and property \u2014 is too high.\n\nThe main barrier to that conversation, of course, is that it\u2019s one the industry definitely doesn\u2019t want to be having, aside from insisting that fracking is safe. Michelle Bamberger, a veterinarian, and Robert Oswald, a professor of molecular medicine at Cornell, believe differently, and they have the research to back up their claims. The two have documented cases of contaminated water and air, of sick pets and dying livestock and of similar symptoms experienced by the animals\u2019 owners, all with few apparent explanations. And that, the researchers, argue, is the real scandal: It\u2019s up to the people being affected, and not the industry causing the damage, to prove that something\u2019s wrong.\n\nIn \u201cThe Real Cost of Fracking: How America\u2019s Shale Boom is Threatening Our Families, Pets and Food,\u201d Bamberger and Oswald share the stories of people whose lives have been affected \u2014 and in some cases, destroyed \u2014 by fracking, in a way that aims to open up the conversation to what\u2019s at stake. \u201cSimply put,\u201d they write, \u201cwe are not certain of the public health implications of large-scale industrial oil and gas drilling.\u201d The effects we are seeing, they add, are being seen most prominently in animals, children and oil and gas workers: the ones who, because they are so sensitive to hazards from gas operations, end up serving as the canaries in the coal mine.\n\nBamberger and Oswald spoke with Salon about the challenges of studying the health risks of fracking, and about why they believe the evidence they\u2019ve found is enough to make us seriously question whether they\u2019re risks worth taking. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat got you started investigating this aspect of fracking?\n\nMB: We heard about this issue about five years ago when we read in our local paper about a community group that was going through all the leases and just plotting out where surface and mineral rights were leased in the county. It made it really easy to know where you were and who your neighbors were that were leased \u2014 the land that was leased around you. We\u2019re out in the country, about 15 minutes from Ithaca, and we saw that we were surrounded by farmers who owned 100 acres or more of land and had leased. The way compulsory integration works in New York is that if you are in a land unit, which is usually one square mile, that is 60 percent or more leased, then your land could be drilled under.\n\nSo that got us really interested in the issue, because we\u2019re not leased, but we would be drilled under. So we thought, we\u2019d better start paying attention to this. So we started attending meetings and learning more about it. And in the process, I started hearing about cases in Pennsylvania where animals were becoming ill, and no one was trying to figure out why, or owners didn\u2019t know why, or their vets didn\u2019t know why. That\u2019s what pulled me into it; and for Robert\u2019s part, I think I can speak for him, he started getting involved with it from looking at the documentation I was starting to collect.\n\nWas it hard to find people who were willing to speak about the experiences they\u2019re having?\n\nMB: I started to get emails from people who knew I was a veterinarian who were local farmer-type people up here in New York who had connections with people in other states through the farming groups. So they started putting me in contact with people, and I started to become known as a vet who was interested in looking into these cases and starting to document them, and that\u2019s how I got pulled into this.\n\nWhat are some of the more shocking things you turned up?\n\nMB: I can think of one particular occasion \u2014 this was in Louisiana in April 2009 \u2014 and that was the one where the cattle were exposed to hydraulic fracturing fluid and they died within an hour. What was shocking about that was that these are animals, which are over 1,000 pounds, and it takes something pretty powerful to knock them out, that they\u2019re exposed to it and then dead in just an hour. That really grabbed me by the neck, because what I\u2019ve been reading about was usually cattle exposures, where even if it\u2019s pretty toxic, it\u2019s one to three days. One to three days is pretty fast, actually, but within an hour is pretty amazing. So I think that was the most amazing thing that I heard of with these cases. Robert is shaking his head in agreement.\n\nRO: I think that was the most dramatic case we had. We had a lot of cases that were interesting but that was a dramatic one.\n\nMB: Robert, the other answer you give for this is the case where we were sitting at the kitchen\u2026\n\nRO: That wasn\u2019t dramatic but it had a big effect on me, let\u2019s put it that way. We went to visit some people and they had actually had some documented contamination on their land and their cows were quarantined. And we\u2019re just sitting in their dining room, which is off their kitchen, and you can look through their kitchen window and all you can see out their kitchen window is a well pad. We look outside the dining room window and about 10 feet away from it is a driveway, and that\u2019s the access road to the pad. So I realized for these people, all this drilling and fracking and everything, it was right on top of their house. These people had several hundred acres and they didn\u2019t want them to put the pad there, but the company insisted on putting the pad right by their house. That was a thing that was really early on and it really struck me as something that I just didn\u2019t understand \u2014 how people could live with that, and how the companies could actually do that.\n\nWould you say that all adds up to these people\u2019s lives being dominated, or ruined, by drilling operations? Or is it just that we\u2019re not hearing enough about any of these things that are happening?\n\nMB: I think their lives are in many cases being dominated, and I think that\u2019s true especially in the cases when people lose their water \u2014 we all know what it\u2019s like when our electricity goes out or our power goes out and we can\u2019t run our spigot. To have that be all the time, how do you compensate for that? What do you with water that\u2019s not good, and you can\u2019t drink it and maybe you can\u2019t even bathe in it? You\u2019re getting rashes, you\u2019re getting ill \u2014 it really does turn your life upside down and it does dominate it. We have one woman we described in our book who said, \u201cI go to sleep thinking of water. I wake up thinking of water. Every minute is thinking of water.\u201d It just made me realize that we take so much for granted. But this is huge: When you have to think of every drop, counting exactly how much water you\u2019re going to need and how much you\u2019re going to use and think of your community and think of your neighbors, it\u2019s really overwhelming. It\u2019s hard to really understand. We got a little bit of a taste of it when we went and visited these people and spent some time with them, but I think no one could ever understand it unless you go through it.\n\nRO: You know, Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP, during the BP oil spill, he said he wanted his life back. That had such a hollow ring to it. These are people who really need their lives back, and they\u2019re not going to get it back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's natural gas boom has real consequences for children and animals, researchers tell Salon", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America's natural gas boom has real consequences for children and animals, researchers tell Salon", "title": "Fracking\u2019s untold health threat: How toxic contamination is destroying lives", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/02/frackings_untold_health_threat_how_toxic_contamination_is_destroying_lives/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/girl_fracking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's natural gas boom has real consequences for children and animals, researchers tell Salon", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/girl_fracking.jpg", "title": "Fracking\u2019s untold health threat: How toxic contamination is destroying lives", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Fracking\u2019s untold health threat: How toxic contamination is destroying lives", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, drilling, Editor's Picks, Energy, fracking, Gas Industry, Livestock, Pets, public health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd28\"", "article_summary": "What do you with water that\u2019s not good, and you can\u2019t drink it and maybe you can\u2019t even bathe in it?\nIt made it really easy to know where you were and who your neighbors were that were leased \u2014 the land that was leased around you.\nThese are people who really need their lives back, and they\u2019re not going to get it back.\nSo that got us really interested in the issue, because we\u2019re not leased, but we would be drilled under.\nWe went to visit some people and they had actually had some documented contamination on their land and their cows were quarantined."}
