Review boards composed of current and former public- and private-sector officials choose finalists among the nominations, who are then vetted by the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Federal Investigative Services. FIS performs background checks on federal employees and contractors.\n\nOne of the 2014 Distinguished Rank winners (David J. Wineland from the Commerce Department) won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nEach year, OPM publishes guidance on the Presidential Rank Awards for agencies, including the nomination deadlines, eligibility, criteria and the evaluation process. The fiscal 2015 guidance, published in December 2014, contains two paragraphs on Page 12 regarding recognizing award recipients. \u201cUpon notification by OPM, agencies should immediately inform award recipients of their selection; however, agencies shall not make any public announcement or hold any ceremonies in honor of the award winners,\u201d the guidance stated. \u201cOPM will advise agencies if publicity is authorized.\u201d The same language is in OPM\u2019s fiscal 2014 guidance on the awards.\n\nSome, including Bonosaro, viewed that guidance as banning agencies from publicizing their winners. But OPM denied the White House or the Office of Management and Budget specifically instructed it to tell agencies not to advertise winners. An OPM spokesman said that \u201cthe president believes in the value of the Presidential Rank Award program,\u201d but added that while the agency \u201cjoins the president in strongly supporting the recognition of some of our federal government\u2019s best and brightest, we are also sensitive to the financial challenges faced by so many Americans in recent years, and consequently asked federal agencies to be judicious in conducing celebratory events or announcements that may appear insensitive to those who may be continuing to experience tough economic times.\u201d\n\nThe Agriculture Department, General Services Administration, and Navy were among the agencies that mentioned their 2014 winners in press releases or blog posts. But other than the publicity generated by the annual spring black-tie event SEA hosts for the winners at the State Department, there\u2019s not much mention of the honorees online or elsewhere. The Presidential Rank Awards page on OPM\u2019s website offers a brief description of the program, and some relevant links. The latest list of finalists is from 2013. The 2014 winners apparently were mentioned during the president\u2019s December 2014 meeting with senior executives \u2013 the first of his presidency.\n\nBonosaro said President Ronald Reagan used to present the awards in person in the 1980s. She described a brief ceremony, where winners received their pins, certificates, and a picture with the president, followed by a \u201cpunch and cookies\u201d reception. \u201cSomeone said many years ago, \u2018Gee, is that all there is?\u2019 \u201d Bonosaro recounted. \u201cSo, that\u2019s how we started the banquet, and when I think about it, people would be thrilled if that were all there is right now,\u201d she added, referring to President Reagan\u2019s personal appearance.\n\nIn May 2014, the White House reinstated the Presidential Rank Awards after canceling them in 2013 \u2013 the first time that has happened since the program was created in the late 1970s. The White House cited budget cuts and furloughs caused by sequestration and the need to belt-tighten across government as the reason for scrapping the awards that year, a move SEA denounced as a morale buster.\n\nOnly 1 percent of the SES is eligible to receive the rank of Distinguished Executive and 5 percent of the corps is eligible to receive the rank of Meritorious Executive. Winners of either the Distinguished or Meritorious award cannot receive the same rank award more than once in five years. However, since the 2013 finalists did not receive awards, they were eligible for re-nomination in fiscal 2014, and several finalists and winners were repeat nominees.\n\nPerhaps because of shrinking budgets and the spotlight on senior executive bonuses in recent years, particularly at the Veterans Affairs Department, the number of annual Presidential Rank Award winners has decreased over the last few years. Twenty-four civil servants received the 2014 Presidential Distinguished Rank Award compared to 46 recipients in 2012, the last year the prizes were handed out. There were 54 top winners in 2011, and 66 in 2010.\n\nIn fiscal 2014 there were 7,014 career senior executives in the federal government; the 2014 Distinguished Rank Award winners represented 0.34 percent of that total, while Meritorious Rank Award recipients composed 1.27 percent, according to statistics from SEA. The last time the percentage of Distinguished Rank Award winners was at 1 percent was 2009.\n\nBonosaro said the administration\u2019s reluctance to tout the winners is a \u201clost opportunity,\u201d given the public\u2019s dismal view of government. \u201cI mean, this is a chance to say, \u2018Look at what your government has done for you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe 2014 winners have saved the government more than $32 billion, according to SEA.\n\n(Image via Vacclav / Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "The Obama administration has been somewhat mum on the Presidential Rank Award winners, probably because of the bonuses.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "The Obama administration has been somewhat mum on the Presidential Rank Award winners, probably because of the bonuses.", "title": "Why Isn't the White House Touting Its Top Senior Executives?", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/05/why-isnt-white-house-touting-its-top-senior-executives/113107/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/18/051815whitehouse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration has been somewhat mum on the Presidential Rank Award winners, probably because of the bonuses.", "creator": "@klunney", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/18/051815whitehouse/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Why Isn't the White House Touting Its Top Senior Executives?", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-18T20:25:36Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/18/051815whitehouse.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Why Isn't the White House Touting Its Top Senior Executives?", "keywords": "performance award, bonuses, ses bonuses", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/05/18/051815whitehouse/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-long,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration has been somewhat mum on the Presidential Rank Award winners, probably because of the bonuses."}, "article_summary": "The Presidential Rank Awards page on OPM\u2019s website offers a brief description of the program, and some relevant links.\nThe last time the percentage of Distinguished Rank Award winners was at 1 percent was 2009.\nOne of the 2014 Distinguished Rank winners (David J.
