He also said there\u2019s a difference between news programming and talk radio programs.\n\nIn a follow-up statement, Finken called the Burgum campaign\u2019s claims \u201cridiculous and petty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been a guest host on a variety of radio talks shows over the years including frequent appearances on the What\u2019s On Your Mind radio show,\u201d he said. \u201cI do so out of a love for politics, not because I am on someone\u2019s payroll.\u201d\n\nFederal Communications Commission filings show Odney placed advertising orders for Stenehjem this year.\n\n\u2018Abundantly clear\u2019\n\nFinken said there\u2019s no legal or regulatory disclosure required of a guest or guest host, and he said that talk radio show hosts often share their points of view.\n\n\u201cThat said, I did make it abundantly clear that I am a supporter and had offered the fact that I am working for the Stenehjem campaign in previous appearances on the talk show,\u201d he wrote. In an April 6 appearance as a guest host, Finken was introduced as a consultant to the Stenehjem campaign before he interviewed Stenehjem and his running mate, state Sen. Nicole Poolman, according to an online recording.\n\nBut Harms said federal rules mean \u201cthe public is entitled to know whether they are listening to a bona fide news program, and when they\u2019re listening to a paid political advertisement.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Finken added that he \u201cwould be happy to disclose my relationship with the Stenehjem campaign in any future appearances.\u201d\n\nScott Hennen, the regular host of What\u2019s on Your Mind, said Finken\u2019s working relationship with the Stenehjem campaign has previously been disclosed. He added that he would welcome a Burgum campaign adviser to host the show if they showed the radio skills to do so.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, if (Finken) is talking about the Stenehjem campaign, it only makes sense to let people know that he is an adviser to the Stenehjem campaign,\u201d Hennen said.\n\nHennen added that both Burgum and Stenehjem will be on the show, which he said is broadcast on four stations across the state, this week.\n\n\u201cWe're glad to have Pat on board, and, if it's that important to their campaign, I'm sure Pat would be more than happy to disclose his relationship to our campaign on future talk show appearances,\u201d a statement from Stenehjem\u2019s campaign manager Nate Martindale said.\n\nDisclosure\n\nBurgum and Stenehjem are in the midst of a heated battle for an open governor\u2019s seat on the Republican side of the aisle. Incumbent Republican Jack Dalrymple is not running for another term.\n\nStenehjem won the Republican Party\u2019s endorsement at the state convention in Fargo earlier this month, but Burgum is going to the primary election in June. Burgum has been running television ads critical of \u201ccareer politicians\u201d and pointing to North Dakota\u2019s $1.1 billion shortfall.\n\nMonday morning\u2019s radio interviews included discussions with state Rep. Roscoe Streyle and Insurance Commissioner Adam Hamm, both Stenehjem supporters. Streyle discussed the state\u2019s budget and criticized Burgum for running \u201cdishonest\u201d ads, while Hamm\u2019s segment included talk of a Burgum advertisement that claims Stenehjem supported the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that he\u2019s not a supporter of the law,\u201d Hamm said.\n\nAt one point of the show, Finken noted a listener who emailed into the show felt it was \u201clopsided\u201d and not fair to Burgum.\n\n\u201cThe voters of North Dakota are getting deluged with well over $1 million, probably $1.5 million worth of advertising, just to make this point,\u201d he said during the show, according to recording available online. \u201cPart of what this show is about today is to give the Legislature a chance to weigh in on this and talk about what happened and why they\u2019re where they\u2019re at, and it\u2019s not as dire as maybe you may be get led to believe by the paid advertising piece of this.\u201d\n\nLater in the show, Finken said he got a text from a Stenehjem supporter wondering if he should disclose \u201cthe fact that I\u2019m a Wayne supporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I guess that would be kind of obvious, but I thought I better disclose I am a Stenehjem supporter for a lot of reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is that I\u2019ve known the guy since the \u201870s, we were friends since we were kids and this is a quality guy. But for full disclosure, just in case there was any question: I am a Stenehjem supporter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,North Dakota,news,North Dakota,doug burgum,wayn stenejem,governors race,Election 2016", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Hageman", "og": {"site_name": "The Dickinson Press", "description": "GRAND FORKS -- The gubernatorial campaign for Fargo businessman Doug Burgum raised criticisms Monday over radio interviews conducted by a paid consultant for the campaign of his opponent, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem.
