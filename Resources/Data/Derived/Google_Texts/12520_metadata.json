We're on the hook for the promise,\" Joe Gifford, chief executive for Providence-Swedish Health Alliance, said earlier this year.\n\nBenchmarks are tied to costs, including hospital readmissions and the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nEmployees in Puget Sound rate the new plan highly, according to Tedino.\n\nEmployees who participated in focus groups this summer gave the plan a satisfaction rating of 85 percent and nearly all said they would stay with the plan in 2016, he said.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nIn Puget Sound, approximately 27,000 employees and their dependents, along with 3,000 retirees, were eligible to sign up.\n\nFor employees in Charleston and St. Louis, the benefits save employees from $350 per year to well over $1,000 per year depending on family size and other factors. Employees who select the preferred partnership also have no copayment for office visits to a primary care physician and will have no copayment for generic drugs.\n\nOther benefits include: Same-day or next-day appointments for urgent primary care needs or appointments within three days for urgent specialty care needs; electronic messaging with their care provider; a Boeing-dedicated customer service center that patients can reach by phone, email or online; a Boeing dedicated nurse line offering 24-7 consultations; online and mobile access for scheduling primary care appointments and reviewing test results; and proactive provider support for preventive care and chronic disease management.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/boeing-grows-health-plan-adds-health-networks-charleston-st-louis", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Boeing-747-plane-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Aviation giant Boeing has added Roper St. Francis Health Alliance in Charleston, South Carolina and Mercy in St. Louis to its health plan, according to a Boeing spokesman, as the company continues to grow its in-house benefits network.", "title": "Boeing grows health plan, adds health networks in Charleston, St. Louis"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Boeing-747-plane-feature.jpg"}, "title": "Boeing grows health plan, adds health networks in Charleston, St. Louis", "description": "Aviation giant Boeing has added Roper St. Francis Health Alliance in Charleston, South Carolina and Mercy in St. Louis to its health plan, according to a Boeing spokesman, as the company continues to grow its in-house benefits network.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Aviation giant Boeing has added Roper St. Francis Health Alliance in Charleston, South Carolina and Mercy in St. Louis to its health plan, according to a Boeing spokesman, as the company continues to grow its in-house benefits network.&#13; Earlier this year, Boeing entered into direct contracts with Providence-Swedish Health Alliance and UW Medicine in Washington for its Puget Sound employees.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Aviation giant Boeing has added Roper St. Francis Health Alliance in Charleston, South Carolina and Mercy in St. Louis to its health plan, according to a Boeing spokesman, as the company continues to grow its in-house benefits network.\nEarlier this year, Boeing entered into direct contracts with Providence-Swedish Health Alliance and UW Medicine in Washington for its Puget Sound employees.\nStarting in 2016, Boeing employees have the option of staying with a traditional plan or choose Boeing's preferred partnership plan, which gives them access to networks through Roper St. Francis Health Alliance or the Mercy Health Alliance.\nWe're on the hook for the promise,\" Joe Gifford, chief executive for Providence-Swedish Health Alliance, said earlier this year.\nBoeing remains among the few employers that negotiate directly with providers for a health plan that saves money for the company and its employees."}
