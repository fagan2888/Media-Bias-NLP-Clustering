But even within the Obama administration, Clinton was urged to label the group as terrorist.\n\nDiplomats in the State Department, the CIA and the FBI all urged Clinton to put Boko Haram on the official terrorist list. Lawmakers from both sides of the isle also urged Clinton to act on Boko Haram.\n\nOn May 24, 2012, then Senators Scott Brown (R-MA), Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) and James Risch (R-ID) introduced the \u201cBoko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2012.\u201d The act urged then Secretary of State Clinton to justify why Boko Haram would not be classified as such based on seven points they submitted, including the bombing of the UN facility where 21 people died; bombs attacking worshipers on Christmas day 2011 where 41 people were killed; Boko Haram\u2019s 2010 support of al-Qaeda and threats to the U.S.; and current and former officials of the U.S. and Britain referring to Boko Haram as a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned that Boko Haram\u2019s tactics, targeting and fundraising operation appear to be increasingly international in scope, including within the U.S. homeland,\u201d then-Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R) and Patrick Meehan (D), chairman of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, wrote in a March 2012 letter to Clinton.\n\nRelated: Why Boko Haram Might Be Impossible to Stop\n\nBecause she\u2019s the Democratic frontrunner, the questions about whether Clinton should have labeled the group terrorists aren\u2019t going away. But a close examination of the group at the time, and the reasons why she didn\u2019t, show that the decision she made was the right one. Here are three reasons why:\n\n1. The Nigerians didn\u2019t want it. According to Robert Jackson, the principal deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan didn\u2019t want the group to be labeled as a FTO.\n\n\u201cThe government of Nigeria feared that designating these individuals and the organizations would bring them more attention, more publicity and be counter productive,\" Jackson told a Senate subcommittee earlier this month. \"For some time we accepted that point of view.\u201d\n\n2. It would have been ineffective. The FTO designation allows the United States to prohibit American businesses from doing business with the group, as well as prohibits American citizens from funding it. Because the group has no economic ties to the Untied States, these tools would have been ineffective.\n\nAll the FTO would have done was raise the profile of the group. It\u2019s not as if the United States was idle in the early fight against the group; it increased aid to Nigeria and sent FBI agents there to help.\n\nRelated: Libyan Mission Over, But U.S. Deeper into Africa\n\n3. At the time, the group posed no threat outside of northern Nigeria, and there was little evidence that it had connections to al Qaeda. Boko Haram is not one of the four groups that al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has granted the al Qaeda tag. Al Qaeda has even condemned the group for the kidnappings.\n\nBoko Haram has more similarities to a gang than an organized terror group like al Shabaab in Somalia and Kenya and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in North Africa. Its leader, Abubakar Shekau, is an Islamic radical, but most of the foot soldiers are young men with no futures fed up with endless cycles of poverty and government corruption.\n\n4. Getting into the anti-terrorism business with the Nigerian military is a losing proposition. The Nigerian military is responsible for a host of their own human rights abuses in their effort to eradicate the group. Providing anything more than information that could help locate the girls would be supporting these violations.\n\nAs the group grew more powerful, and the threat it posed leaked into Nigeria\u2019s neighbors, Clinton\u2019s successor John Kerry designed the group an FTO in November 2013. Suggesting that Clinton\u2019s failure to do so would contributed to the kidnappings is playing politics with a tragedy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for failing to formally designate Boko Haram as terrorists.
