The Kentucky Equality Federation, an agency that supports what it calls "marriage equality," issued a plea Saturday for Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to call a special session of the General Assembly to pursue impeachment of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis.

Minister Jordan Palmer, secretary-general of the federation, issued a release contending that actions of Davis to deny marriage licenses to gay couples defies Kentucky and U.S. court rulings.

Palmer said, "This violates the oath of office taken by Kim Davis and, if she cannot complete her job because of religious beliefs, then she should resign. Government is free of religion and religious beliefs. Perhaps Ms. Davis would be happier in a religious state such as Afghanistan, Iran, or Iraq."

Rowan County Clerk Davis has asked Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan to stay enforcement of a federal court ruling requiring Rowan to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.

In an emergency application, Davis asks Kagan to delay Judge David Bunningâ€™s order while her appeal is being considered by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court, which refused to issue a stay.

The application was filed with Kagan because she considers such requests from Kentucky and the three other states in the 6th Circuit.

Kagan voted with the 5-4 majority in June that required all states to recognize same-sex marriages.
