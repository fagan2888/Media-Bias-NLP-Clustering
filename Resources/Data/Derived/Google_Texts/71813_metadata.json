We turned it into an extremist far right party that is fundamentally anti-American.\n\nYou can\u2019t understand why the GOP was so successful in winning back both houses of congress in 2014, and wrecking most of what Obama has tried to do, unless you understand what we did back then.\n\nYou see, in the late 1960s Dad published the first of many best-selling evangelical books. When Dad toured Evangelical colleges and churches all over North America, I often accompanied him while Mom and Dad\u2014unbeknown to them at the time\u2014were gradually being elevated to Evangelical Protestant sainthood. This meant that a few years later when Dad took a \u201cstand\u201d on the issue of abortion, a powerful movement formed almost instantly inspired by his leadership, and the Evangelical-led \u201cpro-life\u201d movement (and the Religious Right) was born.\n\nMy father is still a hero to many Religious Right leaders, such as Dave Andrusko (editor of the National Right to Life News). In his review of two books on the history of the antiabortion movement, Andrusko notes that the antiabortion movement \u201cattracted people by building on the foundation established by theologian Francis Schaeffer. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of [Schaeffer\u2019s] book Whatever Happened to the Human Race? and [the 1970s] twenty-city film and lecture tour [undertaken] to awaken the evangelical community.\u201d\n\nBy the early 1980s the Republicans were laboring under the weight of a single-issue religious test for heresy: abortion. As I describe in my new book WHY I AM AN ATHEIST WHO BELIEVES IN GOD: How to give love, create beauty and find peace (and I hope offer an alternative to the harm we did) I was there\u2014and/or Dad was.\n\nWe were leaders participating in various meetings with Congressman Jack Kemp, Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush, Sr., when the unholy marriage between the Republican Party and the Evangelical Reconstructionist-infected \u201cpro-life\u201d community was gradually consummated. Dad and I\u2014as did many other Evangelical leaders like Jerry Falwell\u2014met one on one or in groups with key members of the Republican leadership quite regularly to develop a \u201cpro-life strategy\u201d for rolling back Roe v. Wade. (Senator Jesse Helms named Dad as his favorite author when asked by the American Spectator magazine to name his favorite books.)\n\nAnd that strategy was simple: Republican leaders would affirm their antiabortion commitment to Evangelicals, and in turn we\u2019d vote for them\u2014by the tens of millions. Once Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, \u201cwe\u201d would reverse Roe, through a constitutional amendment and/or through the appointment of antiabortion judges to the Supreme Court or, if need be, through civil disobedience and even violence, though this was only hinted at first. In 2016, the dream we had will become a reality unless America wakes up. The Republicans are poised to destroy women\u2019s rights. They have a majorty on the Court to back them to.\n\nWhen Evangelical and Republican leaders sat together, we discussed \u201cthe issue,\u201d but we would soon move on to the practical particulars, such as \u201cWill blue-collar Catholic voters join us now?\u201d (They did.) Soon Evangelical leaders were helping political leaders to send their message to the \u201cpro-life community\u201d that they\u2014the Republican leaders\u2014were on board.\n\nFor instance, I organized the 1984 publication of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s antiabortion book with Evangelical Bible publisher Thomas Nelson. Reagan\u2019s book had first appeared as an essay in the Human Life Review (Spring 1983). I was friends with Human Life Review founder and editor: brilliant Roman Catholic antiabortion crusader Jim McFadden. He and I cooked up the presidential project over the phone.\n\nThe president\u2019s book expressed his antiabortion \u201cviews\u201d as ghostwritten by McFadden in order to cement the Reagan \u201cdeal\u201d with the antiabortion movement. We called the book Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation. I suggested to Reagan\u2019s people that two Schaeffer family friends\u2014C. Everett Koop and Malcolm Muggeridge (a famous British writer/social critic and convert from Far Left politics to rabid Far Right Roman Catholicism with whom my father once led a huge pro-life demonstration in Hyde Park, London)\u2014provide us with afterwords to \u201cbulk out\u201d an otherwise too brief book, which they did within a week or two after I called them.\n\nOnce they were \u201con board,\u201d Republican leaders like Senator Jesse Helms and Congressmen Jack Kemp and Henry Hyde (to name but three whom I met with often, in Jack\u2019s case in his home, where I stayed as a guest) worked closely with my father and me, and we (along with a lot of other religious leaders) began to deliver large blocs of voters. We even managed \u201cour\u201d voters for the Republican Party by incessantly reminding our followers of \u201cthe issue\u201d through newsletters, TV, and radio broadcasts. For instance, I worked closely with James Dobson in the early days of his \u201cFocus on the Family\u201d radio program, and I was on his show several times. He offered my \u201cpro-life\u201d book A Time for Anger as a fund-raising fulfillment and distributed over 150,000 copies. The book eventually sold over half a million copies.\n\nNo one seemed to notice (or mind) that the Republicans weren\u2019t really doing anything about abortion other than talking about it to voters. And by the mid-to late 1980s the cause shifted: We Evangelicals paid lip-service to \u201cstopping abortion,\u201d but the real issue was keeping Republicans in power and keeping Evangelical leaders in the ego-stroking loop of having access to power.\n\nFast-forward thirty years to the early twenty-first century: The messengers, leaders, and day-to-day \u201cissues\u201d changed, but the volume and tone of the anti-government \u201cdebate\u201d and the anger in reaction to the Obama presidency originated with the antiabortion movement. To understand where that anger came from and who first gave voice to it, consider a few prescient passages from my father\u2019s immensely influential book (influential within the Evangelical ghetto, that is) A Christian Manifesto,which was published in 1981.\n\nAs you read these excerpts, bear in mind what would take place in the \u201chealth care debates\u201d over what came to be disparaged as \u201cObamacare\u201d thirty years or so after my father\u2019s book was read by hundreds of thousands of Evangelicals. Anti-health-care-reform rhetoric\u2014\u201dDeath Panels!\u201d \u201cGovernment Takeover!\u201d \u201cObama is Hitler!\u201d\u2014that the Far Right spewed in the policy debates of 2009 and beyond seemed to be ripped from the pages of Dad\u2019s and my writings. Note the ominous rhetorical shadow Dad\u2019s book cast over a benighted and divided American future, a future that produced the climate of hate that eventually spawned the murder of abortion providers such as Dr. George Tiller in Wichita in 2009. Here\u2019s a bit from Dad\u2019s writing on how the government was \u201ctaking away\u201d our country and turning it over to Liberals, codenamed by Dad as \u201cthis total humanistic way of thinking\u201d:\n\nThe law, and especially the courts, is the vehicle to force this total humanistic way of thinking upon the entire population.[1]\n\nAnd this:\n\nSimply put, the Declaration of Independence states that the people, if they find that their basic rights are being systematically attacked by the state, have a duty to try and change that government, and if they cannot do so, to abolish it.[2]\n\nThen this:\n\nThere does come a time when force, even physical force, is appropriate.A true Christian in Hitler\u2019s Germany and in the occupied countries should have defied the false and counterfeit state. This brings us to a current issue that is crucial for the future of the church in the United States, the issue of abortion.It is time we consciously realize that when any office commands what is contrary to God\u2019s law it abrogates its authority. And our loyalty to the God who gave this law then requires that we make the appropriate response in that situation.[3]\n\nIn other words, Dad\u2019s followers were told that (1) force is a legitimate weapon to use against an evil government; (2) America was like Hitler\u2019s Germany\u2014because of legal abortion and of the forcing of \u201cHumanism\u201d on the population\u2014and thus intrinsically evil; and (3) whatever would have been the \u201cappropriate response\u201d to stop Hitler was now appropriate to do here in America to stop our government, which Dad had just branded a \u201ccounterfeit state.\u201d\n\nIs it any wonder that to the Evangelicals running the Republican Party these days that they see themselves as the children of a revolution? Shutting down the government was nothing to these people. They see our government as the enemy, and they are running it. We were outsiders asking for change. The change came and now people as demented as I was are running the show.\n\nDad\u2019s books sailed under the radar of the major media, which weren\u2019t paying much attention to religious books despite the powerful influence they were having on the direction of American politics. Manifesto sold more than 1 million copies in Evangelical bookstores.\n\nDad and I were rewarded by the Republican leadership\u2014admittedly before some of Dad\u2019s fans were killing doctors but after we were spreading anti-government and anti-American venom\u2014for our \u201cstand.\u201d By the end of the 1970s the Republicans depended on agitators (or \u201cprophetic voices\u201d) like us to energize their rank and file.\n\nThey still do.\n\nMark my words, the subtext to the GOP assault on us in 2016 will be the extremism my family contributed to. For the Republicans the next election won\u2019t be about politics. it will be a holy war\u2013 again.\n\nFrank Schaeffer is a writer.
