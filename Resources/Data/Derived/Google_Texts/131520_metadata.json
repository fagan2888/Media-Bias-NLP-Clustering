South Dakota (40.8 percent), and Missouri (39.4 percent) are fourth and fifth place, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn the top five states, you tend to see a trend,\u201d Malm told Mississippi Watchdog. \u201cMississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee and some states like Missouri tend to be lower-income states on average, which means a lot of their people qualify for programs like Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAlaska gets the least amount of its general fund revenue (20 percent) from the federal government.\n\nSo what does this money buy?\n\nMuch of it is for public welfare programs such as Temporary Aid to Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and Medicaid. According to the General Accounting Office, the amount of this aid to states has skyrocketed \u2014 from $55 billion in 1977 to $284 billion in 2009. That\u2019s an increase of 417 percent.\n\nDon\u2019t expect that number to decline, especially in Mississippi. Medicaid requires a state contribution of 26.5 percent. With expanded income eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the state will spend more than $1 billion on Medicaid in fiscal 2016, an increase of more than 14 percent from fiscal 2015.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant has rejected calls to expand Medicaid in the state because, he has said, the state and any recipients of expanded coverage would be left wanting if Congress changed the ACA.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s contribution also continues to swell in education funding \u2014 from $27 billion in 1977 to $83 billion in 2009.\n\nAll of this largesse comes with a price.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing for these states to keep in mind is that when you\u2019re get a lot of federal funding, you\u2019re kind of at the whim of the federal decisions,\u201d Malm said. \u201cFor example, if during the most recent recession, if anything changed at the federal level, it could\u2019ve really impacted state budgets. States need to be cognizant of that and make sure they engage in responsible planning and responsible saving.\u201d\n\nGet regular updates on Mississippi through our Facebook or Twitter accounts", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Mississippi tops states for federal aid to state budgets, with Louisiana a close second.", "title": "Mississippi tops states in federal aid; Louisiana second - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/03/Mississippi_State_Capitol_building-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-14T08:32:36+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/192580/federal-aid/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "published_time": "2015-01-14T04:00:31+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mississippi.watchdog", "section": "Budget and Spending", "modified_time": "2015-01-14T08:32:36+00:00", "tag": "federal aid,Federal Government,Legislature,Louisiana,medicaid,Mississippi,State Spending,Tax Foundation,Tennessee"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Mississippi tops states for federal aid to state budgets, with Louisiana a close second.", "title": "Mississippi tops states in federal aid; Louisiana second - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/03/Mississippi_State_Capitol_building-1.jpg"}, "creator": "@Gulfcoastsage", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Mississippi tops states for federal aid to state budgets, with Louisiana a close second."}, "article_summary": "Louisiana was second, with 44 percent of its budget coming from federal coffers, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation.\nLiz Malm and Richard Borean of the Tax Foundation calculated the percentage of federal money in each state\u2019s budget by dividing general revenue by what states refer to as \u201cfederal intergovernmental revenue.\u201dAlong with Louisiana and Tennessee (41 percent), that gives the South three of the top five states in terms of getting federal money.\n\u201cIn the top five states, you tend to see a trend,\u201d Malm told Mississippi Watchdog.\nThe Magnolia State received 45.3 percent of its budget from the federal government, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nBy Steve Wilson | Mississippi WatchdogMississippi relies on federal help more than any other state."}
