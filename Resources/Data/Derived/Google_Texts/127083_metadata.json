This would be uncharted territory for the Bipartisan Working Group, an exclusive association with a straight-forward mission.\n\nThe members-only organization has succeeded since its founding during the 112th Congress in fostering interparty collegiality and legislative partnerships. It\u2019s provided opportunities for lawmakers to pitch ideas, find co-sponsors for initiatives and discover avenues for collaboration across the aisle.\n\nThe results have not been insignificant: Because of efforts from coalitions of members inside the group, three bills have passed the House and four policies have become law. But what the BPWG hasn\u2019t been able to do is reach unanimity on a single issue.\n\n\u201cThe first couple Congresses we didn\u2019t engage much on the tough stuff, right?\u201d Rep. John Carney, D-Del., asked BPWG Co-Founder and Co-Chairman James B. Renacci during a recent interview with CQ Roll Call. \u201cWe\u2019d just try to find simple stuff that people would agree on, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think every issue starts as bipartisan,\u201d the Ohio Republican replied. \u201cThe intention of it is to see if the Bipartisan Working Group can coalesce around it.\u201d\n\nBeing able to vote as a bloc on a piece of legislation would undoubtedly boost the BPWG\u2019s clout. Group members say that, more than anything else, would send a strong signal that bipartisan cooperation isn\u2019t dead on Capitol Hill. That\u2019s the goal.\n\nRenacci and Carney met as frustrated freshmen on the Financial Services Committee. At regular breakfast meetings, they'd bemoan mutual concerns that partisanship made it impossible for members of opposing parties to even have a constructive conversation, let alone work together to pass laws. Sensing a shared concern elsewhere in the House, they began inviting other members to breakfast.\n\nThe tradition of early-morning gatherings over coffee and pastries (which dues cover) endured once the BPWG was officially born.\n\nThe demand by Renacci and Carney for members to take the group seriously is what makes it unique among the congressional organizations that boast a feel-good, \u201cwhy-can\u2019t-we-all-just-get-along?\u201d vibe.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to say they\u2019re bipartisan,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cBelieve me, there are some people who want to be in the group but aren\u2019t in the group, because they wanted to be in the group in name only.\u201d\n\nAdmission is by invitation only, with current membership capped at 26 and an even partisan split. Second-term Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., wanted in as a freshman but had to wait for an opening until the start of this Congress.\n\nThe group meets every week Congress is in session, and every new member must sign a contract pledging to attend at least 75 percent of the time. \"Jim's a stickler for coming to meetings,\" Carney said.\n\nAnd then there are the rules of conduct: Every meeting is confidential unless 75 percent of members agree to make certain information public. That includes granting Roll Call access to report and write this story, plus admittance to one meeting that was off the record.\n\nCarney and Renacci have asked members to resign when they don't adhere to expectations.\n\nThe co-chairmen choose the members from their side of the aisle, considering years of service, legislative portfolio, political ideology and personality \u2014 specifically, who can work well with others.\n\nNone of Renacci's picks hail from the flame-throwing contingent of the House Republican Conference, unless you count Florida's Daniel Webster, who ran unsuccessfully for speaker in January and subsequently lost his Rules Committee slot.\n\nThe Republicans represent the more \"establishment\" wing of the conference. They include Patrick Meehan, Mike Kelly and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania; Susan W. Brooks and Larry Bucshon of Indiana; Andy Barr of Kentucky; Barbara Comstock of Virginia; Rodney Davis of Illinois; and David Joyce of Ohio. California's David Valadao and Nevada's Mark Amodei are notable for their tendency to vote with Democrats on immigration issues.\n\nMore than half the Democrats were elected in 2012: Bustos, John Delaney of Maryland, Derek Kilmer of Washington, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, Marc Veasey of Texas, Dan Kildee of Michigan and Scott Peters of California.\n\nReps. Mike Quigley of Illinois and Terri A. Sewell of Alabama, along with freshmen Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Kathleen Rice of New York, round out the group along with Vermont's Peter Welch, whom, with a laugh, Carney referred to as \"our liberal.\"\n\nCarney recalled that Welch was one of the only Democrats who dared speak on the floor in support of his bill, which clarified expatriate health insurance plans didn't have to comply with the Affordable Care Act's regulations for domestic policies. Democratic leaders were incensed one of their own members would take issue with any element of the health law and were working behind the scenes to sink the effort, he said.\n\nThe bill ultimately passed in the House and was later integrated into the year-end \"cromnibus\" spending bill.\n\n\"I will never, ever forget what he did,\" Carney said. \"It was pretty lonely, him and I just sitting up there.\"\n\nThis month, the group couldn't reach a critical mass on one path forward on the Highway Trust Fund, and Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill to fund state transportation projects through October \u2014 a bitter pill to swallow for most BPWG members. But the BPWG did make a small statement in the final vote breakdown for the three-month highway patch.\n\nWelch helped lead in efforts against short-term transportation and infrastructure bills, spearheading letters and pushing procedural maneuvers to force Congress to at least hold a vote on a multiyear proposal. When it came time to cast votes for the three-month bill at the end of July, Welch was joined in his opposition by BPWG members Moulton, Amodei, Barletta and Renacci, among just 34 votes against the short-term bill.\n\nCarney didn't vote, but lest he look like he didn't stand by a colleague who once stood by him, he later went to the floor to enter a personal explanation into the Congressional Record: Had he been present, he would have voted \"no.\"\n\nRenacci and Carney haven't given up on finding that elusive, uniting issue. They're thinking tax overhaul legislation, or what Congress will or won't do to increase the debt ceiling.
