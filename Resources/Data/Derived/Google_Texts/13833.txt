Automatic Data Processing, one of Augusta’s largest private employers, is trying to find a place for about 100 of its employees that will become part of a spinoff company.

ADP handles payroll and human resources functions for other companies. It also has a division that specifically deals with helping car dealers with management and marketing.

Well, the dealer services segment is going to be a company all by itself. ADP announced that in April.

About 100 of the 990 people that work in Augusta’s ADP facility are in this division.

Dave Brendza, vice president and general manager at Augusta, said the company is working with the Augusta Economic Development Authority on finding a spot in Richmond County for that division once it becomes it own publicly-traded company. (The name of it hasn’t been picked yet.)

Brendza said the EDA was helpful to ADP locating in Augusta in 2007 and found it temporary quarters while the main campus was being built in west Augusta.

Dealer services is about 16 percent of ADP’s quarterly revenue. The company said it expects to gain $700 million from the spinoff, which it will use to buy back some of its owns stock. The new company is supposed to be formed by the end of the year.

Having two companies allows ADP to concentrate on payroll and HR outsourcing.

While 100 people will be leaving the Augusta ADP campus, about 70 more will be looking for desks, Brendza said. That’s going to be from a pilot project concentrating on the Affordable Care Act.

There’s still a little bit of room in Augusta. It has 990 workers, but the building can accommodate 1,250.

Brendza was talking about the personnel moves Thursday during a state High Demand Career Initiative meeting at Georgia Regents University that concentrated on technology jobs. State development officials were in Augusta to “listen” to Augusta tech companies describe what they need for their workforce.
