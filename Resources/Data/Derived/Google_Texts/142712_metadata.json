Terry Branstad, of Iowa, who calls the health care law \u201cunaffordable and unsustainable,\u201d yet something he has to implement by law. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it work as best we can for the people of Iowa.\u201d\n\nOklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, said many governors still have concerns about the program, but that outright repeal would be \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\nAs governors from both parties gathered in Washington this weekend, some GOP governors echo Fallin, reporting that a full repeal of the law would be complicated at best, if not impossible, as states move forward with implementation and begin covering millions of people \u2014 both by expanding Medicaid rolls for lower-income residents or through state or federal exchanges that offer federal subsidies to those who qualify.\n\nRepublican opposition to the law is the centerpiece of the GOP\u2019s political strategy ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nDespite a troubled rollout, nearly 3.3 million people have signed up through Feb. 1 for health care coverage under the law. The White House reported that 1 million people signed up nationwide for private insurance under the law in January alone. It remains unclear that the administration will reach its unofficial goal of 7 million people by the end of March, but it still expects several million enrollees by then.\n\nA recent Associated Press analysis of the sign-ups found that six Republican-led states \u2014 Florida, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin \u2014 were on pace or better than the states had initially projected.\n\nMichigan Gov. Rick Snyder is among several Republican governors who expanded their state\u2019s Medicaid laws under the law.\n\n\u201cThe whole dialogue on the Affordable Care Act is about people fighting, causing gridlock and a mess, instead of working on something important like wellness,\u201d Snyder said, adding that he still has \u201ca lot of issues\u201d with the overhaul. \u201cBut it is the law, so I\u2019m trying to work in that context.\u201d\n\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, said governors spent about half of their private lunch session on Saturday discussing the health care law and the tone was much different than in past years.\n\n\u201cBefore the election, it felt like a cock fight,\u201d Shumlin said, describing the debate over the law during the 2012 campaign. \u201cDown there we were talking about ways to we could cooperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the Republicans have accepted that as millions of people sign up for it and finally get the health care they have been dreaming of for their families, nobody\u2019s going to take that away,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Republican governors here described circumstances that would hardly befit a dream.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike complained about major problems with the Medicaid eligibility data that they are receiving from federal exchanges. The 36 states in the federal exchange have noted often incomplete data with the Medicaid information they are receiving.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican who is among his party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents in the fall election, said he\u2019s working to expand his state\u2019s Medicaid program, but the process had been cumbersome and difficult. He said it still remained unclear, from a fiscal standpoint, if the health care law would be functioning in two years.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot more unknowns than there are knowns,\u201d Corbett said.\n\nRepublican campaign officials, meanwhile, plan to make the health care law the overwhelming focus of the coming midterm elections.\n\nFrom coast to coast, conservatives are attacking Democrats who supported the overhaul, seizing on problems with the program\u2019s website and news that some Americans were forced to change insurers once the law took effect. The conservative group, Americans For Prosperity, has spent more than $20 million on anti-Obamacare television ads in several key states since last August.\n\nThe stakes are high for parties battling over control of the House and Senate, while there are also 36 elections for governor, most of them for governors mansions currently held by Republicans. The coming elections also offer prospective 2016 presidential candidates an opportunity to boost their political standing.\n\nLeading GOP figures in the Senate like Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida have been vocal critics of the health care law. Cruz mounted a 21-hour Senate speech against Obama\u2019s health law and was tied to the partial government shutdown while Rubio was an early proponent of defunding the health law although he distanced himself from the shutdown.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat up for reelection in November, said her state would soon expand its Medicaid program to cover 50,000 uninsured residents.\n\n\u201cOverall, I\u2019m very disappointed with the early implementation and rollout,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think we are making progress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski  WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some Republican governors suggest that President Barack Obama's health care overhaul is here to stay \u2014 despite their opposition to it and problems with Obamacare.  \"We're just trying to make the best of a bad...", "title": "Some Republican Governors Say Obamacare Is \u2018The Law\u2019 and Here To Stay Despite Problems", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/23/some-republican-governors-say-obamacare-is-the-law-and-here-to-stay-despite-problems/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/600x41411.jpg", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "some, republican, governors, say, obamacare, law, here, stay, despite, problems", "sailthru.tags": "government, health, obamacare, author-daveurbanski, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 331, "gplus-count": 0, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/769527", "categories": "obamacare,government,health", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 147, "description": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski  WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some Republican governors suggest that President Barack Obama's health care overhaul is here to stay \u2014 despite their opposition to it and problems with Obamacare.  \"We're just trying to make the best of a bad...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski  WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some Republican governors suggest that President Barack Obama's health care overhaul is here to stay \u2014 despite their opposition to it and problems with Obamacare.  \"We're just trying to make the best of a bad...", "title": "Some Republican Governors Say Obamacare Is \u2018The Law\u2019 and Here To Stay Despite Problems", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/23/some-republican-governors-say-obamacare-is-the-law-and-here-to-stay-despite-problems/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/600x41411.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 414}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-23T17:55:17+00:00", "twitter-count": 112}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbff1\"", "article_summary": "Terry Branstad, of Iowa, who calls the health care law \u201cunaffordable and unsustainable,\u201d yet something he has to implement by law.\nCruz mounted a 21-hour Senate speech against Obama\u2019s health law and was tied to the partial government shutdown while Rubio was an early proponent of defunding the health law although he distanced himself from the shutdown.\nStory by the Associated Press; curated by Dave UrbanskiWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some Republican governors suggest that President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul is here to stay \u2014 despite their opposition to it and problems with Obamacare.\nHe said it still remained unclear, from a fiscal standpoint, if the health care law would be functioning in two years.\nRick Snyder is among several Republican governors who expanded their state\u2019s Medicaid laws under the law."}
