A section of a downtown Denver street is being converted from a one-way to accommodate visitors to the LoDo area, the manager of Denver Public Works announced Friday.

The two-block stretch of 18th Street between Wynkoop and Blake streets will be converted from a one-way to a two-way section, according to Denver Public Works.

Studies were launched in response to developments at Denver Union Station that would necessitate the change.

The cost of the project is $550,000, and work will begin this summer, said Emily Williams, Denver Public Works spokeswoman.

“Delays during the construction are expected to be minor,” Williams said.

The project is estimated to take two months to complete.

Among the changes will be a new traffic light and changes to the signs.

The decision to convert the stretch followed an in-depth study, professional observations and stakeholder meetings, according to Denver Public Works.

The revived Union Station building and new transit center is set to open this summer.

Planners say the hub will be Denver’s own Grand Central Station — with an eight-track, at-grade commuter rail station. Officials estimated that as many as 100,000 travelers could pass through the station daily once rail service starts in 2016.

About 50 percent of downtown workers now commute by alternative transit — on foot, or by bus, bike or light rail — rather than cars, and city planners said it’s time for a change in traffic flow to try to accommodate everyone.

Other one-way sections have been the topic of discussion for change.

Those spots are Welton Street between 15th and 17th streets, and East 19th Avenue between Broadway and Park Avenue and East 20th Avenue between Park and Lincoln Street.
