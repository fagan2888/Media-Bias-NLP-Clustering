The plan was to continue to limit their minutes heading into Saturday\u2019s game against the visiting Dallas Stars.\n\n\u201cThe more they earn my trust, the more comfortable I\u2019ll be to put them on the ice,\u201d Roy said at his Thursday morning news conference.\n\nThe Avs currently have a terrific fourth line in center John Mitchell and wingers Cody McLeod and Jack Skille, and Roy will continue to give them third-line minutes until Rantanen and Rendulic become more comfortable in their surroundings.\n\nMitchell plays on a power-play unit, and McLeod \u2014 Colorado\u2019s most physical forward \u2014 was the extra forward in the waning minutes of a 6-on-5 attack against the Wild.\n\nCarl Soderberg centers Rantanen and Rendulic but also played with Mitchell and McLeod against the Wild.\n\n\u201cWe were chasing the puck too much, didn\u2019t get much offense,\u201d Rantanen said after his first NHL game and playing with Rendulic. \u201cThere\u2019s little details I need to learn, like in the defensive zone. Of course, it was a tough loss because we led by three goals. I think the second game will be easier. Hopefully, (Saturday) I\u2019ll feel a little better.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. The Stars were 0-3-2 last season against the Avalanche and entered Saturday\u2019s game 1-6-3 against Colorado over the past two seasons. \u2026 Avs goalie Semyon Varlamov entered the game with a career record of 9-3-2 against Dallas. \u2026 Stars newcomer Antti Niemi, formerly of the San Jose Sharks, entered the game 8-1-3 in his career against Colorado. \u2026 In 24 previous games against the Stars, Avs center Matt Duchene had 26 points (10 goals). \u2026 The Avs have Sunday off before returning to practice Monday. They conclude their three-game homestand Wednesday against the Boston Bruins. \u2026 Saturday was the 600th Avalanche game at the Pepsi Center.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche coach Patrick Roy takes it slow with Mikko Rantanen, Borna Rendulic", "title": "Avalanche coach Patrick Roy takes it slow with Mikko Rantanen, Borna Rendulic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/10/avalanche-coach-patrick-roy-takes-it-slow-with-mikko-rantanen-borna-rendulic/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151005_020700_mikko-rantanen.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151005_020700_mikko-rantanen.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-11T01:26:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T05:49:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Avalanche coach Patrick Roy is taking it slow with young third-line wingers Mikko Rantanen and Borna Rendulic, who have a combined 13 games of NHL experience.\n\u2026 In 24 previous games against the Stars, Avs center Matt Duchene had 26 points (10 goals).\nCarl Soderberg centers Rantanen and Rendulic but also played with Mitchell and McLeod against the Wild.\nThe Stars were 0-3-2 last season against the Avalanche and entered Saturday\u2019s game 1-6-3 against Colorado over the past two seasons.\n\u201cWe were chasing the puck too much, didn\u2019t get much offense,\u201d Rantanen said after his first NHL game and playing with Rendulic."}
