Kennametal, Inc. v. Ingersoll Cutting Tool Co., Case No. 14-1350 (Fed. Cir., Mar. 25, 2015) (Linn, J.).\n\nKennametal (the patent owner) filed suit against Ingersoll (the petitioner) for infringement of a patent related to cutting tools with a binder containing ruthenium and having a physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating. Ingersoll successfully petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) for inter partes reexamination of the asserted patent, raising both anticipation and obviousness grounds. The examiner refused to adopt the proposed anticipation rejections, but rejected all of the claims as obvious. The o appealed the obviousness rejections to the PTAB, and the petitioner cross-appealed the examiner\u2019s refusal to adopt its proposed anticipation rejections. The PTAB found that the examiner erred by not adopting the petitioner\u2019s proposed anticipation rejection and affirmed the obviousness rejections. The patent owner appealed all of the PTAB\u2019s rejections to the Federal Circuit.\n\nThe Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB\u2019s finding of anticipation. There was no dispute that the prior art disclosed all of the limitations of the rejected claim. The patent owner, however, argued that the prior art failed to disclose all the claimed limitations\u2014here, the combination of ruthenium and PVD coatings\u2014 \u201carranged or combined in the same way as in the claim.\u201d The Federal Circuit explained that can anticipate a claim even if it \u201cd[oes] not expressly spell out\u201d all the limitations arranged or combined as in the claim, if a person of skill in the art, reading the reference, would \u201cat once envisage\u201d the claimed arrangement or combination. Here, the question for the purposes of anticipation is \u201cwhether the number of categories and components\u201d disclosed in the prior art is so large that the combination of ruthenium and PVD coatings \u201cwould not be immediately apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.\u201d After reviewing the PTAB\u2019s reasoning, the Federal Circuit concluded that the prior art\u2019s express contemplation of PVD coatings is \u201csufficient evidence that a reasonable mind could find that a person of skill in the art would immediately envisage applying a PVD coating\u201d and that \u201cactual performance\u201d of combining ruthenium and PVD coatings was not required.\n\nWith regard to the PTAB\u2019s decision of obviousness, the Federal Circuit explained that although a prior art reference that anticipates an invention can, theoretically, still not make that invention obvious, that is the rare case. Here, because there was only a limited number of possible combinations disclosed in the prior art, it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine ruthenium and PVD coatings with a reasonable expectation of success. As for the patent owner\u2019s assertion of unexpected results, the Federal Circuit concluded that because the precise combination of ruthenium binders and PVD coatings was taught in Grab, the patent owner\u2019s secondary consideration argument falls short.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patent Appeal Board affirmed the PTABs decision with respect to both anticipation and obviousness in Kennametal v.
