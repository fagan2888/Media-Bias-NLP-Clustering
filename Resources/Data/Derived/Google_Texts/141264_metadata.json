Leave the Tea Party alone! Let them destroy this country because WAAAAA, they hate ObamaCare!\n\nThe Youtube comment section was a goldmine of Americans fed up with the Tea Party. From \u201ci am a redneck white and i full support obama in everything he does even if he used union troops against the anti-tax anti-government nut jobs\u201d to calling Amy a stalker who won\u2019t let go of her prey, Americans are over the Tea Party.\n\nWatch here:\n\nTranscript from Youtube:\n\nJOHNSON: The Constitution also shows that when a presidential election occurs and something has been ruled to be Constitutional by the Supreme Court, you allow the law to go through, and that would solve the problem.\n\nKREMER: And, Jason, also \u2013 also, the American \u2014 the real problem is Obamacare. The American people don\u2019t like it. And I\u2019m tired of hearing that, oh, he was reelected. Well, guess what, had all this bad information come out last year, before November, I think we might have had a very different result.\n\nJOHNSON: You couldn\u2019t make your point in a two year presidential election. I think it\u2019s about time to give it up.\n\nThe best part about this is seeing the 12% of the country who support the Tea Party that just shut our government down are now loathed and despised, even in Youtube comments. Where are all of the Koch Brothers paid trolls? So sad.\n\nThe two top comments:\n\n\n\nRuss E\n\nRuss E 1 day ago\n\nSo sorry\ufeff to trouble you with reality and facts.\n\nsocialism.rules\n\nsocialism.rules 20 hours ago\n\nwhy are all teaparty people ugly nasty not informed \ufeff scum\n\nthis woman needs healthcare- look at her she is sickly obese and probably is diabetic\n\noh i am a redneck white and i full support obama in everything he does even if he used union troops against the anti-tax anti-government nut jobs\n\nAnd then:\n\nJack Keenan 1 hour ago\n\nAmy Kramer\u2026why does CNN give this lunatic any air time?\n\nNewborn babies cry less than this skank.\n\nKramer and all her ilk on the extreme right are like stalkers who won\u2019t let their prey(Obamacare) go\u2026she\u2019s like someone who has been told the relationship is over and refuses to believe it and now she is in stalking mode\u2026she wont let\ufeff it go\u2026just utter madness from this lunatic.\n\n\u00b7\n\nAlan Dampog\n\nAlan Dampog 10 hours ago\n\nScrew the a$$hats of the GOP for shutting down the government. the GOP\ufeff are a bunch of morons.\n\n\u00b7\n\nAden Nak\n\nAden Nak 10 hours ago\n\nFacts\ufeff have a well known liberal bias.\n\n\u00b7\n\nsocialism.rules\n\nsocialism.rules 11 hours ago\n\neven george washington sent union troops against anti tax anti-government nutso\u2019s\n\noh he even disbarred tory conservatives from owning guns- there goes your second\ufeff amendment nutterly also\n\n\n\nPeople are clearly beyond fed up with the Tea Party \u201cstalkers\u201d.\n\nIs the country done being driven by these egomaniacal knuckle draggers yet? There\u2019s nothing so infuriating as trying to \u201ctalk\u201d to a screeching, dense moron whose only skill is their ability to spit propaganda out, rabid fire style. It\u2019s misinformation on top of wild lies topped off by egregious misuse of words like \u201cConstitution\u201d as if by saying it a lot, it imbues their argument with gravitas.\n\nAnd they are always so smug, because they are too ignorant to even imagine that they might be wrong. To them, having one tidbit of information makes them feel like they belong among the intellectual elite. It\u2019s very exciting for them, and they cling to it and repeat it as a safety device against the realization that they really don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about our average citizens who are too busy to keep up with politics. I\u2019m talking only about the Tea Party types \u2013 the Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, Ted Cruz types that we elevate because they\u2019re the Kim Kardashians of the political world.\n\nTheir followers have no idea that they\u2019re being played by con artists, and that\u2019s how we end up with marks like Amy, being used as a missile of misinformation, acting as if not liking ObamaCare justifies violating the law. She doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s advocating violating the constitution. I doubt she will ever realize that.\n\nHow can you even \u201ctalk\u201d to people like this? They are the trolls of the political world. It\u2019s truly frightening that we\u2019re being run by them.\n\nThe only bonus of this whole shutdown nightmare is that this will eventually lead to the demise of the Tea Party for good.\n\nThe bad news is that once the Tea Party gets branded as the puppetry of demonic, secret dark money trying to overtake our government, the Koch Brothers will just rebrand the \u201cnew\u201d version of the Birchers and we will have to wait another 4 years for the media and the public to catch on, as Rome burns again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People are clearly beyond fed up with the Tea Party \"stalkers\".
