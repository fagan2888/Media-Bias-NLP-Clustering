Without providing any evidence, James Clapper claimed that China is \u201cthe leading suspect.\u201d\n\nThree months later, Clapper is still blaming Beijing, but still has failed to offer any evidence for his claims. Speaking before a House panel on Thursday, the spy chief urged for an increase in cyber security measures aimed at Beijing.\n\nIn response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged Washington to either provide a rationale for their claims, or cease with its accusations.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cWe hope that the US stops its groundless attacks against China, start dialogue based on a foundation of mutual respect, and jointly build a cyberspace that is peaceful, secure, open and cooperative,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said during a news briefing, according to Reuters.\n\nThe White House has already indicated that it may implement targeted sanctions against individuals and entities the administration believes to have launched cyberattacks against US companies. That possibility has already been criticized by intelligence experts as a hypocritical response from the US, given its own role in corporate espionage.\n\n\u201cThe US government routinely claims that it doesn\u2019t spy for economic reasons, yet it usually finds \u2018strategic\u2019 reasons to get the same information,\u201d J.J. Steinberg, senior editor with the Executive Intelligence Review, told Sputnik.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the Chinese government expressed hope that cybersecurity cooperation between Beijing and Washington was possible.\n\n\u201cWe hope China, the United States and other countries could work together to work out the rules for cybersecurity in the international arena in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,\u201d Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi told China Daily.\n\nWhile China certainly seems willing to come to the negotiating table, Clapper\u2019s comments could be an indication of Washington\u2019s stalwart opposition.\n\n\u201cMaintaining cyber security should be a point of cooperation rather than a source of friction between both China and the United States,\u201d Hong said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following a plea from US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for Washington to increase cyber security measures against Beijing, Chinese officials have called for an end to the warrantless accusations., China, Cyber Spying, data breach, Office of Personnel Management,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sputnik News", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Following a plea from US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for Washington to increase cyber security measures against Beijing, Chinese officials have called for an end to the warrantless accusations., China, Cyber Spying, data breach, Office of Personnel Management,", "title": "Put Up Or Shut Up: China Demands Washington Show Evidence Of Cyber Spying", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/put-up-or-shut-up-china-demands-washington-show-evidence-of-cyber-spying/209482/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1018080085.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-12T09:22:49-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following a plea from US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for Washington to increase cyber security measures against Beijing, Chinese officials have called for an end to the warrantless accusations., China, Cyber Spying, data breach, Office of Personnel Management,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1018080085.jpg", "title": "Put Up Or Shut Up: China Demands Washington Show Evidence Of Cyber Spying", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Office of Personnel Management", "published_time": "2015-09-12T05:00:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T09:22:49-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged Washington to either provide a rationale for their claims, or cease with its accusations.\n\u201cMaintaining cyber security should be a point of cooperation rather than a source of friction between both China and the United States,\u201d Hong said.\nWithout providing any evidence, James Clapper claimed that China is \u201cthe leading suspect.\u201dThree months later, Clapper is still blaming Beijing, but still has failed to offer any evidence for his claims.\nWhile China certainly seems willing to come to the negotiating table, Clapper\u2019s comments could be an indication of Washington\u2019s stalwart opposition.\nSpeaking before a House panel on Thursday, the spy chief urged for an increase in cyber security measures aimed at Beijing."}
