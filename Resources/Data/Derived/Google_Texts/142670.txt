After saying in an interview that she is “absolutely” pondering running for president, Sarah Palin delivered a rather disjointed speech at a Tea Party conference in Iowa.

The 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate spoke to the crowd at the Iowa Freedom Summit Saturday, and the teleprompter broke during her address, according to the New York Daily News, causing Palin to improvise and make some rather curious and nonsensical statements.

“And GOP leaders, by the way, you know, the man, can only ride you when your back is bent,” declared the former governor of Alaska. “So strengthen it! Then the man can’t ride you, [and] America won’t be taken for a ride because so much is at stake and we can’t afford politicians playing games like nothing more is at stake than, oh, maybe the next standing of theirs in the next election.”

One of her statements that was apparently meant to jab at Hillary Clinton also rang confusing.

“What will they do to stop causing our pain and start feeling it again,” said Palin in a portion of her speech about Obamacare. “Well, in other words, um — Is Hillary a new Democrat or an old one?”

The head-scratching Hillary Clinton commentary continued.

“Now the press asks, the press asks, ‘Can anyone stop Hillary?'” explained Palin. “Again, this is to forego a conclusion, right? It’s to scare us off, to convince us that — a pantsuit can crush patriots.”

One day before Palin delivered her enthusiastic yet disjointed remarks, she confirmed to The Washington Post that she is considering a run for the White House.

“You can absolutely say that I am seriously interested,” alleged Palin.
