They went down to the smallest detail.\u201d\n\nThe wagon project began to roll when David Wiksten, 69, a retired dentist, came to the museum in the past year to volunteer. Wiksten\u2019s hobbies are woodworking and making scale models.\n\n\u201cWe had this project, and he agreed to take it on,\u201d Madden said. In turn, Wiksten recruited Mike Peters, 65, a retired lawyer whose hobby is making furniture, and Norm Davis, 65, a retired mechanical engineer, whose hobby is blacksmithing.\n\nBut the three didn\u2019t have any plans from which to build the wagon.\n\nThe three repeatedly took measurements from a full-size covered wagon on display in the museum gallery, scaling down their wagon to 60-percent of the full-size version.\n\nWiksten estimates the three made 50 to 60 trips between the wood shop where they crafted the parts and the full-scale wagon in the gallery.\n\n\u201cI think we wore a path,\u201d Peters said. The three worked with Ron Seeger, exhibit technician, who runs the wood shop and built boxes for the wagon and a frame for the Kansas town scene displayed on a wall.\n\nDavis fabricated the five iron hoops that support the wagons\u2019 canvas cover, the brackets to hold the hoops in place and the hand-forged pins at the front of the wagon, all at his blacksmith shop at home.\n\nHMC Inc. allowed Davis to use a machine to roll the hoops.\n\nThe toughest challenge, Peters said, was getting all the wooden stakes mortised into the horizontal stringers on the wagon box and building the wheels.\n\n\u201cThat took cabinet making and woodworking skills to make,\u201d Peters said.\n\nLois Herr, museum education coordinator, sewed the canvas cover.\n\nOn Sept. 9, the wagon parts were moved from the wood shop to the Discovery Place to be assembled.\n\nSince children are climbing in and out of the wagon, the volunteers made allowances: The wagon is mounted on a steel rectangular frame so it won\u2019t shift, the wagon doesn\u2019t have moving parts, and the hoops are metal, not wood, so a child reaching up to swing on a hoop won\u2019t snap it.\n\nThe hoops also are a little taller proportionately so a child won\u2019t bump his or her head while climbing in and out of the wagon.\n\nWhat has been the response of the children to the wagon?\n\n\u201cThey love it, they love it,\u201d Madden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge hit.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the three volunteers have agreed to tackle another undisclosed project.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Steve Fry, David Wiksten, Mary Madden, Mike Peters, Norm Davis", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The covered wagon is parked on the dusty street of a 19th-century Kansas town outside a general store, where soon-to-be pioneers on the Oregon Trail are loading provisions for the long trip west.", "title": "Volunteers build kid-sized frontier-era wagon for Museum of History", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2013-09-22/volunteers-build-kid-sized-frontier-era-wagon-museum-history", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12642831.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The covered wagon is parked on the dusty street of a 19th-century Kansas town outside a general store, where soon-to-be pioneers on the Oregon Trail are loading provisions for the long trip west.But these settlers are kind of small, and for that matter, the wagon is just a little over half the size of a frontier-era wagon rolling to the Oregon coast.That is because the wagon stands in the Discovery Place, the hands-on play area for children at the Kansas Museum of History."}, "article_summary": "The volunteers\u2019 one-of-a-kind wagon is worth \u201cthousands of dollars,\u201d museum education director Mary Madden said.\nOn Sept. 9, the wagon parts were moved from the wood shop to the Discovery Place to be assembled.\nThat is because the wagon stands in the Discovery Place, the hands-on play area for children at the Kansas Museum of History.\nThe wagon was made by three volunteers, all from Topeka, who donated an estimated 740 hours starting in April.\nWiksten estimates the three made 50 to 60 trips between the wood shop where they crafted the parts and the full-scale wagon in the gallery."}
