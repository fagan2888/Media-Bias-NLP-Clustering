He notes, however, that Columbus has fared \u201cmuch, much better than the average. We have made back all the jobs lost during the (Great) Recession, plus 20 percent. And we\u2019ll continue to grow better than the average.\u201d\n\nJung Kim, director of research at the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, notes that in mid-2013 the city passed the 50,000 milestone for net new jobs since January 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re striving to be on pace for 150,000 new jobs by 2020,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it will be tougher to reach that goal.\u201d\n\nLaFayette says that the slower economy of the state and nation \u201cputs a ceiling on our growth.\u201d\n\nKim agrees, saying, \u201cThe national pattern has been two steps forward, one step back. We\u2019re always fighting the headwinds.\u201d\n\nChris DeCapua, owner of Dawson Careers, sees a definite upturn in job opportunities in the coming year. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from employers that we haven\u2019t heard from in a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are short of people on all levels\u2014from IT to forklift operators.\u201d\n\nHis major problem is finding qualified candidates. \u201cThere are an awful lot of people who are not hirable,\u201d he says.\n\nKim anticipates local job growth in manufacturing (especially at Honda), logistics, science and technology, business services, and financial services. He sees a significant jump in venture capital investment in Central Ohio, citing the opening of Drive Capital, headed by Mark Kwamme and Chris Olson, as a big boost.\n\n\u201cWhat Drive Capital is doing is a big deal,\u201d Kim says. \u201cCompared to Silicon Valley, this is an undercapped market. The activity from Drive Capital can have a multiplier effect.\u201d\n\nJose Rodriguez, director of communications for the Columbus Public Health Department, says that the Affordable Care Act should generate increased employment. \u201cAs Medicaid and health insurance policies cover more and more people,\u201d he says, \u201cthe demand for medical services will grow along with the need to supply it to residents.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, this demand will create over 27,000 new jobs in the state, ranging from administrative services to workers at assisted living facilities.\n\nKim says that the key to growth for local companies is \u201cserving a national and global market.\u201d He cites Jeni\u2019s Ice Cream as an example, noting also the expansion of Nationwide and Huntington Banks into new markets.\n\nWhat could upset this outlook?\n\n\u201cA reprisal of the federal fiscal battles,\u201d says Kim. \u201cThe recent agreement to end the shutdown provides funding to keep the government running through January 15 and allows borrowing to continue through February 7. It wasn\u2019t a long-term agreement as much as an extension for further negotiations.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, LaFayette says, \u201can unknown unknown. It could be something geopolitical. Or a major supply disruption. Or something positive\u2014like improved consumer confidence.\u201d\n\nColumbus MSA employment compared to state & national employment in the past 12 months:\n\nColumbus MSA employment increase= 0.4% (June-Aug. 2013)\n\nOhio employment fell 0.1 percent (June-Aug. 2013)\n\nU.S. employment increase= 0.2 percent (June-Aug. 2013)\n\nColumbus MSA employment increase= 16,800 or 1.8% (past 12 months)\n\nOhio employment increase= 0.6 percent (past 12 months)\n\nU.S. employment increase= 1.6% (past 12 months)\n\nSource: Current Employment Statistics, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
