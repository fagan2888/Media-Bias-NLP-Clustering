Don’t be fooled, the world is a very dangerous place. There are plenty of things out there that can and will kill you, including many things in Australia. As the venerable Bilbo Baggins once said, “It’s a dangerous business going out your front door.” From wild animals, raging wildfires, the ocean and most things in it, to your fellow human beings, lightning, and vending machines, statistics show that all of these things and more can and will kill you.

That being said, there are plenty of things out there that aren’t trying to kill you. Fluffy bunnies, ducks, babies, the warm embrace of a loved one, and your favorite reclining chair are all things that want you to live. So, don’t lock yourself in a padded room and wait for your inevitable demise. Get out there and enjoy yourself. As always, take the necessary precautions when doing so. However, as you’ll see in the above video, people have plenty of misconceptions when it comes to things being able to kill you.

Elliot from Mental Floss explains all the preconceived notions about what people think is going to be the end of them, as well as things that people believe will actually save them from death. He covers drinking your own pee or from a cactus when you’re thirsty, pulling out any object that has somehow impaled you, and, a cartoon favorite, using an umbrella to break a big fall.

Instead of listening to a friend of a friend tell you that your house is actually safer than a commercial building when it comes to dying in a fire, listen to science and find out the truth.
