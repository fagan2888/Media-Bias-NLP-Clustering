Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s GOP debate, PostOnPolitics recaps each candidate\u2019s last debate performance, spotlights what to watch in the coming candidate clash and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 examines how each candidate has handled the Trump Factor.\n\n(Click here for an earlier post on former Arkansas Gov. and current Panhandle resident Mike Huckabee.)\n\nBEN CARSON\n\nFlorida connection: Moved to West Palm Beach in 2013, in part because he was \u201ca little unhappy with the taxation situation that existed in Maryland.\u201d Registered to vote in Palm Beach County with the Independence Party of Florida before switching to the GOP last fall.\n\nPolls: Has surged to 2nd in the RealClearPolitics.com average of national Republican polls with 16.8 percent \u2014 up from 5th place and 5.8 percent before the first GOP debate. In a recent Gallup poll, Carson has the highest net-favorable rating (difference between favorable and unfavorable scores) in the GOP field, up 16 points since early August. In Iowa, he\u2019s within striking distance of front runner Donald Trump in several polls.\n\nLast debate: After fielding an early question about whether he knows enough about foreign affairs to be president, Carson wasn\u2019t called on by the Fox News moderators for more than 30 minutes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I was going to get to talk again,\u201d he quipped. Carson said \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a politically correct war,\u201d put in a plug for a flat tax system based on the model of tithing in the Bible, called Hillary Clinton \u201cthe epitome of\u2026the secular progressive movement\u201d and vowed to strengthen the military. Asked about race relations, the lone black candidate from either party decried \u201cpurveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it.\u201d\n\nTrump Factor: While Carson has criticized Democrats like Clinton and President Barack Obama, he hasn\u2019t gone after other Republicans \u2014 until last week, when he questioned the depth of Trump\u2019s Christian faith. \u201cYou know, one of my favorite Bible verses, Proverbs 22:4, it says, \u2018By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life\u2019 and that\u2019s a very big part of who I am \u2014 humility and the fear of the Lord. I don\u2019t get that impression with him.\u201d Trump accused Carson \u2014 who discussed his Christian beliefs in his 1990 autobiography and keynoted National Prayer Breakfasts in 1997 and 2013 \u2014 of only recently becoming \u201ca big man of faith.\u201d Carson soon apologized for his remarks, saying he didn\u2019t mean them as a personal attack.\n\nWhat to watch Wednesday: Now that he\u2019s a top-tier candidate, Carson won\u2019t be ignored for a half-hour stretch as he was in the first debate. Carson speaks softly, but has been known to make some controversial statements \u2014 he might be asked to explain his past description of political correctness as \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany\u201d in suppressing speech or his contention that Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d With a majority of GOP voters currently preferring a non-politician for president, look for Carson to present himself as an outsider like Trump, but with a cooler demeanor and more consistent conservative ideology.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Post On Politics", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2015/09/14/republican-presidential-debate-florida-preview-ben-carson/", "image": "https://cmgpbppostonpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/fl-carson-4.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Four Florida residents, plus part-time Palm Beacher Donald Trump, are seeking the Republican nomination for president.
