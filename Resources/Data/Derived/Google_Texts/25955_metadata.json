Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign won a lawsuit allowing 17-year-olds who will turn 18 before November to vote, extending the franchise slightly.\n\nAt a Sunoco gas station in Youngstown, two strangers, both retired white male schoolteachers, started chatting in a neighborly way while pumping gas. On an election morning, the talk quickly turned to politics.\n\nSteve, 67, a native of Youngstown, was wearing an \u201cI Heart Ohio Voting\u201d sticker on his black T-shirt. He asked for his last name not to be used to protect his privacy at the ballot box. \u201cI voted for the local sheriff, and I voted for Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m a Democrat. I like Bernie Sanders, but he might be a little too far to the left \u2013 not for me, but realistically.\u201d\n\nDavid Telesco, 60, in button-down dress shirt with a checkered pattern, said that he hadn\u2019t voted yet, but that he would for Ted Cruz. \u201cWe had an ideologue on the left side with Obama, and now we need an ideologue on the right side,\u201d the Connecticut native said.\n\nSteve\u2019s admission that he chose not the candidate he prefers, but the one he thinks will win, may account in part for Clinton\u2019s dramatic victory in Ohio last night. After all, Ohio\u2019s vote comes just days after Sanders\u2019 unforeseen victory in Michigan last week. He continued, \u201cWe need freeways, highways \u2013 social projects \u2013 to get society moving. But it\u2019s hard for a lot of people to get past it, once you\u2019re tagged with a name like \u2018socialist.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo put it mildly, David saw it another way.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama became president, I became a Republican \u2014 I was unaffiliated before. Trump is an unguided missile. I\u2019m voting for Cruz because you know what you\u2019re getting. But if I have to, I\u2019ll vote for Trump in November. I will never vote for Hillary Clinton after Benghazi,\u201d he said, referring to the attack on a U.S. facility in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, as well as several others.\n\nBoth men agreed that Youngstown hasn\u2019t recovered from the collapse of the steel industry in the 1970s. The city has lost two-thirds of its population over the past several decades.\n\n\u201cWhat the steel mills provided,\u201d Steve said, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t exist any more, was the combination of high-paying, low-skilled jobs. You didn\u2019t need a college education.\u201d\n\nThe Rust Belt, in a nutshell: with the legions of white, working-class men who are the bulwarks of the Trump and Sanders campaigns. But Ohio did not, as it turned out, reward either candidate. Favorite-son Governor John Kasich took the Republican delegates. He was unlikely to have been David\u2019s choice under any circumstances.\n\n\u201cWhat really nobody\u2019s looking at with Kasich is how he brought in Medicaid-expansion and Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe two men then talked a bit more about ex-wives and their experiences working in their respective school systems, and then shook hands. They got into their cars and said goodbye.", "article_metadata": {"WT.cg_n": "Blogs - The Great Debate", "WT.ti": "A rarity for 2016: Agreeing to disagree - The Great Debate", "SEARCH.AUTHOR": "Alan Chin", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "\u201cI voted for the local sheriff, and I voted for Hillary Clinton.
