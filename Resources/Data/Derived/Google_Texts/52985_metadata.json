The full House will now consider a needle exchange pilot program and a new medical marijuana proposal.\n\n\n\nThe House\u2019s main healthcare panel ran something of a legislative marathon Wednesday. Committee Chair Rep. Jason Brodeur (R-Sanford) Republican squeezed twenty different bills into a three hour meeting.\n\nOne of the issues taking center stage was a medical marijuana measure Frankensteining together two different provisions. According to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Shalimar), the move is entirely within House rules. But Rep. Gayle Harrell (R-Stuart) doesn\u2019t like the monstrosity.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to look at expanding the Right To Try to other quote drugs out there, why don\u2019t we open it up to meth? To cocaine? To heroin?\u201d Harrell asks. \u201cSo I have a real problem with putting these two bills together.\u201d\n\nThe first part of the new measure is the one Harrell opposes\u2014granting terminal patients access to full-potency medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cThe proposed substitute before the committee removes the barrier between dying people\u2014truly dying people\u2014and well-tested, well-regulated, properly labeled, physician ordered medical cannabis,\u201d Gaetz says.\n\nGaetz explains the second part makes a number of alterations to Florida\u2019s existing medical cannabis architecture.\n\n\u201cStronger testing protocols, 24 hour security, limited retail hours, more rigorous inspections, patient ID cards, express local control, seed to sale tracking, reliable labeling as well,\u201d he lists off.\n\nIn addition, the bill lays out a plan for additional licenses. Once there are 250,000 qualified patients, the Department of Health will award three more. But they\u2019ll do it differently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten feedback that 30 years ago there may have been predatory lending practices which necessarily disadvantage African Americans who might otherwise be interested in this venture,\u201d Gaetz says. \u201cSo we take the position in this bill that for any future licensures that become necessary as a result of demand we will eliminate the thirty year nurseryman requirement on a going forward basis.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, South Florida Democrats have spent years lobbying for a needle exchange pilot program in Miami Dade County. Despite finding a receptive audience in the Senate, the measure has languished in the House.\n\n\u201cThe bill authorizes the University of Miami, and its affiliates to establish a needle and syringe exchange pilot program in Miami Dade County to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS and other blood borne diseases spread by intravenous drug users, their sexual partners and offspring,\u201d Rep. Katie Edwards (D-Sunrise) says.\n\nBut now that proposal moves to the House floor. The companion bill in the Senate is on the floor as well.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The House Health and Human services committee sent two measures to the floor that would\u2019ve been unthinkable just a few years ago.\u00a0 The full House will now", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/marijuana-and-needle-exchange-proposals-headed-house-floor", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/467119276.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The House Health and Human services committee sent two measures to the floor that would\u2019ve been unthinkable just a few years ago.\u00a0 The full House will now", "title": "Marijuana And Needle Exchange Proposals Headed For House Floor"}, "story_id": 467119245, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Nick Evans", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Marijuana And Needle Exchange Proposals Headed For House Floor"}, "nid": 13654, "datePublished": "2016-02-18", "keywords": "needle exchange pilot program, needle exchange, medical marijuana, medical pot", "wordCount": 564, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The full House will now consider a needle exchange pilot program and a new medical marijuana proposal.\nThe House Health and Human services committee sent two measures to the floor that would\u2019ve been unthinkable just a few years ago.\nOne of the issues taking center stage was a medical marijuana measure Frankensteining together two different provisions.\nAccording to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep.
