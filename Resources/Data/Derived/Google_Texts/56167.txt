Welcome to Overnight Regulation, your daily rundown of news from Capitol Hill and beyond. It's Wednesday evening here in Washington. Here's the latest.

THE BIG STORY

The Labor Department is moving forward with plans to regulate retirement investment advisers.

The so-called fiduciary rule released Wednesday will require those advisers to act in the best interest of their clients.

Democrats see the fiduciary rule as a way of cleaning up Wall Street, but Republicans argue it will raise the cost of investment advice for retirees.

The fight over the fiduciary rule is just beginning.

The Hill's Peter Schroeder has the story:

The Obama administration on Wednesday unveiled new rules for retirement investment advisers, turning aside pressure from industry groups to abandon the proposal.

The regulations, which were issued by the Labor Department, establish requirements that the White House says will save Americans billions of dollars by combating bad behavior on Wall Street.

"A little over a year ago, the president called for action to crack down on conflicts of interest in retirement advice ... Today, we reached a crucial milestone," said Jeff Zients, director of the National Economic Council, in a Tuesday call with reporters.

"It ensures that retirement savers get investment advice in their best interests so they can grow their nest egg."

The now-finalized rules mark one of the largest regulatory undertakings for the Labor Department under Obama, as the most recent comment period spanned five months, generated 3,000 comment letters and involved over 100 meetings.

Under the new rules, most investment advisers for retirement plans will have to meet a "fiduciary" standard, requiring them to put the interest of their clients ahead of any others. And if they don't, clients would have the ability to file lawsuits against them.

White House analysis found that conflicted advice can cost Americans up to $17 billion a year, and can drive down investment returns for middle and working-class Americans by a full percentage point.

While the rules may finally be done, the fight over them is only beginning.

Groups in the financial industry could mount legal challenges to the regulatory effort, and some members of Congress are exploring legislative ways to change them.

--The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will delay protections for parrots.

The FWS proposed listing the northern scarlet macaw as an endangered species in July 2012, but is now proposing to list it as a threatened species, which would afford the parrot fewer protections. The agency is reopening the comment period to give the public more time to consider the changes.

The public has 60 days to comment. http://bit.ly/1WcWYpN

--The FWS will issue new protections for freshwater crayfish.

The FWS will list the Guyandotte River crayfish as an endangered species and the Big Sandy crayfish as a threatened species.
