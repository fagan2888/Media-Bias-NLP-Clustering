Imagine a game show in which representatives from each party are forced to strap on roller skates for the first time and are then compelled to stuff as many talking points as possible into each answer as they wobble back and forth. But the debate Monday night between the two candidates running for Senate in Kentucky was better than most. Both were firmly seated, and engaged in a free-flowing exchange that was prodded along by a single moderator who asked smart follow-ups. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a model of the form.\n\nJohn Dickerson John Dickerson is a Slate political columnist, the moderator of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, and author of On Her Trail. Read his series on the presidency and on risk.\n\n\n\nThe debate also provided a model of what makes our politics so discouraging: The candidates retreated to disingenuous evasions that were at once familiar\u2014candidates evade questions all the time\u2014and notable because they seemed so brazen. One was a policy elision from Sen. Mitch McConnell, and one was a personal smokescreen from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nThey are equivalent only in that they are both diversions. Whether one is worse than the other depends on your view of politics. Some people weigh candor about a personal matter more heavily than candor about policy. Fibs about personal matters are usually easier to spot in real time and require less context. Plus, policy is complicated, and good people can disagree. On the other hand, there is no direct policy impact in a personal evasion, whereas a policy hoodwink affects, or could affect, a great number of people in a direct way that changes lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI will address them in the order in which they appeared.\n\nGrimes: When she was asked whether she voted for President Obama, Grimes ducked the question, saying that it was a matter of principle that she shouldn\u2019t have to disclose her vote. It\u2019s possible that Grimes really feels bound to this position, though when most people think about the sanctity of the ballot, it\u2019s usually the idea that no government or person can compel you to say how you voted. But as McConnell pointed out, how you voted is not a fact that dare not speak its name. (Update, Oct. 15, 2014: Which is why Grimes said she voted for Clinton in 2008). You are free to let people know. So Grimes appears to be creating a principle to hide a political liability, which is her past support for a very unpopular president. It\u2019s one thing to shift and wiggle. It\u2019s worse to pretend your gyrations are based on a sacred commandment, especially when they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s not only disingenuous, but it contributes to the overall view that principles are playthings, which diminishes their effectiveness when real policies are on the line.\n\nGrimes\u2019 evasion during the debate is mainly a fixation of Washington reporters and Twitter elites.\n\nLots of commenters said it was a politically stupid thing for Grimes to do, too. That is less clear. It\u2019s doubtful this political tap dance routine affects the thinking of a great number of Kentucky voters: Those who don\u2019t like Grimes see this as proof of their previous views. Those who do like her (or don\u2019t like McConnell) probably won\u2019t let an awkward evasion get in the way of their established opinions.\n\nMore important, the evasion as it stands is mainly a fixation of Washington reporters and Twitter elites. If you\u2019re McConnell, you can\u2019t turn that into an ad that lots of voters could see. When the president recently said his policies were on the ballot, McConnell\u2019s team put the footage into an ad almost instantaneously. If Grimes had admitted she voted for Obama, it would have provided her opponent with a fresh clip for his next advertisement. That moment would have been replayed again and again for the next three weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut Grimes wasn\u2019t forswearing all presidents: Grimes says she considers herself a Clinton Democrat rather than an Obama Democrat because Clinton\u2019s policies represented \u201cgrowing the middle class the right way. And that\u2019s by making sure that we are building from the foundation up.\u201d For those keeping score at home, that\u2019s a complete condemnation of Obama\u2019s economic policies by a Democrat.\n\nMcConnell: The Senate minority leader was asked about Kentucky Kynect, the state\u2019s federal exchange set up as a part of the Affordable Care Act: \u201cHas Obamacare and Kynect been a boon or bane for the majority of Kentuckians?\u201d\n\nMcConnell didn\u2019t answer the question because he disagreed with its premise. He said Kynect was just a website and that it would be \u201cfine\u201d if it continued, but that he still believes that Obamacare should be pulled out \u201croot and branch.\u201d This too is a disingenuous answer. McConnell is trying to retain those voters who disapprove of Obamacare while not doing anything to offend those who like the popular program that has insured 500,000 people across the state. He doesn\u2019t want to inspire new voters to turn out against him by making it seem like their new health care plans are under threat.\n\nHow can he do this? By being intentionally vague and defining the state program in a very limited way. When McConnell says it\u2019s fine for Kynect to continue, it might sound to the casual viewer that he\u2019s OK with the current system. But what he means is that the actual website can continue\u2014literally the servers and the URL\u2014and everything else can be replaced by some other system. He does not go into detail about what that new system would be in practical terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019ve all learned that health care websites and policies are closely intermingled. In fact, McConnell helped teach us that. He was an articulate critic of the president during the collapse of healthcare.gov. \u201cThe president likes to say that Obamacare is about more than just a website,\u201d McConnell said during the period of healthcare.gov's initial collapse. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right. And that\u2019s why fixing a website won\u2019t solve the larger problem here.\u201d Websites and policies are tied together.\n\nThe policies that McConnell supports would make Kynect impossible in its current form because if you did away with Obamacare, as he proposes, the system would collapse into a death spiral. The mandates and subsides that allow the exchange to function would be gone. Striking down Obamacare would also remove the Medicaid subsidy that has covered people through Kynect.\n\nAt several other instances during the debate, McConnell went into some detail about the havoc that is wrought on Kentucky by federal actions both real and imagined. In this case, however, he doesn\u2019t admit that Kynect in its current form would disappear. McConnell can make a case that the coming GOP majority will have a health care plan in 2015 that will replace Obamacare and be even better, but that\u2019s quite a different argument\u2014and full of politically unhelpful uncertainty\u2014than the position he took. McConnell left the impression with viewers\u2014and those who have taken advantage of the exchange\u2014that the thing they liked could continue even if Obamacare died.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Which Kentucky Senate candidate was more disingenuous?", "fb-share": "Which Kentucky Senate Candidate Was More Disingenuous?", "sailthru.author": "John Dickerson", "description": "It has been painful to watch most of the debates between Senate candidates this election season.
