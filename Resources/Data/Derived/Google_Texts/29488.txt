One of the most surprising answers of the debate — in which Sen. Bernie Sanders revealed that, if elected, he would ask President Obama to withdraw his Supreme Court nomination — came from a question submitted by a Daily News reader.

New York University Ph.D student Hannah Greene, 25, was one of hundreds of New Yorkers who submitted a question to the News for the NY1-CNN debate.

"I was honored that my question was asked," said Greene, who had no idea that she was picked until she heard moderator Errol Louis read it.

Greene wanted to know if the candidates would commit to keeping Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was "going to support the President," but stopped short of saying she'd keep Garland.

"When I am President, I will take stock of where we are and move from there," she said.

Sanders called it an "outrage" that Senate Republicans are blocking the nomination, but said he'd ask Obama to withdraw the nomination if he's elected.

"We need a Supreme Court Justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United," he said.

Greene said she submitted the question because she believes that Obama's choice must be respected.

"I think it's incredibly important to support President Obama's right to appoint a nominee," she said. "It's disrespectful to the President, and the Americans that elected him, not to consider his nominee for the Supreme Court."

She is particularly concerned that the Affordable Care Act will be overturned, which she said has benefited her personally.

She lives in Chappaqua — the same town as Hillary Clinton.
