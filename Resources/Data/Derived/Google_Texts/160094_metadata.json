The journalist point-blank asked if the law was a job killer, as the Congressional Budget Office report seemed to suggest. Biden refuted the claim and presented the staid White House talking point that it would allow for job flexibility.\n\nCo-host Sherri Shepherd then lobbed a softball question \u2014 if you can call it that \u2014 at the Vice President.\n\n\u201cI know you have a key message that you want to get out to a key group of people for Obamacare, which is moms and young adults,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cSo is there something you want to say to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for the prompt,\u201d Biden joked, before getting serious. \u201cThe truth is that no matter how old we get, we still listen to our moms. I know that sounds corny, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President detailed his own personal experience with a medical crisis during his youth, saying that he would not have been able to afford his health care bills without insurance.\n\n\u201cSo moms have great influence,\u201d the VP said. \u201cCall your sons and daughter. Tell them, \u2018Sign up.\u2019 It\u2019s for them, and it\u2019s for your mom\u2019s peace of mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why do you think young people are not flocking?\u201d co-host Whoopi Goldberg asked. \u201cBecause I would \u2014 all I wanted was healthcare when I was a young mother.\u201d\n\nBiden responded that young people think they\u2019re invincible and believe the health insurance plans available to them are more expensive than they actually are. The Vice President, who recently admitted that enrollment in the President\u2019s healthcare law will be lower than needed come March 31, pointed out that 25 percent of those who have signed up for Obamacare are young people.\n\nThe Vice President\u2019s appeal to the mothers of America is very familiar. The White House and Health and Human Services have been playing up the relationship between parents and their children in an effort to get Millennials to take the Obamacare bait. HHS released an advertisement featuring \u2018mom jeans\u2019 earlier this month.\n\nWatch the full interview below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "As if young people don't get enough life advice -- aka nagging -- from their parents, Vice President Joe Biden told moms on Tuesday to call up their kids and convince them to sign up for Obamacare.", "title": "[WATCH] Joe Biden tells moms to nag their kids about Obamacare on...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/02/Joe-Biden-on-The-View-600x334.jpg", "height": 334}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/02/25/watch-joe-biden-tells-moms-to-nag-their-kids-about-obamacare-on-the-view/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "young-people-arent-signing-up-for-obamacare", "published_time": "2014-02-25T12:44:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-25T12:55:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Co-host Sherri Shepherd then lobbed a softball question \u2014 if you can call it that \u2014 at the Vice President.\nAs if young people don\u2019t get enough life advice \u2014 aka nagging \u2014 from their parents, Vice President Joe Biden told moms on Tuesday to call up their kids and convince them to sign up for Obamacare.\nThe Vice President sat down with the ladies of ABC\u2019s The View on Tuesday morning, and unlike Late Night host Seth Meyers the night before, Barbara Walters immediately stuck Biden with a hard topic: Obamacare.\nBiden refuted the claim and presented the staid White House talking point that it would allow for job flexibility.\nTell them, \u2018Sign up.\u2019 It\u2019s for them, and it\u2019s for your mom\u2019s peace of mind.\u201d\u201cWell why do you think young people are not flocking?\u201d co-host Whoopi Goldberg asked."}
