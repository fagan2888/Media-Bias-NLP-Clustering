Immigrants create an engine of economic prosperity.\u201d\n\nRubio, whose recent attempts to finesse the issue have drawn skepticism from his opponents, has made a more nuanced case. He argues that his plan to \u201cmodernize\u201d the immigration system would pay economic dividends. Rubio was also the author of the 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty bill that would have provided a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nBoth Rubio and Bush have rejected calls for widespread deportation of \u201claw-abiding\u201d illegal aliens. There are more than 11 million in the United States.\n\nThe Golden State study, released by the Public Policy Institute of California, suggests that legalizing aliens would not create the \u201ceconomic engine\u201d that Bush envisions, or supply the desirable labor pool that Rubio advocates.\n\nThe study found that 51 percent of the roughly 2.6 million illegals in California would meet the income eligibility criteria for Medi-Cal \u2014 less than $16,243 for an individual, $21,984 for a couple, or $33,500 for a family of four.\n\nSome Democrats have proposed authorizing California to seek a waiver from the federal government allowing illegal immigrants to obtain insurance on health exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome Democratic legislators have proposed authorizing California to seek a waiver from the federal government allowing illegal immigrants to obtain insurance on health exchange under the Affordable Care Act. Federal law would prohibit them from receiving government subsidies, and the institute estimates that many of the immigrants could not afford the insurance without the assistance.\n\nIf immigration-reform advocates were to succeed in granting legal status to that population, however, the immigrants would be eligible for subsidies up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line. The report says only 3 percent of illegal immigrants in California earn too much money to qualify for support.\n\nRelated: Ryan Backs Off on Immigration\n\nThe findings are no surprise to researchers who study immigrant use of government-assistance programs. Immigrants are poorer and less educated than the American population as a whole, and therefore make heavier use of government assistance programs.\n\nA September report by the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies showed more than half of all immigrant households nationwide in 2012 used at least one government program and exceeded usage rates of native-born Americans at all education levels.\n\nSteven Camarota, who wrote the study, said the heaviest users were immigrants without a high school diploma.\n\nGranting legal status would make previously illegal immigrants eligible for more benefits but would do nothing to improve their education or skills, Camarota said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that legalizing people is not going to solve the fiscal problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost certainly makes it worse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study indicating that half of California\u2019s illegal aliens are poor enough to qualify for a proposed Medicaid expansion undermines claims by\u00a0Jeb Bush and", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LifeZette", "description": "A study indicating that half of California\u2019s illegal aliens are poor enough to qualify for a proposed Medicaid expansion undermines claims by\u00a0Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio\u00a0suggesting\u00a0legalizing them brings\u00a0economic benefits.
