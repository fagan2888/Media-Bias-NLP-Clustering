It seems the goal behind the Iran deal was to extricate the United States from long standing alliances in the Middle East, including Israel. This was done to be able to close the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\nThe Soviet Union would have been proud. This disclosure shows that anything the Obama administration puts out is nothing short of sheer propaganda and cannot be trusted; but, we knew that already didn\u2019t we.\n\nThe reaction to the NYT piece by David Samuels has been swift and fierce. Hudson Institute adjunct fellow Michael Pregent opined: \u201cDude thinks he\u2019s on \u2018House of Cards\u2019 \u2013 Rhodes lied to sell Iran Deal and is proud of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters,\u201d Samuels wrote. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he quoted Rhodes as admitting. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d \u201cThe average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns,\u201d Rhodes was quoted as telling him. \u201cThey literally know nothing.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s High Stakes Iran Gamble Illustration by Greg Groesch/The Washington Times more >\n\nAccording to the article the administration put out a deliberately misleading narrative about the way the nuclear negotiations came about, linking them to the rise in 2013 of the \u201cmoderate\u201d President Hasan Rouhani at the expense of \u201chardliners,\u201d ushering in a supposedly new political reality in Iran, reports CNS News. Obama was known by insiders to have wanted to make a deal with Iran from the beginning of his presidency in 2009, but the idea that the rise of \u201cmoderates\u201d provided the opportunity was \u201clargely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal,\u201d Samuels wrote.\n\n\u201cBy obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNow the next president and our children will have to deal with a world where Iran obtains nuclear weapons along with the capability to deliver them as they continue to test intercontinental ballistic missiles. America\u2019s allies in the Middle East no longer trust us. Heck, after reading these reports, how could any of our allies trust us? Obama has done immeasurable damage to the national security of the United States and our allies around the world.
