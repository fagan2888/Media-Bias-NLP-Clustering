Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner resigned and blamed unbuilt computer systems for the phony numbers scandal.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nNow, the White House is at it again, claiming that 11.4 million people have \u201csigned up\u201d for Obamacare. Even if that number were accurate\u2013and it\u2019s not\u2013it would still fall well short of the 13 million target the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected should have enrolled by now. Still, Obama\u2019s latest number represents the number of people it claims have filled out paperwork, not the number who have paid their first month\u2019s premium and activated coverage. The figure also includes individuals who are ineligible but filled out forms anyway\u2013a segment of individuals that numbered in the hundreds of thousands during the last enrollment period. Indeed, even the Huffington Post was forced to concede \u201cthe enrollment tally is bound to come down in the coming months.\u201d\n\nAs Forbes\u2019 Avik Roy notes, if the prior 84% retention rate holds this time\u2013and assuming HHS is not fudging its numbers again\u2013Obamacare will \u201cend up with 9.5 million enrollees\u201d for 2015. Again, CBO predicted Obamacare would have 13 million by year\u2019s end. What\u2019s more, millions of those individuals are simply the 5 million people who had their insurance plans canceled due to Obamacare and were forced into the health exchanges. Roy calculates that just 5.4 million of those signing up for Obamacare this year are previously uninsured individuals\u2013a far cry from the 11.4 million figure Obama is touting.\n\nWorse for Obamacare is the realization many are coming to that having an insurance card is not the same thing as having real coverage. Case in point: the New York Times\u2019 devastating expose revealing that complex Obamacare plans mask true out-of-pocket costs to individuals, have radically shrunk options and networks, and have left many so frustrated they have stopped seeing doctors altogether.\n\n\u201cThe new fees are so confusing and unsupportable that they just avoid seeing doctors,\u201d the Times explained.\n\nThe New York Times noted Obamacare is \u201cundermining its signature promise: health care that is accessible and affordable for all\u201d and that \u201cpatients were paying more in health care expenses than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe purported purpose of the Affordable Care Act was to make insurance more affordable, not less. However, a recent CBS/New York Times poll finds that 46% of Americans are struggling to afford health care\u2013a 10% jump from last year.\n\nObamacare remains deeply unpopular. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, just 39% of Americans support Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last year, the Obama administration announced to much fanfare that it cleared 8 million Obamacare enrollments but later admitted it inflated those figures by 1.3 million.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Last year, the Obama administration announced to much fanfare that it cleared 8 million Obamacare enrollments but later admitted it inflated those figures by 1.3 million.", "title": "Obama Touts Phony Obamacare Numbers (Again) - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obama-wink-smile-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/18/obama-touts-phony-obamacare-numbers-again/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last year, the Obama administration announced to much fanfare that it cleared 8 million Obamacare enrollments but later admitted it inflated those figures by 1.3 million.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obama-wink-smile-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama Touts Phony Obamacare Numbers (Again) - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "New York Times, Obama, obamacare, Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Texas Health and Human Services Commission,Big Government, Obamacare,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Texas Health and Human Services Commission", "published_time": "2015-02-18T09:08:21-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8387\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLast year, the Obama administration announced to much fanfare that it cleared 8 million Obamacare enrollments but later admitted it inflated those figures by 1.3 million.\nMoreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner resigned and blamed unbuilt computer systems for the phony numbers scandal.\nHowever, a recent CBS/New York Times poll finds that 46% of Americans are struggling to afford health care\u2013a 10% jump from last year.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNow, the White House is at it again, claiming that 11.4 million people have \u201csigned up\u201d for Obamacare.\nRoy calculates that just 5.4 million of those signing up for Obamacare this year are previously uninsured individuals\u2013a far cry from the 11.4 million figure Obama is touting."}
