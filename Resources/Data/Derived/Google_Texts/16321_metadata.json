One Wisconsin-based IT business has adapted a sensor initially designed for property managers and hotels to work in hospitals, extended care and nursing home facilities.\n\nIn an interview with John Bialk, CEO of QuietyMe, he said noise is a common complaint by patients. It keeps them awake and prevents them from getting a decent sleep, but it can also have unexpected consequences too. Noise undermines patient safety. Fatigued patients tend to be stressed, feel pain more keenly and are less likely to retain critical health information when they\u2019re discharged, which could interfere with their recovery. Those were some of the findings of a report published in 2013 by the U.S. Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality at the American Hospital Association.\n\nHe also points out that the company is trying to solve a very old problem. \u201cUnnecessary noise is the most cruel abuse of care which can be inflicted on either the sick or the well.\u201d That didn\u2019t come from a 21st century consultant\u2019s book. It comes from a book by Florence Nightingale penned in 1859 \u2014 Notes on Nursing.\n\nThe sensors are placed in patient rooms and a dashboard component helps alert nursing stations to areas where noise levels are greatest so they can take a closer look at what\u2019s causing them and develop a solution. The company creates a score for each shift by looking at noise levels for each room and comparing them from one day to the next. It equips hospitals with the ability to change the conversation from placing blame to solving problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBialk said talking is the biggest source of patient noise complaints. But this tends to be discovered months after patients fill out these surveys when any response seems passive aggressive at best. Nurses tend to get the rap, but as Bialk points out the blame could rest with doctors, medical staff taking blood from neighboring patients.\n\nThe current remedy for noise in hospitals tends to be soundproofing tiles that muffle sound. But the nice thing about QuietyMe is that it provides data that can trigger conversations on how to improve how healthcare workers can respect patients\u2019 sleep needs and still get their work done.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a lean startup approach to the problem. We\u2019re looking at this issue from the patient\u2019s perspective, \u201d he said. \u201cA lot of consultants come in and try to tell healthcare staff how to do their job.
