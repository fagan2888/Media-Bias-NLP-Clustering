A judge says there is enough evidence to try a woman accused of causing an accident that killed a mother and her 3-year-old son.

Arica Vlach is facing several charges including DUI and vehicular homicide.

Investigators say Vlach was driving over 70 miles and hour when she hit a minivan carrying Nichole Enderle and her two young children.

Enderle, who was wearing her seat belt, was killed along with 3-year-old Alexander, who was also properly restrained.

Enderle's daughter Zoe, 2, survived the crash.

The crash happened July 12, 2013 at the intersection of Log Road and Judge Orr east of Colorado Springs.
