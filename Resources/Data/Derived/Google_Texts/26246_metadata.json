Since it was built more than 30 years ago, Loring Greenway (stretching from Nicollet Mall to Loring Park) has been owned and maintained by the city of Minneapolis, not the Park Board. More than a popular bicycle and pedestrian thoroughfare, Loring Greenway provides traditional park features, serving as a place for children to play, event space and a \"back yard\" for condo/apartment dwellers. The park features two fountains, walking/biking paths, gardens, planters, seating areas and a playground.\n\nWhen the greenway fell into disrepair, the city had funds only to restore the hardscape. Thus, residents who live along and near the park formed the Loring Greenway Association, a nonprofit organization, to maintain the greenway. Generous contributions come from residents, condo associations and businesses that line the park or are located near it. Volunteers plant and maintain the gardens and trees, organize events, and work with the city to keep the hardscape looking its best. The association not only helps solve the financial problems of park maintenance, but also brings neighbors and businesses together in a unique way that happens only in an urban setting.\n\nThe Yard, like Loring Greenway, could function both as a local park and a public event space, but its success will hinge on the involvement of the residents and businesses located on or near it. Just planting grass and trees won't suffice. Isn't it better to plan and fund park features before the first shovel turns dirt?\n\nStart early by forming a nonprofit organization to elicit funds from nearby residents and affluent Wells Fargo and the Vikings (whose properties will line the park and benefit from it). If the much larger Loring Greenway can succeed and flourish with a city-citizen partnership, The Yard can also.\n\nSTEVE MILLIKAN, Minneapolis", "article_metadata": {"description": "New downtown park could be owned by the city, with a nonprofit providing funding.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "New downtown park could be owned by the city, with a nonprofit providing funding.", "title": "Loring Greenway is a model for 'The Yard'", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/loring-greenway-is-a-model-for-the-yard/241744981/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2LOG012414.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2LOG012414.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New downtown park could be owned by the city, with a nonprofit providing funding.", "title": "Loring Greenway is a model for 'The Yard'", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/loring-greenway-is-a-model-for-the-yard/241744981/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2LOG012414.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/2LOG012414.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Loring Park"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "The Yard,Loring Greenway,Minneapolis Park Board,Loring Park"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae13\"", "article_summary": "If the much larger Loring Greenway can succeed and flourish with a city-citizen partnership, The Yard can also.\nThus, residents who live along and near the park formed the Loring Greenway Association, a nonprofit organization, to maintain the greenway.\nSince it was built more than 30 years ago, Loring Greenway (stretching from Nicollet Mall to Loring Park) has been owned and maintained by the city of Minneapolis, not the Park Board.\nMore than a popular bicycle and pedestrian thoroughfare, Loring Greenway provides traditional park features, serving as a place for children to play, event space and a \"back yard\" for condo/apartment dwellers.\nThe Yard, like Loring Greenway, could function both as a local park and a public event space, but its success will hinge on the involvement of the residents and businesses located on or near it."}
