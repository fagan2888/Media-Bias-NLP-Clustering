We have our preference.\n\nWays and Means is vested with awesome legislative authority over the $3.5 trillion tax system, our multi-trillion-dollar trade laws, the 14% of our economy devoted to health care and the millions of Americans on welfare.\n\nIf Republicans intend to modernize the tax code, revamp welfare and repeal or at least fix ObamaCare, they better get the right man for this job. Under the Constitution, all tax bills must start in the House, and Ways and Means is where the major changes in the code are first written.\n\nTwo men are vying to take over the chairmanship: Pat Tiberi, a seven-term congressman representing Columbus, Ohio, and Kevin Brady, an eight-termer from north of Houston. Both are qualified.\n\nBrady\u2019s next in line in seniority, but that isn\u2019t the reason he\u2019s the right pick here. He is first and foremost a warrior for tax reform and tells us he wants to bring the corporate rate \u201cwell below 25%.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican companies can\u2019t compete on a global scale with rates so high,\u201d he adds.\n\nHis first choice, Brady says, would be to convert America away from an income tax and toward a consumption-based tax. He is also a free-trader, a proponent of the restoration of a strong dollar and the author of free-market health reforms.\n\nOn trade, he\u2019s a staunch supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact and says the U.S. will thrive under a free-trade regime around the world with lower tariffs and barriers.\n\nOne of his passions is to revamp the big three budget drivers: Medicare, Medicaid and ObamaCare. \u201cI want to give consumers way more choices in health care\u201d is how he explains his approach. \u201cChoice and competition always drive down costs better than central control.\u201d\n\nThis race for the gavel takes on heightened importance, given the possibility of a Republican House, Senate and president in 2016. Does Brady think under that scenario, game-changing free-market reforms in government can pass in 2017?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, yes. I really believe we can run the table and get back to rapid growth immediately.\u201d\n\nThe only rub against Brady is that there are already seven Texans who run congressional committees. But \u201csince when is the GOP a party of quotas?\u201d he asks. He\u2019s right that the way to prevent one state from having outsized power is through term limits on chairmanships.\n\nTiberi is said to be the first pick of the Wall Street lobbyists \u2014 all the more reason why he shouldn\u2019t get the job this time around.\n\nSpeaker Ryan, who controls this selection process, declared last week that in order to win, Republicans have to be the party of big and bold solutions. He\u2019s right, of course, and that begins with putting reformers in positions of influence to make that change happen.\n\nWednesday\u2019s decision by Ryan will be the first indication of how committed he is to free-market reforms and a desperately needed growth agenda.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress: House Republican leaders on Wednesday will decide who will chair the powerful Ways and Means Committee \u2014 the perch vacated by Paul Ryan when he", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Congress: House Republican leaders on Wednesday will decide who will chair the powerful Ways and Means Committee \u2014 the perch vacated by Paul Ryan when he became Speaker.
