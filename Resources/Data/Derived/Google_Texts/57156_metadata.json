Mark Udall for voting for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 not a surprising mouthpiece in a race that will likely come down to suburban women.\n\nBut the woman in the ad, Richelle McKim, is actually an employee of an energy company that is among the biggest donors to Udall\u2019s opponent; and her story, which seemingly contradicts information on her publicly available LinkedIn profile, is at least more complicated than the 30-second version hitting Colorado\u2019s airwaves starting Thursday.\n\nIn the new spot, titled \u201cRichelle\u201d, McKim is sitting at her kitchen table with a cup of coffee talking about how \u201cpolicies coming out of Washington really do affect us here at home.\u201d\n\nShe describes her husband\u2019s decision to start his own business\n\n\u201cWe knew we needed to find healthcare,\u201d McKim said. \u201cBecause we were a single income family, we couldn\u2019t afford our plan.\u201d\n\nOn the screen, text appears that reads: \u201cRichelle had to go back to work.\u201d\n\nMcKim\u2019s own LinkedIn profile shows that she has worked constantly since July 2008 \u2014 four months before President Obama was elected.\n\nFrom July 2008 to May 2010, she worked as an office manager for Mission Basement Company, her husband\u2019s company, out of the family\u2019s home in Castle Rock.\n\nSince 2010, she has worked in Colorado\u2019s oil and gas industry: she served as assistant to the GM of Wattenberg Anadarko Petroleum from May 2010 to August 2013; since then, she\u2019s been employed as an engineering technologist by Noble Energy, where she works currently.\n\nReached by phone Thursday afternoon at her office, McKim explained that she went back to work in 2010 because it was too tough making ends meet on her husband\u2019s income.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just a financial burden, having a single income for so long.\u201d\n\nWhen she was working from home, McKim and her young children were covered under her health insurance plan and her husband went without insurance. Adding him to the plan would have cost the family an extra $800 a month because he\u2019d been treated for high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cHe had no insurance and that was a very good thing for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were able to choose if we wanted health insurance or not.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which now lowers costs for people with preexisting conditions like high blood pressure, mandated that all individuals get health insurance by the end of last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alarming that when we have illegals here, they can still choose if they want health care, but we as citizens no longer have that choice,\u201d McKim said.\n\nMcKim\u2019s husband is now covered under her employee plan offered by Noble, which offers medical, dental and prescription insurance plans to its employees; Anadarko, her previous employer, also offers medical plans.\n\n\u201cI went back to work to get benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nAnadarko Petroleum is currently the biggest contributor to GOP Congressman Cory Gardner\u2019s campaign to unseat Udall, having given $57,550 through the company\u2019s political action committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nNoble Energy has given Gardner\u2019s campaign $36,000 to date.\n\nMcKim said she was connected with Crossroads GPS through \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d and that she\u2019s pleased with the ad\u2019s portrayal.\n\n\u201cI think it captured the heart of my message, which is that entrepreneurship is a risk and when you\u2019re imposing overreaching policies that mandate people have to buy things they can\u2019t afford, it takes that away,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- A new TV ad from Crossroads GPS features a Castle Rock mom criticizing Democratic Sen.
