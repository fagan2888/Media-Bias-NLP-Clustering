Schuylkill County Coroner David "Doc" Moylan rode a massive wave of support in his home county to become the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, unofficial results show.

The Associated Press called the race for Moylan, an oncologist from South Manheim Township, with the Pennsylvania Department of State's website putting him out front with 7,056 votes based off unofficial results. Matt Connolly, of Bethlehem, was second with 4,545 votes, and Matt Dietz, of Wind Gap, was in third with 2,716 votes.

Efforts to reach Moylan were not successful tonight.

Moylan will now face incumbent U.S. Rep. Matthew Cartwright in November in a district that critics say was made a Democratic stronghold through gerrymandering. The new district includes a swath of Northampton County, including Easton.

Cartwright defeated incumbent Tim Holden in the 2012 Democratic primary by attacking Holden's vote against the Affordable Care Act. He secured an easy victory in the November election over Laureen Cummings, a tea party leader from Scranton.

The unofficial early results on the Pennsylvania Department of State website showed Moylan rode a massive wave of support in his home county to clinch the victory. The Schuylkill County website showed Moylan cruising to victory there with 6,235 votes with 100 percent of the vote in. Connolly was second with 1,163 votes and Dietz third with 818 votes.

Unofficial results from the district's five other counties showed Connolly claiming modest victories, but it was not enough to overcome the Schuylkill County total. From his primary night party at Porters Pub in Easton, Connolly said he knew he needed to win the other five counties to earn the nomination, but Moylan did better than they predicted outside of Schuylkill County.

"He didn't campaign anywhere else, and he's already picked up a lot in some of the other counties," Connolly said before the official results came in. "I'm not thrilled right now."
