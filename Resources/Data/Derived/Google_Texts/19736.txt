Neurosurgeon and conservative speaker Ben Carson appeared on Fox & Friends Tuesday morning and was asked by host Brian Kilmeade about his remarks at the Values Voters Summit last fall, in which he told the crowd that Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”



“The issue that I was bringing up is not slavery,” Carson said. “The issue is that we have taken the most important thing we have as free Americans and turned it over to the government.”

“You go and look at the neo-Marxist literature, and see what they say that,” he continued, “and the need, in order to bring America into in line with everybody else, to make the populace dependent.”

Kilmeade pointed out that Carson had a plan “for everybody to have health care,” but the specifics were spared.
