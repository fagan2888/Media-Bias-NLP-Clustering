That means that Spain has joined the relatively elite club of nations whom investors will pay to hold their money.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Spanish government sold three quarters of a billion dollars in six-month securities at a rate of -0.002 percent. The offering sold out.\n\nSounds like a great arrangement. The Spanish government actually borrows money from investors, pays back less than the total principle six months later, and the lenders are somehow satisfied that they got a good deal.\n\nRelated: New York City\u2019s $2.5 Billion Lesson for Investors\n\nThat raises the question: How come the U.S. Treasury Department is still paying interest on relatively short-term debt? U.S. Treasury securities are, traditionally, the closest thing to a risk-free asset that investors can find. Yet when it comes to yield, the U.S. pays (an admittedly tiny) 0.02 percent on its six-month securities, while Spain\u2019s rate is negative.\n\nLook at the yields on longer-term debt, though, and the difference is significant. On Thursday, the rate on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 1.97 percent, while Spain was able to borrow over the same 10-year window at only 1.22 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to ascribe the change to the European Central Bank\u2019s relatively recent conversion to the belief that easy money policies will aid in the region\u2019s economic recovery. But considering the fact that the Federal Reserve already has U.S. rates near zero, that can\u2019t be the whole story. So, what gives? Is somebody at the Treasury Department falling down on the job?\n\nRelated: 15 Fortune 500 Companies Paid No Federal Income Tax in 2014\n\nNot exactly, says economist Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nTo begin, he admits, the entire concept of negative interest rates is a bit odd for most economists. \u201cI used to give talks where I would talk about the \u2018zero lower bound\u2019 on interest rates,\u201d said Bernstein, who formerly served as chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThen, in the last few months, I find people will raise their hand and say, \u2018There is no zero lower bound.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, the way rates are being set today falls under \u201cfairly established market mechanisms that seem pretty coherent to me.\u201d\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t just factoring in the likelihood of getting paid back, but also their actual return once inflation is taken into account. \u201cWhat matters to investors is the real rate of return,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cBut even with low inflation investors are already paying us to hold on to their money in real terms.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin and Tsipras Get Chummy to Stick It to the West\n\nJust how these rates get set is also worth remembering. \u201cThe thing to understand there is that these yields are set at auction; these are market-set rates,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe government offers, investors bid and the yields are set.\u201d The main reason investors placing their money in Spain are willing to settle for a negative return is that they don\u2019t anticipate significant future growth in the Spanish economy, and don\u2019t need to be compensated for the inflation that would accompany it.\n\nThat\u2019s different in the U.S., Bernstein said. \u201cInvestors here could certainly argue that they need a premium against future inflation rates. That would be different in economies that are doing less well.\u201d\n\nCountries like, for instance, Spain.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If United States Treasury securities are the safest investment in the world, how come the U.S. has to pay more to borrow money on the bond market than a country like Spain, which can actually borrow money for six months at a negative interest rate?", "title": "Why Is Spain Getting a Better Deal on the Bond Market Than the U.S.?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/12/Why-Spain-Getting-Better-Deal-Bond-Market-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022011_us_bonds_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/12/Why-Spain-Getting-Better-Deal-Bond-Market-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022011_us_bonds_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If United States Treasury securities are the safest investment in the world, how come the U.S. has to pay more to borrow money on the bond market than a country like Spain, which can actually borrow money for six months at a negative interest rate?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd07a\"", "article_summary": "To begin, he admits, the entire concept of negative interest rates is a bit odd for most economists.\n\u201cThe thing to understand there is that these yields are set at auction; these are market-set rates,\u201d Bernstein said.\nThat means that Spain has joined the relatively elite club of nations whom investors will pay to hold their money.\n\u201cInvestors here could certainly argue that they need a premium against future inflation rates.\n\u201cI used to give talks where I would talk about the \u2018zero lower bound\u2019 on interest rates,\u201d said Bernstein, who formerly served as chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden."}
