The number of closed meetings has risen about 10 percentage points since fiscal 2012, and the percentage is higher than the average of 67.6 percent of meetings that were closed during the second term of Republican George W. Bush.\n\nCRS reviewed data provided by federal agencies under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. There are roughly 70,000 outside experts, peer-review consultants, academics and federal employees who serve on the panels in any given year; the total cost to taxpayers was $334.5 million in 2014 to operate 825 committees.\n\nThe report said the reasons for holding closed meetings range from allowing an expert to give an honest assessment of which academic studies are most qualified to receive a federal grant without fear of retaliation, to protecting proprietary information in grant applications.\n\nAdvisory committees are allowed to hold closed meetings but, by law, a committee\u2019s designated federal officer must obtain prior approval from either the agency head or the General Services Administration\u2019s \u201ccommittee management secretariat\u201d to hold a closed meeting.\n\nThe committees gather information to provide advice to the president and federal agencies on a wide range of policy issues. The Department of Health and Human Services leads all agencies with 264 advisory committees. The Commission on Civil Rights has 51 committees, while the sprawling Department of Homeland Security has a relatively low total of 27 advisory panels.\n\nThe total cost to run the advisory committees has fallen from its high point of $450 million in 2006 under Mr. Bush, with the meetings increasingly being held via webcast or videoconference.\n\nWhile the overall number of committee meetings are rising, 164 active advisory committees held no meetings at all in fiscal 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite President Obama's pledge to conduct the most open administration in history, the number of closed-door meetings by federal advisory committees is on the rise during his second term.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Despite President Obama\u2019s pledge to conduct the most open administration in history, the number of closed-door meetings by federal advisory committees is on the rise during his second term.", "title": "Obama administration sees increased in closed-door meetings", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/4/obama-administration-sees-increased-in-closed-door/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/21/3075e50354ac7b2f850f6a706700ec11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/21/3075e50354ac7b2f850f6a706700ec11.jpg", "description": "Despite President Obama's pledge to conduct the most open administration in history, the number of closed-door meetings by federal advisory committees is on the rise during his second term.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama administration sees increased in closed-door meetings"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics"}, "article_summary": "While the overall number of committee meetings are rising, 164 active advisory committees held no meetings at all in fiscal 2014.\nDespite President Obama\u2019s pledge to conduct the most open administration in history, the number of closed-door meetings by federal advisory committees is on the rise during his second term.\nCRS reviewed data provided by federal agencies under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\nThe committees gather information to provide advice to the president and federal agencies on a wide range of policy issues.\nA new report by the Congressional Research Service found that 71 percent of all agency committee meetings were closed to the public in fiscal 2013 and 2014."}
