An elderly woman in the springs trying to bounce back from an infuriating crime.

It's the kind of thing that could happen to any of us.

She was conned out of thousands of dollars.

Ruth Baer hired a contractor to build her deck, after she paid him $6,000 he walked off the job, without finishing almost any of the project.

After Colorado Custom Decks and Noah's Restoration heard about what happened they decided to rally around Ruth.

The group spent the day rebuilding Ruth's deck at no cost, using donated materials from Home Depot.

They say they hope other homeowners can learn from this unfortunate incident and make sure contractors are insured, licensed and bonded.

Ruth says she's overwhelmed by the support.

"The lord is looking after me I'll tell you or otherwise how could it have happened the way it did,‚Äù Baer said.

The contractor was later arrested by Colorado Springs police.
