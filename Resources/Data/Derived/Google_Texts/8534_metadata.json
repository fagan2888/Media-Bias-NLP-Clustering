I remembered a disturbing phone call from a good friend in the Obama Administration. I have known this friend for years. The call was a short time after 9/11 (maybe Oct. 2012?) In the call, my friend told me that my colleague Jennifer Griffin, who was aggressively reporting on Benghazi, was wrong and that, as a favor to me, my friend in the Administration was telling me so that I could tell Jennifer so that she did not ruin her career. My friend was telling me to tell Jennifer to stop her reporting. Ruin her career?\n\nIn 20 plus years, I have never received a call to try and shut down a colleague \u2013 not that I even could \u2013 this was a first. Here is what I know: Jennifer is a class act\u2026.experienced..and a very responsible journalist. One of the absolute best in the business \u2013 no axe to grind, she just wants the facts.\n\nI told my friend before I go to Jennifer telling her she is wrong, I need proof she is wrong, strong proof and you need to be specific \u2013 what are you saying she is getting wrong? We went around and around \u2014 including the statement again that this was just a call as a favor to Jennifer and me to save Jennifer\u2019s career from reporting incorrect information. I got no proof. Zero. I smelled a rat. Favor to me? Hardly. My friend was trying to use me. I feel bad that a friend did that to me, tried to use me for a dirty reason. I knew then \u2014 and it is now confirmed by BIPARTISAN Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 Jennifer was getting her facts right. I think it is really low for the Administration to stoop this low.", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "Here are SOME of the stories in today's STACK ...\r\n\r\n\r\n1) ObamaCare Surprise: Government can \u00a0grab your assets after you die to recoup Medicaid costs ...\r\n\r\n\tUtah Governor has decided to expand Medicaid, while Pennsylvania's governor is catching flack for refusing to do so...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhite", "title": "#ObamaCare Surprise: Why The Government May Send You A Hefty Bill After You Die..
