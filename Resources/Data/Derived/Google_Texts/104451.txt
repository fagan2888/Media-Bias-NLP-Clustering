NBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd said he believed that Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker needed to be “more alpha” in future debates.

Todd gave glowing reviews for the debate performances from Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush during a Friday Today show appearance, but said he wanted more from the Wisconsin Governor. “Scott Walker, sometimes you wondered where he went,” he said.

“For a frontrunner– he didn’t make any mistakes. But for a frontrunner, he disappeared too often last night,” Todd continued. “As debates go on, he needs to look more alpha, look more presidential.”
