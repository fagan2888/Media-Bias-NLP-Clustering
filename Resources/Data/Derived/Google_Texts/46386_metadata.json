John McCain says he wants to see a lawsuit against the Obama administration over the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s in defiance of the law and I believe we should have lawsuits that bring justice,\u201d McCain tells The Daily Signal.\n\nBack in the spring, President Barack Obama signed into law the Corker-Cardin bill, which required his administration to turn over \u201call related materials and annexes\u201d related to the Iran deal. Once it did so, Congress had 60 days to pass either a resolution of disapproval, which would prevent Obama from granting waivers to U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, or a resolution of approval.\n\nHowever, many congressional Republicans say that hasn\u2019t happened because the details of the so-called \u201cside deal\u201d between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency that oversees the inspections of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites hasn\u2019t been obtained.\n\nMcCain and other leading Republicans believe that this should be challenged in court.\n\n\u201cWe ought to go to court on this one, because I believe it\u2019s in violation of the law that was passed that required a full and complete understanding of all the details of the agreement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
