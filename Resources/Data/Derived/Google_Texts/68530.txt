Democratic House candidate Sean Eldridge won’t say whether he’d vote for Obamacare or support Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) to be Speaker of the House.

Eldridge, the husband of New Republic editor and millionaire “poke” button pioneer Chris Hughes, blasted the disastrous Obamacare rollout in an interview with Real Clear Politics published Thursday.

“I’m very frustrated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,” Eldridge told RCP’s Scott Conroy.

Asked whether he would have voted for the legislation, Eldridge punted. “It’s impossible to speculate on something when I wasn’t there and wasn’t in the room and didn’t have an opportunity to vote on it,” he explained.

Obamacare has become a political albatross for congressional Democrats, and Eldridge “has honed an anti-Washington message,” Conroy wrote.
