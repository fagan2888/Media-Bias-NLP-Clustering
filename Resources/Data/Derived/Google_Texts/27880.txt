Although Sen. Ted Cruz personally receives his healthcare through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as Politico reported in 2015, he has promised to “rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done.”

The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld Obamacare’s right to exist, but Cruz takes issue with Obama’s use of executive action.

“You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country,” Cruz said on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, according to Breitbart. “The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority.”

“Now, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done.”

Cruz has been a vocal opponent of Obamacare from the start, but it remains unclear what Cruz will do to help those without healthcare if he manages to repeal it.
