Kennedy that she couldn\u2019t have realized at the time would launch a campaign for marriage equality that continues 50 years later.\n\nIn her letter, Loving asked Kennedy if the Civil Rights Act of 1964 might be the vehicle that allow her and her husband to return to their home state of Virginia, from which they had been banished for the \u201ccrime\u201d of being married.\n\nSlide show: 10 women in the civil rights fight\n\nSix years earlier, Loving, then a 17-year-old homemaker, and her 23-year-old husband Richard, a bricklayer, had been arrested and jailed for violating Virginia\u2019s anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. She was black; he was white. The Lovings were sentenced to a year in prison \u2013 to be suspended if they agreed to leave Virginia and not set foot in the state again for 25 years. \u201cAs long as you live you will be known as a felon,\u201d the judge in the case said in issuing his ruling.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nKennedy advised Loving to contact the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU quickly agreed to represent the couple in what would become a landmark Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia (1967). In a unanimous decision, the Court held state bans on interracial marriage to be unconstitutional \u2013 16 states had them at the time \u2013 and declared that the \u201cfreedom to marry\u201d belongs to all Americans.\n\n\u201cThey both were shy and reticent,\u201d Bernard S. Cohen, who as a lawyer in the ACLU\u2019s Washington office argued the case for the Lovings, recalled in 2008. \u201cBut she was the protagonist in the family to push this case forward.\u201d\n\nIn June 2007, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Mildred Loving issued a statement that said, in part:\n\nI believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. I am still not a political person, but I am proud that Richard\u2019s and my name is on a court case that can help reinforce the love, the commitment, the fairness and the family that so many people, black or white, young or old, gay or straight, seek in life. I support the freedom to marry for all.\n\n\n\nLoving died the following year at age 68.\n\nThe date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, June 12, has become known as Loving Day.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "In 1964, Mildred Loving wrote a letter to Attorney General Robert F.
