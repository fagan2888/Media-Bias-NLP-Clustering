The attackers crippled Sony's computer network and leaked unreleased films, inflammatory e-mails and financial documents. They also threatened violence against theaters that showed \" The Interview,\" a comedy about bumbling journalists trying to assassinate North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un. The US government has pointed its finger at North Korea as the force behind the attack and has imposed sanctions against the country.\n\nThe announcements also follow a year of high-profile news stories about hacks of major retail chains in the US, including Home Depot, Target, Staples and others. Those attacks exposed various customer data, including, in some cases, numbers and verification codes for payment cards.\n\nThe president's travel next week will be used to highlight his plans for the Internet and include visiting the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center in Arlington, Va., according to Reuters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president will lay out plans next week for identity and privacy protections and network security, as well as ways to spread access to broadband Internet.", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "description": "The president will lay out plans next week for identity and privacy protections and network security, as well as ways to spread access to broadband Internet.", "title": "Obama to outline new cybersecurity measures", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-to-outline-new-cybersecurity-measures/", "image": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/01/28/08c09744-a5e1-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/670x503/bc42182d1a63b798a90693b52b129add/obamaSOTU2014.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president will lay out plans next week for identity and privacy protections and network security, as well as ways to spread access to broadband Internet.", "creator": "@CNET", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-to-outline-new-cybersecurity-measures/", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/01/28/08c09744-a5e1-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/670x503/bc42182d1a63b798a90693b52b129add/obamaSOTU2014.jpg", "height": 503}, "title": "Obama to outline new cybersecurity measures", "site": "@CNET", "card": "summary", "account_id": 30261067}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-to-outline-new-cybersecurity-measures/?search=toapp", "app_name": "CNET", "app_store_id": 383989837}}, "tp": {"baseUrl": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetmpxpdk/pdk"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001036810388, "app_id": 16995676698}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-task": "name=Forums; action-uri=http://forums.cnet.com/; icon-uri=http://www.cnet.com/favicon.ico", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.cnet.com/", "fragment": "!", "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet"}, "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf717\"", "article_summary": "CBSPresident Barack Obama will propose next week new ways to boost online security and Internet access, according to reports.\nThe US government has pointed its finger at North Korea as the force behind the attack and has imposed sanctions against the country.\nThey also threatened violence against theaters that showed \" The Interview,\" a comedy about bumbling journalists trying to assassinate North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un.\nObama's announcements follow the massive hack of Sony Pictures late last year.\nThe president's travel next week will be used to highlight his plans for the Internet and include visiting the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center in Arlington, Va., according to Reuters."}
