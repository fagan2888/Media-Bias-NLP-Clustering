The youngsters respond to questions from U.S. Border Patrol agents by following directions written on printed handouts provided by smugglers.\n\n\u201cThey carry scripts with them telling them how to answer questions,\u201d Shawn Moran, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, told The Daily Signal. Moran\u2019s union represents 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\n\nThat\u2019s not all the young border crossers carry, though. Besides the paper script of what to say, and sometimes identification such as a birth certificate, some bring communicable illness.\n\nAlthough easily captured along the U.S. border with Mexico, the more than 52,000 children detained this fiscal year without adults to care for them arrive with challenges that threaten the morale and health of the Border Patrol agents who first come into contact with the youngsters \u2013 and initially care for them.\n\nThe children are kept in tight quarters, prompting one Arizona physician to tell The Daily Signal this morning that such conditions \u201ccould become a public health crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal confirmed Thursday that an unaccompanied minor was hospitalized and diagnosed with H1N1, or swine flu, after being housed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, a facility run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. An HHS spokesman, calling it an isolated case, said the child was responding to treatment and being monitored.\n\nThough those who illegally enter the U.S. from foreign countries may come while sick, Moran says the illnesses generally rarely transfer to Border Patrol agents \u2013save for the occasional case of tuberculosis.\n\n\u2018Morale Is Pretty Bad\u2019\n\nBut today\u2019s crisis is more acute. Authorities anticipate they will apprehend more than 240,000 illegal immigrants in the Rio Grande Valley, about three-quarters from Central America, during this fiscal year. And the threats to Border Patrol agents are unusual.\n\nMoran, in an interview yesterday with the Daily Signal, said other union representatives tell him that a \u201chandful\u201d of agents who have encountered the child migrants have been diagnosed with scabies, a contagious skin infection caused by mites.\n\nMany of the children have lice, Moran said, but he has not heard any reports of his agents contracting lice.\n\nJust the threat of illness \u2013 although part of the job \u2013 makes life difficult for the agents. Many are being diverted from their usual border posts to more remote areas where smugglers transfer the children, such as the bank of the Rio Grande near McAllen, Texas.\n\n>>> Steven Bucci: Some Minors Crossing Border Bring Health Risks\n\n\u201cMorale is pretty bad, between what is happening in Texas and how it\u2019s impacting other sectors,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThe sheer numbers [of children] are making it more dangerous. The concern about diseases like scabies is that [the agents] don\u2019t want to bring it home to their families.\u201d\n\n\u2018Conducive to Spreading Disease\u2019\n\nDr. Jason Fodeman, who practices internal medicine in Arizona, says he is concerned about the tight spaces in which the children are contained.\n\n\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve seen and heard, these children are in closed, tight, cramped quarters, sleeping on the floor and in close contact with each other,\u201d Fodeman, a former health policy fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal this morning, adding:\n\nAll of that is very conducive to spreading communicable diseases, spreading it to other children and to border guards as well, who can spread it to other Americans in the community. We don\u2019t know [the children\u2019s] medical background. It\u2019s something that can get out of hand really quickly, and could become a public health crisis.\n\nScabies, Fodeman said, is a skin rash that is \u201cincredibly contagious\u201d and \u201cincredibly uncomfortable.\u201d As a strain of flu, H1N1 is more serious.\n\n\u201cIf we have a patient in the clinic with scabies, after he leaves, we call our infection control people and they clean the whole room,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a patient has scabies, I\u2019m wearing gloves.\u201d\n\n>>> James Carafano: How Amnesty Talk Makes the Illegal Immigration Situation Worse\n\nAlthough scabies is spread by contact, Fodeman said it would not require hospitalization and is treatable by a visit with a doctor and medication.\n\nBorder Patrol agents hold children for 72 hours before transferring them to HHS, which oversees detention shelters and works to find family or a sponsor in the United States.\n\nWithin 24 hours, a child undergoes an initial health screening, coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and conducted by a medical professional. Those screenings, however, do not include a lab test \u2014 the only definitive way to diagnose swine flu, which has similar symptoms to a seasonal flu.\n\nStandard Procedure\n\nOnce the Border Patrol transfers the child to the HHS, medical personnel administer a \u201cwell-child exam\u201d and give childhood vaccinations needed \u201cto protect against communicable diseases,\u201d the HSS spokesman said.\n\nHHS also screens the child for tuberculosis and performs a mental health exam.\n\nAt that point, \u201cif children have any communicable disease or have been exposed to a communicable disease, they are placed in a program or facility that has the capacity to quarantine,\u201d the HHS spokesman said. \u201cIf they have mental health problems, they are similarly placed in a specialized facility to meet their needs and not in a temporary shelter.\u201d\n\nIf a border agent were to get sick, Moran said, he or she would fill out paperwork (called a CA-2 and CA-16) with the U.S. Department of Labor and then be sent to a doctor or hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cIn terms of quarantine, that would be up to the local medical authorities,\u201d Moran said.\n\n>>> Genevieve Wood: What I Saw at the Border", "article_metadata": {"description": "The surge of unaccompanied children detained along the border with Mexico carry disease and other challenges that threaten the morale of the Border Patrol.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The surge of unaccompanied children detained along the border with Mexico carry disease and other challenges that threaten the morale of the Border Patrol.", "title": "Swine Flu Case Shows Agents Face Health Risks at Border", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140626_H1N1_Siegel.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-11T13:34:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1nRuiip"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The surge of unaccompanied children detained along the border with Mexico carry disease and other challenges that threaten the morale of the Border Patrol.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140626_H1N1_Siegel.jpg"}, "title": "Swine Flu Case Shows Agents Face Health Risks at Border", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "homeland,immigration", "published_time": "2014-06-28T16:18:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T13:34:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "illegal immigrants, scabies, H1N1, border patrol, unaccompanied minors, swine flu, HHS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19b7\"", "article_summary": "The youngsters respond to questions from U.S. Border Patrol agents by following directions written on printed handouts provided by smugglers.\nMoran\u2019s union represents 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\nAnd the threats to Border Patrol agents are unusual.\nThough those who illegally enter the U.S. from foreign countries may come while sick, Moran says the illnesses generally rarely transfer to Border Patrol agents \u2013save for the occasional case of tuberculosis.\nBorder Patrol agents hold children for 72 hours before transferring them to HHS, which oversees detention shelters and works to find family or a sponsor in the United States."}
