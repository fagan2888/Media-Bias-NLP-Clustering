In part because a number of states (led by Republican governors) opted not to expand their Medicaid programs, an estimated three million Americans remain uninsured. A working paper released last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research sheds light on some of the financial consequences of those expansions, or a lack thereof: Public health insurance, it turns out, improves the financial well-being of not only the insured but the various people and institutions that the insured do business with.\n\nThe researchers compared the credit reports of individuals in states that expanded Medicaid to similar individuals in states that opted out of the expansion, focusing on people in the zip codes likely most affected by the expansion. They looked at six key indicators of general financial well-being and indebtedness: total debt, total debt past due, credit card debt, credit card debt past due, the number of non-medical bills sent to collections, and the total non-medical balance outstanding in collections.\n\n\u201cOur main finding is that Medicaid expansions that began in 2014 significantly reduced the number of unpaid non-medical bills and the amount of non-medical debt sent to third-party collection agencies among people living in zip codes that are most likely affected by the expansions,\u201d the authors concluded. The researchers estimate that the Medicaid expansions decreased the amount of non-medical debt in collections by between $600 and $1,000 for low-income families who obtained insurance due to the expansions.\n\nMedical debt has ripple effects on other aspects of a family\u2019s finances.\n\nEconomists have established that, not surprisingly, health insurance reduces medical debts, but this paper is a reminder of another important truth: Medical debt has ripple effects on other aspects of a family\u2019s finances. \u201cA hit in terms of medical debt can affect more than just medical debt \u2014 it affects your whole financial portfolio,\u201d says Sarah Miller, an economics professor at the University of Michigan and one of the co-authors of the new paper.\n\nWhen people are faced with unmanageable medical bills, they often don\u2019t pay other things, including rent, credit card bills, utility bills. A report published earlier this year by the New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation explored the financial sacrifices families make to pay high medical bills \u2014 70 percent of people who had problems paying their medical bills reported that they cut back spending on food, clothing, or basic household items; 59 percent exhausted their savings; and 34 percent increased their credit card debt. In all, 61 percent of people in the survey reported problems paying their other bills, and 35 percent reported that they\u2019d been unable to pay for basic necessities.\n\nOf course, not all health insurance affects financial well-being equally. On balance, the ACA seems to have improved the financial well-being of Americans. A survey published last year by the Commonwealth Fund found a decline in the number of Americans reporting medical-related financial difficulties. But one of the major revelations of the joint New York Times/Kaiser survey was that people with private health insurance are still struggling to pay their medical bills, due to a shift toward higher deductibles and co-pays that predate the ACA but that some argue has worsened since the bill\u2019s passage. Medicaid, by contrast, isn\u2019t generally characterized by high cost-sharing requirements. \u201cOne thing we know about Medicaid is that it\u2019s very generous in terms of cost sharing,\u201d Miller says. \u201cYou tend to have very, very low co-pays, or no co-pays, whereas, with private insurance, there tends to be different effects.\u201d\n\nThis latest research also sheds light on another important truth about health insurance, which is often overlooked in the ongoing debate over the costs of reform: Unmanageable medical debt affects not just the patients, but also all the other individuals and businesses that those patients and their families financially interact with. \u201cThis is a really big financial gain for the community as well,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThe benefits are spread throughout the community \u2014 because it\u2019s not just the households, it\u2019s the people who are doing business with them, who can now collect on their debt.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, the United States does indeed have a big problem with health-care spending, and it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s gotten far too little attention during this election cycle. But denying insurance to people doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t eventually need health care. The uninsured may forgo preventive care or ignore a nasty cough, but eventually that cough will turn into pneumonia, or they\u2019ll slip and fall on a patch of ice and break an arm.\n\nDenying insurance to people just means that when those unavoidable hospital visits do occur, uninsured patients, the safety-net hospitals that care for them, and the communities these patients live in will all suffer financially.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Denying health insurance to people just means that uninsured patients and the communities those patients live in will suffer.", "title": "The ACA\u2019s Medicaid Expansions Benefited More Than Just the Insured \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "Denying health insurance to people just means that uninsured patients and the communities those patients live in will suffer.", "title": "The ACA\u2019s Medicaid Expansions Benefited More Than Just the Insured \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/the-affordable-care-act-s-medicaid-expansions-benefited-more-than-just-the-newly-insured-9a4d0118ba7b", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*bQOzrgQqwjzfXbIGFSY0gw.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@DwyerGunn", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*bQOzrgQqwjzfXbIGFSY0gw.jpeg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "3 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/9a4d0118ba7b"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dwyer Gunn", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/the-affordable-care-act-s-medicaid-expansions-benefited-more-than-just-the-newly-insured-9a4d0118ba7b"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/9a4d0118ba7b", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/9a4d0118ba7b", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2016-04-25T13:01:02.428Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@DwyerGunn"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By Dwyer Gunn(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Since their introduction, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansions have been a point of controversy.\nWhen people are faced with unmanageable medical bills, they often don\u2019t pay other things, including rent, credit card bills, utility bills.\nThe researchers estimate that the Medicaid expansions decreased the amount of non-medical debt in collections by between $600 and $1,000 for low-income families who obtained insurance due to the expansions.\nMedical debt has ripple effects on other aspects of a family\u2019s finances.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid Expansions Benefited More Than Just the Newly InsuredDenying health insurance to people just means that, when those unavoidable hospital visits do occur, uninsured patients and the communities those patients live in will suffer."}
