Clad in dark suit and yellow tie, Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-3) described the concept in his usual characteristically candid and plain-spoken way, calling it a more \u201cpersonalized\u201d approach to healthcare in the state, like the kind he \u201chad as a young man.\u201d It would \u201cactually improve care, and reduce costs,\u201d for workers and physicians alike, he said.\n\nMost importantly, though, it would save the state a ton of money as it battles an unruly pension and benefit system. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a new concept to deliver healthcare, one that helps the workers with better health and a better life, and also helps the taxpayers. That\u2019s the win-win,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nThere were others, too, in the room to help Sweeney push the issue. Behind him, to one side, stood a motley crew of practicing physicians who took turns at the mic describing how, under today\u2019s fee-for-service healthcare model, they felt like victims on an endless \u201chamster wheel\u201d, and how patient-centered care allowed them to return to affecting real change in the lives of patients (the \u201creason why I got into this business,\u201d said one). To the other side stood a scrum of broad-shouldered labor leaders, figureheads of groups from the AFL-CIO to the New Jersey Education Association to the Communications Workers of America, who praised the program for promising to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare costs at a time when they sit at an all time high.\n\nFor political observers in the room that day, it was this group that stole much of the spotlight, despite the more passionate accounts offered by the doctors who\u2019d actually need to take on the burden of the new program (burden, because the program\u2019s cost-savings for the state comes through asking physicians to participate voluntarily). \u201cThe concept before you this afternoon really has the potentially to be a sea change,\u201d said Eric Richards, a lobbyist for the AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cWe commend Senator Sweeney on this issue and support his cause as we continue to move forward,\u201d added NJEA secretary-treasury Sean Spiller.\n\nTHE PICTURE OF Sweeney and public labor standing shoulder-to-shoulder to advance the same initiative last week was important, not solely because the latter\u2019s support will likely be instrumental in bringing the plan to fruition. It was also, after all, the first time in nearly four years the two forces \u2014 Sweeney and the Senate Majority office and public labor unions like the NJEA \u2014 had partnered on such a big-ticket item.\n\nPolitical observers will recall well the falling-out Sweeney, a one-time iron worker and darling of public and private sector labor alike, had with organizations on this side of the labor fence. In 2011, swept up in feelings of partisanship-busting and productivity the then-newly-minted Republican governor had brought to Trenton, the top Democrat joined forces with Chris Christie on a plan to reform the state\u2019s sizable and chronically underfunded pension and benefit system, bringing to heel runaway costs and neglected payments by governors going back over a decade. Under the new agreement, workers would have to contribute more to the system, but the state would finally pay its fair share.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not how it ultimately played out. Christie rescinded on the agreement, opting instead to cut $2.4 billion in scheduled pension payments in favor of plugging a gaping state budget shortfall. The washout put the state back in the predicament it was before, and is now, drawing the outrage of millions of public sector workers and union bosses who saw their livelihoods jeopardized as a result. Much of that outrage found its target in Sweeney, in their eyes a labor champion-turned-Trenton insider who had bought in to Christie\u2019s false promises and got little to nothing to show for it.\n\nSince then, the need for Sweeney to find his way back into the good graces of these public labor unions has been great. It\u2019s also likely never been greater, as the prospective gubernatorial candidate prepares for life post-Christie. \u201cThe big battle in 2017 is going to be for the Democratic base,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cSweeney has a ways to go to repair relationships with state public workers unions, and he knows it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Sweeney himself seemed to implicitly note the significance of Thursday\u2019s meeting, and stressed repeatedly the importance of having labor at the bargaining table. \u201cThat\u2019s a big statement,\u201d Sweeney said, pointing over his right shoulder to the group in the corner. \u201cAnd hopefully the administration will not demonize labor, but will actually be willing to come to the table also.\u201d\n\nAt least one bystander threw out the word \u201creunion\u201d, referring to Sweeney and the public labor heads gathered in attendance. Others, however, speaking to PolitickerNJ in the days following the presser, rejected the characterization.\n\n\u201cThis is all through the lens of there\u2019s going to be some reuniting with Sweeney,\u201d said one source present in the room Thursday who requested anonymity. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThose on the public labor side involved in the deliberations over the new healthcare concept\u2019s roll out in particular \u2014 as well as sorting out the pension and benefit mess in general \u2014 suggested that this latest partnership is one born out of convenience. As the state struggles to meet its pension liabilities, Christie\u2019s answer has been continued cuts or more contributions from workers, forcing public labor unions and those in the legislature looking to curry their favor to search for their own solution. \u201cFor too long, negotiations over healthcare benefits have boiled down to who would pay for what,\u201d said Spiller Thursday, later echoed by Richards: \u201cThis concept isn\u2019t about cost-shifting, it\u2019s about cost saving, and that\u2019s why I think organized labor is excited about this program.\u201d\n\nThus, labor leaders said this new patient-centered healthcare concept is a way to preserve some semblance of benefits in the face of state budget cuts and rising costs under the ACA. But it\u2019s also a way to circumvent Christie, who they say has \u201cstonewalled every step of the way\u201d their efforts toward making healthcare reforms. \u201cWe finally realized that the governor\u2019s side of the pension and benefit design committee will continually stonewall us on making any changes or even getting correct information,\u201d said Patrick Colligan, president of the state Policeman\u2019s Benevolent Association, referring to the evenly-split 12-member board created in 2011 to handle pension and benefit planning. \u201cSo we started thinking outside the box.\u201d\n\nColligan said public unions\u2019 meeting with Sweeney on the issue was almost coincidental \u2014 both had been working on parallel courses for \u201cover two years\u201d two come up with a new concept to offer more affordable healthcare to state workers. And with Christie\u2019s pension and benefit commission report due out the end of this week, which many expect to conform to the cost-shifting rhetoric the Republican presidential hopeful has already employed in his dealings with the unions, they realized they needed to get ahead of the game. \u201cIt was really just a healthcare issue,\u201d Colligan said, noting that \u201cyou can\u2019t not have a relationship with the senate president.\u201d\n\nColligan added that the initiative will likely require Christie\u2019s stamp of approval \u2014 or at least the approval of a handful of the governor\u2019s appointees on the 12-member design committee \u2014 to begin it\u2019s roll out. He said he \u201chopes that somebody on that committee has the guts to see we really are trying to save costs.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The administration] is only going to be interested in making us pay more and get less,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that there are some options out there, and thankfully Senator Sweeney did too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not read anything into this other than what it is,\u201d said the other source, referring to the implication that the old tensions have been laid to rest with this new initiative.\n\nBut for Sweeney, it is, at the very least, a political opportunity. \u201cHe\u2019s jumping in where there\u2019s a lot of fear and uncertainty,\u201d Murray said, \u201cso it gives him the opening to mend some fences.\u201d\n\nIF THE NEW patient-centered healthcare plan is a play by Sweeney to win back public labor\u2019s affections, not all are persuaded, however. Sweeney will have to do more, critics say, than that to earn their support \u2014 and even then, it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll ever be able to fully rectify the past.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t replace that,\u201d Lionel Leach, president on CWA Local 1039, said of the new healthcare initiative. \u201cYou can\u2019t screw people over with their pensions and benefits and then try to put something in place that was only going to help 60,000 people. I don\u2019t think this exactly makes up for that.\u201d\n\nWhile Leach said figuring out an alternative to rising healthcare costs is important, he\u2019s skeptical of how much the program would actually accomplish, given the relatively sparse details offered so far. During the press conference Thursday, Sweeney and Mark Blum, Executive Director of America\u2019s Agenda, said pilot programs will be rolled out in five different parts of the state, catering to at least $60,000 participating workers. It would encourage doctors to put quality over quantity of care by limiting the number of patients they see and paying them monthly rather than per visit. It would also reduce or do away with all together the pesky out-of-pocket costs that make regular doctor visits so off-putting for patients.\n\nBut for Leach, that still only makes up for a fraction of what they were promised \u2014 and never given \u2014 in 2011. \u201cWe were told that the [2011 reforms] would cure the pension situation,\u201d Leach said. \u201cNeedless to say, it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPolitical experts note that securing the support of figures like Leach and Local CWA 1039\u2019s dozens of members will be essential for gubernatorial aspirants like Sweeney and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop in 2017, when a fierce Democratic primary is expected to take place after four years of Republican leadership. Those candidates are already making calculated moves to position themselves for that battle, Sweeney with initiatives like this one in Trenton and Fulop by building strategic alliances with North Jersey power brokers. Anyone who can more convincingly approach that base \u2013 including former Germany Ambassador Phil Murphy, who launched his own organization, New Start New Jersey, geared toward capturing the progressive vote \u2014 will bolster their chances two years for now.\n\nIn a sense, Leach is an early litmus test. And right now, he said, neither Sweeney nor Fulop nor Murphy is passing muster.\n\n\u201cLionel Leach is looking for a candidate that has pure Democratic values. And the members of Local 1039 will be looking for a gubernatorial candidate with those principals,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the party right now has Democrats that are not really Democrats at times. They waver on real Democratic issues and policies. And I don\u2019t think people are going to be fooled with just \u2018this is what I want to do.\u2019 Your actions have to show more.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leach isn\u2019t sure Sweeney\u2019s latest act \u2014 or any, for that matter \u2014 can repair the bridges burned over the last few years.\n\n\u201cYou work with the governor to try and do this. You work with public employees and say this is going to fix it, and it doesn\u2019t fix it,\u201d Leach said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you overcome that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/dscn0831.jpg?w=50", "description": "THE PICTURE OF Sweeney and public labor standing shoulder-to-shoulder to advance the same initiative last week was important, not solely because the latter's support will likely be instrumental in bringing the plan to fruition.
