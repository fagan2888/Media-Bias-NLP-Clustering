It\u2019s one of the things I love most about this job. His last query concerned what would happen if Obamacare\u2019s cost controls failed, \u201clike it\u2019s failing in Mass[achusetts],\u201d to which I pointed out that none of the cost controls in Obamacare have been tried in Massachusetts. The latest serious question hinges on his belief that government-dominated industries never innovate:\n\nSerious question for @jonathanchait: what is the track record for innovation in govt led corporatist industries? http://t.co/WKjO4ExEMi \u2014 Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) January 15, 2014\n\nBeing no expert in the field, but having the working knowledge that comes from living in the actual world rather than the world of Rush Limbaugh\u2019s imagination, I immediately cited defense, aerospace, and biotechnology. I don\u2019t see how you can deny that the progression of military technology from dudes with muskets to tanks and cruise missiles represents innovation. Likewise, we\u2019re definitely better at sending stuff into outer space than we were when NASA was founded in 1958.\n\nMany others have since sprang to mind. Agriculture has been dominated by socialistic regulation for 80 years, which is a terrible policy in my opinion, but certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the industry from developing massively effective productivity improvements. Defense investment obviously includes the development of the Internet. Finance is pretty crony-ist, and I know Carroll agrees, and it\u2019s innovated in a lot of ways I\u2019d call negative, but it\u2019s certainly innovated. The government-directed fracking technology and horizontal drilling. Plus lots more, including \u201cinnovations from machine tools to railroads, electricity transmission, transistors, lasers, the internet, GPS, and every aspect of energy exploration and development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has the government ever done for us?\u201d turns out to be a loaded question with a disappointingly long answer.\n\nThere is a lot more history and analysis of government\u2019s role in innovation. While I\u2019d agree that a completely state-dominated economy would probably have less innovation on the whole, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the simplistic libertarian caricature \u2014 government can only stifle innovation \u2014 bears little resemblance to observed reality.\n\nCarroll, characteristically, is declaring victory anyway:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "There's no such thing as innovation in a government-led industry is there?
