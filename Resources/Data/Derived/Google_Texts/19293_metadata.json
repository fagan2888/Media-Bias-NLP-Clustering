That's not what we were promised.\"\n\nThe drop-off appeared in the final version of the development plan this spring when it came to staff and officials for final signatures, Town Manager Matt Magley said.\n\nResident complaints about the work caused Magley to take another look at the documents this fall, he said.\n\n\"My memory was that it was included in that final development plan but when I looked at the plans again in October it wasn't,\" Magley said.\n\nSuperior's town attorney advised Magley that the grading change does not require a public hearing or vote from the Board of Trustees for approval, Magley said.\n\nChritton called Magley's mistake unacceptable and accused developer Randy Goodson of \"sneaking\" the change into the plan after approval from Trustees to avoid pushback.\n\nGoodson said he worked within the town's process to include the grading and called resident accusations \"disingenuous.\"\n\n\"There are a couple of homeowners who are trying to create a dispute where there shouldn't be one,\" Goodson said. \"That agreement does not say that land would remain untouched. There's never been a documented plan that I'm aware of for that buffer zone.\"\n\nMayor: 'I did not have the knowledge' of change\n\nGoodson said he has been working with Rock Creek residents since development plans began, including dropping the ground lining the buffer zone where new homes are planned to lessen the impact on existing residents' views.\n\nSuperior Mayor Clint Folsom said he signed off on the plan unknowingly, without thoroughly reading the document.\n\n\"I signed off on the cover page that's part of the packet but what was changed was about 10 or 12 pages deep in that packet,\" Folsom said. \"That's typical with several things I sign. It's put in front of me by staff and I trust that they did their job and I sign it. I did not have the knowledge of the grading change.\"\n\nFolsom was elected in November and was not yet mayor when the board approved the original plan in August 2014.\n\nMagley said earlier project plans did not include changes to the buffer zone because a final plan had not been developed for the 250-foot section of land, which cannot be developed but could include landscaping and other natural improvements.\n\n\"It was a misstep to permit the buffer zone grading,\" Magley said. \"We issued the grading permit, but in hindsight it would have been better to have a final plan for the space in place, first.\"\n\n\"On a path' to rectify mistake\n\nFollowing complaints from residents in the form of letters, phone calls and addressing town officials during public meetings, Magley said the town staff is developing a plan to restore the excavated portion of the buffer zone.\n\nPlans will likely include replenishing dirt removed from the 250-foot section of land and a retaining wall separating the buffer zone from the new development, Magley said.\n\nDetails are still being discussed. But Magley estimates the project could cost about $500,000 to complete including the wall and landscaping on the buffer.\n\nMagley said he expects to present a finalized plan to the Board of Trustees for approval at the Dec. 14 meeting. Work likely will not return to the buffer zone until the spring, he said.\n\n\"In hindsight, we should have done some things differently but we're on a path now to rectify that,\" Folsom said. \"Residents deserve to know what's happening next to their homes and we want that to happen. Please know that staff and the town board are working as diligently as possible to get a resolution to this.\"\n\nChritton said she is glad the town is addressing the problem but is disappointed that the oversight is racking up additional costs for the town and causing headaches for Rock Creek neighbors.\n\n\"The biggest issue is that we've been ignored,\" Chritton said. \"We did everything possible to let them know there was a problem when the work started and they didn't respond.\n\n\"It took months of calls and letters and talking at public meetings for them to listen and that's unacceptable,\" she said. \"I hope they learned their lesson.\"\n\nWhitney Bryen: 303-473-1113, wbryen@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/soonerreporter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/superior-news/ci_29145508/oversight-could-cost-superior-500k-restoration-at-town", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29145508:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-21T11:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Dozens of residents in Superior's Rock Creek neighborhood are being vindicated this week after discovering an  oversight by town officials that could cost   $500,000 to rectify.", "title": "Oversight could cost Superior $500K in restoration at Town Center development", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/superior-news/ci_29145508/oversight-could-cost-superior-500k-restoration-at-town", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1120/20151120__21DCASUPw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1120/20151120__21DCASUPw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-11-24T15:41:14-0700", "endDate": "2025-11-20T16:27:40-0700", "byline": "By Whitney BryenStaff", "pubDate": "2015-11-20T17:42:45-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-21T11:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Oversight could cost Superior $500K in restoration at Town Center development", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Superior News", "description": "Dozens of residents in Superior's Rock Creek neighborhood are being vindicated this week after discovering an  oversight by town officials that could cost   $500,000 to rectify.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/superior-news/ci_29145508/oversight-could-cost-superior-500k-restoration-at-town", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Dozens of residents in Superior's Rock Creek neighborhood are being vindicated this week after discovering an  oversight by town officials that could cost   $500,000 to rectify.", "title": "Oversight could cost Superior $500K in restoration at Town Center development"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1120/20151120__21DCASUPw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Plans will likely include replenishing dirt removed from the 250-foot section of land and a retaining wall separating the buffer zone from the new development, Magley said.\nWork likely will not return to the buffer zone until the spring, he said.\n\"My memory was that it was included in that final development plan but when I looked at the plans again in October it wasn't,\" Magley said.\nDozens of residents in Superior's Rock Creek neighborhood are being vindicated this week after discovering an oversight by town officials that could cost $500,000 to rectify.\nThe drop-off appeared in the final version of the development plan this spring when it came to staff and officials for final signatures, Town Manager Matt Magley said."}
