While expansion is called for by the ACA, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the decision is up to the individual states.\n\nMedicaid expansion is off the table in Georgia, at least for the time being. Gov. Nathan Deal and state legislative leaders have stood firmly against expansion, saying it would be too costly for the state. Few Georgia politicians have pushed for it, and in fact a state law passed in 2014 increased the roadblocks to potential Medicaid expansion.\n\nBrian Robinson, a spokesman for the governor, said Thursday in an e-mail to GHN, \u201cMedicaid expansion adds another expensive layer of entitlement spending at a time when current entitlements are already crowding out essential spending projects. As it is currently constructed, Medicaid expansion is too expensive for Georgia, and recent reports have shown that it has not been the windfall for hospitals that Obama officials promised.\u201d\n\nTwo recent reports gave conflicting pictures of how expansion and the ACA have affected Kentucky hospitals, one of two Southern states that have expanded Medicaid.\n\nA report from Deloitte Consulting and the University of Louisville\u2019s Urban Studies Institute said Kentucky hospitals received $506 million more in Medicaid reimbursement since January 2014 because of the expansion, and that the expansion generated more than 12,000 new jobs in health care and related fields, USA Today reported.\n\nThe Kentucky Hospital Association, though, said the ACA overall has left them facing billions of dollars in cuts and forced them to lay off staff and shut down services. The report went beyond Medicaid expansion costs to include cuts from other parts of the law, such as the loss of charity care funds and the penalties on hospitals for high patient readmission rates.\n\nTim Sweeney, deputy director of policy for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, which supports the ACA and Medicaid expansion, said Friday that the \u201cbenefits of expansion for hospitals are real\u201d \u2014 as are the health benefits to Georgians, he added.\n\nAnother hospital at risk\n\nThe hospital environment in Georgia, meanwhile, remains turbulent.\n\nThe Georgia Hospital Association says its members are facing the most difficult financial conditions they\u2019ve ever seen. The state\u2019s rate of uninsured people remains among the highest in the nation. And since 2013, five hospitals in Georgia have closed.\n\nOne more hospital appears to be teetering on the edge of collapse. Clayton County in metro Atlanta has allocated no money for the 331-bed Southern Regional Medical Center in Riverdale for the county\u2019s 2016 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThe hospital cannot survive as it does currently unless we receive external financial support,\u2019\u2019 Kim Ryan, the Southern Regional CEO, told the Atlanta Journjal-Constitution.\n\nThe Clayton Board of Commissioners approved a plan to hire a consulting firm to evaluate all viable strategic options, including identifying potential strategic financial partners for the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, uncompensated care charges have increased at the hospital. In 2014, Southern Regional\u2019s cost of uncompensated care was $21 million.\n\nThe White House report this week said uncompensated care costs would be $410 million lower in 2016 if Medicaid expansion were fully in effect in Georgia.\n\nA Southern Regional spokesman would not respond to a question on whether expansion would help the hospital\u2019s finances. Tal Wright, the spokesman, pointed instead to a proposed Medicaid waiver to insure more Georgians. That plan was developed by Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe support Grady\u2019s initiative to tailor a program for Georgia through the 1115 waiver, and we hope that those discussions continue to develop a waiver that serves Georgians,\u201d said Wright.\n\nTo date, 28 states have expanded Medicaid. The issue has prompted a long, fierce debate in Florida.\n\nThe state Senate in the Sunshine State passed an expansion bill this week. But despite several changes made in recent days to assuage the concerns of the Republican majority, the Florida House remains poised to defeat the plan.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Government, Health, Latest News, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "ATLANTA -- The Obama administration rolled out new statistics this month to buttress the argument that Georgia should expand its Medicaid program.", "title": "Feds make pitch for Ga.
