The life of a firefighter can be very time-consuming and leaves very little time for a gym membership. So how do America’s Bravest stay in shape with such little time? Answer: the firefighter’s workout. A video uploaded by The New York Times shows exactly how members of the New Brunswick, N.J., fire department stay fit, improve their cardiovascular health, and ensure they are ready for whatever the job throws at them.

“People have this image of the firefighter running out of a burning building holding a baby in this super athletic state,” Lieutenant Robert Piparo told The New York Times. “But we’re just your everyday Americans who have chosen to do a very dangerous job. And we fall into the same pitfalls as everyone else. We work crazy schedules and our sleep cycles are very interrupted.”

According to Lieutenant Piparo, 40 to 50 percent of firefighters who are killed in the line of duty die as the result of a heart attack. The firefighter’s workout consists of functional fitness training, so don’t expect any bicep curls or any other isolation exercises. Instead, they work on compound exercises using various items strewn around the firehouse. For example, Piparo and his team use two 1 ¾ inch fire hoses for battles ropes, the back bumper of a fire engine for box jumps, and 32 gallon foam pales for farmer’s walks.

The New Brunswick fire department is just one of many firehouses participating in 555 Fitness, a charity run by firefighters from all over the country. The charity provides other firehouses with daily workout plans and free exercise equipment.
