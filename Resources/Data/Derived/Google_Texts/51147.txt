WILLISTON, N.D. (AP) - The police and fire departments in the western North Dakota oil patch hub of Williston will expand under the 2015 budget approved by city commissioners.

The $5.8 million law enforcement budget will enable the police department to hire eight more officers, the Williston Herald reported (http://bit.ly/XgKylq ). With four other new officers expected to be hired by the end of this year, the force will grow from 42 officers to 54.

“It is very clear that we will continue adding staff to law enforcement in the next three to five years steadily,” Emergency Services Commissioner Tate Cymbaluk said. “Until we stabilize as a community, we have no choice but to add more officers to the streets.”

Williston’s population has doubled in size since 2010, to an estimated 30,000 people. Crime, including violent crime, has risen along with the number of residents.

“It was rare to see human trafficking, murders, the amount of drugs coming through,” Cymbaluk said. “Those are crimes many of us haven’t seen before. When it happens in your own community it’s concerning, and it makes us realize how important it is to have a strong police force.”

The 2015 city budget also provides $12.9 million for ambulance and fire services. It will add nine firefighters to the current staff of 33 and fund a second fire station.

City commissioners approved the new budget last week. It totals $250 million - five times what the city spent four years ago.

The City Commission and the Williams County Commission also have agreed on a ballot measure that would initiate a 1 cent sales tax to provide an estimated $30 million annually for public safety funding and ease pressure on the city and county budgets. Residents will vote on the matter Nov. 2.
