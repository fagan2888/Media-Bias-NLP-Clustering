Milbank, SD

Every member of the gymnastics team at Milbank High School since 1978 has been coached by Jeanne Sinclair. But that's about to end.



Sinclair, a Sisseton native and University of South Dakota graduate, will retire from Milbank at the end of this school year.



Sinclair says that during her 37-year career she's not only been a coach, but also "part-mother, part-counselor and part-friend" to the Bulldog gymnasts.



Sinclair says one of the highlights of her coaching career was the opportunity to train her twin daughters, one of whom won the state Class A uneven bars title in 2003.



While some schools have benefited from local gymnastics youth clubs, many of the Bulldog performers have no prior gymnastics training before participating in Milbank's program.
