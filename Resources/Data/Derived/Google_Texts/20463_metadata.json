(AP) - Blankets, pads and sheets drape over more than 30 of the chairs near the stage at the Mountaineer Opry House.\n\nIt\u2019s not laundry day - the drapery signifies the favorite seats claimed by long-time fans of one of the region\u2019s main hubs for bluegrass music.\n\nThat\u2019s just where they like to plop down for the regular Saturday shows, and don\u2019t you sit there.\n\nThe Opry House has been drawing fans for a long time.\n\nPaul King, a retired chemical truck driver for Union Carbide, opened the doors in 1972, hoping to supplement his retirement, according to a history of establishment in the Fall 2012 edition of Goldenseal magazine.\n\nTickets were just $1.50, as King hoped to create a sort of local version of Nashville\u2019s Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThat\u2019s how it felt to fiddler Bobby Taylor, who is quoted in the Goldenseal history, remembering his early days as a performer there with the Teays Valley Boys.\n\n\u201cIn its own way, it was our Grand Ole Opry, and we all were thrilled to step on that stage on Saturday night,\u201d Taylor recalled.\n\nInitially, the lineups included mainly local country, bluegrass and gospel acts with the occasional professional act appearing maybe once a month.\n\nAs the Opry House became better known, more national name acts played there. The theater seating for 550 would fill up and sometimes lead to standing-room only crowds in the mid \u201870s, when marquee acts like Ernest Tubb and Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys came to town.\n\nAfter King\u2019s wife died, he asked Larry Stephens to keep the music going in 1991.\n\n\u201cWhen she died he just didn\u2019t want to fool with it anymore, and he asked me if I\u2019d take it over,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nAt the time, Stephens was still a lieutenant with the Cabell County Sheriff\u2019s Department, where he had a 36-year career, 18 of those years as chief deputy.\n\nHe retired a dozen years ago and he and his wife, Mary, have been keeping a steady stream of bluegrass and bluegrass gospel music hitting the stage, starting at 7:30 p.m. most Saturdays of the year, with the occasional country act, like Rob McNurlin and the Beatnik Cowboys, thrown in.\n\nMary does the booking, although the Opry House is such a staple on the bluegrass circuit that most bands call them for bookings.\n\n\u201cWe usually don\u2019t have to call in bands to book, because we\u2019ve been there as long as we have now. A lot of them are repeated from one year to the next,\u201d Stephens said.\n\n\u201cSome of them when they play the Opry House they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, I want this same date the next year.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe bands that perform are a who\u2019s who of the national bluegrass and bluegrass gospel circuit, as well as up-and-coming stars. Stephens ran a few of the names:\n\n\u201cWe just had the Grascals. IIId Tyme Out. Of course, as always we have Doyle Lawson twice a year. The Larry Stephenson Band. We\u2019ve had Rhonda Vincent and the Rage. When Bill was alive we had Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys. The Osborne Brothers. Jim and Jesse and the Virginia Boys. And the list just goes on and on.\u201d\n\nThe green-walls of the stage feature a portrait of Monroe, as if casting his blessing over the proceedings. In the back of the room is a concession stand that serves up Mary\u2019s hot dog chili, fresh popcorn, barbecue and soft drinks.\n\nDepending on the fame of the band, crowds vary from perhaps 60 on the low end to a couple hundred on the upper end.\n\n\u201cIt might average out to 150 to 200, if you averaged it into the year,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nAgain, depending on the fame of the band, ticket prices vary: from $15 for adults, $12 for seniors and $5 for children 12 and under to a straight $15 for adults and $5 for children 12 and under.\n\nHe and his wife are certainly not in it for the money, Stephens said.\n\n\u201cIf I did it for a living, I\u2019d quit. It\u2019s more of a hobby for me and Mary. You\u2019re not going to make any money from it. If you don\u2019t do it because you like it you might as well forget it.\n\n\u201cBoth of us are retired and I have volunteer people to help me with it. So, I\u2019ve got no expense in that respect. I don\u2019t have to pay people to help me. Otherwise, if you did, we just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe Opry House is a reliable Saturday night destination for some fine bluegrass music in a family-friendly setting, Stephens said.\n\n\u201cMary and I, we just try to keep it going as a place for people to come and enjoy themselves. It\u2019s family entertainment. We have no drinking, no drugs, no smoking. We try to keep it strictly family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of old school. It\u2019s kind of down-to-earth,\u201d he said. \u201cJust put it this way, we sell more senior tickets than we do adult tickets.\u201d\n\nHe not only likes the music on the stage but the people that the music draws.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I found about it is people that come are just some of the finest people you\u2019d just ever want to meet. They\u2019re just good down-to-earth people.\u201d\n\nHow long can the Opry House keep going?\n\nThat\u2019s an open question since the heirs of Paul King still own the property and building, located right off the Milton exit of Interstate 64, and not much has been done to the old building over the years.\n\n\u201cOne of these days, they\u2019ll probably sell and somebody will buy it and it\u2019ll probably be gone.\u201d\n\nUpcoming acts at the Opry House include:\n\nFeb. 14: The Corey Hensley Band\n\nFeb. 21: The Hart Brothers\n\nFeb. 28: The Clinton Gregory Bluegrass Band\n\nFor more information, visit www.mountaineeropry.com .\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Charleston Gazette, http://www.wvgazette.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blankets, pads and sheets drape over more than 30 of the chairs near the stage at the Mountaineer Opry House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/mountaineer-opry-house-in-milton-keeps-music-acts-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Blankets, pads and sheets drape over more than 30 of the chairs near the stage at the Mountaineer Opry House.", "title": "Mountaineer Opry House in Milton keeps music acts going"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blankets, pads and sheets drape over more than 30 of the chairs near the stage at the Mountaineer Opry House.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mountaineer Opry House in Milton keeps music acts going"}, "Author": "DOUGLAS IMBROGNO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca962\"", "article_summary": "MILTON, W.Va.
