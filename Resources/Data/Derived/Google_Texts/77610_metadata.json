Soon, health care workers and patients may see the following advisory: \u201cHandshake-free zone: To protect your health and the health of those around you, please refrain from shaking hands while on the premises.\u201d\n\nAlthough research has long associated handwashing with decreases in bacterial colonization and hospital-acquired infections, only 40 percent of clinicians and other health care workers comply with such mandatory hygiene policies. Among patients and visitors, handwashing hygiene is even lower. And alcohol-based rubs, the most touted solution to hospital hygiene problems, remain ineffective against such dangerous pathogens as Clostridium difficile.\n\n\u201cThe hands of health care workers often serve as vectors for transmission of organisms and disease,\u201d wrote Drs. Mark Sklansky, Nikhil Nadkarni, and Lyn Ramirez-Avila. \u201cHealth care workers\u2019 hands become contaminated with pathogens from their patients, and, despite efforts to limit the spread of disease, cross-contamination of health care workers\u2019 hands commonly occur through routine patient and environmental contact.\u201d\n\nCommon handwashing policies in health care settings reflect wisdom gleaned multiple studies showing the handshake as a vector of dangerous pathogens, with bacteria surviving longer on the hand in the presence of mucous.\n\n\u201cThe handshake represents a deeply established social custom. In recent years, however, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of hands as vectors for infection, leading to formal recommendations and policies regarding hand hygiene in hospitals and other health care facilities,\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cSuch programs have been limited by variable compliance and efficacy. In an attempt to avoid contracting or spreading infection, many individuals have made their own efforts to avoid shaking hands in various settings but, in doing so, may face social, political, and even financial risks.\u201d\n\nHowever, the UCLA team has an even better solution for friends and colleagues greeting one another in health care settings: the fist bump.\n\nSource: Sklansky M, Nadkarni N, Ramirez-Avila L.
