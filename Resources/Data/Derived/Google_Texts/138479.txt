"I asked young voters across the country, 'What words come to mind when you think of the Republican Party?' and it was words like close-minded, racist, intolerant, old-fashioned, stuck in the 1950s," says Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, who is the author of the new book The Selfie Vote: Where Millenials are Leading America (And How Republicans Can Keep Up). She adds, "I don't know if Republicans have done enough, recently, to combat this image."

In a conversation with Reason TV's Nick Gillespie, Soltis Anderson talks about the coming political impact of the millennial generation, who outnumber the baby boomers but don't yet vote in their numbers; their unprecedented ethnically diverse demographics; why they eschew "traditional" touchstones of adulthood such as home ownership in favor of entrepreneurial ventures; and how President Obama has left his rivals in the dust when it comes to actively engaging the younger generation on social media.
