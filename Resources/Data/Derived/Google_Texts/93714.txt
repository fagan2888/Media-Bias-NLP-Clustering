Paul Bracken likes to keep his message fresh.

So when he comes to Dallas to speak about sound strategic thinking at our One Day University Executive Edition, he’s added new material to help folks in the health-care industry plan for the future now that Obama Care is installed.

The 66-year-old professor at Yale University School of Management gave his talk What is Strategic Thinking? Game Theory, Simulation, Role Playing, and other Frameworks to businesspeople at a similar One Day U in New York earlier this year — without reference to the medical drama.

For the past two years, those in the health-care sector have been focused on the politics and regulations of the Affordable Care Act, Bracken says. Like it or not, now that it’s a reality, it’s time for them to shift gears.

“They’re starting to think about, ‘What strategies should we pursue?’ ” says Bracken. “I’m going to put some health-care examples into my talk, which were not in there when I gave it in New York.”

Want to hear what those are? Come to One Day University Executive Edition on Nov. 1 at the Belo Mansion in downtown Dallas.
