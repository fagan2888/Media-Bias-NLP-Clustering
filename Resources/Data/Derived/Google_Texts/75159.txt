Trump's Son Slams Obama: "He Ignores Every Problem We Have," Does He Care? Who Knows?

Eric Trump, Donald's son explains what the elder Trump meant when he said there is something "going on" with the president that no one really understands.





ERIC TRUMP: My father is an incredibly practical guy, incredible direct guy. How do you defeat an enemy if you can't even say what they are. We have this shooting in Paris, this shooting in California, many attacks all over the world.



We have 9/11 here not too many blocks from where we are right now.



How do you defeat an enemy if you can't name it? The problem is not going away.



When does the president acknowledge the problem? That is my father's frustration.



FOX NEWS HOST: That's the first part, the second part is: "There's something going on with him that we don't know about."



What does your dad believe is going on with this president that we don't know about?



ERIC TRUMP: Something. He ignores every big problem that we have as a country. This one, the one that we're talking about right now, the fact that we're about to go to 19 trillion dollars in debt, right? Nothing gets done about it, he doesn't even speak about it.



You have ISIS running all over the middle east totally unchecked, Obamacare is a total disaster, you've got so many problems around the world, our education and military systems are falling apart.



Conversation isn't even had about those problems. It does feel like something is going on with the guy?



Who knows. Does he care?



It just seems like he is so disconnected, like there is something wrong, when you have all these attacks, all these problems, and he can't even speak directly to them.
