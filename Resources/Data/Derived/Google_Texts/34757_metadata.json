Bundlers typically get credit or special access to a candidate if they cross a specific threshold of money raised.\n\nThe former Florida governor is among the first 2016 candidates to announce such intentions, taking on a voluntary task that his brother George W. Bush was known for starting during the 2000 presidential campaign. For her part, Hillary Clinton will announce her bundlers quarterly. She also revealed her bundlers when she ran for president in 2008, as did President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain during their White House bids.\n\n\"This display of transparency is consistent with the high level of disclosure he has practiced during his life in public office and, frankly, should be expected from public servants,\" said Allie Brandenburger, a spokesperson for Bush, in a statement.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush's team announced Wednesday that it plans to reveal a list of bundlers who help raise money for his White House bid in the first two quarters.", "pubdate": "2015-07-15T22:58:02Z", "author": "Ashley Killough, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Jeb Bush's team announced Wednesday that it plans to reveal a list of bundlers who help raise money for his White House bid in the first two quarters.", "pubdate": "2015-07-15T22:58:02Z", "title": "Jeb Bush to release list of campaign bundlers", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/15/politics/jeb-bush-bundlers/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150630172237-jeb-bush-june-29-2015-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150630172237-jeb-bush-june-29-2015-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/15/politics/jeb-bush-bundlers/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Jeb Bush to release list of campaign bundlers - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-07-15T23:38:23Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbef3\"", "article_summary": "She also revealed her bundlers when she ran for president in 2008, as did President Barack Obama and Sen.
