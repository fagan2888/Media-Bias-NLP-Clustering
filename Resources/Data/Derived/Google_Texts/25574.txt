A Durango man flying a Cessna 150 over the Animas Valley north of Durango Sunday reported an engine failure at an elevation of 10,000 feet, then made an an emergency landing on a country road near homes and survived.

The pilot, Baudy Barnes, was not injured, La Plata County Sheriffâ€™s Department spokesman Dan Bender said.

Deputies closed La Plata County Road 205 just north of Durango.

Road crews were waiting for an aircraft mechanic to help remove the wings from the damaged aircraft, Bender said, so it could be moved from the road and trucked away.

Barnes had taken off Sunday from the Animas Air Park south of Durango and was flying alone. It was unclear why the engine cut out, Bender said.

As Barnes spotted the two-lane, paved county road and descended, in a populated canyon within one mile of homes, the aircraft hit a power line. But he was able to guide it down safely, Bender said, and no injuries were reported.
