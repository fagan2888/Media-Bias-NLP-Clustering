Since 2010, 48 rural hospitals have closed, according to the National Rural Health Association.\n\n\u201cExperts and practitioners cite declining federal reimbursements for hospitals under the Affordable Care Act as the principal reasons for the recent closures,\u201d reported Gugliotta. \u201cBesides cutting back on Medicare, the law reduced payments to hospitals for the uninsured \u2026\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is causing all sorts of chaos, but don\u2019t expect the Obama administration to admit defeat anytime soon. While the evidence against the law is stunning and apparent, Democrats would rather see George W. Bush become president again than allow Obamacare to falter.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean, however, that someone\u2014or some group\u2014isn\u2019t going to be held responsible for the failures caused by the ACA. In Washington, DC, someone is always to blame, and in this case, doctors, not incompetent bureaucrats and greedy politicians, will be next on the blame-anybody-but-Democrats media tour.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to some since doctors spend their whole lives healing sick people, including many sick and poor people, but the reality is that doctors actually make easy political targets for the Democrat machine.\n\nFor starters, Doctors are wealthy, especially highly trained specialists. The average base pay for a family practitioner is $189,000 according to Merritt Hawkins & Associates\u2019 2012 Review of Physician Recruiting Incentives. But this figure seems paltry in comparison to the average salaries of cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and neurosurgeons, all of whom earn more than $500,000 per year on average.\n\nSpecialists\u2019 earnings put them securely within the \u201ctop 1 percent\u201d category in virtually all states, the very same group of people demonized by the Occupy Wall Street crowd and their DNC supporters.\n\nSecond, most doctors are not politically active and are poorly represented in government. In the current Congress, there are only 17 physicians out of the 535 available seats despite the fact that doctors are some of the most educated people in the nation.\n\nThird, many doctors have already started to turn away Medicare and Medicaid patients because the government\u2019s reimbursement rates are too low, making doctors as a group seem unsympathetic to the elderly and the impoverished.\n\nTheir wealth, lack of a big public microphone, and seemingly uncaring behavior with Medicaid and Medicare patients make doctors the obvious scapegoat for Obamacare\u2019s struggles. Rather than raising taxes or cutting benefits, both of which are politically difficult to accomplish, Democrats looking to defend the ACA will pin increasing costs and reduced benefits and coverage on greedy, rich, selfish doctors more interested in helping retain their status as members of the 1 percent than saving lives and serving the public.\n\nThe political hit pieces and election-season television commercials practically write themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s true that doctors earn a lot of money, but notice the key word there is \u201cearn.\u201d Doctors are required to attend four years of college, four years of medical school, and then as many as seven years of residency, where most doctors make roughly $40,000\u2013$50,000 per year. They spend thousands of dollars on required internships, residency interviews, applications, standardized test, and numerous other fees. Many doctors graduate medical school hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and all medical students are required to work for two years without any pay at all.\n\nMany doctors work 60 hours per week or more, and it\u2019s not uncommon for specialists to work as many as 80 hours per week. Doctors miss holidays, birthdays, and make numerous other personal sacrifices in order to help other people. If ever there was a group of people who deserve to make a lot of money, it\u2019s doctors.\n\nThis, however, won\u2019t matter in the coming years to politicians in the nation\u2019s capital looking to score cheap political points when the ACA\u2019s flaws become even more apparent than they are today.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on March 9 projecting Obamacare premium prices to outpace both private insurance premiums and government spending between 2016 and 2018.", "title": "Obamacare Failing, Doctors Will Take Future Blame | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015_03_23_173752_2015-03-05T011923Z_3_LYNXMPEB230U7_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/03/23/obamacare-failing-doctors-will-take-future-blame/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on March 9 projecting Obamacare premium prices to outpace both private insurance premiums and government spending between 2016 and 2018.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015_03_23_173752_2015-03-05T011923Z_3_LYNXMPEB230U7_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on March 9 projecting Obamacare premium prices to outpace both private insurance premiums and government spending between 2016 and 2018."}}, "article_summary": "Since 2010, 48 rural hospitals have closed, according to the National Rural Health Association.\nMany doctors work 60 hours per week or more, and it\u2019s not uncommon for specialists to work as many as 80 hours per week.\nIf ever there was a group of people who deserve to make a lot of money, it\u2019s doctors.\nIn Washington, DC, someone is always to blame, and in this case, doctors, not incompetent bureaucrats and greedy politicians, will be next on the blame-anybody-but-Democrats media tour.\nMany doctors graduate medical school hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and all medical students are required to work for two years without any pay at all."}
