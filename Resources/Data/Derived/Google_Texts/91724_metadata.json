There is a gradual loss in nutrient content in any fresh fruit or vegetable from the moment it is picked. But unless you are growing your own kale or buying it at the farmers\u2019 market, it has most likely spent days in transit and on display. The additional day in your crisper will make virtually no difference.\n\nAnd kale is quite hardy. While we tend to treat it as a salad green, it is a cruciferous vegetable like brussels sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli. So you may notice it can be stored far longer than lettuce or spinach.\n\nWhether the leftover kale is raw or cooked, it is important to keep it refrigerated. One study found that after six days of refrigeration, leafy vegetables lost only 10 percent of their vitamin C content, compared with 20 percent in just two days at room temperature.\n\n\u201cI definitely would hope that doesn\u2019t deter someone from eating the kale salad,\u201d said Jackie Armstrong, a nutritionist at Stanford University. \u201cIt\u2019s still packed with nutrition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/hfnutricolbx05.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Q: Does day-old, leftover kale salad have less nutritional value than fresher kale?\n\u201cI definitely would hope that doesn\u2019t deter someone from eating the kale salad,\u201d said Jackie Armstrong, a nutritionist at Stanford University.\nWhether the leftover kale is raw or cooked, it is important to keep it refrigerated.\nThere is a gradual loss in nutrient content in any fresh fruit or vegetable from the moment it is picked.\nBut unless you are growing your own kale or buying it at the farmers\u2019 market, it has most likely spent days in transit and on display."}
