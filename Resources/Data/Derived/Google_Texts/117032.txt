Greg Chatham, owner of Greg's Fireworks, has his shelves stocked, ready to take on the last minute shoppers in need of fireworks. This year, the fourth of July falls on a Saturday, and he says that could boosts sales.

"Sometimes that helps because people don't have time to go out of town," Chatham explains. "People usually wait til the last minute anyway to get fireworks. The little children, if they buy them, they're going to want to shoot them."

He says sales have been picking up. Vanessa Williams is one of Greg's customers. She says her family is picking up a combination of fireworks to get ready for the holiday tomorrow.

"Really, we do it every year," Williams says. "This year, my husband happens to be home, so we're getting a little more than we normally get because we have him here to help us."

Chatham says shoppers are generally looking for a larger number of smaller fireworks in the summer, so they can stay out and enjoy the temperatures. But whatever your taste, there are plenty of options.

"We have something for everyone," Chatham says.
