CarePlus is a new benefit plan offered by MassHealth that is designed to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion and the unique needs of the state health care market. The NHP MassHealth CarePlus plan will be available starting January 1, 2014 to qualified adults ages 21-64 with incomes at or under 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to offer the new MassHealth CarePlus plan to ensure access to high-quality and coordinated health care for individuals in the Commonwealth,\u201d said Deborah C.
