Not Mike Alvarado; his story has been splattered on these pages for years \u2014 a local boy makes good, and Saturday night he will fight for millions in Inglewood, Calif.\n\nBut for every \u201cMile High Mike,\u201d there\u2019s an anonymous gritty face with gritted teeth, punching a dusty bag, over and over and over, but for what?\n\nFor this boxer, the fight isn\u2019t inside the ropes \u2014 the fight is to get inside the ropes in the first place. This boxer is winless, yet she\u2019s a winner. You probably know \u201cMile High Mike.\u201d Now, meet \u201cThe Warrior Princess.\u201d\n\nCecelia Martinez was heading into another freshman year. She was involved with drugs. Teachers had seen this before, a lost girl, failing and flailing and falling behind. Life was lapping her.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u2019 \u201d she recalled Friday. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in the same spot, always a freshman. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nSports save. For all of the stories about sports propelling people, taking the good and making them great, sports also are saviors for folks on the fringe. Sports give chances, and darn it if Cece didn\u2019t take a chance.\n\n\u201cI got to box!\u201d she recalls telling her dad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for girls,\u201d he told her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not for girls,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to make it for girls.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of her teen years, Martinez discovered the Grudge Training Center in Arvada. It would become her second home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Cece and her family since they came in, back when she was still in her trouble with school, trying to find her way,\u201d said Leann Perez, who\u2019s involved with Grudge in numerous capacities. \u201cBut a lot of the credit is to Trevor (Wittman), telling her she can\u2019t train until you get your grades up. We want to see progress reports, report cards. And eventually, Cece is such a lovable girl, she worked with everybody in the gym, and really won over all of our hearts.\u201d\n\nThis is what is so heartwarming about these stories \u2014 that inside so many trodden bodies are beautiful souls. It\u2019s also what is heart-wrenching about these stories \u2014 for every Martinez, there\u2019s someone else, forever a freshman.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve seen me at my lowest, when I was ready to give up,\u201d Martinez said of her family and her family at the gym, \u201cand then they saw I was able to build up my own self- esteem.\n\n\u201cThey tell me I can\u2019t win a fight if I don\u2019t try, it\u2019s not just going to come to me. They made me realize that nothing will land in my lap. I have to fight for everything I want.\u201d\n\nShe goes to the gym every day but Sunday, sparring and sprinting on the treadmill, working on footwork and combinations and, well, you know, as long as she\u2019s doing something, anything in that gym, it\u2019s better than the alternative.\n\nShe has blossomed there. She\u2019s fought four times, never winning. Who cares? She won just by showing up. Most important, she\u2019s graduating from Hidden Lake High School on Wednesday. She can\u2019t believe it. Cece. A graduate. It\u2019s happening. She\u2019s going to Front Range Community College \u201cto get a lot of my core classes done,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be off to bigger or better things.\u201d\n\nShe wants to work in medicine, hopefully with young babies.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s enriching her life by doing everything that\u2019s positive,\u201d Perez said. \u201cEveryone in the gym is super-excited for her to give her graduation gifts and see her become this better person. It\u2019s been an honor to see her grow, it really has.\n\n\u201cYou see it all the time, young boys coming into the gym, fighting too much on the street, and they want something to look forward to. Boxing is a really good outlet for kids to come in and better their lives \u2014 I\u2019ve seen my own husband do it. And it\u2019s such a sad thing to hear boxing is a dying sport, because of what it can do to kids all over the place.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Boxing turns Cecelia Martinez into a winner", "title": "Hochman: Boxing turns Cecelia Martinez into a winner", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/16/hochman-boxing-turns-cecelia-martinez-into-a-winner/", "image": {"width": 588, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__Cecelia-martinez-1p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__Cecelia-martinez-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T21:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:56:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She\u2019s going to Front Range Community College \u201cto get a lot of my core classes done,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make it for girls.\u201dIn the middle of her teen years, Martinez discovered the Grudge Training Center in Arvada.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be in the same spot, always a freshman.\nBoxing is a really good outlet for kids to come in and better their lives \u2014 I\u2019ve seen my own husband do it.\nYou probably know \u201cMile High Mike.\u201d Now, meet \u201cThe Warrior Princess.\u201dCecelia Martinez was heading into another freshman year."}
