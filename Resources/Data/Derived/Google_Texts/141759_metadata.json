They are a means by which individuals learn lessons about politics, identity, family and community. Holidays are also a type of habit. They\u2019re part of a cultural routine, one that is usually followed without much reflection, contemplation or introspection.\n\nThanksgiving is a holiday ritual that celebrates family and community. In recounting one of the country\u2019s founding legends\u2014in which Europeans fled religious persecution, escaped to the \u201cNew World,\u201d and then were helped by friendly \u201cIndians\u201d\u2014the American people are supposed to reflect upon their blessings, fortunes and good luck.\n\nLike most national holidays, Thanksgiving is a myth. It does the powerful political work of encouraging American Exceptionalism: a belief that the United States was preordained by \u201cGod\u201d for a special place among all others; and that it is a \u201cshining city on the hill.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the arrival of the Mayflower (and other European explorers and colonists in the \u201cNew World\u201d) would help to set into motion two of the greatest crimes in human history: the genocide of First Nations peoples and the enslavement and mass murder of black Americans. Stolen land and stolen labor are the twin bedrocks of American empire. Their influence was (and remains) so profoundly deep that it would take a civil war (what was really a second American Revolution) and then 100 years of additional struggle to strike down white supremacy as the formal public policy of the United States.\n\nFirst Nations peoples can never be made whole for the land (and lives) that was stolen from them. Black Americans will never receive their reparations, be it 40 acres and a mule, or redistributive justice because of the material harm done to them by white supremacy from Jim and Jane Crow and in the present. These inequalities are now fixtures in American social and political life. There is no holiday that can repair those harms.\n\n(One should not overlook how Thanksgiving was a source of political controversy during the American slaveocracy. The South refused to celebrate Thanksgiving because it was viewed as a way for \u201cAbolitionists\u201d and \u201cYankees\u201d to undermine the institution of white on black chattel slavery. Thanksgiving would be fully embraced as an \u201cAmerican\u201d holiday after the end of the Civil War when apartheid was reinstated across the South after the fall of Reconstruction. White America could celebrate Thanksgiving as one nation only when black American citizens were denied their equal rights.)\n\nIn many ways, Thanksgiving is a celebration of gluttony, sports, nationalism, militarism and waste. While some of the poor and homeless may be fed for a day, the institutions and structures that create income inequality and joblessness remain untouched. The day after Thanksgiving is called \u201cBlack Friday.\u201d It is a festival of consumerist excess and greed. It is one of many moments throughout their lives when the American people are told the lie that \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201ccapitalism\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d are interchangeable. In reality, the gangster and casino capitalism of late 20th and early 20th century America is incompatible with a true \u201cWe the People\u201d democracy.\n\n* * *\n\nThis year\u2019s Thanksgiving comes during the midst of a national debate about America\u2019s national character.\n\nYoung people and others are protesting for progressive social change at America\u2019s colleges and universities, participating in Black Lives Matter, and standing up against police thuggery and violence in cities like Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland. The Confederate Flag, what is more accurately described as the American swastika, has been removed from some government buildings in the old Confederate South. Buildings, streets and roads that bear the names of white supremacists are being renamed.\n\nConservatives and other reactionaries have resisted. History and social change work is a story of \u201cpush and pull\u201d factors, thesis and antithesis. Right-wingers in Texas and across the country are rewriting school textbooks with the goal of quite literally \u201cwhitewashing\u201d American history, where any facts that undermine their lies about American Exceptionalism, and the many distortions needed to maintain the illusion, are removed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A holiday bound in myths, and based on America's founding sins, arrives in the middle of a fraught conversation", "title": "Our #blacklivesmatter Thanksgiving: Race, terror, Trump and political correctness collide at Thanksgiving", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A holiday bound in myths, and based on America's founding sins, arrives in the middle of a fraught conversation", "title": "Our #blacklivesmatter Thanksgiving: Race, terror, Trump and political correctness collide at Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/26/our_blacklivesmatter_thanksgiving_race_terror_trump_and_political_correctness_collide_at_thanksgiving/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/donald_trump_turkey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A holiday bound in myths, and based on America's founding sins, arrives in the middle of a fraught conversation", "title": "Our #blacklivesmatter Thanksgiving: Race, terror, Trump and political correctness collide at Thanksgiving", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/donald_trump_turkey.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chauncey DeVega", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #blacklivesmatter, political correctness, Race, Thanksgiving", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: #blacklivesmatter, political correctness, Race, Thanksgiving, NewsPublic holidays are a type of ritual.\nWhite America could celebrate Thanksgiving as one nation only when black American citizens were denied their equal rights.)\nThese inequalities are now fixtures in American social and political life.\n(One should not overlook how Thanksgiving was a source of political controversy during the American slaveocracy.\nThe day after Thanksgiving is called \u201cBlack Friday.\u201d It is a festival of consumerist excess and greed."}
