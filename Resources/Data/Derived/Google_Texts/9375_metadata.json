His research has been supported by organizations that include Google, IBM, Microsoft and Yahoo.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nA variety of Internet-enabled platforms for peer-to-peer commerce seem to be under regulatory siege. If settlement talks fail, Airbnb is heading to court to challenge a wide-ranging subpoena for New York City host information issued by the New York State attorney general. The urban transportation platforms Uber Lyft and Sidecar have battled regulators in numerous cities \u2013 for instance, Sidecar left New York last spring after a sting by agents of the Taxi and Limousine Commission during a pilot program in Brooklyn led to the impounding of a driver\u2019s car . A consortium of cabbies and drivers recently sued the city of Chicago with a claim that the city has allowed \u201cunlawful taxi caste system\u201d to emerge. RelayRides , a peer-to-peer car rental marketplace, suspended operations in New York a few months ago after being told that a regulator \u201cbelieves there is noncompliance with certain unique aspects\u201d of New York insurance law.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because the emerging peer-to-peer, collaborative \u201csharing economy\u201d will be a significant segment of the country\u2019s future economic activity, stimulating new consumption, raising productivity and catalyzing individual innovation and entrepreneurship. There\u2019s a real danger that today\u2019s misalignment between newer peer-to-peer business models and older regulations will impede economic growth. The solution is to delegate more regulatory responsibility to the marketplaces and platforms while preserving some government oversight, by creating new self-regulatory organizations like those that have succeeded in other markets and industries.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if today\u2019s city and state regulations are fundamentally flawed. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s simply that this wave of digital disruption is altering how we experience familiar services \u2014 short-term accommodation, point-to-point urban transportation, car rental. The economic engine at work here is an array of new peer-to-peer marketplaces that unlock dormant physical capital (real estate, vehicles, household assets) and put it to productive use, creating, in the process, a wide variety of new consumption experiences (contrast the modest range of hotel rooms with the diversity of Airbnbs), and catalyzing innovation by micro-entrepreneurs who can dip their toes into the world of small business unimpeded by the risks of an all-or-nothing start-up.\n\nNot surprisingly, there\u2019s a misalignment between the rules developed for the older, industrial-age, \u201canalog\u201d ways of shared consumption, like staying in hotels or hailing taxis, and the peer-to-peer business models enabled by the new digital platforms. If this gap \u2013 between the old regulations and the new models \u2013 isn\u2019t closed soon, there is a real risk that the impending economic growth could be stifled. Moreover, a lack of genuine regulatory oversight and guidance where actually necessary can lead to backlash that might damage both the platforms and their millions of suppliers.\n\nThere is a solution to this regulatory conundrum. First, the government should recognize that the new peer-to-peer marketplaces have sophisticated controls naturally built in. For example, Airbnb offers its traders a robust digital reputation system based on detailed post-transaction ratings, as well as identity verification systems that combine the digitized social capital of Facebook or LinkedIn with the existing government ID infrastructure. Verifying identity lowers the risks of market failure by making users (both renters and suppliers) feel safer; instant and transparent user feedback makes government oversight \u2014 about, say, space cleanliness \u2014 less essential. Likewise, government-mandated taxi fares and meters seem unnecessary when Uber, Lyft and Sidecar set uniform rates and track routes exactly using navigation technology.\n\nThe platforms have voluntarily adopted additional nondigital safeguards. Ahead of any regulatory requirement, Lyft and Sidecar had put in place a fairly elaborate supplier-screening protocol, one that was perhaps a template for California\u2019s recently introduced regulatory framework for ride sharing. Airbnb has more than 50 investigative agents, headed by a former army intelligence officer, on its trust and safety team. This isn\u2019t surprising. The profit-seeking interests of these private marketplaces aren\u2019t that different from those of a textbook regulator: encouraging productive trade, keeping market participants safe and preventing \u201cmarket failure.\u201d\n\nSelf-policing isn\u2019t a universal panacea. We\u2019ll still need government mandates to prevent effects like congestion, or for, say, providing accessible vehicles and ensuring disaster preparedness \u2014 things that markets don\u2019t easily self-provide. As we better understand the scope and sustainability of effective self-policing, and what new forms of oversight are needed, we should encourage the creation of a new class of self-regulatory organizations that set and enforce regulations for peer-to-peer sharing marketplaces, perhaps initially with some federal or state oversight.\n\nAs hundreds of new peer-to-peer marketplaces emerge over the coming years, such organizations would ease what would otherwise be a tremendous strain on the government\u2019s resources: having to constantly monitor and correct regulatory misalignment across an evolving set of industries. They could also inform the new oversight questions that emerge as these platforms reach mass-market scale, like the liability of ride-sharing platforms for accidents involving drivers between fare-paying rides, and whether residential zoning and noise laws should change when individual apartments become mixed-use real estate.\n\nFollowing the Securities and Exchanges Act of 1934, a variety of securities markets have self-regulatory organizations like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra (and the predecessor regulatory arms of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq), all under the watchful governmental eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Granted, peer-to-peer markets for goods and services have different complexities than markets for financial securities. But industry-created organizations have led to effective self-regulation in other (nondigital) peer-to-peer businesses as well. The National Association of Realtors and the American Medical Association, which emerged organically from a need to self-regulate, are perhaps the best examples. Bar associations guide the behaviors of lawyers in each state. The historical roots of industry consortiums for self-policing go much further back, perhaps to the merchant guilds of medieval times. The idea has been around and worked for centuries.\n\nThis digital transformation that is creating today\u2019s \u201ccollaborative economy\u201d is quite different from the ones that preceded it. It affects everyday asset-intensive services. Today\u2019s regulatory misalignment is slowing the immense innovation and economic growth it will generate. It\u2019s time to place more trust in the digital trust infrastructure, and give the \u201csharing economy\u201d platforms their fair share of the regulatory responsibility.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140303000121, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 3, 2014", "org": "Airbnb;Lyft Inc;RelayRides;Uber Technologies Inc", "keywords": "Automobile Renting and Leasing,Bed-and-Breakfast Lodgings,Economics (Theory and Philosophy),Regulation and Deregulation of Industry,Taxicabs and Taxicab Drivers,Airbnb,Lyft Inc,RelayRides,Uber Technologies Inc,Today's Economist", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Trusting the 'Sharing Economy' to Regulate Itself ( 20140303 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Arun Sundararajan", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Arun Sundararajan", "byl": "Arun Sundararajan", "twitter": {"description": "Rather than challenging new forms of peer-to-peer commerce, like Airbnb or Uber, government should foster the kind of self-regulation that prevails in many established industries and professions, an economist writes.", "title": "Trusting the 'Sharing Economy' to Regulate Itself", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/trusting-the-sharing-economy-to-regulate-itself/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "description": "Rather than challenging new forms of peer-to-peer commerce, like Airbnb or Uber, government should foster the kind of self-regulation that prevails in many established industries and professions, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 3, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Today's Economist", "published_time": 1393822881, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-03-03T05:01:21-05:00"}, "utime": 20140303050121, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140303, "pdate": 20140303, "des": "Automobile Renting and Leasing;Bed-and-Breakfast Lodgings;Economics (Theory and Philosophy);Regulation and Deregulation of Industry;Taxicabs and Taxicab Drivers", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Rather than challenging new forms of peer-to-peer commerce, like Airbnb or Uber, government should foster the kind of self-regulation that prevails in many established industries and professions, an economist writes.", "title": "Trusting the 'Sharing Economy' to Regulate Itself", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/trusting-the-sharing-economy-to-regulate-itself/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/trusting-the-sharing-economy-to-regulate-itself/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Trusting the 'Sharing Economy' to Regulate Itself", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83ad\"", "article_summary": "Granted, peer-to-peer markets for goods and services have different complexities than markets for financial securities.\nIt\u2019s time to place more trust in the digital trust infrastructure, and give the \u201csharing economy\u201d platforms their fair share of the regulatory responsibility.\nFirst, the government should recognize that the new peer-to-peer marketplaces have sophisticated controls naturally built in.\nThis digital transformation that is creating today\u2019s \u201ccollaborative economy\u201d is quite different from the ones that preceded it.\nThis is unfortunate, because the emerging peer-to-peer, collaborative \u201csharing economy\u201d will be a significant segment of the country\u2019s future economic activity, stimulating new consumption, raising productivity and catalyzing individual innovation and entrepreneurship."}
