This was one of 9 cosmetic procedures she had undertaken in the past 5 years \u2014 including a nose job, a bioplasty facial correction, a jaw reduction, boob job, liposuction and vaginal lip reduction. Shortly after her recent injection, however, she developed an infection and was sent to Conception Hospital in Porto Alegre, where doctors drained her thigh. Currently, Urach requires a breathing apparatus and is heavily sedated but seems to be doing well.\n\nDuring an interview with Brazil\u2019s R7 website, Urach noted that \u201cthe hydrogel was no absorbed by my body and started to harm me. Now I\u2019ve discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. That\u2019s why I am feeling such strong pains. I\u2019m taking morphine every four hours and antibiotics to alleviate the suffering.\u201d\n\nMiss BumBum is an annual competition in Brazil that aims to find the woman with the \u201cbest butt.\u201d There are currently 27 contestants for Miss BumBum 2014; Urach won second place in the competition in 2012. She had previously made a media splash after claiming she had had an affair with Cristiano Ronaldo, a famous Portuguese soccer player, though he had vehemently denied her claims and said they were \u201cpure fiction and forgery\u201d to seek \u201cthe limelight on my account.\u201d\n\nUrach had undergone 9 different plastic surgery operations in the past 5 years. Facebook\n\nMeanwhile, Urach\u2019s friends and family are hoping she will recover from her plastic surgery-induced illness: \u201cI ask everyone to pray a lot, because I\u2019m sure that my dear Jesus is wonderful and will cure it,\u201d Marisete de Favari, Urach\u2019s mother, said in a statement, according to Brazilian news agency Globo.com.\n\nJessica Lopes, another Miss BumBum contestant and one of Urach\u2019s friends, told The Daily Mail that \u201ceveryone is in a state of shock. Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. We were slaves to beauty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "miss bumbum, andressa urach, botched plastic surgery, big butts", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After a botched plastic surgery operation to enhance the shape of her thighs, Brazilian model and Miss BumBum contestant was hospitalized with an infection.", "title": "Brazil's Miss BumBum Hospitalized After Botched Plastic Surgery To Enlarge Thighs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miss-bumbum-brazilian-model-hospitalized-after-botched-plastic-surgery-enlarge-thighs-313246", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/andressa-urach.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a botched plastic surgery operation to enhance the shape of her thighs, Brazilian model and Miss BumBum contestant was hospitalized with an infection.", "title": "Brazil's Miss BumBum Hospitalized After Botched Plastic Surgery To Enlarge Thighs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miss-bumbum-brazilian-model-hospitalized-after-botched-plastic-surgery-enlarge-thighs-313246", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/andressa-urach.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/andressa-urach.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-05T13:32:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-05T13:32:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After a botched plastic surgery operation to enhance the shape of her thighs, Brazilian model and Miss BumBum contestant was hospitalized with an infection."}, "article_summary": "27-year-old Andressa Urach, a Brazilian model competing to be Miss BumBum, was hospitalized after a botched plastic surgery procedure left her with an infection.\nJessica Lopes, another Miss BumBum contestant and one of Urach\u2019s friends, told The Daily Mail that \u201ceveryone is in a state of shock.\nOn November 21, Urach underwent a procedure during which doctors implanted hydrogel and PMMA into her thighs and butt in order to enhance their shape.\nAndressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping.\nDuring an interview with Brazil\u2019s R7 website, Urach noted that \u201cthe hydrogel was no absorbed by my body and started to harm me."}
