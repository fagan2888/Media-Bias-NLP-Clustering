President Obama welcomed newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House today, celebrating the fact that the United States had joined Canada with a government program for health care.

“I’m proud to be the first American President to stand with a Canadian Prime Minister and be able to say that — in both our nations — health care is not a privilege for a few but is now a right for all,” Obama said, referring to his signature issue of forcing Obamacare on all Americans.

Trudeau, often referred to as the Canadian Obama, was welcomed with all the pomp and circumstance of an official state visit, the first time in 20 years for a Canadian Prime Minister.

Obama also highlighted the two nations for their views on Syrian refugees and the right to gay marriage.

“As two vast and vibrant societies, we reaffirm that our diversity is our strength — whether your family was among the first native peoples to live on these lands or refugees we welcomed just yesterday,” he said. “Whether you pray in a church or a synagogue, or a temple, or a mosque. Where, no matter what province or state you live in, you have the freedom to marry the person that you love.”
