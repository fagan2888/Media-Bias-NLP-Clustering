Chief justice at the Vatican Cardinal Raymond Burke called president Obama’s policies “anti-life” and “anti-family” in an interview with Polonia Christiana magazine, transcribed by Life Site News.

“It is true that the policies of the president of the United States have become progressively more hostile toward Christian civilization. He appears to be a totally secularized man who aggressively promotes anti-life and anti-family policies,” said Cardinal Burke.

Cardinal Burke said of the Affordable Care Act’s birth-control mandate, “such policies would have been unimaginable in the United States even 40 years ago.” The cardinal called policies like president Obama’s ”deadly” and said they lead to the “loss of freedom” that democratic institutions exist to protect.​

He explained that the president believes one is free to act according to his conscience within his place of worship, but once he leaves, the government can constrain him to act against his “rightly formed conscience.”

The former archbishop of St. Louis wants his fellow citizens to elect leaders who respect the truth of moral law “as it is respected in the founding principles of our nation.”
