All this week, I was hitting good shots.\u201d\n\nIsner fired 18 aces in Sunday\u2019s final, but Nishikori made the most of his service games as well. The world No. 5 won 91 percent of his first-serve points and faced just two break points against, with none in the final two sets. He committed just 13 unforced errors, compared to 28 by Isner, and fired 11 of his 18 winners from his backhand.\n\n\u201cHe put a decent amount of first serves in the court,\u201d Isner said, \u201cand from there, he\u2019s arguably the best in the world from the baseline, so it\u2019s tough. \u2026 His backhand is world class, his backhand crosscourt is incredible, he dictates play very well and he\u2019s quick.\u201d\n\nIsner, seeded eighth, took the opening set in 36 minutes, earning the only break of the set in the tenth and final game.\n\nNishikori broke back, though, in the first game of the second set, winning a challenge on an apparent Isner ace. Nishikori then won the ensuing point off Isner\u2019s second serve for his first break of the match and a 1-0 lead in the second set.\n\n\u201cI had so much momentum after playing a great game at 5-4 in the first [set],\u201d Isner said, \u201cso if I hold that first game [in the second set] the pressure is still on him and I\u2019m sort of free rolling out there. But he got up a break, it gave him some momentum and it gave him more confidence \u2026 so I think that was a pretty big turning point.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Nishikori held serve the rest of the match, earning his 10th career ATP title and his third of 2015. The 2014 U.S. Open finalist also improved to 43-9 on the year and now trails only Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray for most ATP match wins in 2015 with 48.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that this match will help a lot,\u201d said Nishikori, who will now compete in Masters-1000 tournaments in Montreal and Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to play good tennis this summer after not playing the two Masters series events last year [while injured]. I did great last year at the U.S. Open so I\u2019ll try to do well at these two Masters too. I can\u2019t wait to go to the U.S. Open. I\u2019m excited to play again on the big stage.\u201d\n\nNishikori will rise to No. 4 in the world when the latest ATP rankings are released on Monday, matching his career high. It is also the highest ranking ever achieved by a Japanese player.\n\nLike Nishikori, Isner will also move up in rankings, jumping from No. 18 to No. 12.\n\nIsner, 30, has won more matches at the Citi Open than at any other tournament in his career, but the top-ranked American dropped to 23-8 lifetime in Washington \u2014 including 0-3 in finals.\n\n\u201cGetting to the finals of an event like this is something to be proud of,\u201d said Isner, who won his third consecutive BB&T Open in Atlanta last week and was playing his ninth match in 11 days.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s disappointing to have not broken through once [in Washington] \u2026 Getting to the finals is a good achievement, but losing stinks. But I\u2019ve had a very good two weeks and now I can\u2019t get complacent.\u201d\n\nThere has not been an American singles champion in Washington since Andy Roddick beat Isner in 2007, marking the longest drought in the tournament\u2019s 47-year history.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s men\u2019s doubles final, Bob and Mike Bryan beat Ivan Dodig and Mercelo Melo, 6-4, 6-2. It was the Bryan brothers\u2019 108th career doubles title and their fourth championship in Washington.\n\nThe WTA singles final saw Sloane Stephens beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia, 6-1, 6-2. Stephens, 22, was competing in her first career WTA final.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A year after leaving Washington with a toe injury that would sideline him for the next three weeks, a healthy Nishikori returned to the Citi Open last week eyeing a strong start to the hard-court season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A year after leaving Washington with a toe injury that would sideline him for the next three weeks, a healthy Nishikori returned to the Citi Open last week eyeing a strong start to the hard-court season.", "title": "Kei Nishikori makes most of service games to beat John Isner, win Citi Open", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/9/kei-nishikori-makes-most-of-service-games-to-beat-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/8_9_2015_washington-tennis-2-68201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/8_9_2015_washington-tennis-2-68201.jpg", "description": "A year after leaving Washington with a toe injury that would sideline him for the next three weeks, a healthy Nishikori returned to the Citi Open last week eyeing a strong start to the hard-court seas", "card": "summary", "title": "Kei Nishikori makes most of service games to beat John Isner, win Citi"}, "Author": "Ben Raby", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, John Isner, Kei Nishikori, Washington"}, "article_summary": "Like Nishikori, Isner will also move up in rankings, jumping from No.\nAll this week, I was hitting good shots.\u201dIsner fired 18 aces in Sunday\u2019s final, but Nishikori made the most of his service games as well.\nOn Sunday, Nishikori delivered, rallying to beat hard-serving John Isner, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, in the final of the Citi Open before a capacity crowd at the Rock Creek Park Tennis Center.\nNishikori broke back, though, in the first game of the second set, winning a challenge on an apparent Isner ace.\n2 seed, who fell in straight sets to Isner in Miami in April in their only prior meeting."}
