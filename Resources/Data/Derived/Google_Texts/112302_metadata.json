Sweating in a 100-degree room, Thompson would stand on one foot, lean forward with his chest and raise his opposite foot behind him in line with his flattened back. After clasping his hands behind his back, Thompson would swing them out to the Superman position, as if they were wings, before extending his arms in front like a diver.\n\nThe hot yoga classes Thompson took after the Washington Redskins\u2018 minicamp in June were meant to let the rigidity seep out of his body. Back in Tallahassee, Florida \u2014 Thompson went to Florida State \u2014 he hesitatingly joined hot yoga classes in search of flexibility. He developed a love-hate relationship with Warrior III, Warrior II and hot yoga, for that matter.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of days I wanted to walk out,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe were in there about an hour and a half, depending on which type of sessions we were in.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-8, 193-pound Thompson is small by NFL standards. He is also pinball quick and can catch passes out of the backfield, which is why he is still grappling for a roster spot in Washington and under consideration to be the team\u2019s third-down back. Thompson was drafted in the fifth round in 2013. He was tried as a kickoff returner that season. It did not work. That November, his season ended after he tore the labrum in his left shoulder.\n\nInjuries again slowed Thompson in the preseason last year. The irritation of Redskins coach Jay Gruden was clear when asked then about Thompson. Gruden explained that Thompson\u2019s value to the team was in line with his ability to stay on the field. He couldn\u2019t, at least not consistently, so he was cut at the end of camp before clearing waivers and joining the practice squad. Thompson played in just two games last season, both in December. He ran three times and caught six passes.\n\nIn the heat of training camp, which the 24-year-old said doesn\u2019t bother him thanks to the sweltering yoga classes, the battle is similar to that of last season. Alfred Morris remains established as the lead back. Rookie third-round pick Matt Jones is expected to be Morris\u2019 bruising alter ego. Veteran Darrel Young remains the starter at fullback. Last season, the Redskins carried four running backs. Roy Helu filled the role of third-down back. That spot is open for Jones, Thompson, Silas Redd or undrafted rookie Trey Williams.\n\nThough the tussle for the single running back spot is akin to last year\u2019s situation, Thompson\u2019s level of worry about it is not.\n\n\u201cI learned this year not to think and worry about it too much.\u201d Thompson said. \u201cLast year, I was always worried every single day about, you know, the competition. If I missed practice today, then that\u2019s going to set me back. Just things like that. I don\u2019t worry about that stuff no more.\n\n\u201cI love all the running backs that\u2019s in there. We all love each other. We know at the end of the day, it\u2019s all competition, but we treat each other like brothers. If one makes a play, we\u2019re all congratulating him. You know, the young guys, we got Trey Williams, [undrafted rookie] Mack Brown in here, Matt Jones. We\u2019re just helping those guys come along, man. It\u2019s no selfishness with us.\u201d\n\nThompson received several carries during the fight-free portions of drills with the Houston Texans on Saturday. Last Thursday and Friday, he was the first back to have the ball stuck in his arms. Through the first weeks of camp, he has been free of injury. Perhaps it\u2019s the yoga; he\u2019s not sure.\n\nSince his main value is expected to be as a receiver, Thompson studies tight end Jordan Reed. He\u2019s paying attention to how Reed sets up a defender with body language or footwork. Thompson also watches what Reed decides when he has a choice route and can pivot depending on what he sees from the defense.\n\n\u201cHe gets the backers and DBs on their heels,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd a lot of times, it\u2019s difficult for them to recover like that. Where he\u2019s crossing the guy\u2019s face, just watching how he sets it up and everything and learn from that.\u201d\n\nHe laughed when asked if he could also borrow a few inches of height from Reed.\n\n\u201cI wish,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHey, man, if I was six feet tall \u2026 it would be some fun days out here.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s comfort in his second season in Gruden\u2019s system caused an error early in camp. He expected the middle linebacker to be called out by the quarterback, which changes blocking assignments. He wasn\u2019t, and Thompson missed his block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just little things like that,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI have to continue to stay focused although I am a lot more comfortable.\u201d\n\nGruden has noticed the comfort, the running and the blocking.\n\n\u201cI think Chris Thompson is really starting to emerge as a third-down back, if we can obviously keep him healthy,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s done an excellent both in the running game and the passing game, and he\u2019s done an excellent job in protection so far. Competition for that spot is ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe chance is what Thompson is looking for. He\u2019s more limber. His opportunity has expanded. The coach likes what he can do.
