Vance McAllister's (R-La.) Republican challengers.\n\nThe group announced its endorsement of Dasher while referencing the scandal over video of a kiss between McAllister, who is married, and a member of his staff.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Louisiana knows about Vance McAllister\u2019s personal problems, but far less is known about his extremely liberal record,\u201d Club for Growth President Chris Chocola said in a statement. \u201cWhen he ran for Congress last year, Vance McAllister pushed for expanding Obamacare in Louisiana and told voters \u2018we\u2019re past the point of repealing\u2019 it. In Congress, Vance McAllister has voted against numerous efforts to cut federal spending and he voted for a budget that contained billions in taxes. Vance McAllister\u2019s love of big-government policies is yet another reason to replace him with fiscal conservative Zach Dasher this November.\u201d\n\nDasher is the nephew of \"Duck Dynasty\" star Phil Robertson. McAllister has his own ties to the family: Robertson's son Willie starred in an ad for McAllister last year, and was the representative's guest at President Barack Obama's State of the Union address.\n\nThough McAllister initially said he would not run for re-election after video of him kissing the staffer emerged in April, he changed his mind in June and announced that he would seek to defend his seat.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) has called McAllister an \"embarrassment.\" The Club for Growth's decision to back his challenger only furthers his alienation within the Republican Party.\n\nDasher and McAllister will face off in Louisiana's nonpartisan primary Nov. 4. If no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote, the race to represent the district will proceed to a December runoff.\n\nThe McAllister campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: New House Members Of The 113th Congress New House Members Of The 113th Congress\n\n1 of 84 Rep.
