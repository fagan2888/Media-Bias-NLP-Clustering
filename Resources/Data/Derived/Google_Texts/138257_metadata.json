Obama will be campaigning in the Centennial State \u2013 one of the key battlegrounds in his bid to hold the Senate for his party \u2013 but neither the incumbent senator he is trying to save nor other top-tier Democratic candidates will appear in public with the president. Adding insult to injury, embattled incumbent Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., will appear in private with Obama tomorrow for the president to tap his extensive donor network in the state. Udall\u2019s team cited scheduling problems that would keep the senator, locked in a toss-up race with challenger Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., from appearing at a daytime campaign event where there will be reporters present. But Udall\u2019s schedule will clear up just in time for the senator to arrive at a closed-door donor event in Denver. Even more galling: Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, facing a tough re-election test, and Andrew Romanoff, the former state House speaker now running for a seat in Congress, will both be no shows for Obama. Candidates ditching unpopular incumbents in public is nothing new, but the Colorado case is telling for Obama and his party this cycle.\n\n\n\n[The Denver Post reports today that the drop-out rate for the state\u2019s ObamaCare program is now forecast to be twice as bad as first projected.]\n\n\n\nPeaks and valleys - Obama\u2019s jaw-dropping 2008 convention, complete with Greek pillars, was held in Denver and Hickenlooper, then mayor, was the host. Obama went on to roll through the previously reddish state by a stout 9-point margin. Democrats cruised in Colorado in 2010 and the president didn\u2019t have to break a sweat to win the state again in 2012, though his margin shrank to 5 points. Obama championed Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet\u2019s rise in the party, choosing him in a contentious 2010 primary and helping Bennet rise to be the current chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Colorado was the centerpiece of an Obama \u201cWestern strategy\u201d to permanent Democratic majorities. Now? The president\u2019s job approval rating in the state was at 38 percent in the last reliable public poll taken in the state. Udall, who rode Obama\u2019s coattails in 2008, is looking like an increasingly bad bet for re-election. The president\u2019s energy policies and overall economic concerns rank high on the list of voter concerns, but ObamaCare remains a toxic substance in the state. Colorado embraced the health law but has struggled badly with implementation. Like Iowa to the east, Colorado\u2019s retreat from Obama and the Democrats who carry his banner has revealed the hollowness of Obama\u2019s onetime boats of being a transformational political figure for his party.\n\n\n\nLOOSE LIPS MAY SINK OBAMA BORDER PLAY\n\nIt looks like congressional Democrats got a little ahead of the White House in touting the president\u2019s decision to drop efforts to deport tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have surged across the southern U.S. border to take advantage of the administration\u2019s policy of granting sanctuary to migrant children. After the AP cited Hill sources claiming that President Obama, bowing to liberal worries, would drop his request for rapid deportation authority, the White House pushed back saying that the request was still part of a package headed to Congress today seeking billions in new spending and other legal changes to address the border surge.\n\n\n\n[That\u2019s where the money goes - York: \u201cSo: A total of $1.324 billion ($329 million for the Border Patrol and $995 million for ICE) will go to the \u2018care, feeding, and transportation costs\u2019 of the illegal immigrants, while $32 million ($9 million for attorneys and $23 million for removal operations) will go to deportations.\u201d]\n\n\n\nOut of order - The way it was apparently supposed to work was for the president to first seek new spending to help care for and place the border crossers in permanent homes in the United States. Since making a request for deficit spending to accommodate part of a migrant influx forecast to be approximately 100,000 strong would be politically unpalatable for the president and Democrats, the request for deportation authority and some funds to beef up the border guard would provide at least the appearance of a balanced approach. The enforcement measures would have been necessary to either win passage of the spending plan or make a more credible case for the president using executive authority in the face of congressional inaction. But in the rush to assure liberals that the tough talk was only that, the White House seems to have given up the game. Because of the leak, it will be harder to either co-opt Republicans or shift blame for the crisis. No wonder they pushed back so hard.\n\n\n\nBAIER TRACKS: ON SECOND THOUGHT...\n\n\u201cAfter the furor over the border crisis involving tens of thousands of illegal-immigrant children, the White House finally admitted that no, the president couldn't just go to Texas Wednesday and Thursday for two Democratic fundraisers just a couple of hundred miles from ground zero in the crisis. After formally asking Congress for billions of dollars to help deal with the situation, it would be a tough visual for the president to be raking in campaign cash while asking for taxpayer money for a humanitarian crisis in the same state. So what's the solution? A roundtable discussion with local leaders. Most of the president\u2019s critics say he needs to act more and talk less. But we'll see how this talk goes.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.\n\n\n\nJarrett tries jiu-jitsu on Perry snub - Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, declined to appear in an Austin airport photo-op with President Obama during the president\u2019s Texas fundraising trip on Wednesday. Perry instead sent a letter to the commander in chief suggesting he and Obama have a \u201csubstantive meeting\u201d relating to the current crisis at the border between Texas and Mexico. Not to be outdone, top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett sent Perry a letter Monday thanking him for his \u201cconcern.\u201d Jarrett wrote that Obama \u201cwould welcome a meeting with\u201d Perry, but provided no details. Jarrett did invite Perry to join a group discussion with faith leaders and local elected officials with the president in Dallas. The White House continues to insist the president has no plans to visit the border, which Perry invited Obama to do to \u201csee firsthand what is happening there.\u201d\n\n\n\nHALF OF INSURANCE BROKERS WANT OUT\n\nPuget Sound Business Journal: \u201cNearly half of insurance brokers polled nationally have considered leaving the industry in the wake of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 meanwhile, employers say they need them more than ever before, according to a report by Aflac. A potential exodus of brokers could make it more difficult for large and small businesses to lose that expertise just as things are getting really complicated. Brokers help companies give employees the best and most affordable coverage and insure they comply with the complexities of the ACA\u2026.Brokers have only seen their jobs get more difficult since the dawn of the Affordable Care Act. They're under pressure to deliver employers low-cost health care, but that can be increasingly difficult. Others fear losing customers to public and private health exchanges. And when brokers look elsewhere for work they take their expertise with them. Many had previously expressed concern that the introduction of the health exchanges would take business away from them.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Washington Free Beacon: \u201cThe OBGYN practice of Marilyn Jerome, the wife of Democratic congressional candidate John Foust, does not accept Medicaid, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. Foust has repeatedly attacked his Republican opponent Barbara Comstock for opposing the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act in his campaign to represent Virginia\u2019s 10th district.\u201d]\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nAfter faithfully serving as a solar observatory, then flying through the tails of Comet Giacobini-Zinner and Halley\u2019s Comet, scientists decided they didn\u2019t need it anymore. The Atlantic\u2019s Robinson Meyer describes the quest to save the ISEE-3\u2014a long-lost NASA probe launched in the disco era and abandoned in the dot-com boom. \u201cLate last week, the amateur scientists and engineers working to salvage the probe hit a major milestone: They coaxed the craft into firing its rotational thrusters\u2026 Now, the team can begin to fire the ISEE-3\u2019s thrusters and change the ship\u2019s trajectory\u2014hopefully, keeping it from crashing into the moon\u2026 In the past month of working with the spacecraft, Cowing said they\u2019d gotten used to its idiosyncrasies. ISEE-3 lacks an onboard computer, so commands must be fed to it one at a time\u2026 [Keith Cowing, a journalist-turned-mission-leader says] \u2018It\u2019s like telling an old dot-matrix printer from back in the day to do something.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The Republican National Committee\u2019s site selection team is reportedly going to decide today whether Cleveland or Dallas will get the nod. Cleveland, a swing-state, blue-collar city with a pleasant lakeshore summertime climate, is considered the frontrunner. But Dallas has serious clout as coming from the most influential state in the party as well as larger capacity for big events. The downside for Dallas, other than the heat: messaging difficulties related to the ongoing feud in the state party as well as the legacy of the city\u2019s most famous resident, former President George W. Bush. The current plan is for the convention to begin on June 27 or July 18, 2016.\n\n\n\nNYT RIFFS ON HILLARY\u2019S WALL STREET WORRIES\n\nNYT: \u201cAs its relationship with Democrats hits a historic low, Wall Street sees a solution on the horizon: Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton was the industry\u2019s home state senator, and the financial sector was the second-largest giver to her presidential campaign in 2008. In her post-State Department life, she has been showered with lucrative speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and other financial firms. In her talks, she says it is unproductive to vilify the industry, and she avoids the kind of language that puts off financial executives, as when President Obama referred to \u2018fat cat\u2019 bankers in 2009. But as Wall Street hopes for a warm embrace from the former secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton must grapple with a populist surge coursing through politics, on both the right and the left\u2026.Several people who advised Mrs. Clinton on her 2008 presidential campaign said the speech angered some of her Wall Street donors, who complained about what they viewed as her increasing antagonism to the industry. Mrs. Clinton has also called for eliminating the carried interest tax loophole\u2026 some on the left say Mrs. Clinton\u2019s less combative approach to issues of taxation, Wall Street regulation and growth \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re all in this mess together,\u2019 as one person who had attended several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches described her message \u2014 was out of step with the current political climate.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmerica Rising calls for Clintons to show the money \u2013 The conservative group America Rising PAC is calling for the Clinton Foundation to release records on how the non-profit is spending its money and which of Hillary Clinton\u2019s high-priced college speaking fees, many whose tuitions have skyrocketed, were donated to her family\u2019s foundation. \u201cFor Americans to credibly believe these speaking fees are being donated to charitable endeavors, the foundation must be transparent about how and where it has spent its millions since Hillary Clinton joined last year,\u201d America Rising PAC Executive Director Tim Miller said in a statement. Miller claims in the past the foundation has funded the Clinton\u2019s glitzy lifestyle and paid for Democratic aids who can help Clinton though her potential presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nPoll: GOP gains on Hillary as her favorability declines - Although Hillary Clinton continues to beat at top GOP presidential contenders, a new Quinnipiac poll of registered voters shows the GOP contenders are inching upward against the Democratic presidential frontrunner. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., gained the largest margin among the possible nominees, four points since January of this year. The same poll also shows that since Clinton left the administration in 2012, she has been on a downward slope of favorability, dropping from 61 percent favorability to 49 percent. This is the first time she has dropped below the 50 percent threshold since losing the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008.]\n\n\n\nUniversity refuses to disclose Clinton payout - NY Post: \u201c[State University at Buffalo] \u2014 which is taxpayer-funded \u2014 refuses to disclose how much Clinton received [for a speech at the university]. Officials claim they don\u2019t have to make the amount public because it was paid through the university\u2019s foundation. \u2018[The foundation] is not subject to the New York Freedom of Information Law. As such, these agreements, including information about speaking fees, are not public information,\u2019 the university said in a statement.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Slacktastic - A Pew study, one in ten Americans are not registered, seldom or never vote, or do not follow political news most of the time.]\n\n\n\nCRUZ CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO COCHRAN\u2019S WIN\n\nWaPo: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) on Monday sharply criticized allies of Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) for courting Democrats in last month\u2019s Republican runoff election and called for a thorough investigation into allegations of voter fraud, marking his most direct comments yet on the outcome of one of the most contentious and divisive campaigns in recent memory. \u2018What happened in Mississippi was appalling,\u2019 Cruz said on the Mark Levin Show. \u2018Primaries are always rough and tumble. But the conduct of the Washington D.C. machine in the Mississippi runoff was incredibly disappointing.\u2019\u201d Cruz is a vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which McDaniel\u2019s campaign has accused of wrongdoing in the election.\n\n\n\nMcDaniel\u2019s lawyer presses on - The (Jackson, Miss.) Clarion-Ledger: \u201cA lawyer for Chris McDaniel said campaign canvassers started going through records at every courthouse statewide on Monday and he\u2019s confident McDaniel can successfully overturn the June 24 GOP runoff. The Thad Cochran campaign countered that few voting irregularities are being found and the vote should stand. [Mitch Tyner, an attorney for McDaniel and former Republican candidate for governor] said he is uncertain the number of ineligible votes the campaign has found. McDaniel\u2019s campaign reported 4,900 late last week, and McDaniel in television interviews said 5,000. The McDaniel campaign has said a majority of these are people who voted in the June 3 Democratic primary, then crossed over June 24 and voted in the Republican runoff, which is prohibited by state law\u2026 Cochran spokesman Jordan Russell on Monday refuted the McDaniel campaign\u2019s claim there are thousands of illegal votes and says the number appears to be within normal margins of election errors\u2026.Russell said he didn\u2019t have totals, but listed the number of potential crossover votes found in four counties: Perry, 1; Lauderdale, 7; Pontotoc, 3; Leake, 5.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Former GOP gubernatorial candidate hopeful and attorney Mitch Tyner now represents Chris McDaniel during the run-off voting irregularities investigation.

Thad Cochran won the state\u2019s Republican primary runoff over challenger Chris McDaniel by 7,667 votes. The party sent results to the Secretary of State on Monday, the legal deadline. The GOP\u2019s numbers showed Cochran winning by more than the 6,800 votes counted by The Associated Press after the June election.

Lamar\u2019s record - run against the tea party, voted for bank bailouts and amnesty for illegal aliens,\u201d says the narrator in the 30 second ad.

Bruce Braley, D-Iowa,] who was caught on tape in January making a remark that seemed to besmirch Iowa farmers, has been caught on tape seemingly claiming to be one. \u2018We\u2019re farmers,\u2019 a parade attendee appears to tells Braley, a U.S. Senate candidate, during the Fourth of July parade in Iowa Falls last weekend. \u2018So am I,\u2019 Braley answers in a video\u2026 \u2018But so is [Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa],\u2019 says the woman, who is seated in a lawn chair on the side of the road. \u2018So am I,\u2019 Braley insists. Braley is not an active farmer. He doesn\u2019t own farm land and doesn\u2019t earn any farm income, according to his federal financial disclosure reports. He doesn\u2019t perform or manage any farm operations, campaign aides said today.\u201d\n\n\n\nGLOBAL WARMING GROUP HITS ERNST ON EDUCATION\n\nSioux City Journal: \u201cAn environmental group said Monday it is launching the second ad of its campaign against Republican Senate hopeful Joni Ernst, saying she is out of step with Iowans because she wants to eliminate the federal Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. The ad is going to begin running this week and into next in the Cedar Rapids and Des Moines markets. It's part of a $457,000 ad buy placed late last month when its first ad debuted. The league and two other groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club, have said they are going to spend $1 million in Iowa's open Senate race\u2026. The ad says that federal Pell grants would be threatened by closing the education department and shuttering the EPA would let \u2018polluters off the hook.\u2019 The league says a third of the education department's spending is on Pell Grants.\u201d\n\n\n\nCROSSROADS ROLLS OUT NEWS SPOTS IN ARK. AND COLO.\n\nConservative group Crossroads GPS will launch a pair of TV ads today in key Senate battlegrounds. The group is launching a $435,000 TV ad attacking Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., on unstable ObamaCare premiums and taxpayer-funded subsidies for Congress. \u201cArkansas families struggle after being told their health plans were cancelled and worry about higher premiums and Medicare cuts,\u201d the narrator says in the 30-second spot. \u201cBut Sen. Mark Pryor voted to allow members of Congress and their staff to get taxpayer-funded health care subsidies to help pay for ObamaCare premiums.\u201d The ad concludes urging voters to \u201ctell Pryor, Arkansas families can\u2019t afford ObamaCare.\u201d Another ad, backed by $460,000, will hit Colorado airwaves targeting Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., over the Obama administration\u2019s global-warming regulations and inaction on a proposed pipeline to bring Canadian oil to U.S. refineries, the Keystone XL project.\n\n\n\nCASSIDY ATTACKS OBAMACARE IN NEW AD\n\nRep. Bill Cassidy, R-La, debuts a new ad attacking ObamaCare and the exemption for Congress and their staff. \u201cFor 25 years, I cared for patients in charity hospitals like this,\u201d Cassidy says in the 30 second spot referencing [a] hospital in Baton Rouge, La. \u201cI saw that when politicians and bureaucrats control healthcare, your care suffers.\u201d Cassidy continues, \u201cPoliticians know this. So some in Congress exempted staff from ObamaCare. It\u2019s good enough for us but not for them \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Washington.\u201d The ad will air in New Orleans over the next few weeks. Cassidy challenges Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., along with Col. Rob Maness in November.

That\u2019s why I dyed my hair pink,\u201d Pat Lawrence from Billings, Mont. says in the 30 second spot. \u201cI really depend on Medicare. When I heard that John Walsh said ObamaCare wouldn\u2019t hurt seniors, I couldn\u2019t believe it. ObamaCare cuts billions of dollars from Medicare, putting my care at risk. Walsh also believes that privatizing Social Security should be on the table.\u201d Lawrence concludes saying \u201cI just don\u2019t trust John Walsh.\u201d\n\n\n\nSenior \u2018disappointed\u2019 in Daines for cutting Medicare in new Walsh ad\u2013 The Hill: \u201cSen.

Steve Daines (R-Mont.) on Medicare in his latest ad, targeting a key demographic in his uphill battle to retain his seat. \u2018We rely on Medicare to survive,\u2019 one of the seniors says in the ad. \u2018We were so disappointed when Congressman Daines voted to cut Medicare benefits while cutting taxes for multi-millionaires like himself,\u2019 the others chime in.
