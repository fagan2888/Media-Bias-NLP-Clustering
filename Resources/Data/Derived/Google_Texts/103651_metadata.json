Burwell case. The case, which went before the high court March 23 for oral arguments, challenges the Obamacare requirement that nonprofit employers offer their employees health care coverage that includes birth control, Plan B, ella, and other potentially life-ending drugs and devices.\n\n\n\nOklahoma Wesleyan University\n\nThe schools that are part of Zubik v. Burwell come from diverse backgrounds. Some are Catholic and oppose providing through their health care plans all forms of contraceptives. Others, like Oklahoma Wesleyan University, for example, only oppose drugs and devices that can lead to the termination of a pregnancy, not providing birth control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pro-life. So Plan B and ella would be off the table for the Wesleyan church because there are times when it can terminate a fertilized egg,\u201d Dr. Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThat\u2019s intervening into God\u2019s power to define life, to give life, and to later on take it at his choosing.\u201d\n\nWhile Dr. Piper has no religious objection to birth control, he believes that Catholic universities and nonprofits like the Little Sisters of the Poor have a constitutional right to object themselves.\n\n\u201cWesleyans wouldn\u2019t presuppose or be arrogant enough to tell Catholics that they have to live their life the way we do. And Catholics don\u2019t suggest that they can tell Wesleyans that they can live their lives the way we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Catholic church has chosen to prohibit all contraception. The Wesleyan church has chosen to prohibit abortifacients because it takes a human life \u2026 and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nSetting Precedent\n\nZubik v. Burwell will set precedent for \u201croughly 1,000 religiously affiliated schools that object to birth control,\u201d said Alison Tanner, co-editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law.\n\nTanner, who\u2019s a student at Georgetown University, submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on behalf of 240 students, faculty, and staff from 11 religiously affiliated universities arguing that if the current mandate is struck down, \u201cserious obstacles\u201d to contraceptive access would arise.\n\n\u201cI am not Catholic; I\u2019m Jewish,\u201d Tanner said on Wednesday as the Supreme Court was hearing oral arguments. \u201cI am still a Georgetown student, and I still deserve access to no-cost birth control, not just because I don\u2019t want to have a family right now, but because birth control is an essential health care for me. And it is essential health care for many of my friends.\u201d\n\nSome schools like Georgetown University offer student health care plans, which could also be impacted by the court\u2019s decision. Georgetown University, however, has offered free birth control to students since 2013. The Independent Journal Review noted that the school\u2019s policy states: \u201cUnitedHealthcare StudentResources will accommodate Georgetown University and pay for your birth control as required by law \u2026 with no out-of-pocket expense.\u201d\n\nPart of the Obama administration\u2019s goal with the health care law was to provide women access to comprehensive coverage of contraceptives, including abortion-inducing drugs and devices. Churches and church-controlled ministries were granted exemptions from this mandate (along with large corporations such as Exxon and Visa, who were grandfathered in), but religious nonprofits, schools, and other organizations were left out of that arrangement.\n\nInstead, the Obama administration granted these groups a form of accommodation that allows them to sign a piece of paper stating their objection.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has a religious objection \u2026 doesn\u2019t have to pay for, refer, doesn\u2019t have to organize, doesn\u2019t have to accommodate that contraception coverage for his or her employees,\u201d said former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, according to NPR. \u201cWhat they are required to do is provide notification to the government or their insurer that they are opting out. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPermission Slip\u201d for Abortion\n\nReligious institutions and nonprofits like the Little Sisters of the Poor say this accommodation falls short of protecting their pro-life beliefs. They\u2019ve equated the arrangement to the government coercing them to sign a \u201cpermission slip\u201d that results in their formal cooperation with abortion.\n\nThe Wesleyan Church, Piper said, demands that \u201cyou practice what you preach.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just worship God in the four walls of the church. You actually leave the church and do something about it.\u201d\n\nSigning a \u201cpermission slip\u201d that authorizes abortion, he added, is hypocritical to their very core.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t segregate the private and the public, we integrate private life and public life into an integrated life that represents integrity. We would argue the opposite of that would be hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nElsa Spear, a student at Geneva College\u2014another party to the case\u2014said the government shouldn\u2019t \u201cforce me and my college\u201d to act against their belief that life begins at conception.\n\n\u201cThe government is trying to force Geneva College to dehumanize an extremely vulnerable group of people, to force Geneva College to be a participant in what we believe is the intentional killing of these people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe choice Geneva College faces\u2014abandon your religious principles or undergo severe punishment\u2014is a clear assault on religious freedom.\u201d\n\nSpear attended a rally in front of the Supreme Court last Wednesday to speak out on behalf of Geneva students.\n\nLosing, she said, \u201cwould be another blow\u201d to students, who believe that abortion is a \u201cconsequence of de-humanization.\u201d\n\nAwaiting an Answer\n\nReligious institutions and nonprofits face millions of dollars in fines if they do not comply with the accommodation as it stands.\n\nThe question before the Supreme Court is whether the opt-out process poses a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the rights of religious groups and whether or not the government has a compelling interest in forcing them to abide by the current accommodation.\n\nWith the passing of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia last month, a total of eight justices sit on the Supreme Court. If a tie occurs, the decisions of the lower appeals courts will stand. In those decisions, nearly all appeals courts sided with the Obama administration, meaning the mandate will essentially stand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How religiously-affiliated colleges and universities could be impacted by the Supreme Court's decision in Zubik v.
