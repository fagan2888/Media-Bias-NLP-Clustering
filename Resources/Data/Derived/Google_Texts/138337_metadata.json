It\u2019s on the wall in giant, blinking neon lights. The name will change.\u201d\n\nReferring to the team\u2019s owner, Mr. Reid added: \u201cDaniel Snyder may be the last person in the world to realize this, but it\u2019s just a matter of time before he\u2019s forced to do the right thing and change the name.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a statement that \u201cslurs have no right to trademark protections.\u201d \u201cThe team that represents our nation\u2019s capital should be a source of pride to all Americans,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time for the Washington football team to choose a new name.\u201d\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) also took to the Senate floor to praise the decision. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to know that finally people are recognizing that this issue can no longer be a business case for the NFL to use this patent,\u201d she said. The patent office\u2019s decision puts a \u201cbig dent\u201d in the NFL\u2019s business case, she added.\n\nLast month, Ms. Cantwell led an effort by 50 Democratic lawmakers to sign a letter calling on the NFL to \u201cremove the racial slur from the name of one of its marquee franchises.\u201d\n\nRep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) said the patent office \u201cgot it exactly right.\u201d In a statement, he called the team name \u201cderogatory and offensive\u201d and said a change was long overdue. \u201cThe NFL should take this decision to heart and force the team to change its name,\u201d he said. Mr. Waxman last month threatened to hold a hearing on the NFL\u2019s use of the term \u201cRedskins,\u201d citing the National Basketball Association\u2019s removal of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling over racist remarks.\n\nWhile the patent office\u2019s ruling delivers a symbolic blow to the team, it may not have an immediate or significant real-world impact. The team may still have ways to enforce its trademark rights, and is not required to change its name. The team also can appeal the ruling in federal court.\n\nOther lawmakers have not been as enthusiastic about the ruling. Rep. Howard Coble (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet, said Wednesday the panel would consider holding a hearing on the patent office\u2019s decision once the appeals process is over.\n\nThe Redskins in May retained McGuireWoods Consulting to lobby Congress on the team\u2019s behalf. The firm\u2019s Ronald Platt, who lobbies for the Redskins, said Wednesday that he hadn\u2019t read the Patent Office decision and declined to discuss the issue.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also took to Twitter to hail the Patent Office ruling. Here\u2019s a sample of their tweets:\n\nToday\u2019s great actions by the @USPTO show that slurs have no right to trademark protections. The DC football team must choose a new name. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 18, 2014\n\nDecision to cancel trademark of DC\u2019s football team is a victory for Native Americans and dignity of all communities #ChangeTheName \u2014 Rep.
