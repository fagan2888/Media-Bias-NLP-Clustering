Mr. Robot S01E07: "eps1.6_v1ew-s0urce.flv"





Two more great tracks to choose from this week. First up, Fka Twigs' creepy romantic neo-ballad "Two Weeks," to which Tyrell MURDERED a woman to.







And of course the best use of The Cure's "Pictures of You" ever:







Guys, I'm still flopping around on the ground in emotional distress from the events that closed out "Brave Traveler." But it was nice to see that I wasn't alone. "View Source" toiled in the aftermath of Shayla's death beautifully, with bookending scenes that showed just how much of Elliot's world was taken away from him when Shayla turned up, throat slit, in the trunk of a car.

The opening scene, a flashback to Elliot and Shayla's first meeting, didn't present itself as a flashback until midway through, but it was indicative of where Elliot was right now: back to where he started. Except worse. Before he just had his empty life and crippling anxiety, but now he had all that and the weight of the death of one of his few friends. His need for that drug I can't pronounce let alone spell pushed Shayla towards Vera, which led to her death. If Elliot was feeling f*cked up before, he's feeling triple f*cked up now.

"View Source" finally returned to what made the pilot so great, which was the opportunity to spend some time inside Elliot's head, and there's nothing like simmering over the murder of a girlfriend to bring back the outsider element that made him so fascinating and real. But from this type of tragedy, Elliot would either lose all momentum with personal progress or rebound with renewed strength to give Shayla's death meaning. And it looked like it would be the former in the beginning when Krista released him from their mandated sessions.





But by the time the end came around, Elliot was outside Krista's office when he didn't even have a session, and for the first time ever, he was ready to talk: "I want a way out of loneliness, just like you. Is that what you wanted to hear?" And the bridge between his silence and willingness to talk was never really built, but did it have to be built and explained? The pain in Elliot's face was all we needed to see, and perhaps the thought of losing someone else in his life—Krista, surprisingly—was too much. Maybe he finally learned to accept Gideon's advice of finding someone he needed to be totally honest with, and Krista made the most sense because in Elliot's eyes, she's the only person who knew what he was going through.

Disgraced CTO and sleazy ball-job fan Terry Colby had a similar breakthrough in agreeing to go along with Angela's plan. He'll turn on the Evil Corp execs and she'll take some blame for the hacking scandal, which gets her some retribution for the death of her mother instead of leaving leaving the scandal buried underneath indifference and the power of a corporate in-house law team. For Colby, there's a question of whether or not Angela's initial parting words—that losing the respect of everyone you know and everyone you don't know was the worst kind of torture—made him change his mind or whether he finally realized it was the best thing for him to do. But with Elliot's decision to open up to Krista and Colby coming around to Angela, there's a message of striving for health in the episode that hasn't always been in Mr. Robot.

Elsewhere, the episode was a little messy but also awesome at the same time? I can't even begin to pretend to know what's going on with Tyrell. I mean, how do you explain the fact that he murdered new CTO Scott's wife on the roof by choking her to death after seducing her with confidence? And aside from wiping lipstick off his face, the whole thing was sloppy, not what I expected from a man who always seemed to plan out every step in advance. But hey! I'm not a crazy psychopath so how should I know. Was it a release of frustration from being passed over for CTO? Was it a way to get Scott back or break him down so he would have to leave the job? The only way to know is to go inside Tyrell's head, and NO THANKS, that place is scary.





Fsociety moved forward a bit, with Darlene getting a meeting with the White Rose, which doesn't sound like the most intimidating name for a super powerful hacker. And, after a month off, there were a few members of Fsociety that needed some convincing to come back. Trenton got the pep talk from Darlene, while Romero got a gun in the face from Mr. Robot. I assume free popcorn was enough to get Mobley to return, so the episode didn't need to bother with that. Speaking of Mr. Robot, either Elliot is totally going out of body with his creation of Mr. Robot, or it's time to accept the fact that Mr. Robot is a real person.

Interestingly enough, "View Source" may have spent the least amount on Elliot that any episode of Mr. Robot has so far, yet his scenes were easily the best and most powerful of the hour. Elliot appeared in only six scenes that I counted: in the opening flashback, in his first meeting with Krista, with Gideon in the office, when he wiped his gear, at a stop at the vet, and in his second meeting with Krista. And while I'm not usually the type to say a few great scenes make a great episode, the aftermath of Shayla's death as seen through Elliot's eyes were brutally effective. "View Source" was the cool down that Mr. Robot needed before launching back up again to head toward the finale.

– C'mon Elliot, couldn't you have picked a better Blur album? Like Modern Life is Rubbish? Parklife?

– I love the portrait of corporate culture that Mr. Robot paints, and this week Dwight, one of Tyrell's lackeys, was amazing. "We get it, the goddamned earning reports are going to look good on Monday, stop being such a faggot." And he didn't know what his kids were up to and was sad when his daughter was into art. Holy hell, these people are AWFUL.

– How does Angela come out of this unscathed? Will she leverage Cisco's hacker stuff she uploaded into Allsafe's system against Evil Corp when the time is right? Will she make Evil Corp pay for ignoring the toxic chemical dump through Colby and then hit them again with Cisco's disc?

– Romero is making THC body lotions now? Cool.

– That opening with "Pictures of You" playing while Shayla walked away into the out of focus world while the Mr. Robot logo stamped her out of existence may have gotten someone who looked a lot like me a little teary-eyed.

– I'm off for vacation next week, but Cory Barker will be filling in for me. See you the week after that!
