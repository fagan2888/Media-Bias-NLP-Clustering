With "Crossfire" returning to CNN this Monday, September 9, CNN is taking a closer look into the hosts' lives with a series of Web videos.

In this video, Van Jones, a former special adviser to President Obama for green jobs, reflects on his memories of watching “Crossfire” with his father and on his hopes for the future of the program.

Jones, who says he doesn’t come from a traditional Washington background, says as a teenager in the early 1980s, he learned a lot watching the program with his father, whom he describes as a “black ex-military Southerner” who didn’t agree with liberals or conservatives. “I got to understand through his eyes that there’s way more points of view in America than you can ever get on TV,” explains Jones. “So I’m excited about getting a chance to bring some of those perspectives.”



Jones also argues that after “Crossfire” went off the air, American media went downhill. With the relaunch of “Crossfire,” Jones maintains that the hosts will get beyond talking points quickly in a half-hour program: “In 22 minutes of television, you have to really get down to the secondary, the tertiary, the root of these debates and these discussions. I think America needs that.”

"Crossfire" returns to CNN Monday, September 9, at 6:30pm ET.
