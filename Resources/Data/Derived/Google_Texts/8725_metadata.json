Everyone should have some training.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his gun group, Hoffer is a seller at Crossroads of the West Gun Show in Phoenix this weekend. Like many at the gun show he believes in the Second Amendment and his right to carry a gun at all times to defend himself. But he also said there should be a little personal responsibility that goes into carrying a weapon in public.\n\n\u201cJust having training, going through the concealed weapon class -- don't just buy a gun and think you know how to use it,\u201d said Hoffer.\n\nMeanwhile, many self-defense and law enforcement experts say the best thing to do in an active shooter situation is run or hide. The last resort should be to fight back.\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
