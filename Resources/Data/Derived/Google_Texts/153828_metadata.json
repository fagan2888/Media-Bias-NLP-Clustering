After Democrats maintained (and indeed expanded) their majorities in the upper and lower chambers in 2008, the newly elected president had, within his grasp, the votes to pass comprehensive immigration reform. For obvious reasons, however, he chose not to. Of course, it didn\u2019t matter that he pledged to make immigration reform a top legislative priority during his first year in office. He decided, instead, to guide the passage of what is now mistakenly referred to as the \"Affordable\" Care Act \u2013 the president\u2019s health care overhaul that was hugely controversial at the time, and, to this day, has never really enjoyed widespread backing from the American public.\n\nNevertheless, that was his choice. Today, however, Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry pressed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on this point; namely, if the president had the political capital to reform our broken immigration system for two full years, why didn\u2019t he?\n\nThis is a curious answer. Despite the multitude of \u201ccrises\u201d the president may have faced in 2009-2010, it\u2019s fair to say that those crises have only multiplied -- or become more intractable. Why, then, does he have time now to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, but didn\u2019t four years ago? In other words, it's difficult to believe, I think, that the president couldn\u2019t have tackled immigration issues when he first took office (when it was politically viable to do so) because of \u201ca lot of other crises.\u201d Those crises, I'm afraid, still exist today \u2013 and aren't going away anytime soon, either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hmm..05/26/2016 19:57:48PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hmm.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Reporter Asks WH: Why Didn't Obama Pass Immigration Reform When He Had the Votes?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/08/04/ed-henry-to-wh-press-secretary-say-why-didnt-the-president-pass-immigration-reform-when-he-had-the-votes-n1874570", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/171/c3d645e9-62d5-4d98-b4b5-2f6f5caf3f16.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hmm.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Reporter Asks WH: Why Didn't Obama Pass Immigration Reform When He Had the Votes?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/08/04/ed-henry-to-wh-press-secretary-say-why-didnt-the-president-pass-immigration-reform-when-he-had-the-votes-n1874570", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/171/c3d645e9-62d5-4d98-b4b5-2f6f5caf3f16.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Reporter Asks WH: Why Didn't Obama Pass Immigration Reform When He Had the Votes?, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Why, then, does he have time now to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, but didn\u2019t four years ago?\nAfter Democrats maintained (and indeed expanded) their majorities in the upper and lower chambers in 2008, the newly elected president had, within his grasp, the votes to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\nOf course, it didn\u2019t matter that he pledged to make immigration reform a top legislative priority during his first year in office.\nDespite the multitude of \u201ccrises\u201d the president may have faced in 2009-2010, it\u2019s fair to say that those crises have only multiplied -- or become more intractable.\nToday, however, Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry pressed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on this point; namely, if the president had the political capital to reform our broken immigration system for two full years, why didn\u2019t he?"}
