Sandra Fluke, the former Georgetown University Law student who became a national face of the Affordable Care Act after Republicans denied her the right to speak on a panel, appeared on MSNBC's 'All In With Chris Hayes' on Tuesday.

Fluke, who now works as a social justice attorney, went head-to-head with the Washington Examiner's Timothy Carney about the new health care law's contraception mandate. Some employers may be exempt from the mandate based on religious or moral reasons. But Fluke said it was a bad idea to let companies chose what health care services they want to cover.

"It's a corporation picking and choosing what types of law they want to comply with," she said. "Our belief in this society has always been that we protect the liberty of individuals in their private lives, but that when you cross that line and go into the publics sphere and decide you want to operate as a company, make a profit off the public, you need to abide by public's laws."
