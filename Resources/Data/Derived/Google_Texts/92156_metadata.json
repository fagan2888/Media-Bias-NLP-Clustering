They billed Medicare for the devices and received more than $22 million.\n\nIn some cases health care providers paid kickbacks to fraudsters who could get their hands on Medicare patients\u2019 personal information. They would then use that info to bill Medicare for bogus care.\n\nSometimes fraudsters, known to the Feds as \u201cpatient recruiters,\u201d will go to places like homeless shelters and soup kitchens and offer money to those who would share their Medicare patient numbers, a Department of Justice spokesman said.\n\nA Los Angeles doctor is charged for allegedly billing $23 million for 1,000 power wheelchairs and home health services that were not medically necessary and often not provided. And in a Florida case, a health care provider received $1.6 million from Medicare for prescription drugs that were never purchased and never dispensed, said Lynch.\n\nThe FBI analyzed billing data to find areas in the country where there is a high potential for fraud.\n\n\u201cIn these cases, we followed the money and found criminals who were attracted to doctors offices, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes in search of what they viewed as an ATM,\u201d said FBI Director James B. Comey.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s Medicare Fraud Strike Force team led the investigations. Since 2007, it has charged 2,300 people who have falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $7 billion. In recent years, the team has expanded from two cities to nine, thanks to an additional $350 million in funding from the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FBI arrested hundreds of people, including 46 doctors and nurses, across the country this week in the largest Medicare fraud bust ever.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "The FBI arrested hundreds of people, including 46 doctors and nurses, across the country this week in the largest Medicare fraud bust ever.", "title": "Dozens of doctors and nurses arrested in huge Medicare fraud sting", "url": "http://wqad.com/2015/06/20/dozens-of-doctors-and-nurses-arrested-in-huge-medicare-fraud-sting/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/s002794721-300.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/s002794721-300.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2015-06-20T15:21:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-20T15:21:30+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0aef\"", "article_summary": "In some cases health care providers paid kickbacks to fraudsters who could get their hands on Medicare patients\u2019 personal information.\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) \u2014 The FBI arrested 46 doctors and nurses across the country this week in the largest Medicare fraud bust ever.\nIn total, 243 people were arrested in 17 cities for allegedly billing Medicare for $712 million worth of patient care that was never given or unnecessary.\nFour people are charged for mass-marketing a talking glucose monitor and sending the devices to Medicare patients across the country who didn\u2019t need or request them.\nAnd in a Florida case, a health care provider received $1.6 million from Medicare for prescription drugs that were never purchased and never dispensed, said Lynch."}
