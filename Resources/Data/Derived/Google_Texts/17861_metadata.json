On Tuesday, the company announced it will begin offering its employees unlimited paid maternity and paternity leave for the first year after a child\u2019s birth. It\u2019s all about flexibility at Netflix, with new parents allowed to work part-time, full-time, or not at all during the first year after a child\u2019s birth \u2014 whatever works for them and their family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just keeping paying them normally, eliminating the headache of switching to state or disability pay,\u201d Tawni Cranz, chief talent officer at Netflix, said in a statement. \u201cEach employee gets to figure out what\u2019s best for them and their family, and then works with their managers for coverage during their absences.\u201d\n\nWhy Netflix\u2019s Path Is The Healthy One\n\nIn 2013, researchers from the University of Maryland School of Public Health examined the link between length of maternity leave and postpartum depression. They found that women who had shorter maternity leaves were much more likely to develop depression after their child\u2019s birth, swamped in concerns about the finances and health of their baby, as well as worried they weren\u2019t spending enough time with their child. The researchers argued that even 12 weeks of paid leave wasn\u2019t enough to provide mothers with enough recovery time \u2014 and crucial emotional bonding time \u2014 with their infant.\n\nIndeed, other research has consistently found that new mothers who take extended time off after their child is born are better equipped to fight stress, depression, fatigue, and illness during the big transition in their life. Women who took more than 12 weeks of leave experienced more energy, improved mental and physical health, and a stronger bond with their child \u2014 and of course, their children benefited significantly.\n\nThis January during his State of the Union address, President Obama emphasized the importance of paid leave. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stop treating child care as a side issue or a women\u2019s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is,\u201d he said. Obama has been fighting for a national policy that allows paid leave for parents of newborn children as well as caretakers of elderly, but opponents argue that it\u2019s an economic burden. Interestingly, in states where paid leave experiments have been in place for some time, there is no evidence that paid leave is detrimental to businesses.\n\nWhile the federal government drags its feet, companies can take the lead in pioneering new standards for family leave. And perhaps this is the beauty of Netflix: Employees are treated like responsible adults and are given the freedom to choose how to create their work-life balance instead of restricted or micro-managed, to the benefit of everyone involved. It\u2019s common sense.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "netflix, maternity leave, paternity leave", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Netflix will allow unlimited paid leave for new mothers during the first year of their child\u2019s birth, paving the way for American companies to provide more humane family leave standards.", "title": "Raising The Bar: Netflix Will Allow Parents One-Year Maternity Leave", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/netflix-allow-one-year-paternity-and-maternity-leave-how-will-benefit-parents-and-346278", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/05/mother-child.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Netflix will allow unlimited paid leave for new mothers during the first year of their child\u2019s birth, paving the way for American companies to provide more humane family leave standards.", "title": "Raising The Bar: Netflix Will Allow Parents One-Year Maternity Leave", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/netflix-allow-one-year-paternity-and-maternity-leave-how-will-benefit-parents-and-346278", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/05/mother-child.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/05/mother-child.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-05T13:02:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T17:44:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Netflix will allow unlimited paid leave for new mothers during the first year of their child\u2019s birth, paving the way for American companies to provide more humane family leave standards."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e43\"", "article_summary": "Interestingly, in states where paid leave experiments have been in place for some time, there is no evidence that paid leave is detrimental to businesses.\nWhile the federal government drags its feet, companies can take the lead in pioneering new standards for family leave.\nThis January during his State of the Union address, President Obama emphasized the importance of paid leave.\nOn Tuesday, the company announced it will begin offering its employees unlimited paid maternity and paternity leave for the first year after a child\u2019s birth.\nObama has been fighting for a national policy that allows paid leave for parents of newborn children as well as caretakers of elderly, but opponents argue that it\u2019s an economic burden."}
