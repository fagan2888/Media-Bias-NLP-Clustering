The simple meditation technique has the power to ease pain in arthritis and asthma patients, reduce anxiety and symptoms of depression, and improve heart health. It so powerful that it works better than conventional methods (medication, psychotherapy) for many of these conditions. And now, a new study finds that it can bring back happiness in people falling down the rabbit hole of opioid drug addiction.\n\nMindfulness involves taking a moment to relax, to become aware of the present moment \u2014 sounds, smells, and the surrounding environment \u2014 and to think calmly about our emotions and thoughts. By considering thoughts in this context, we\u2019re better able to achieve wellness, as mindfulness requires that we approach them without judgment, and without thinking what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. It helps us find happiness in the present moment. And that\u2019s exactly what people in the habit of taking opioid drugs need, according to the study.\n\n\u201cThese findings are scientifically important because one of the major theories about how and why addiction occurs asserts that over time drug abusers become dulled to the experience of joy in everyday life, and this pushes them to use higher and higher doses of drugs to feel happiness,\u201d said Eric Garland, an associate professor at the University of Utah College of Social Work, in a press release.\n\nHe says that the desensitization opioid drug users experience can be reversed through mindfulness, and that it may even be able to keep them off the drugs. Indeed, opioid drug users, whether they\u2019re abusing heroin, oxycodone or some other morphine-derived drug, experience a rush of the neurotransmitter dopamine, as the drug binds to opioid-sensitive receptors in the brain. This causes a high full of pleasure, and the brain encodes that pleasure with the environment it occurs in. Thus, the brain comes to crave those feelings again, with each subsequent use inducing a weaker effect. These drug users typically search for higher doses after that, and it\u2019s easy to see how it can become a vicious cycle of addition.\n\nGarland and his team, however, found that the intervention program Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) was able to reduce patients\u2019 cravings for opioid drugs. Chronic pain patients taking these drugs underwent the eight-week intervention, during which time they were taught a \u201cmindful savoring practice\u201d that encouraged them to focus attention on beautiful scenes of nature, a sunset, or a connection with a love one, all of which are considered pleasant experiences. During meditation, they were asked to focus and appreciate the present moment, which involved taking in the smells, textures, and colors of a bouquet of flowers.\n\nBy pushing patients to find happiness in their day-to-day activities, the researchers found, through EEG scans, that their brains activated at a higher rate to such events. And the more activity they showed, the less likely they were to crave opioids.\n\nRoughly two million Americans abuse prescription opioids \u2014 it\u2019s an epidemic \u2014 and overdose deaths have more than quadrupled in the last 15 years. It\u2019s extremely important for opioid users to find a way out before it\u2019s too late. After all, dependency is one thing, but addiction is a whole other beast.\n\nSource: Garland E, Froeliger B, Howard M.
