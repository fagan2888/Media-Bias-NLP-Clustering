Despite a certain failed GOP presidential contender\u2019s suggestion that we should be putting in more hours at the office, the numbers show we\u2019re already logging plenty. A CNN Money roundup of stats on work habits shows Americans work more than people in other rich countries; that the average working week is actually 47 hours, not 40; and that nearly 40 percent of workers rack up more than 50 working hours each week. Yet our culturally ingrained notions allow for Americans to be constantly asked to work more all the time, without complaint, a system that seems to be holding up nicely. An ABCNews.com poll from 2015 found just 26 percent of Americans say they work too hard.\n\nSo who\u2019s toiling the hardest among U.S. denizens? The GOP would likely state that those in the heartland are pulling all the weight while coastal elites read the New Yorker, listen to NPR and sip lattes. But WalletHub\u2019s look at the labor forces in 116 largest American cities finds the hardest workers are scattered around the country. The assessments are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to average workweek hours, commute time and number of workers with multiple jobs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new WalletHub survey measures the average work weeks and commute times of laborers across the United States VIDEO", "title": "These are the 20 hardest working cities in America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new WalletHub survey measures the average work weeks and commute times of laborers across the United States VIDEO", "title": "These are the 20 hardest working cities in America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/06/the_20_hardest_working_cities_in_america_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/shutterstock_382909630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new WalletHub survey measures the average work weeks and commute times of laborers across the United States VIDEO", "title": "These are the 20 hardest working cities in America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/shutterstock_382909630.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kali Holloway", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Labor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But WalletHub\u2019s look at the labor forces in 116 largest American cities finds the hardest workers are scattered around the country.\nA CNN Money roundup of stats on work habits shows Americans work more than people in other rich countries; that the average working week is actually 47 hours, not 40; and that nearly 40 percent of workers rack up more than 50 working hours each week.\nThe assessments are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to average workweek hours, commute time and number of workers with multiple jobs.\nTopics: AlterNet, Labor, Business News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetAmericans work a lot.\nAn ABCNews.com poll from 2015 found just 26 percent of Americans say they work too hard."}
