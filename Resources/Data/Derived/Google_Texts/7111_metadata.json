Casey Foundation provides a sobering look at how children are faring in North Carolina.\n\nThe 2014 KIDS COUNT Data Book, which looks at 16 separate factors, ranks our state 38th in overall economic well-being, 28th in education, and 32nd in health.\n\nThe annual report concludes:\n\n\u2018Although unemployment is slowly declining, job growth has been concentrated in low-wage sectors and in nonstandard employment that tends to be less stable and offer few or no benefits, such as health insurance and paid sick leave.\n\nA stronger labor market and an increase in job quality, along with continued efforts to boost the education and training levels of low-income parents, would help to further reduce child poverty.\u2019\n\nIn North Carolina, 26% of children lived in poverty in 2012, according to the new report.\n\nLocally, the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle is working to help address this problem by creating long-term solutions to hunger for North Carolina\u2019s low-income families.
