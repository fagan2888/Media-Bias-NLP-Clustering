The Association of Mature American Citizens is one of multiple senior groups that bills itself as a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons.Founded in 2007 by retired insurance agency owner Daniel Weber, the New York-based seniors advocacy group is marketed to people age 50 and over, for $16 per year. Those younger than a half-century can join, but won't receive all of the benefits as those over 50.The organization's goal is to protect the interests of its members, and "to offer an alternative perspective on how to best solve the problems seniors face today," according to AMAC AMAC claims to have signed up nearly 1.5 million Americans who had grown frustrated with other seniors organizations, while not specifically naming the AARP. It attributed its spike in membership growth to opposition to the AARP-supported Affordable Care Act, according to The Wall Street Journal The group's viewpoint is rooted in conservative ideals, such as "fighting runaway taxes, excessive government involvement in our day-to-day lives, and the erosion of accountability at all levels of government." AMAC espouses "traditional American values of faith, family, and freedom."The boost in membership also increases AMAC's visibility in Washington, D.C., as it does battle against "tremendous lobbying power of AARP." AMAC claims that Washington is looking for someone who will speak for retirees and seniors that counters the AARP's unbalanced influence and, with enough members, AMAC is there to fill that void.Beyond its conservative policy advocacy, AMAC offers member benefits such as discounts on travel and at retail stores and restaurants as well as roadside assistance. They are also working toward local vendors to offer further savings.
