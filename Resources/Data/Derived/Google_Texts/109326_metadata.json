Between the time they chow down at Sunday night\u2019s Wild Hog Supper and toss shredded paper into the air on Sine Die, politicians will hash out important policy, pass a bunch of meaningless proclamations, and introduce their share of absurd bills\u2014i.e. the one to make English the official language of Georgia (again)\u2014intended to spark controversy.\n\nExpect this 40-day to go by relatively fast. After all, it\u2019s an election year. Following 2015\u2019s nearly $1 billion transportation bill, which included the passage of a tax hike to fund overdue road repairs, some Republicans in the GOP-controlled legislature are likely to face primary challengers backed by anti-tax crusaders. Incumbent state reps and senators will be eager to adjourn in order to start raising funds for the campaign trail\u2014something they\u2019re prohibited from doing during the session.\n\nBefore they leave town, Georgia\u2019s part-time, $17,000-a-year lawmakers are required by statute to accomplish one mission: Approve the state\u2019s annual budget. With the state\u2019s tax revenue up by 9.1 percent\u2014approximately $700 million\u2014in the first five months of the current fiscal year, officials will debate how to spend potentially more than $23 billion in what could be the state\u2019s largest budget ever. Pour money into schools? Give struggling hospitals a shot in the arm? Dedicate funding toward transit for the first time since, well, ever? Better not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nMany more details will be revealed in the next few weeks. But here are some of the key questions the lawmakers on their way to Atlanta face coming into the 2016 legislative session.\n\nCourtesy State of Georgia\n\nLt. Gov. Casey Cagle (from left), Gov. Nathan Deal, and House Speaker David Ralston at the 2015 \u201cState of the State\u201d address1. Gov. Nathan Deal wants to reform how Georgia\u2019s public schools are funded. Can everyone get on board with his plan?\n\nThe question of how to improve Georgia\u2019s public education system\u2014ranked sixth worst in the nation\u2014is a perennial issue. After spending his first term focused on criminal justice reforms, Deal recently has shifted his attention toward the state\u2019s struggling schools. \u201cEducation reform is the ultimate criminal justice reform,\u201d Deal said last month at a PolicyBEST breakfast. A major thrust of his plan involves rewriting the state\u2019s complex funding formula\u2014known as Quality Basic Education\u2014that determines how much money each school receives a year. QBE has remained unchanged since its launch in 1985. To portray the program as outdated, the septuagenarian governor compared it to parachute pants, jelly shoes, and a Commodore 64 during last year\u2019s \u201cState of the State\u201d address.\n\nBased on recommendations from his handpicked Education Reform Commission, Deal intends to simplify the rules for funneling money to classrooms. As part of that effort, he plans to boost education funding by about a quarter-billion dollars each year, provide schools with greater flexibility in spending cash, and tie teacher pay to student test scores. That last initiative\u2014recently referred to as the \u201choverboard of education\u201d for its potential to burst into metaphoric flames\u2014is already facing strong pushback from teacher associations. Democrats, including Atlanta state Sen. Vincent Fort, also worry the reworked formula could \u201ccodify austerity cuts\u201d from the past decade that would in essence guarantee schools are permanently underfunded. The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimates schools have been shortchanged more than $8.9 billion since 2003.\n\n2. Is state control the answer to turning around failing local schools?\n\nWhile the QBE funding debate takes place, dueling campaigns will ramp up over the scheduled November 2016 referendum to decide whether Georgia should establish an \u201cOpportunity School District.\u201d If approved, the governor would appoint a superintendent to take over up to 20 schools that have scored below 60 on the state\u2019s College and Career Ready Performance Index for three straight years (Georgia has 141 that fit this criteria, including 27 in Atlanta). Though supporters point to Louisiana\u2019s OSD as a model for success, critics believe the measure gives the governor too much power and, more importantly, aren\u2019t convinced it will work in Georgia. They instead would like to see better teaching, higher-quality classroom curriculum, and increased funding in struggling schools.\n\nScott Ehardt/Wikipedia\n\nWill this train make its way up to Alpharetta anytime soon?3. Will the growing love affair between Keith Parker and Republican lawmakers pay off for MARTA?\n\nLast March, when lawmakers raised taxes to fix the state\u2019s road and highways for the first time in nearly two decades, they also helped MARTA. Though House Bill 170 didn\u2019t provide it direct funding, the once-troubled transit agency saw some burdensome financial restrictions lifted. It also set the stage for MARTA to return for state funding in 2016\u2014which would be a major step toward paying for its massive $8 billion expansion plan. MARTA CEO Keith Parker, who convinced skeptical Republicans to reconsider his agency\u2019s merits, now wants legislators to let Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton residents vote on whether they should raise their own taxes to fund future transit investments, including the construction of three new rail lines.\n\nSo far, the signs are encouraging. \u201cI don\u2019t know if MARTA will expand and, if it does, I don\u2019t know what it might look like,\u201d House Speaker David Ralston said at last month\u2019s PolicyBEST meeting. \u201cBut I do know that major companies who seek out our state want reliable transit options in metro Atlanta.\u201d And it\u2019s not just top leadership; even south Georgia lawmakers are coming full circle on recognizing how MARTA benefits the whole state\u2014not just metro Atlanta.\n\n\u201cYou cannot build [just] roads to get out of transportation,\u201d said state Rep. Jay Powell, a Republican from Camilla who serves on MARTA\u2019s oversight committee. \u201cWhether it\u2019s MARTA or another system, I don\u2019t know the answer, but you can\u2019t rely totally on the highway system. You have to have other options.\u201d\n\nRead more: Keith Parker puts us back on track: The man who saved MARTA believes it can save us all. Will we get on board?\n\n4. The \u201creligion freedom\u201d bill has returned. Will Georgia learn from Indiana\u2019s costly mistake?\n\nDepending on whom you ask, Georgia\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill is either key to protecting or gutting our First Amendment rights. For the third consecutive year, state Sen. Josh McKoon, a Columbus Republican, will attempt to push his \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act\u201d through the General Assembly by claiming it\u2019s needed to protect religious rights from government intrusion. Each year he\u2019s faced growing opposition from LGBT activists and clergy members who argue the law is not just unnecessary, and but would also permit business owners to discriminate against customers. As a result, Georgia\u2019s corporate community has ratcheted up its opposition after seeing Indiana take a $1.5 billion economic hit following protests over a similar kind of law passed last year. According to the Metro Atlanta Chamber, Georgia would stand to lose more than $1 billion in convention business and sporting events if RFRA were to pass. (McKoon counters with another fact: Seven of the last 10 Super Bowls have taken place in states where RFRA already existed.) This year, however, McKoon has an ally in state Sen. Greg Kirk, an Americus Republican, who plans to drop a bill to protect public employees who have religious objections to gay marriage. Does the name Kim Davis ring a bell?\n\nRead more: The rumble over religious freedom: Will Georgia\u2019s most divisive bill help or hurt the state?\n\n5. Georgians can\u2019t legally access medical marijuana in Georgia. Will the state\u2019s new law be fixed or remain broken?\n\nLast year state lawmakers did what was once inconceivable by legalizing medicinal marijuana. Well, sort of. The measure, which allows the use of cannabis oil for a limited number of ailments, didn\u2019t make it legal for pot to be grown in Georgia so that the oil could actually be produced. State Rep. Allen Peake, the Macon Republican who authored the medicinal marijuana bill, is looking to correct that legislative oversight. However, he\u2019ll have to work against Deal\u2019s opposition to in-state cultivation. (Peake recently stepped down as the governor\u2019s House floor leader.) Peake appears to have popular support, as a recent poll found two-thirds of Georgia Republican voters favor his stance; backing from lobbyists hired by at least two medical marijuana companies, and Ralston\u2019s endorsement. Will that be enough to help Peake in his fight?\n\nRead more: Medical marijuana is legal now in Georgia. So how do we get it here?\n\nCourtesy MGM Resorts International\n\nMGM Resorts International officials, who are pushing for casinos to be legalized, point to the company\u2019s $1.3-billion resort being built outside Washington D.C. for an example of what could come to Georgia.6. Casinos are pulling out all the stops to legalize gambling in Georgia, but how far will it get them in a state filled with evangelists?\n\nThere won\u2019t be a casino built at Turner Field. But what about elsewhere in Atlanta? Or the rest of Georgia? A fierce debate will occur over the potential legalization of as many as six Georgia casinos. Supporters will be talking in dollar signs: the hundreds of millions in gambling taxes that could flow to the underfunded HOPE scholarship program, as well as a potential $5 billion statewide annual economic impact. But religious activists seeking to preserve Georgia\u2019s morality\u2014whatever amount still remains\u2014will battle back by stoking fears that casinos could lead to the rise of problem gamblers and a spike in local crime rates. For Georgia to go all-in, two-thirds of state lawmakers would need to support the effort, followed by a successful statewide referendum, and then local approval from voters who live in areas near proposed casinos. It\u2019ll be an uphill fight, but casinos have hired an army of lobbyists to do their bidding this year.\n\nRead more: Georgia lawmakers say casinos could save the HOPE scholarship. Is the fix already in?\n\n7. The Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t going anywhere. Will lawmakers find a way to expand Medicaid?\n\nRepublicans seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act saw their hopes dashed last summer when the U.S. Supreme Court ruling effectively upheld the law for good. With Obamacare here to stay, Georgia lawmakers are left to fix a state healthcare system that\u2019s seen five rural hospitals shutter in the past three years and a dozen more facing closure. Even larger public hospitals are on the brink of scaling back vital services, like the mental health clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital. Many Republicans still oppose expanding Medicaid\u2014which would provide more than 400,000 Georgians with healthcare coverage\u2014mostly due to financial concerns and continued political objections to the law. However, they\u2019ve failed to come up with another solution for insuring those Georgians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the elephant in the room,\u201d said Tim Sweeney, deputy director of policy for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. \u201cAny proposal that doesn\u2019t address the coverage issue is going to fall short in the long run.\u201d\n\nSo what happens next? Major reforms are unlikely to pass before the 2016 election, officials say. But the groundwork for a finding a solution is finally starting to be laid. The influential Georgia Chamber has hired two former Deal aides, spokesperson Brian Robinson and health policy adviser Blake Fulenwider, to lead a bipartisan effort to find a way to avoid a looming healthcare crisis in 2018. If nothing happens before then, payment cuts that were intended to be offset by Medicaid expansion will go into effect, placing Georgia hospitals into a deeper financial crisis.\n\n\u201cWe can either be ready for it or face significantly bad consequences,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be politicized.\u201d\n\nWhile Robinson said it\u2019s too early to talk specifics, the effort to expand Medicaid by another name will slowly take shape in the coming months. His pitch: Closing the coverage gap isn\u2019t just a moral obligation; it\u2019s good for the economy.\n\nRead more: HHS Secretary: States like Georgia will eventually see the merits of Medicaid expansion.\n\n8. Georgia\u2019s craft brewers are fuming over the 2015 legislative session. Will the booming new industry get a fair shake or lose out to distributors?\n\nWhen Senate Bill 63 passed last spring, Georgia\u2019s craft brewers believed it would be a boon to the burgeoning industry. The news was huge: They could effectively sell beer directly to consumers\u2014a measure that circumvented an old state law that required sales to go through a distributor. The law\u2019s intended effect, however, was gutted when the Georgia Department of Revenue issued a memo with \u201cclarifying language\u201d that undermined the intent of the bill and cost some small business owners thousands of dollars. If they didn\u2019t comply, DOR officials said, they could be fined and lose tasting room privileges.\n\nThe Georgia Craft Brewers Guild wants to revisit the legal snafu when legislators return to Atlanta. They\u2019ve already gained two key allies: House Speaker David Ralston, who has several small breweries in his district, and Senate President Pro Tem David Shafer, a frequent supporter of alcohol wholesalers, strongly encouraged the DOR to align its policy with the law\u2019s intent. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, we may have to,\u201d Ralston recently told the AJC.\n\nRead more: Emails: Georgia officials catered to distributors\u2019 wishes over those of craft brewers.\n\nCourtesy Galileo/University System of Georgia\n\nAn 1895 map of Milton County9. Will we see the return of Milton County and the end of DeKalb County\u2019s CEO gig?\n\nYes, your favorite effort to split Fulton County in two is back. Under a new measure introduced by state Rep. Brad Raffensperger, a Johns Creek Republican, voters statewide would decide if the state constitution should be amended to allow for the \u201cre-creation of a previously existing county which was merged into another county may be accomplished by law.\u201d What does that mean? Four words: Bring back Milton County. The proposal resurrects an old fight between white, affluent North Fultonites who believe a county of their own would put their tax dollars to better use and a more diverse South Fulton constituency that doesn\u2019t want to be left footing the bill for MARTA and Grady Memorial Hospital. The measure would require two-thirds approval from legislators, passage of a statewide referendum, and approval on the county\u2019s ballot.\n\nFulton won\u2019t be the only metro county facing big changes. In 2015, DeKalb\u2019s government has had a hellish year between the conviction of ex-CEO Burrell Ellis, the continued foibles of interim CEO Lee May, and a host of other corruption allegations. In the wake of that maelstrom, state lawmakers representing parts of the county are pushing to abolish the CEO position altogether. While Republicans from the county\u2019s northern end have long wanted a new form of local representation, state Rep. Scott Holcomb, Tucker a Democrat said he\u2019ll carry legislation intended to do away with the county\u2019s top position. Whether other DeKalb Democrats follow suit, especially ones in the county\u2019s southern parts, could determine his success.\n\n10. How will guns factor into the legislative session?\n\nTwo years ago, state lawmakers caused a international uproar by passing House Bill 60\u2014known as the \u201cguns everywhere\u201d bill\u2014that allows guns into unsecured parts of airports, bars, and churches. After a quiet year in 2015, gun lobbyists are seeking further expansion of their Second Amendment rights. \u201cWe\u2019d like the \u2018guns everywhere else\u2019 bill,\u201d said Georgia Carry Executive Director Jerry Henry. What would that look like? He wants to make it even easier to bring guns into churches, which currently must \u201copt-in\u201d to allowing firearms on their premises. In the wake of recent campus shootings across the country, Henry also expects to see another push to legalize campus carry, reviving a failed effort from two years ago. That effort could either gain momentum behind an overlooked 2015 campus carry measure from state Rep. Heath Clark, a freshman Republican from Warner Robins, or a forthcoming bill yet to be introduced.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, state Sen. Michael Rhett, a Marietta Democrat, wants to give judges the ability to restrict people getting a divorce from buying a gun. He\u2019s referred to his bill, inspired by the 2014 shooting of a Fulton County prosecutor by her estranged husband, as an \u201canti-domestic violence\u201d measure. State Rep. Keisha Waites, D-Atlanta, wants to require firearms safety training for anyone attempting to get a concealed weapon permit. Both of these bills, as with as all gun-control legislation, face uphill battles in a state known to promote Second Amendment rights. Don\u2019t be surprised, though, if a few more gun-control bills grab headlines, even if they have no chance of passing in a red state.\n\n11. Will AirBnb, the latest disruptive startup in Georgia, face major threats like Uber and Tesla did in recent years?\n\nWhen Uber, Tesla, and AirBnb arrived in Georgia, the startup companies all experienced a similar path: Disrupt an old way of doing business, grow wildly popular among new consumers, and face regulations by lawmakers rooted in tradition. Ridesharing companies like Uber, which in recent years faced a host of restrictions designed to protect the entrenched taxi industry, had to submit to a law requiring background checks for drivers. Tesla, the luxury electric carmaker, fared a little bit better: After facing pushback from car dealers over its direct sales model, the electric vehicle company convinced lawmakers to let them bypass a longstanding law requiring independent dealers to sell cars to consumers. Now it\u2019s AirBnb\u2019s turn. Tourism officials are angry that the short-term rental platform has gotten away with sidestepping hotel regulations. The company became the subject of a 2015 study committee that\u2019s considering potential regulations. What might they look like? A cap on the number of days each year that a residence could be rented\u2014potentially somewhere around two weeks\u2014 before the property would become taxed like traditional motels and hotels.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "News & Opinion,Uncategorized,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/01/1024px-Georgia_State_Capitol_dome_with_Gordon_statue-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Max Blau", "description": "Coming soon to the Capitol: The rift over school reforms, RFRA\u2019s return, MARTA\u2019s $8 billion pitch, Milton County redux, and more.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/gold-dome-preview-eleven-issues-to-watch-during-the-2016-legislative-session/", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Magazine", "description": "Coming soon to the Capitol: The rift over school reforms, RFRA\u2019s return, MARTA\u2019s $8 billion pitch, Milton County redux, and more.", "title": "Gold Dome Preview: Eleven issues to watch during the 2016 legislative session - Atlanta Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/01/1024px-Georgia_State_Capitol_dome_with_Gordon_statue-e1452268559824.jpg", "height": 750}, "updated_time": "2016-01-08T15:20:24-04:00", "url": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/gold-dome-preview-eleven-issues-to-watch-during-the-2016-legislative-session/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.221": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/01/1024px-Georgia_State_Capitol_dome_with_Gordon_statue-221x290.jpg", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-08 11:33:03", "sailthru.image.100": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/01/1024px-Georgia_State_Capitol_dome_with_Gordon_statue-100x120.jpg", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "Gold Dome Preview: Eleven issues to watch during the 2016 legislative session", "sailthru.image.400": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/01/1024px-Georgia_State_Capitol_dome_with_Gordon_statue-400x400.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Airbnb,budget,Craft Beer,David Ralston,Dekalb County,education,Fulton County,Georgia State Capitol,Gold Dome,guns,healthcare,MARTA,milton county,Nathan Deal,Religious Freedom,RFRA,transit,News & Opinion,Uncategorized,News and Culture,", "article": {"section": "News & Opinion", "tag": "transit", "published_time": "2016-01-08T11:33:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T15:20:24-04:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/maxcblau"}, "news_keywords": "airbnb, budget, craft beer, david ralston, dekalb county, education, fulton county, georgia state capitol, gold dome, guns, healthcare, marta, milton county, nathan deal, religious freedom, rfra, transit", "sailthru.description": "Many more details will be revealed in the next few weeks.
