From the Wall Street Journal:

Beyoncé Releases Latest Album—Quietly

Can we please stop this? This wasn't some kind of stealth release. It was a brilliant use of viral marketing. Beyoncé and a few of her buddies "quietly" advertised the new album to about ten or twenty million of their closest friends, all of whom thought they were being let in on a secret and immediately went out and crashed the iTunes server farm. It was genius. Even if it only works once, it's genius.

But quiet? Only if you have a five-year-old's understanding of human nature. To misquote everyone's favorite America-hating superhero, it was an awfully loud kind of quiet, man.
