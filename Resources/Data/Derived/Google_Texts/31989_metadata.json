Aaron Schock of Peoria announced he would resign amid questions about whether he misspent taxpayer and campaign money and violated congressional ethics rules. A federal grand jury in Springfield has been interviewing his former aides as part of a criminal probe.\n\nVoters in central Illinois probably are still shaking their heads over Schock's fall from grace. But they have some work to do. The 18th Congressional District seat is open.\n\nFive candidates \u2014 three Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 want the job. They're running in a July 7 primary election; the winners will meet in a Sept. 10 general election.\n\nThese five have distinct backgrounds: a state senator and attorney, a tech manager, a writer and policy analyst, a teacher, a financial adviser.\n\nThey have at least one thing in common: They pledge to avoid the highflying, high-spending style of the last congressman. Schock's hometown newspaper, the Peoria Journal Star, once chastened him in an editorial with this question: \"Aaron Schock: Caviar congressman in meat-and-potatoes district?\"\n\nThe 18th District includes parts of Peoria, Bloomington, Springfield, Jacksonville, Quincy and Macomb. It's one of the most Republican-leaning districts in the state. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney won 61 percent of the vote there in 2012.\n\nSo who should replace Schock? The Tribune offers endorsements today.\n\nOur recommendation in the Republican primary is state Sen. Darin LaHood of Dunlap, the son of former congressman and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.\n\nA former federal prosecutor, Darin LaHood was appointed to the Senate seat in 2011.\n\nIn his relatively short time in the Senate, LaHood has established a record as a principled, independent conservative. He has pushed legislation to force elected officials to reveal more detail about their outside income and potential conflicts of interest. He has supported pension reform despite pressure from public-sector unions.\n\nHe would not be shy about challenging authority in Washington. Twice he has opposed Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno's bids to stay in charge of the Republican caucus because, he argued, the party needed to make a more forceful challenge to Democrats.\n\nLaHood says he is grounded in the district. He doesn't spend nights in Springfield when the legislature's in session. He drives to his home just north of Peoria to be with his family.\n\nTwo other Republicans are running. Michael Flynn of Quincy, who studies conservative policy, advises candidates and writes and edits for Breitbart News Network, the conservative news outlet. Flynn says he supports immigration reform, so long as it starts with closing the border.\n\n\"You physically shut it down. Fencing, yes. Then you can have a discussion about immigration policy. It's insane to have this discussion while you have a completely open border that you don't even know who's coming across,\" Flynn says.\n\nDonald Rients of Benson is a tech manager for an insurance company who says the national debt is his top concern.\n\nDemocrats will choose between history teacher Robert Mellon of Quincy and Adam Lopez, a Springfield school board member and financial adviser.\n\nOur endorsement goes to Mellon, a captain in the Army Reserve. Among his top priorities: expand veterans programs such as the GI Bill and improve the veterans health care system.\n\nMellon says improving infrastructure is also critical, and he would be open to replenishing the Highway Trust Fund with a gradual increase in taxes. Lopez says the trust fund can be restored by closing offshore tax loopholes, not by raising general tax revenues. He strongly supports the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSpecial elections can be difficult to predict. Turnout tends to be low, which is likely to be the case for an election held the Tuesday after a holiday weekend.\n\nVoters, make the effort. And hope that, this time, your choice remembers the 18th is a meat-and-potatoes district.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Endorsements for Aaron Schock's former seat", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "In a brief letter released March 17, then-U.S. Rep.
