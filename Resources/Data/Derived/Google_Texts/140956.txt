The water crisis in Flint, Mich. has forced authorities to take quick action to provide safe water to residents and has pushed health care systems within the city limits to take further steps to guarantee their patients and staff have access to a safe water supply.

In April 2014, the decision was made to tap into the Flint River for the city’s water supply. That decision has since been reversed and the city is now reconnected to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s system, but the discovery of elevated levels of lead in the city’s piping system is still cause for concern.

H&HN’s sister publication Health Facilities Management spoke with hospitals in the area to see what they’re doing to combat the problem, here is what one had to say. Flint’s Hurley Medical Center states: “Per the emergency advisory issued by the Genesee County Health Department, water should only be used for consumption if it has been tested to assure that it does not have elevated levels of lead. Hurly Medical Center began conducting lead level testing on its water when the lead concerns were first brought up. The results of our testing has shown that our water can be used by our staff and patients. To assure the water remains appropriate for use, testing will continue.”
