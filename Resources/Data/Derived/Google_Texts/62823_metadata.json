Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants the public to be fully aware of the \u201cpotential danger\u201d that awaits anyone looking to enjoy smokeless marijuana.\n\nThamba, who had no history of alcohol abuse, drug use, or mental illness, obtained the marijuana cookie from a 23-year-old friend he had been visiting Colorado with. As directed by the sales clerk at the marijuana dispensary, Thamba only consumed a small piece of the cookie. However, he consumed the rest of the cookie after 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nAn ingredients list on the cookie read: \"65 mg THC/6.5 servings (THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal psychoactive agent in cannabis).\" The label also stated: \"This marijuana product has not been tested for contaminants or potency.\"\n\nThamba\u2019s friends reported that he started to act hostile and speak erratically approximately two hours after eating the entire cookie. Three and a half hours after eating the first piece of the cookie, Thamba leaped to his death, becoming the first reported death associated with the consumption of marijuana edibles. Thamba\u2019s autopsy listed \u201cmarijuana intoxication\u201d as a chief contributing factor.\n\n\u201cThis case illustrates a potential danger associated with recreational edible marijuana use,\u201d the CDC said in a statement. \u201cSome studies have suggested an association between cannabis and psychological disturbances. Second to alcohol, marijuana is the most commonly used recreational drug in the United States, with an estimated 19.8 million past-month users during 2013. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to permit recreational use of marijuana under their state laws.\u201d\n\nAlthough Thamba\u2019s death is the first associated with marijuana edibles, it was most certainly not the last. Back in March, the family of Luke Goodman blamed the 23-year-old\u2019s suicide on peach tart candies containing 10mg of THC per piece of candy. Goodman\u2019s cousin, Caleb Fowler, said he began acting \u201cpretty weird and relatively incoherent\u201d a few hours after consuming five times the recommended dosage.\n\nGoodman\u2019s mother, Kim, said her son did not read the labels which stated: \u201cThe intoxicating effects of this product may be delayed by two or more hours. The standardized serving size for this product includes no more than 10mg.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was 100 percent the drugs,\u201d Kim Goodman told CBS Denver. \u201cIt was completely because of the drugs \u2014 he had consumed so much of it. It was completely out of character for Luke. There was no depression or anything that would leave us being concerned, nothing like that. I would love to see edibles taken off the market. I think edibles are so much more dangerous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cdc, highlights, dangers, marijuana, edibles, following, death, teen, denver", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The CDC highlights the \"potential dangers\" associated with consuming marijuana edibles.", "title": "CDC Warns Pot Edibles Are Highly Dangerous [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/cdc-highlights-dangers-marijuana-edibles-following-death-teen-denver-344912", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/28/marijuana-edibles.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The CDC highlights the \"potential dangers\" associated with consuming marijuana edibles.", "title": "CDC Warns Pot Edibles Are Highly Dangerous [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/cdc-highlights-dangers-marijuana-edibles-following-death-teen-denver-344912", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/28/marijuana-edibles.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/marijuana-edibles.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-28T12:17:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T12:17:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The CDC highlights the \"potential dangers\" associated with consuming marijuana edibles."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1e4\"", "article_summary": "The label also stated: \"This marijuana product has not been tested for contaminants or potency.\"\nThree and a half hours after eating the first piece of the cookie, Thamba leaped to his death, becoming the first reported death associated with the consumption of marijuana edibles.\n\u201cThis case illustrates a potential danger associated with recreational edible marijuana use,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.\nAs directed by the sales clerk at the marijuana dispensary, Thamba only consumed a small piece of the cookie.\nThamba, who had no history of alcohol abuse, drug use, or mental illness, obtained the marijuana cookie from a 23-year-old friend he had been visiting Colorado with."}
