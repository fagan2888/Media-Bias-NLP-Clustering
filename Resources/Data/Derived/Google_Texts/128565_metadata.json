But until now, most Americans did not realize just how bad the situation is \u2014 hundreds of thousands of people, including children, needlessly lose their lives every year because new, breakthrough drugs that have worked in clinical trials and are legal in other countries are not approved here. In fact, the number of people dying is increasing, because the FDA keeps increasing the delays \u2014 despite its false claims that it approves drugs faster than it really does. The FDA continues to demand more data and statistical certainty from clinical trials, making them \u201clarger, longer and more complex.\u201d\n\nThe agency insists that unless a treatment has a high success rate, it should not be approved. But everyone is different; some people respond differently than others to medications. Peter Huber of the Manhattan Institute explains, \u201cThere is no such thing as breast cancer,\u201d because scientists \u201chave discovered at least ten distinct variations.\u201d Therefore, indiscriminately testing one drug on all breast cancer patients is going to have skewed success results.\n\nThe FDA isn\u2019t even delaying approval in order to establish the safety of a drug, merely to measure its effectiveness. This is cruelly unfair. As Darcy puts it, people with terminal illnesses like Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease (ALS) or cancer would rather have a 50 percent chance of being cured than a 100 percent chance of dying from it. One doctor sarcastically stated, \u201cThese people would be happy to go to their own funeral five years from now rather than a year from now.\u201d\n\nDarcy relays the stories of several people with different terminal illnesses who went to great lengths despite the FDA to obtain these new groundbreaking treatments. Some moved overseas, while others persisted until they were allowed to participate in the clinical trials. Most of them were not rich so it was a difficult, uphill task, but the treatments ultimately worked.\n\nPerhaps most disturbing of all is what I think should really be called child abuse. Darcy lists the high numbers of children who die every year of terminal illnesses, who could have been saved had they been given these treatments. Even the clinical studies are cruel to children. Some are driven by their parents hundreds of miles every month or so for the chance of just a handful to participate in a trial, only to be part of the placebo group that does not receive the real drug. Darcy calls this \u201cmorally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIt is fascinating learning about the new treatments. One of the new methods that is working effectively to kill cancer and other serious illnesses involves sending a virus into the patient\u2019s body to infect the cancer cells. If the virus doesn\u2019t kill the cancer cells first, the body\u2019s immune system will kick in and kill them. Thus, HIV is being used to cure leukemia. Other drugs in the works will combat depression, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, PTSD, mesothelioma and Alzheimer\u2019s. Positive results have been achieved already reversing Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, leukemia and more \u2014 but virtually none of these drugs have been approved by the FDA.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t know about these successful but unapproved new treatments, because their doctors aren\u2019t telling them. One pediatric doctor told Darcy that most of them are too afraid of retaliation to stand up to the FDA.\n\nIn order to get around the FDA, Darcy and allies have worked to get Right to Try legislationpassed at the state level. So far, 24 states have approved of the legislation, which lets terminally ill patients try new drugs before the FDA has approved them if they meet certain minimal criteria.\n\nOne way Darcy recommends reforming the FDA is to implement \u201ca policy of regulatory reciprocity with countries that have a proven record of approving safe and effective drugs \u2014 including the European Union, Canada, Japan and Australia.\u201d People from Britain are surprised when they learn they have access to drugs that Americans can only dream of having years down the road.\n\nIt is heartwarming to think of all the Americans who will read this book and use it as a guide to figure out how to obtain these prohibited lifesaving treatments. My brother died from leukemia in 2009; had my brother had one of these non-FDA approved options, he might still be with us today. In 2012, a seven-year-old girl named Emily Whitehead sought experimental treatment for leukemia. Doctors \u201cgenetically engineered her own blood to kill cancer,\u201d known as T-cell immunotherapy. The leukemia completely disappeared and she has been in remission ever since.\n\nFortunately, considering how dry of a topic this could be, Darcy has written it as a series of human interest stories about the patients involved, making it impossible to put down. She should be commended for not only shining light on one of the most horrific problems in society, but for saving many lives. Dr. Jonathan Bell, an award-winning scientist at the Center for Innovative Cancer Research at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada, perhaps summarized the problem the best: \u201cIt\u2019s unethical to withhold these treatments if there\u2019s a potential there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Darcy Olsen, CEO and president of the Goldwater Institute, has written a must-read book for anyone facing a serious ailment, The Right to Try: How the Federal Government Prevents Americans from Getting the Life-Saving Treatments They Need..05/27/2016 8:21:24AM EST.", "author": "Rachel Alexander", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Darcy Olsen, CEO and president of the Goldwater Institute, has written a must-read book for anyone facing a serious ailment, The Right to Try: How the Federal Government Prevents Americans from Getting the Life-Saving Treatments They Need.", "title": "Right to Try: The FDA Has the Blood of Millions of Americans on its Hands", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/rachelalexander/2016/01/11/right-to-try-the-fda-has-the-blood-of-millions-of-americans-on-its-hands-n2102822", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/206/2014-06-20T124437Z_2_LYNXMPEA5J0H7_RTROPTP_3_CHINA-PHARMACEUTICALS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Darcy Olsen, CEO and president of the Goldwater Institute, has written a must-read book for anyone facing a serious ailment, The Right to Try: How the Federal Government Prevents Americans from Getting the Life-Saving Treatments They Need.", "title": "Right to Try: The FDA Has the Blood of Millions of Americans on its Hands", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/rachelalexander/2016/01/11/right-to-try-the-fda-has-the-blood-of-millions-of-americans-on-its-hands-n2102822", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/206/2014-06-20T124437Z_2_LYNXMPEA5J0H7_RTROPTP_3_CHINA-PHARMACEUTICALS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Right to Try: The FDA Has the Blood of Millions of Americans on its Hands, Rachel Alexander, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In order to get around the FDA, Darcy and allies have worked to get Right to Try legislationpassed at the state level.\nDoctors \u201cgenetically engineered her own blood to kill cancer,\u201d known as T-cell immunotherapy.\nThe FDA isn\u2019t even delaying approval in order to establish the safety of a drug, merely to measure its effectiveness.\nOne pediatric doctor told Darcy that most of them are too afraid of retaliation to stand up to the FDA.\nIf the virus doesn\u2019t kill the cancer cells first, the body\u2019s immune system will kick in and kill them."}
