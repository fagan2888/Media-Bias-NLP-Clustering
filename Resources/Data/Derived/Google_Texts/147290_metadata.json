To win GOP primaries, they have to bash government health care programs.\n\nAccording to former Texas Medical Association executive Kim Ross, the physician lawmakers may sincerely hold such views, even though health care accounts for about one-third of state spending and government is a huge player in their economic sector.\n\n\u201cMost physicians are at best apolitical and tend to vote their ZIP code rather than their professional interests,\u201d said Ross, the doctor group\u2019s top lobbyist from 1986 to 2002. \u201cThey are not concentrated in the 5th Ward [in inner-city Houston] or a South Texas colonia.\u201d\n\nFormer Sen. Bob Deuell of Greenville said that a few years ago, there was only \u201ca little hope\u201d the Republican-controlled Legislature would consider coverage-expansion proposals.\n\nAlthough Texas leads the nation in the share of its population lacking coverage, such debates have died, he said.\n\n\u201cThe newer people can\u2019t really discuss the ins and outs of health care,\u201d said Deuell, a family doctor. \u201cThey just say they\u2019re against it.\u201d\n\nJohn Davidson, health care analyst for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said doctors have widely varying views on the merits of Obamacare\u2019s proposed Medicaid expansion, which state GOP leaders have fiercely resisted.\n\nMany are skeptical of the state\u2019s Medicaid program and disillusioned with how the Affordable Care Act has spawned purchases of doctors\u2019 practices by hospital chains and mergers of huge national health insurance companies, he said.\n\n\u201cIndividual physicians are a lot more ambivalent about the [act] than, say, people who run managed-care companies or hospital system administrators, who generally tend to be for it because it benefits them and what they do,\u201d he said.\n\nRichmond GOP Rep. John Zerwas, is an anesthesiologist who has experience as a hospital administrator. Zerwas has advocated trying to negotiate a \u201cTexas solution\u201d that would allow the state to draw down scores of billions in federal Medicaid funds but make demands of the newly covered adults, who would have private coverage and health savings accounts.\n\n\u201cWe ought to have a real vibrant conversation about that and consider what the pros and cons of doing it are,\u201d he said.\n\nZerwas acknowledged, though, that he\u2019s outnumbered \u2014 not just in the GOP caucus but the \u201cwhite coat\u201d caucus.\n\nAccording to the newspaper\u2019s review of a 2014 compilation by the American Medical Association, 17 states have no doctors in their legislatures.\n\nTexas has two in the Senate, four in the House. The Texas Legislature ranks third in its percentage of doctor lawmakers \u2013 3.3 percent. Only in Nevada and Utah did docs wield a bigger presence \u2014 4.8 percent in each. However, Utah has only five doctor lawmakers; and Nevada, three. Their legislatures have 104 and 63 members, respectively, compared with 181 in Texas.\n\nFollow Robert T.
