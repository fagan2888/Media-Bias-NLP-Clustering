Brian Lindsey, and that the body was in that location for several months. Gross Reservoir is about a 15-mile drive southwest from Boulder via Flagstaff Road.\n\nThe man's name has not yet been released by the Boulder County Coroner's Office.\n\nHikers reported seeing the body above the north shore of the reservoir at about 6 p.m. Saturday, but were unable to pinpoint the location as they were hiking off trail.\n\nMembers of the Boulder Emergency Squad, Longmont Emergency Unit, Rocky Mountain Rescue, Boulder County Coroner's Office and the Boulder County Sheriff's Office responded.\n\nThe body was in a location that was difficult to reach, according to Lindsey, so rescue workers waited until daylight to find the body and investigate the scene.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27990578/boulder-county-rescue-team-recovers-body-found-at", "sailthru.author": "By Daily Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27990578:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-26T12:26:16-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Rescue crews today recovered the body of a man found by a  group of hikers on Saturday evening at Gross Reservoir.", "title": "Boulder County rescue team recovers body found at Gross Reservoir", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27990578/boulder-county-rescue-team-recovers-body-found-at", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-04-26T12:26:48-0600", "endDate": "2016-04-25T12:26:16-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Daily Camera", "pubDate": "2015-04-26T12:28:26-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-26T12:26:16-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County rescue team recovers body found at Gross Reservoir", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "description": "Rescue crews today recovered the body of a man found by a  group of hikers on Saturday evening at Gross Reservoir.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_27990578/boulder-county-rescue-team-recovers-body-found-at", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Rescue crews today recovered the body of a man found by a  group of hikers on Saturday evening at Gross Reservoir.", "title": "Boulder County rescue team recovers body found at Gross Reservoir"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc652\"", "article_summary": "Members of the Boulder Emergency Squad, Longmont Emergency Unit, Rocky Mountain Rescue, Boulder County Coroner's Office and the Boulder County Sheriff's Office responded.\nThe initial findings on the scene indicate the death wasn't suspicious, according to Boulder County Sgt.\nSheriff's Office: Death not suspiciousRescue crews today recovered the body of a man found by a group of hikers on Saturday evening at Gross Reservoir.\nThe man's name has not yet been released by the Boulder County Coroner's Office.\nThe body was in a location that was difficult to reach, according to Lindsey, so rescue workers waited until daylight to find the body and investigate the scene."}
