Spokespeople either said no one was available to talk or that there was \u201cnothing to announce today.\u201d\n\nIn the past 10 months after merger talks broke down between Beaumont and Henry Ford Health System, Beaumont officials have been updating their long-range strategic plan with an eye to eventually select another merger partner.\n\nHenry Ford officials also said last year they believe they need to grow into a larger health care organization to weather changes under the Affordable Care Act and increased competition from other health systems, including for-profit DMC, which has been slowing gaining market share the past two years.\n\nEarlier this year, Beaumont CEO Gene Michalski provided a statement to Crain\u2019s about Beaumont\u2019s ambitions. He confirmed Beaumont has been talking with several health systems about various business arrangements.\n\n\u201cBecause of changes in implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we continue to update our strategic plan,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cAs part this planning, we have been talking with other health care organizations that are also preparing (for) and adapting to health reform. These are confidential discussions so we can\u2019t provide names. If and when we decide to align with another organization, we\u2019ll certainly let you know.\u201d\n\nLast fall, sources said the Oakwood board voted to seek a merger partner and Skokie, Ill.-based Kaufman Hall was hired to seek interested parties, several sources told Crain\u2019s. However, Oakwood CEO Brian Connolly denied Kaufman had been hired.\n\n\u201cI have had continual discussions with every health care system leader throughout state of Michigan,\u201d said Connolly in a previous interview with Crain\u2019s.\n\nHe added the discussions did not include merger or acquisition. \u201cThere are no talks with Tenet or DMC,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nBut over the past several months, sources, who asked to remain anonymous, told Crain\u2019s they have inside knowledge that Oakwood is interested in seeking a hospital merger partner to help it navigate health care reform.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Botsford CEO Paul LaCasse, D.O., said this about a possible merger with Beaumont:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act provides opportunity for 330-bed Botsford Health Care to create strategic affiliations and partnerships that may generate even greater value for the communities we serve.\n\n\u201cThese are dynamic strategic considerations that are necessary to adapt to the health care reform agenda. If and when Botsford Health Care chooses to align with other organizations, an announcement will be made.\u201d\n\nGarden City Hospital, the area\u2019s third largest independent hospital with 220 beds, also has agreed to be acquired by Prime Health Care, an Ontario, Calif.-based for-profit management company. Prime owns 25 hospitals in six states. The two companies signed an agreement last month.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is reviewing the sale.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"description": "Talk again is circulating about a mega-hospital merger or alliance arrangement in Southeast Michigan.
