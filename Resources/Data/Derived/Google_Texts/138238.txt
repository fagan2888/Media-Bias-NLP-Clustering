According to unofficial results, Harper garnered 2,381 of the 3,402 votes cast, or 70 percent. Foley received 1,021 votes, or 30 percent.

"I am very honored and humbled by the show of support by voters," Harper said. "I want to thank everyone who participated in the election process today, and I look forward to serving. It will be an honor and a privilege to serve another four years for District 61."

Harper, 56, faces no Democratic opposition in the Nov. 4 general election and, barring a successful write-in campaign, he will continue representing the district that includes portions of Tuscaloosa, Pickens and a small piece of Greene County.

Harper has worked as a job recruiter/economic developer in West Alabama for the past 28 years, including serving as the retail development director for the city of Northport until 2013. He was first elected to the Alabama State House in 2006 and was re-elected in 2010.

During the campaign, both Harper and Foley said attracting new industry and jobs to the district was a top priority. Harper also said there was too much federal overreach, using Obamacare as an example of a federal law that needs addressing while, at the same time, calling for a boost in resources for military veterans.

"We've got some folks out there suffering and not being taken care of," Harper said. "We need to do everything we can to help those folks who have gone to protect us on foreign soil."

Foley, 45, is a Northport resident and social studies teacher at Southview Middle School. He has served in the Army National Guard since 1987 and is a captain in the Mississippi Army National Guard. He was deployed to Iraq in 2009-10. It was his first run for office.

According to the secretary of state's website, Harper raised $121,950 and spent $87,892.42 in the primary campaign. Foley reported that he raised $10,000 and had $225.76 in "other receipts" and spent $9,250.
