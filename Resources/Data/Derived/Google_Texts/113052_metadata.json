REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4133204\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln enjoyed a bawdy joke here and there, President Barack Obama said Thursday.\n\nDuring an appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Herd\u201d with Colin Cowherd, Obama responded to Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s contention that President Lincoln would not have appeared on a Funny or Die\u2019s \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d with Zach Galifianakis, as Obama did earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, if you read back on Lincoln, he loved telling the occasional bawdy joke and you know being out among regular folks,\u201d Obama told Cowherd. \u201cAnd one of the hardest things about being president is being in this bubble that is artificial and unless you make a conscious effort, you start sounding like some Washington stiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you\u2019ve got to consciously try to get out of that if you want to remind yourself of the wonderful people that you \u2018re supposed to be serving who have a sense of humor and aren\u2019t thinking every day about position papers,\u201d he continued.\n\nLast week O\u2019Reilly took Obama to task in his Talking Points Memo for appearing on \u201cFunny or Die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a problem with it in general, but I think the timing hurts Mr. Obama. The economy continues to be problematic and Putin is clearly testing the president. It looks like Putin believes the president is a lightweight. Will a comedy video counter that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for PR and if Carney wanted to go on \u2018Funny or Die,\u2019 fine, but should the president of the United States? All I can tell is you is Abe Lincoln would not have done it. There comes a point when serious times call for serious action,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\nObama added in the ESPN interview that he makes such appearances to encourage more people to sign up for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have health insurance you are vulnerable to financial hardship or medical hardship,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf you get sick or you have an accident or like me, you\u2019re an aging jock, and you think you can still play basketball and you pop an Achilles,\u201d he said, going on to repeat that if people sign up they could find a plan for less than their cell phone or cable bill. (RELATED: Obamacare is definitely NOT as cheap as your cell phone bill)\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure people take a look at it before the end of the month,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "President Abraham Lincoln enjoyed a bawdy joke here and there, President Obama said Thursday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Abraham Lincoln enjoyed a bawdy joke here and there, President Barack Obama said Thursday.
