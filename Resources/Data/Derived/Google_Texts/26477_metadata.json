Most likely, you won\u2019t hesitate even a moment before answering \u201cyes, of course.\u201d Now, let\u2019s tweak the question and the circumstances:\n\nDoes a 17-year-old, with the permission and backing of her parent, have the right to refuse an unwanted medical treatment?\n\nIn Connecticut, this question is under debate as a 17-year-old patient, Cassandra Fortin, battles child services, which has taken custody of her and now is forcing her to undergo chemotherapy, a recommended, though unwanted treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s refusing chemo because of the poison toxins that she does not want in her body... this is her human rights\u2026 to not put poison in her body,\u201d Jackie Fortin, her mother, told FOX News. \u201cHer rights have been taken away; she has been forced to put chemo in her body right now as we speak.\u201d\n\nHaving appealed the ruling, Cassandra and her mother await a hearing of their case scheduled for Thursday at the Connecticut Supreme Court in Hartford. Mother and daughter, who is receiving treatment at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, will be represented by a public defender. If Cassandra is successful, her treatments will end immediately. While the question of her constitutional rights is most important, her rights as a patient also matter and should be addressed now that the Affordable Care Act has begun to change the health care landscape.\n\nPatient\u2019s Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1995, the Association of American Physicians & Surgeons adopted a Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights which guarantees various freedoms, including \u201cto refuse medical treatment even if it is recommended by their physician(s).\u201d Interestingly, the bill of rights also guarantees patients the right \u201cto refuse third-party interference in their medical care, and to be confident that their actions in seeking or declining medical care will not result in third-party-imposed penalties for patients or physicians.\u201d It seems strange, then, that the AAPS has not taken a stand or, at the very least, issued a statement about Cassandra\u2019s impending court case.\n\nThe bare facts of Cassandra\u2019s legal case, taken from a state document, are these: Doctors diagnosed Cassandra with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September 2014 and recommended chemotherapy as part of her treatment. Cassandra decided against the treatment, and her mother supported her decision. In November, a state court granted the Department of Children and Families (DCF) temporary custody of Cassandra and directed her mother to cooperate with medical care as recommended by doctors. Initially, Cassandra and her mother complied with the order and Cassandra received two chemotherapy treatments in November. Subsequently, Cassandra ran away from home to avoid further treatment and then refused treatment when she returned.\n\n\"It's a question of fundamental constitutional rights \u2014 the right to have a say over what happens to your body \u2014 and the right to say to the government 'you can't control what happens to my body,'\" attorney Michael S. Taylor, who represents Cassandra, told Fox News. He noted that neither supreme court, the state\u2019s, nor that of the United States has ruled on this matter. A spokesman for the Connecticut Children's Medical Center told the news service that the hospital is working closely with DCF on the matter.\n\nSome effort has been made to compare what happens to people who refuse chemotherapy with what happens to those who undergo treatment. This study and this one both find the risk of an additional cancer \u201cevent\u201d and/or death to be higher for patients who refuse treatment. However, the first study is not very comprehensive and neither study includes Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chemo, lymphoma, patient bill of rights, constitutional rights", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "With the support of her mother, a 17-year-old Connecticut patient battles child services, which is forcing her to undergo unwanted chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "title": "Connecticut Conundrum: Can A 17-Year-Old Refuse Chemo?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/connecticut-forces-teen-girl-undergo-chemo-violatation-patient-bill-rights-316550", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/06/chemotherapy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the support of her mother, a 17-year-old Connecticut patient battles child services, which is forcing her to undergo unwanted chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "title": "Connecticut Conundrum: Can A 17-Year-Old Refuse Chemo?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/connecticut-forces-teen-girl-undergo-chemo-violatation-patient-bill-rights-316550", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/06/chemotherapy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/06/chemotherapy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-06T16:39:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-06T16:39:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "With the support of her mother, a 17-year-old Connecticut patient battles child services, which is forcing her to undergo unwanted chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin's lymphoma."}, "article_summary": "This study and this one both find the risk of an additional cancer \u201cevent\u201d and/or death to be higher for patients who refuse treatment.\nDo we have the right to refuse medical treatments we do not want?\nMother and daughter, who is receiving treatment at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, will be represented by a public defender.\nSome effort has been made to compare what happens to people who refuse chemotherapy with what happens to those who undergo treatment.\nInitially, Cassandra and her mother complied with the order and Cassandra received two chemotherapy treatments in November."}
