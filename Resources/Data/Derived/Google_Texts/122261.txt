Bill Maher really is one sick puppy.

On HBO’s Real Time Friday, the host asked the federal government to legalize marijuana so that he could be able to hand it out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween (video follows with transcript and commentary):

BILL MAHER: New Rule: Now that a record 58 percent of Americans support the legalization of marijuana, the federal government has to hurry up and do something about it. Come on guys, I have to decide what I'm handing out for Halloween.

Maybe it’s exactly for this reason the federal government SHOULDN’T legalize marijuana.

Now I know in Maher’s view this is just a joke.

However, he and I both grew up during a time when sick people were putting things like LSD and razor blades in Halloween candy.

As such, the thought of morons handing out pot to kids should be offensive to more than 58 percent of Americans.
