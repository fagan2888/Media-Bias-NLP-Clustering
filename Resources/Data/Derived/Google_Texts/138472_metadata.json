Then, there are those people who take things a step further. In more than one instance, for example, people have claimed that drinking urine will keep you slim, energized, and looking young. But before you go judging these people for being weird and crazy, look at these four celebrities who also practiced, at one point or another, out-of-the-ordinary health routines \u2014 of course, they too might just be weird crazy people.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones\u2019 Hoppy Conditioner\n\nA little conditioner, some coconut oil maybe. These are the products most people would turn to for hair care. For Catherine Zeta-Jones, though, beer does the trick, too. In a 2009 interview, she said that she washed her hair with beer and honey, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cI do condition my hair with honey and beer,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI smell like the bottom of a beer barrel for days afterward, but it\u2019s very good for the hair.\u201d\n\nThe UK-born actress is most famous for her roles in Ocean\u2019s Twelve, Chicago, and Entrapment, as well as being married to Michael Douglas \u2014 speculation that Douglas got throat cancer from human papilloma virus through Zeta-Jones might have caused them to split.\n\nWhile it may sound strange, there are actual benefits to using beer in hair. In fact, there are benefits to using it on skin and in baths, too. Its low acidity tightens hair follicles, and removes dirt and grease, while the yeast within helps fight acne. As a hair conditioner, mix one cup of warm beer \u2014 might want to try a better quality one, at that \u2014 and one teaspoon of jojoba oil. Use it after your normal shampoo. Also, look here for more beer beauty tips.\n\nTeri Hatcher\u2019s Crimson Baths\n\nSticking to the subject of using alcohol for more than putting it in our stomachs, Teri Hatcher, famous for her roles in Desperate Houswives, Coraline, and 007: Tomorrow Never Dies, pours one out for softer skin. Rather than a bubble bath, she takes a wine bath. \u201cTeri Hatcher is one of an increasing number who has started pouring a glass of wine into her bath every day,\u201d a source told the Daily Telegraph, according to Star Pulse. \u201cShe would never drink it, but she claims bathing in it keeps her skin soft.\u201d\n\nRed wine has antioxidants that certainly benefit the body, as well as tartaric acid, \u201can alpha hydroxyl agent that can exfoliate,\u201d Lezandra Berchik, an esthetician at Bliss Spa in Los Angeles, told Women\u2019s Health magazine. But anyone who wants to try it should take caution as it will not only take more than a few baths to start seeing benefits, but the wine may also irritate small scratches on the skin.\n\nSnooki\u2019s Cat Obsession Goes Too Far\n\nThough some may scoff at the thought of Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi \u2014 and for almost every reason \u2014 it looks like she\u2019s matured a lot since her binge-drinking, drunken days on MTV\u2019s loved-to-be-hated (and vice-versa) Jersey Shore. For some people though, she\u2019ll always be a joke, and the fact that she uses cat litter as an exfoliant doesn\u2019t help her case.\n\nDuring an interview with Conan O\u2019Brien, she talks about her book Confessions of a Guidette, in which she claims to use \u201cclean\u201d cat litter to exfoliate her skin as an alternative to other more expensive facial cleansers. \u201cSome exfoliants have rocks in them, and it makes your skin really smooth,\u201d she said. \u201cCat litter is like a substitute for that.\u201d When O\u2019Brien asks her if she\u2019s actually tried it, she says she has, and that the fact she hasn\u2019t \u201cbroken out\u201d yet has to mean it works.\n\nBerchik told Women\u2019s Health, however, that it\u2019s probably best not to use cat litter. Although the texture might be similar to that of a mud mask, they are too large for using on skin. \u201cThese particles can cause micro scratches, which can lead to inflammation and blotchiness,\u201d she said. Additionally, the silica that absorbs moisture in the litter will do the same on the skin, causing dehydration. She suggests using plain baking soda instead.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hair care, skin care, weird health tips, celebrity health tips, celebrity health routines, weird celebrity health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Some people might be called weird for the things they do to maintain health, but celebrities are in on the weirdness, too.
