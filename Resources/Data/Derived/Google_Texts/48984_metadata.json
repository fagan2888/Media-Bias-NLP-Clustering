John Barrasso John BarrassoOvernight Healthcare: House loosens pesticide rules to fight Zika | A GOP bill that keeps some of ObamaCare | More proof of pending premium hikes GOP senator: Obama used Zika money for climate fund Member of Senate GOP leadership to lead platform committee MORE (R-Wyo.), who is leading the Senate GOP\u2019s response to King v. Burwell, said Republicans will be willing to strike a deal with Obama to ensure that the 7.5 million people who stand to lose their subsidies are protected, at least until the 2016 elections.\n\nBut in return, they would demand that Obama to do something he has long resisted: nix the employer and individual mandates for insurance coverage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIs the president going to say, \u2018Tough, I\u2019m going to veto that?\u2019 \u201d Barrasso said in an interview in his Dirksen office. \u201cThere will be, as part of that [deal], things we want to have happen.\u201d\n\nThe GOP is far from a consensus about how to react to a potential conservative victory in the case, just two months out from an expected ruling at the end of June. So far, Republicans have put forward more than a half-dozen proposals that they described as ObamaCare alternatives.\n\nThe common thread in those plans is some kind of temporary aid for people who could lose their subsidies, which Barrasso said would be the crucial bargaining chip in a deal with Obama.\n\nBut, in the event the justices rule against the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will offer a simpler solution \u2014 passing a bill to fix the few sentences of the statute that are under scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe president can say, \u2018Here\u2019s our one-page bill,\u2019 \u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), who opposes the current congressional strategy, told a D.C. audience on Thursday.\n\nUnlike previous cases challenging the president\u2019s authority to pass ObamaCare, King v. Burwell rests on a close reading of only a few words of the law\u2019s text.\n\nThat puts Republicans at risk of taking the blame for losing billions of dollars in healthcare subsidies if they can\u2019t reach consensus on an alternative plan.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s going to stand up and say, \u2018Meet so-and-so who\u2019s got cancer. Meet so-and-so who\u2019s got diabetes,\u201d Jindal, a longtime foe of the healthcare law, said. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll say, \u2018These mean, stingy Republicans simply won\u2019t make a one-page change in the law.\u201d\n\nGOP leadership has not yet revealed its playbook for the court ruling, though leading members, such as Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have said they will have a plan in place in time for the ruling. Ryan is among three GOP House chairmen who are charged with crafting the chamber\u2019s official plan for King v. Burwell. No details of that plan, which has been shaped behind closed doors, have been shared.\n\nBarrasso is leading a separate group in the Senate, which has met regularly for several months and has involved about half of all Republican senators at various parts of the process.\n\nAny deal between Republicans in Congress and Obama would also send shockwaves through the GOP nationally, since it would mean the party is choosing not to push for a full repeal of the law.\n\nGOP leaders in Congress are under intense pressure from outside of Washington to use a court victory to force the president to veto a repeal of his healthcare law for the first time. The move would then help the law play a bigger role in the elections.\n\nRepublican leaders just put the finishing touches on a joint budget proposal calling for the repeal of ObamaCare. The language was a driver in the GOP efforts to pass the budget blueprint.\n\nBarrasso\u2019s support for a revision \u2014 rather than replacement \u2014 of the Affordable Care Act in the aftermath of a Supreme Court ruling favorable to the law\u2019s critics signals a shift in strategy among GOP leadership. It is likely to draw fire from conservative groups like Heritage Foundation that have stressed any response to King v. Burwell should be centered on repeal.\n\nBut Barrasso, leader of the Senate Republican Policy Committee said he doesn't want to dilute the party\u2019s bargaining power on ObamaCare by pushing another repeal effort.\n\n\u201cSince we don\u2019t have a willing partner in the White House, the best idea for actually fixing healthcare is not things that the president isn't going to sign. He\u2019s not going to work with us on this. So we have to have a Republican president in 2016,\u201d Barrasso said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A Supreme Court ruling against the law would give Republicans new leverage.", "description": "A Supreme Court ruling against the law would give Republicans new leverage.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A Supreme Court ruling against the law would give Republicans new leverage.", "title": "GOP prepares list of demands if justices rule against ObamaCare", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240734-gop-prepares-list-of-demands-id-hjustices-rule-against-obamacare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/barrassojohn_011715gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-01T12:10:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240734-gop-prepares-list-of-demands-id-hjustices-rule-against-obamacare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A Supreme Court ruling against the law would give Republicans new leverage.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP prepares list of demands if justices rule against ObamaCare"}, "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-01T12:10-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240734-gop-prepares-list-of-demands-id-hjustices-rule-against-obamacare", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-01T06:01-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "ObamaCare,John Barrasso, Barack Obama,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-01T06:01:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T12:10:45-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "GOP prepares list of demands if justices rule against ObamaCare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd40a\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIs the president going to say, \u2018Tough, I\u2019m going to veto that?\u2019 \u201d Barrasso said in an interview in his Dirksen office.\nRepublicans believe a Supreme Court ruling against ObamaCare this summer would give them leverage to force President Obama to scrap the healthcare law's central pillars.\nRyan is among three GOP House chairmen who are charged with crafting the chamber\u2019s official plan for King v.
