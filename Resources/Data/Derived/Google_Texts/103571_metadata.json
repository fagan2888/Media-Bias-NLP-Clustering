But students say the word \u201clynch\u201d has negative racial connotations and is upsetting to black students.\n\nIn a sense, they are right. But the building isn\u2019t named after \u201clynch\u201d the verb, but rather \u201cLynch\u201d the man. It seems fairly ridiculous to expect that a great many people\u2014or even a few people\u2014can\u2019t tell the difference. Nevertheless, according to pennlive.com:\n\nAt Friday's forum they acknowledged no known links between Dr. Clyde A. Lynch and the practice of \"Lynching\" but said as is, the building and last name harken back to a period in American history when Blacks were widely and arbitrarily killed by public hangings and \"Lynch Mobs.\" \u2026 And while student organizers at LVC indicate a willingness to compromise, many critics remained unappeased and wondering, sarcastically, whether public officials like U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, places like the White House or Lynchburg, Va. might be targeted for alteration next. \"I will not longer watch NFL football when John Lynch announces. Or watch Jane Lynch on TV. Too upsetting,\" a commenter named \"gmaven\" quipped.\n\nRenaming this building, obviously, is a silly thing to do\u2014far sillier than the proposed renaming of buildings dedicated to slave owners and racists.
