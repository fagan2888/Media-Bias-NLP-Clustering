The task is to mount a media attack, to stage it, cook a falsehood and embed it in the media agenda.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Is Upgrading Russia\u2019s Massive Cold War Battlecruisers\n\nHowever, the organization that Peskov said is behind the report is not a group he and Putin will be able to dismiss easily.
