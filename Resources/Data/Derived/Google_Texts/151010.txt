If the court were to deadlock, which is entirely likely given it will hear the case with just eight members, one possibility is that the decisions of the lower courts would stand. That would mean religious nonprofits in seven states would not have to comply with the law, while in the remaining few dozens states covered in rulings would. That's problematic.

That’s not ideal, says David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University’s law school. “The Supreme Court normally tries to resolve circuit splits because they don’t want federal laws interpreted differently in different parts of the country,” he said.

The other possibility in the case of a deadlock is that the Supreme Court will hold over a decision until a justice with the deciding vote is finally confirmed. Which potentially could mean another year or more of limbo. Despite Sen. Orrin Hatch's assurances that that would be Antonin Scalia's wishes, a year of chaos in the federal judiciary on issues this important is not a good thing.

But that's not going to stop Republicans from making it happen. They want to maximize disfunction in every branch of government, and have pretty well succeeded at that so far. Only in their wildest dreams could they extend breaking government to the Supreme Court, and now that's in their grasp.
