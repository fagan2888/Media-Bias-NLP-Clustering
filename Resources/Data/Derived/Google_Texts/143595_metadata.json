Six in ten children are regularly beaten by their caregivers. Half of all girls between the ages of 15 and 19 believe a man is \u201cjustified\u201d in hitting his wife. Nearly one in five homicide victims are children.\n\nThose are just a few of the findings in a new report from UNICEF that details the \u201cshocking prevalence\u201d of violence and abuse against children around the world. The study \u2014 which represents the largest-ever compilation of information on the scope of child abuse \u2014 draws on data from 190 countries, and concludes this type of violence has been so normalized that many children are growing up with the assumption it\u2019s just the way the world is supposed to work.\n\n\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know until now was the extent of the problem,\u201d Geeta Rao Gupta, UNICEF\u2019s deputy executive director, told the Associated Press. \u201cToo many victims, perpetrators and bystanders see it as normal, and when violence goes unnoticed and unreported we fuel the belief among children that it is normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s partly because children are typically being abused by the family members and authority figures who are supposed to protect them. With the exception of some countries in Latin America, where the child homicide rate is the highest in the world and children are fleeing to the U.S. border to escape murder, the violence inflicted on children is not necessarily a result of wartime or political upheaval. \u201cIt occurs in places where children should be safe, their homes, schools and communities,\u201d UNICEF\u2019s executive director, Anthony Lake, noted in a statement.\n\nFor instance, among the teen girls who reported they had been subject to \u201csome form of physical violence\u201d since the age of 15, most of them said their assailants were close family members. In countries like India and Zambia, more than 70 percent of victims said their current or former romantic partners were the ones who abused them. Most of those girls never report their assaults.\n\nConfronting violence against children, the UN agency says, involves challenging the cultural norms that have allowed it to flourish for so long. For example, the report finds that about the same portion of boys and girls around the world \u2014 nearly 50 percent \u2014 believe there are cases when it\u2019s acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. Previous research in the field has found that unhealthy attitudes toward women take root at a young age, and these dynamics are so deeply entrenched that young people simply assume that sexual violence is inevitable.\n\nOfficials from the UN agency say that the sobering statistics in their report should compel governments to more seriously address these issues. A separate UNICEF report released this week offers additional solutions for ending violence against children: educating caregivers about alternatives to corporal punishment, giving children the resources to seek support, expanding access to child welfare services, passing laws to protect children, and continuing to collect data about the scope of the problem.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "According to UNICEF, endemic levels of physical and emotional abuse are inflicted on children each day.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "According to UNICEF, endemic levels of physical and emotional abuse are inflicted on children each day.", "title": "New Report Details \u2018Shocking\u2019 Levels Of Global Violence Against Children", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/05/3563747/un-report-violence-children/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP703773967436.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to UNICEF, endemic levels of physical and emotional abuse are inflicted on children each day.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP703773967436-321x214.jpg", "title": "New Report Details \u2018Shocking\u2019 Levels Of Global Violence Against Children", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP703773967436.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP703773967436.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-05T12:11:17+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health New Report Details \u2018Shocking\u2019 Levels Of Global Violence Against Children CREDIT: AP Photo/Khin Maung WinOne in ten girls has been sexually assaulted.\nThose are just a few of the findings in a new report from UNICEF that details the \u201cshocking prevalence\u201d of violence and abuse against children around the world.\nConfronting violence against children, the UN agency says, involves challenging the cultural norms that have allowed it to flourish for so long.\nOfficials from the UN agency say that the sobering statistics in their report should compel governments to more seriously address these issues.\nHalf of all girls between the ages of 15 and 19 believe a man is \u201cjustified\u201d in hitting his wife."}
