Jonas also said he expects Tesla initially will sell only well-equipped, high-end versions of the Model 3, at an average price of around $60,000, well above the car's starting price.\n\nTesla, established in 2003, had sold less than 110,000 vehicles in its history through December, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts noted.\n\n\"In 24 hours, Tesla surfaced as many serious buyers as it has converted into customers in its existence,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Newman said in a research note. \"That is the opportunity the car maker is tapping into.\"\n\nThose ordering the car, many of whom had queued up in the hundreds outside Tesla stores, were required to put down a refundable deposit of $1,000.\n\nRelated: The Cheapest Cars to Insure in 2016\n\nHowever, UBS analyst Colin Langan, who has a \"sell\" rating on Tesla, said the initial orders may not translate into a sustainable annual rate.\n\nMany buyers, he said, were getting orders in early in time to take advantage of a $7,500 electric car tax credit that will phase out in the quarter after an automaker hits 200,000 in electric car sales. Tesla is likely to hit that mark in mid-2018, Langan said.\n\nAnalysts believe most of the orders for the Model 3 were placed before its unveiling, and they expect orders to pick up at a steady pace over the coming months.\n\nOne driver will be price. The Model 3 will compete with General Motors Co's Chevrolet Bolt EV, which is expected to launch later this year and also will be priced from around $35,000.\n\nReporting by Tenzin Pema in Bengaluru and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Ted Kerr and Meredith Mazzilli.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Shares of Tesla Motors surged to their highest in six months early on Friday after the", "title": "Why Tesla Shares Are Surging", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/Why-Tesla-Shares-Are-Surging", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/tesla-model3_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/Why-Tesla-Shares-Are-Surging", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/tesla-model3_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Shares of Tesla Motors surged to their highest in six months early on Friday after the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Model 3, considered a make-or-break product for Tesla, was unveiled late on Thursday by Chief Executive Elon Musk.\nAnalysts questioned whether and how soon Tesla would be able to meet intense demand for the stylish compact sedan priced from $35,000.\nTesla, established in 2003, had sold less than 110,000 vehicles in its history through December, Sanford C.
