The man who died Thursday night after a hit-and-run in a crosswalk outside the downtown RTD station has been identified by the county coroner's office as Charles Marcus Dial, 62, of Boulder.

An autopsy has been completed, and the cause and manner of death are pending investigation. Boulder police suggested Friday, however, that an RTD bus may have been involved in a hit-and-run that left Dial with what police called "obvious trauma", making it "very apparent that he had been hit by a car."

Boulder police spokeswoman Kim Kobel said Friday that RTD buses were being examined for damage and any evidence of a crash. Kobel added that RTD buses are being investigated because the body was located at the bus exit on the building's south end, but she said police haven't ruled out other possibilities.

No arrests have been made, and there were no witnesses to the death, which was first reported just before 9 p.m. Thursday by a passerby waiting at the transit center, near 14th Street and Canyon Boulevard.

RTD spokesman Scott Reed has said that his office is working with police, but will not be able to provide security footage because none of the transit center's cameras are aimed at the area in which Dial died. Kobel said police will work with businesses in the area to see if any of their cameras caught the incident.
