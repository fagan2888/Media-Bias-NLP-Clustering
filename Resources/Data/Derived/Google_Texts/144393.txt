Advocates rallied around the cause to establish the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation, which today has five health care centers, including one in Beaverton (right).

BEAVERTON, Ore. (KOIN 6) — A health care center run by a group that focuses on breaking down health barriers for migrant and seasonal workers is set to open at Beaverton High School Friday.

The Virginia Memorial Health Center’s Beaverton High location will provide primary and mental health care to students at the school, then expand to serve the entire Beaverton School District, Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation spokesperson Olivia Mackenzie said in a statement.

“[School based health centers] exist to serve our youth where it is easiest to reach them — in school,” Mackenzie said.

Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici along with school and health officials are expected to be in attendance.

Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center provides “comprehensive and culturally appropriate primary health care with a special emphasis on those with barriers to receiving health care,” according to the organization’s mission statement.

The organization has grown from a volunteer-run clinic to healthcare centers in two counties, employing more than 400 people and serving nearly 38,000 patients annually.
