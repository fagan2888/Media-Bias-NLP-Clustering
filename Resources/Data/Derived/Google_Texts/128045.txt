GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Time is running out if you plan to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The deadline is Sunday, Feb. 15. That's why volunteers from community and health care organizations are going into the community to help people renew their policies and sign up new customers.

"Everyone needs to able to go to the doctor for their annual exam, get prescriptions at a reasonable cost, all are reasonably priced plans" says Kathy Haughton, enrollment organizer.

Haughton adds that from November 2014 to January 2015, 458,000 North Carolinians either renewed their policies or signed up for health insurance. In order to reach as many people as they can, volunteers are taking their enrollment services on the road. In Guilford County, volunteers will be at the Greensboro Coliseum Special Events Center until Thursday evening. On Saturday and Sunday, volunteers will be helping customers sign up for health insurance at the Legal Aid NC office and at the United Way office in Greensboro.

Volunteers or Affordable Care Act Navigators like Aden Hailemariam enjoy helping others and giving customers the information they need so they can understand the health insurance they are buying.

"I feel like I am empowering people to seek out information and make decisions for themselves and take responsibility for those decisions," Hailemariam said.
