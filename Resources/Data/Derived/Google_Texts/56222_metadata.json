He has just finished visiting with one of them, Cliff Sloan, formerly of Winnetka, now the State Department\u2019s special envoy to close Guantanamo. Next stop for Alter was the Washington premiere for the first season of Alpha House, the creation of \u201cDoonesbury\u201d cartoonist and Alter friend of 25 years, Gary Trudeau. Alter serves as executive producer and all-around wise man\u2014making certain the DC details are right\u2014to the comedy, Amazon\u2019s first step into original streaming video content.\n\nAlter, 56, who now lives in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, grew up in Lincoln Park and went to Francis Parker en route to Harvard College. He is among the most connected people I know\u2014from the aforementioned State Department official, to his cousin, the just-retired Ambassador to France, to his buddy Trudeau, 65, whom he met while writing a Newsweek cover story on the cartoonist, to his own wife, Emily Lazar, who also grew up in Winnetka, and is currently co-executive producer of The Colbert Report.\n\nIt was Alter who corralled many famous names to appear as cameos\u2014Stephen Colbert, Bill Murray, Tom Brokaw, Jeffrey Toobin, Jeff Greenfield, former RNC chief Michael Steele, Anthony Weiner, Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform (he and Alter wrote for the Harvard Crimson). \u201cI made contact with all of them,\u201d Alter tells me.\n\nThe first three of the first season\u2019s 11 episodes are now available and free on Amazon Instant Video; after that, every Friday, starting this Friday, the next show will be available to those joining Amazon Prime; the last episode will be released in January 2014. This is Amazon\u2019s initiation into original programming.\n\nHere\u2019s an edited transcript of our conversation:\n\nWhat exactly is your role in this endeavor?\n\nI\u2019m one of three executive producers\u2014me, Elliot Webb, a former TV agent, and Garry Trudeau, but Garry is the show\u2019s creator and writer.\n\nTell me more about your relationship with Trudeau.\n\nIn 1990 I wrote a cover story for Newsweek called \u201cInside Doonesbury\u2019s Brain.\u201d It was the first interview Garry had given in 17 years. We became friends and we traveled every four years to the New Hampshire primary. In 2012 Garry told me about a script involving four senators. I helped him develop the project. I sold it to Amazon and then he promoted me from consultant to executive producer. He\u2019s a wonderful guy. I call him a WASP mensch. We named the company Sid Kibbitz [after the Doonesbury LA super agent].\n\nI do some work in what\u2019s called breaking stories. That means something different than it does in our business\u2014helping figure out what\u2019s going to happen to the characters over the course of the season. I\u2019m on the set every day, usually on a soundstage in Queens across from the [Kaufman] Astoria Studios. We started with three people, and then it snowballed in a fun way. Now we have 150 including cast and crew. We got a medium-sized business going.\n\nSo the story is based on a real house in DC shared by four Democrats\u2014Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, George Miller and, until he retired from Congress, Bill Delahunt\u2014and follows four fictional Republican senators sharing a house, also in DC\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood. But it\u2019s shot in Queens?\n\nMost of it, yes. Sometimes we would be on location\u2014for example, Riverside Church up near Columbia University.\n\nIn real life, Leon Panetta and Marty Russo from Illinois also lived in that house. So why did you change the roomates\u2019 party?\n\nThat was Garry\u2019s decision; he thought it would be funnier if they were Republicans. Three of our senators are facing primary tea-party challenges. The fourth is running for President in 2016. In the show we have pictures of real senators who lived there before\u2014Larry Craig, John Ensign, David Vitter. [All three Republicans landed in embarrassing personal scandal while in the Senate\u2014a hint that Republicans may take some hits in the show.]\n\nUsing a sound stage, how realistic is that?\n\nWe recreated the interior of the Russell Senate Office Building on the sound stage. The details draw on my 30 years covering politics. In 1975 when I was in high school I interned for Sen. Adlai Stevenson [III] who had an office in Russell. The hallway we built in Queens, when Chuck Schumer, who appears in one of our episodes, was there he said, \u201cthis is Russell.\u201d For me, I\u2019d flash back almost 40 years to when I was an intern walking that hall.\n\nDoes each episode have a different director?\n\nWe have eight different directors. The first two were done by Adam Bernstein, the Breaking Bad director; also Bob Balaban from Chicago does a couple. Then there\u2019s Jan Turner, Michael Mayer, Clark Johnson who directed Homeland.\n\nDid you write any of the scripts?\n\nNo, Garry is the writer. Very much his vision and his show and I don\u2019t second-guess him. He very smartly rejects my suggestions. From time to time he\u2019ll take one of them.\n\nYou mean you don\u2019t even get to red line a script now and then?\n\nWe hired five writers who write notes on the scripts and later people from Amazon\u2019s studio write notes on the scripts.\n\nYou were a print guy and later an on-line guy (most recently for newyorker.com) and now you\u2019re doing on-line streaming TV? Did you have any experience to prepare you for this?\n\nThe answer, with one exception, is no. I did one episode in [the early \u201890s] with [Chicagoan] John Eisendrath for a show roughly based on WBBM-TV called WIOU. It ran for part of a season.\n\nSo now you\u2019re working for Amazon whose chief, Jeff Bezos, just bought the Washington Post, which used to own your former employer, Newsweek. So was Bezos involved in getting this project going and will he be involved in deciding whether you guys get a chance to make season two?\n\nYes. He\u2019s the CEO. I don\u2019t know when the decision about another season or two will be made; we just have to wait.\n\nWas Alpha House Bezos\u2019 vision?\n\nHe\u2019s involved in every important Amazon decision, so the concept of doing a series like this probably was his vision. The director of Amazon Studios reports to Bezos in Seattle. Amazon Studios is a small part of the company but they\u2019re putting a lot of money into marketing. [Alter wouldn\u2019t answer my question about the budget for each episode, but it\u2019s been pegged by other reporters as between $1-2 million an episode.]\n\nHave you ever met Bezos?\n\nYes, he came last week to the New York premiere at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As we were coming out we chatted. He said how much he liked the show.\n\nAny Chicago connections we should know about?\n\nWanda Sykes plays an African-American senator, Democrat Rosalyn DuPech, from Illinois.\n\nWas she modeled on Carol Moseley Braun?\n\nWhen the costume director asked how he should dress Sen. DuPeche, I googled Carol Moseley Braun and DuPeche ended up being dressed in ways similar to Moseley Braun.\n\nChuck Schumer\u2019s been around this project. How about Schumer\u2019s roommate and competitor [for Senate Majority Leader should Harry Reid retire], our senator, Dick Durbin?\n\nDurbin has a standing invitation to be in Alpha House. He couldn\u2019t work out his schedule to participate. [Alter emailed me that Durbin did attend the Washington premiere on Tuesday night.]\n\nWho are some of the actors in this first season?\n\nJohn Goodman plays one of the senators; he\u2019s a retired University of North Carolina basketball coach. One day at a wrap party I was talking to him about the Cubs. He was interested that I grew up near Wrigley Field. He shot part of Babe here and really likes Chicago. Amy Sedaris plays the wife of the senator from Nevada. \u2026. Cynthia Nixon plays the Democratic senator from New York; Mark Consuelos plays the senator from Florida who bears some resemblance to Marco Rubio and some resemblance to John Edwards. (The other two senators are played by Clark Johnson and Matt Malloy.)\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this full time since July. I\u2019ve just signed a new contract [for political analysis] with MSNBC. Now that we\u2019ve finished this season I\u2019m going to start on a new book, and I\u2019m not sure what the subject is yet. (Alter wrote books on the 2008 campaign and the 2012 campaign.\n\nAre you a fan of House of Cards?\n\nIt\u2019s very well done and it\u2019s very important for our show. Before it what we were doing was hard to explain. It\u2019s a comedy but it\u2019s on Amazon the way that House of Cards is on Netflix. When I saw Kevin Spacey at the White House Correspondents dinner I said, \u201cYou guys paved the way.\u201d\n\nWill Obama\u2019s terrible problems with the Affordable Care Act affect your show? [Although the senators and supporting cast are fictional, it\u2019s set squarely in Obama\u2019s and Mitch McConnell\u2019s Washington.]\n\nI hope that our show, with its realistic framework, in terms of mood about Washington, will detoxify things. We deal with some issues like immigration, and energy. Those are the backdrop of our comedy. The show is really not about Obama except to the extent that Republicans are portrayed as being so afraid to be seen with Obama. They know they\u2019d be in trouble in primaries if in any way they supported him or appeared to be bipartisan.\n\nSo it\u2019s not pure comedy?\n\nRight, not 100 percent comedy. We do have scenes that are not funny on purpose. You\u2019ll see that at the end of the third episode. The comedy comes out of the characters, grows organically out of the characters. The comedy is in the tone of Doonesbury. It\u2019s character-driven\u2026 It\u2019s a particular sensibility that\u2019s different from insult humor, or comedy on networks. It\u2019s quirky. I like to say it\u2019s simultaneously warm and piercing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitics", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,chicagomag.com", "description": "The star-studded political comedy, by the Chicago-born reporter and the <em>Doonesbury</em> artist Garry Trudeau, is Amazon\u2019s big entry into original streaming video content.", "title": "Jonathan Alter on the Making of Alpha House", "og": {"site_name": "Chicago magazine", "description": "The star-studded political comedy, by the Chicago-born reporter and the Doonesbury artist Garry Trudeau, is Amazon's big entry into original streaming video content.", "title": "Jonathan Alter on the Making of Alpha House", "url": "http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/November-2013/Chicagoan-Jonathan-Alter-Teams-with-Garry-Trudeau-to-Make-Alpha-House/", "image": "http://media.chicagomag.com//images/cache/cache_f/cache_9/cache_5/alphahouse-9386759f.jpeg?ver=1415361125&aspectratio=1.5", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The star-studded political comedy, by the Chicago-born reporter and the Doonesbury artist Garry Trudeau, is Amazon's big entry into original streaming video content.", "title": "Jonathan Alter on the Making of Alpha House", "url": "http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/November-2013/Chicagoan-Jonathan-Alter-Teams-with-Garry-Trudeau-to-Make-Alpha-House/", "image": "http://media.chicagomag.com//images/cache/cache_8/cache_5/cache_8/alphahouse-317b6858.jpeg?ver=1415361125&aspectratio=1.5", "creator": "@cfelsenthal", "site": "@chicagomag", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Chicago magazine", "googleplay": "Chicago magazine"}, "id": {"ipad": 567851357, "googleplay": "com.chicagomag.chicagomag"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "all", "fb": {"admins": "bikesarefun", "pages": 37873197144}, "keywords": "Alpha House, Jonathan Alter, Garry Trudeau, John Goodman, Amazon Video", "thumbnail": "http://media.chicagomag.com//images/cache/cache_e/cache_7/cache_6/alphahouse-28eb867e.jpeg?ver=1415361125&aspectratio=1.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable = no", "news_keywords": "Alpha House, Jonathan Alter, Garry Trudeau, John Goodman, Amazon Video"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde94\"", "article_summary": "Next stop for Alter was the Washington premiere for the first season of Alpha House, the creation of \u201cDoonesbury\u201d cartoonist and Alter friend of 25 years, Gary Trudeau.\nI reached former Newsweek writer Jonathan Alter while he was exiting the State Department, where two of his college roommates now work in high positions.\nIt\u2019s a comedy but it\u2019s on Amazon the way that House of Cards is on Netflix.\nI\u2019m one of three executive producers\u2014me, Elliot Webb, a former TV agent, and Garry Trudeau, but Garry is the show\u2019s creator and writer.\nAlter serves as executive producer and all-around wise man\u2014making certain the DC details are right\u2014to the comedy, Amazon\u2019s first step into original streaming video content."}
