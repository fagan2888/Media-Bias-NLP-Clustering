MIAMI — A Miami Beach strip club has temporarily closed its doors after police say a 13-year-old runaway was forced to dance for money.

City officials issued an emergency order to Club Madonna’s manager Friday night shortly before it opened.

City Manager Jimmy Morales said he revoked Club Madonna’s certificate of use for six months because the club was a threat to the community.

Richard Wolfe, an attorney for Club Madonna, said the city had no basis for such actions. The club and city have battled for years over an alcohol ban in such clubs.

The Miami Herald reports police arrested three people earlier this week for allegedly forcing a runaway teen to prostitute herself and dance at the club.

Club Madonna’s owner said he was unaware the girl performed there.
