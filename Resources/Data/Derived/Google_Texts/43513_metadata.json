Though the Tribune says Ramos denied there was ever a relationship between Gutierrez and his brother, prosecutors indicate the victim had previously shown interest in her, igniting her new boyfriend's jealousy.\n\nGutierrez's boyfriend has not been charged in the crime.\n\nPolice say the victim was lured to the home by the woman and that she was hit in the head with a pipe before his throat was slashed with a knife, according to the Tribune. She was taken into custody after she indicated to police she was \"an active participant\" in the slaying.\n\nA Saturday autopsy confirmed that the man died from \"multiple sharp force injuries\" and assault, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIn court Sunday, a public defender said Daisy Gutierrez is three months pregnant and requested she be held in the jail hospital. In addition to her children with Moncada Ramos, Gutierrez has a 3-year-old child. Moncada Ramos said his children with Gutierrez are not in the custody of the Department of Child and Family Services.\n\nDaisy Gutierrez was ordered held on $2 million bond Sunday, while her father was ordered held on $500,000 bond.\n\nEarlier on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Updated story \n\nA 19-year-old Chicago woman and her 56-year-old father have been charged following the discovery of a dismemb...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-07 12:40:35 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Updated story \n\nA 19-year-old Chicago woman and her 56-year-old father have been charged following the discovery of a dismemb...", "title": "Father, Daughter Charged Over Dismembered Body In Backyard", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/father-teen-daughter-charged_n_4053822.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1391758/images/o-FATHER-DAUGHTER-BODY-DISMEMBERED-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostChicago", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1391758/images/o-FATHER-DAUGHTER-BODY-DISMEMBERED-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "Updated story \n\nA 19-year-old Chicago woman and her 56-year-old father have been charged following the discovery of a dismemb...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Father, Daughter Charged Over Dismembered Body In Backyard"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-06 12:40:35 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4053822", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "chicago", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,Chicago murders,Daisy Gutierrez charged,Daisy Gutierrez chicago,Chicago crime,human remains found southwest side,human remains found chicago,salvador gutierrez charged,Daisy Gutierrez,salvador gutierrez chicago", "article": {"section": "Chicago", "tag": "video,Chicago murders,Daisy Gutierrez charged,Daisy Gutierrez chicago,Chicago crime,human remains found southwest side,human remains found chicago,salvador gutierrez charged,Daisy Gutierrez,salvador gutierrez chicago", "published_time": "2013-10-06 12:40:35 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-10-07 12:53:38 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbaa\"", "article_summary": "Daisy Gutierrez is charged with first-degree murder and her father, Salvador Gutierrez, is charged with concealing a homicidal death, according to DNAinfo Chicago.\nUpdated storyA 19-year-old Chicago woman and her 56-year-old father have been charged following the discovery of a dismembered body in the backyard of a home on the city's far Southwest Side Friday.\nIn addition to her children with Moncada Ramos, Gutierrez has a 3-year-old child.\nMoncada Ramos said his children with Gutierrez are not in the custody of the Department of Child and Family Services.\nDaisy Gutierrez was ordered held on $2 million bond Sunday, while her father was ordered held on $500,000 bond."}
