The Christian groups have provided housing, food and job assistance to former prisoners to help reduce recidivism in the Sunshine State for more than two decades.\n\nState programs funded the work by the two organizations at rates of about $14 a day per client to $20 a day per client, according to the January ruling, provided by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. The Center sued to prevent the payments in 2007, challenging the payments on grounds that it violated Florida\u2019s prohibition on using public money to finance religious work.\n\n\u201cThat staggering claim endangers religious hospitals and all kinds of social service programs,\u201d Lori Windham, the Becket Fund\u2019s senior counsel, said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nLeon County Circuit Court judge Judge George Reynolds rejected the center\u2019s claim that the state payments were illegal. The state of Florida subsequently joined the Becket Fund to help fight the lawsuit, arguing that the programs were offered to ex-convicts irrespective of their faith or beliefs, and didn\u2019t require participation in religious services.\n\nThe county court ruled against the Center\u2019s claims, saying that similar arguments, if upheld, could be used to prevent state funds from going to religiously affiliated hospital systems.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a similar case from Missouri where a Lutheran preschool was blocked from a state program because it is run by a church. The high court will likely hear arguments on that case in upcoming months, with a ruling expected in June.\n\nWatch the Becket Fund explain the Florida case in the video below:\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/23/atheists-drop-suit-to-block-christian-prison-ministry-funding/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prisoners-of-Christ-11.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "atheism, atheist, atheists, Christian ministry, church-state separation, ex-convicts, lawsuits, prison, social policy, state funding"}, "description": "An atheist group dropped its attempt to block state funding of faith-based groups\u2019 work with ex-convicts in Florida.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prisoners-of-Christ-11.jpg"}, "keywords": "christian ministry,prison,ex-convicts,atheist,state funding,atheism,atheists,church-state separation,lawsuits,social policy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Watch the Becket Fund explain the Florida case in the video below:Contact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 An atheist group dropped its attempt to block state funding of faith-based groups\u2019 work with ex-convicts in Florida.\nLeon County Circuit Court judge Judge George Reynolds rejected the center\u2019s claim that the state payments were illegal.\nAtheists drop suit to block Christian prison ministry fundingPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/23/atheists-drop-suit-to-block-christian-prison-ministry-funding/Jeffrey Green, a former client who now works at the Prisoners of Christ Faith House, stands in the doorway of the building where the organization has served the Jacksonville community since 1990.\nThe Center sued to prevent the payments in 2007, challenging the payments on grounds that it violated Florida\u2019s prohibition on using public money to finance religious work."}
