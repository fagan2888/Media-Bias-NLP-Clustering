Women who need abortions, most of whom are mothers already, will move heaven and earth to terminate pregnancies they cannot bring to term. The result of all these restrictions is that women are increasingly going to desperate lengths to make sure they don\u2019t have children they cannot afford to care for.\n\nLook no further than Texas for proof of this. In 2013, the state passed an omnibus bill aimed at shutting down clinics in the state through a bunch of medically unnecessary requirements that were too expensive or just outright impossible for clinics to meet. More than half of the state\u2019s 41 clinics have closed already due to these restrictions and, if the Supreme Court hadn\u2019t stayed some portions of the law while it\u2019s being litigated, all but 10 clinics in the state would close. (The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments about this case during this session.)\n\nBut cutting the state\u2019s abortion services in half didn\u2019t do anything to reduce demand. It just forced clinics to put women on a wait list. In a report released by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at UT Austin, researchers found that some women were having to wait a whole three weeks to get an abortion that would have previously been something you could get done shortly after making an appointment.\n\nLong wait times are no fun with any kind of medical care, but with abortion, it\u2019s a particularly bad deal. The chance of going into the second trimester rises the longer the wait is, making the abortion more costly and difficult to do. Longer waits also mean the embryo is more developed and may even go into the \u201cfetus\u201d stage, which can make the entire ordeal that much more stressful for women \u2014 the longer you\u2019re pregnant, the more symptoms you have to deal with, and the harder it gets to keep it to yourself.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many women in Texas want to avoid this miserable process altogether and are looking to the black market to get an abortion instead. Another report by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, released in November, found that anywhere from 100,000 to 240,000 women in Texas had attempted to abort a pregnancy on their own. Women living close to the border are more likely to have tried it. This is both because clinic closures have affected those areas most dramatically and because Misoprostol, an ulcer medication that induces abortion, is easy to buy over-the-counter in Mexico or from a black market dealer selling in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blame them. Misoprostol is half of the RU486 regimen that the FDA has approved for medical abortion, but on its own it will safely and effectively terminate pregnancies 75 to 90 percent of the time. Even if it doesn\u2019t work all the way, it will start a miscarriage process, allowing a woman to show up at E.R. to have the rest removed legally and safely, without ever having to book an appointment at an abortion clinic. Misoprostol induced miscarriages look no different than natural miscarriages to a doctor. The whole process allows women to abort safely and privately, an option that becomes all the more appealing when going the legal route means waiting three weeks, traveling for hundreds of miles, having to arrange for child care and taking off from work.\n\nIt\u2019s been said before, but always worth restating: If anti-choice legislators were serious about reducing the abortion rate, they\u2019d pass laws making birth control free and proper sex education mandatory, and they would put a bowl of condoms in every bar and coffeehouse and public bathroom in the state. The fact that they concentrate instead on laws that mostly serve to make abortion more miserable \u2014 or to drive women to turn to the black market instead \u2014 shows that these laws are punitive in nature. It\u2019s about making women pay for having sex, and nothing more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the 5th year in a row, anti-choice legislators across the country pass record numbers of abortion restrictions", "title": "GOPers punishing women: Yet again, Republicans have passed dozens of laws this year to destroy abortion rights", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For the 5th year in a row, anti-choice legislators across the country pass record numbers of abortion restrictions", "title": "GOPers punishing women: Yet again, Republicans have passed dozens of laws this year to destroy abortion rights", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/14/gopers_punishing_women_yet_again_republicans_have_passed_dozens_of_laws_this_year_to_destroy_abortion_rights/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/texas-abortion-restrictions.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the 5th year in a row, anti-choice legislators across the country pass record numbers of abortion restrictions", "title": "GOPers punishing women: Yet again, Republicans have passed dozens of laws this year to destroy abortion rights", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/texas-abortion-restrictions.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, abortion restrictions, aol_on, Reproductive Rights, state abortion laws, texas abortion law", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s about making women pay for having sex, and nothing more.\nThe chance of going into the second trimester rises the longer the wait is, making the abortion more costly and difficult to do.\nLong wait times are no fun with any kind of medical care, but with abortion, it\u2019s a particularly bad deal.\nUnsurprisingly, many women in Texas want to avoid this miserable process altogether and are looking to the black market to get an abortion instead.\nto have the rest removed legally and safely, without ever having to book an appointment at an abortion clinic."}
