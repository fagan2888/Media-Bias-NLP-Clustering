How ironic that he does not want to go against his core conviction yet he does not allow other people to go against their core convictions. What is the world coming to when people can\u2019t have their own opinions?\u201d\n\nRobertson replies: Opinions are one thing, but laws are another. The cancellation is his way of expressing his opinion. Calling Trib Talk is yours.\n\n\u201cI just wondered if there is still a no-call list. We seem to get all these erratic phone calls from all over the country that we didn\u2019t when we were on the no-call list. I had updated my phone number on the no-call list, but I\u2019m still getting them. Also, I just wanted to compliment Lorry Myers\u2019 \u2018Storytime.\u2019 Her columns are always so to the point and so good.\u201d\n\nRobertson replies: You can double-check online to see whether your telephone number is listed on the Missouri no-call list by going to www.ago.mo.gov/divisions/consumer/no-call or by calling 866-289-9633. You may also register a complaint about unwanted calls at the same website if you have the offending telephone number.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the clown was or the exact amount, but the comment was, \u2018Well, it will only raise taxes by $185 a year.\u2019 Does this nimrod have any idea what that means for someone like me who is elderly, handicapped and living on a fixed income?\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitics is nuts these days. Just like the nut, if you turn it to the right, you tighten things up. If you turn it to the left, you loosen things up. The nut ought to stay still in the middle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI keep reading about Gary Ward\u2019s letter regarding picking up trash after football games. I thought the athletic department was supposed to be self-supporting. This doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re self-supporting. It sounds like they take money from the university.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read where each candidate for president in 2012 spent $1 billion. I thought that to be incredible, but I later learned that same year $5 billion was spent on potato chips. Methinks the potato chip expenditure was more beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the years abortion has been debated, why has not the father, or sperm donor, been implicated in the process? A woman did not wake up on a Sunday morning pregnant with no assistance, so let\u2019s put emphasis on responsibility for the cause of the pregnancy. How, you ask? The mother to be or not to be must disclose who the father is, whereupon he will be served a summons and assessed a fee for the cost of the abortion at the least. Might slow his impregnating another woman as a benefit, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cDowntown student apartment competition \u2014 much like sorority and fraternity houses, could there be a competition for the No. 1 ranking of a student housing project downtown? Let\u2019s say they volunteer to clean up the sidewalks from cups and upchuck after the bars close the next day, with a roving trophy to stay on display in the winner\u2019s lounge for the month. The residents could receive free benefits like discounts from restaurants and a raffle for 10 free parking spaces for that month in a city garage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the university continues to pay people salaries when it can\u2019t even find a job for them, the oversight committee from the state legislature can\u2019t come any too soon. People need to speak up for the janitors and the people that do the real hard work around the university for virtually no pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an interesting story about Mitt Romney. He was driving down the road with his grandchildren and asked them what they thought of Trump, and somehow they all came to the conclusion that there was something bad about him. I guess thinking that his grandchildren were the future, he figured out that this guy was not what this country needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone and researched in my Bible, and the Bible does say in the end days, \u2018Ye shall be ruled by women and children.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that interesting? It seems that everybody is run by their children, and now we have Hillary Clinton running for United States president, and who could be more of a child than Donald Trump? Come on, folks. These are the end days. It\u2019s time to make up your mind. Do you love God, or do you not? You had better do it quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to congratulate Rudi Keller for an excellent article on the graduate student election. I had never seen the quote from Hank Foley saying he\u2019d hate to \u2018go to war with these kids.\u2019 What a patronizing, stupid thing to say. It just proves that this so-called new leadership is just as clueless as the people they replaced.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"title": "Trib Talk", "description": "\u201cI find it ironic that Bruce Springsteen has canceled a tour for a concert two days prior to the concert in North Carolina in objection to the LBGT law.\"", "card": "summary", "site": "@columbiatribune"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/opinion/trib_talk/trib-talk/article_9eb2542e-27c3-5250-8121-a83560850710.html", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cI find it ironic that Bruce Springsteen has canceled a tour for a concert two days prior to the concert in North Carolina in objection to the LBGT law.\"", "title": "Trib Talk"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "trib talk", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "\u201cI find it ironic that Bruce Springsteen has canceled a tour for a concert two days prior to the concert in North Carolina in objection to the LBGT law.\""}, "article_summary": "I had updated my phone number on the no-call list, but I\u2019m still getting them.\nWe seem to get all these erratic phone calls from all over the country that we didn\u2019t when we were on the no-call list.\n\u201cI just wondered if there is still a no-call list.\nYou had better do it quick.\u201d\u201cI wanted to congratulate Rudi Keller for an excellent article on the graduate student election.\nI thought that to be incredible, but I later learned that same year $5 billion was spent on potato chips."}
