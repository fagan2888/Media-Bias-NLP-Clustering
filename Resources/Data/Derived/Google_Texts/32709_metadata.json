More than 200 young adults participated in the experiments, mostly self-reporting their emotions on a given day. Afterward, researchers took samples of their gum and cheek tissue to measure levels of IL-6.\n\nThe results supported researchers\u2019 hypothesis: Positive emotions are associated with lower levels of IL-6. What\u2019s more is awe in particular was the strongest predictor for low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, even when samples were controlled for relevant personality and health variables.\n\n\"That awe, wonder, and beauty promote healthier levels of cytokines suggests that the things we do to experience these emotions \u2014 a walk in nature, losing oneself in music, beholding art \u2014 has a direct influence upon health and life expectancy,\" Dacher Keltner, co-author of the study and psychologist at the University of California-Berkeley, said in a press release.\n\nPrior research has found high levels of cytokines are associated with poor health and disease, like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and depression. Keltner and her team cited one study found depressed patients had higher levels of the cytokine known as TNF-alpha compared to non-depressed patients. Some experts believe cytokines work to block the hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate mood, appetite, sleep, and memory.\n\nJennifer Stellar, lead study author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto, said awe is otherwise associated \u201cwith curiosity and a desire to explore,\u201d which would suggest these behaviors don\u2019t match up to the behavior responses of those with inflammation; patients with inflammation typically withdraw from their environment.\n\nBusiness Insider reported awe reduces stress in people, at the same time it inspires them to act more generously. BI added it\u2019s the idea an awe-inspiring experiences \u201cgets us out of our own heads\u2026encourage us to look at the world inquisitively and feel more at ease.\u201d\n\nOne caveat: Researchers are still figuring out which comes first, low levels of IL-6 or positive emotions, like awe.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that having lower cytokines makes people feel more positive emotions,\u201d she said, \u201cor that the relationship is bidirectional.\u201d\n\nSource: Stellar JE, et al.
