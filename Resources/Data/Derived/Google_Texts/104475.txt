A new broad corporate strategy unveiled by Illumina Inc. was enough to boost the company’s shares by as much as 10% in early trades Friday, as Wall Street said the genome-sequencing specialist could tap into a market worth up to $20 billion.

Illumina /quotes/zigman/83650/delayed /quotes/nls/ilmn ILMN shares were up $11.13 to $136.16 in recent action, a record high. Late Thursday, the company said it had developed two new platforms to its gene-sequencing lineup, the NextSeq 500 and the HiSeq X Ten.

These and other systems are geared toward analyzing human genes to expose potential disorders, and in some cases to find cures for debilitating diseases such as cancer. The company’s systems are able to identify embryos that may have severe genetic disorders. It also is developing several analytical tools designed to more quickly process genomic information.

The new strategy was announced at an investor conference on Thursday.

“Needless to say, the tone was upbeat, and clearly reflective of a company hitting its stride amidst a backdrop of rapid market expansion,” JPMorgan’s Tycho Peterson said in a note to clients. He raised his price target on the company’s shares to $190 from $120, making note of the potential $20 billion market.

Dan Leonard of Leerink Research did the same and upped his price target on shares to $140 from $110.

“While [Illumina's] stock is expensive, in our view, by any measure, we believe investors will be willing to pay $20 billion for a company visibly executing toward a $20 billion market opportunity in an enviable competitive position,” Leonard said in a note to clients.
