The Islamic State, currently the most virulent force for evil in the world, is systematically destroying many of the antiquities in Syria, keys to understanding ancient life in the cradle of civilization. It\u2019s the price of cobbling together a caliphate. In the midst of fearful turmoil, a hero emerges who demonstrates that sometimes principle is worth more than life itself. One such was Khaled Asaad, an archaeologist who stood between the marauders and the priceless treasures of the past. So he had to die. Depravity, thy name is ISIS.\n\nMr. Asaad, 82, had spent five decades working in the ruins of the ancient city of Palmyra, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. In its campaign to eradicate traces of pagan civilization before the Prophet Muhammad, ISIS captured Palmyra in May, and celebrated by blowing up shrines. The barbarians had earlier destroyed World Heritage sites at Nimrod, where the Tower of Babel, described in the 10th chapter of Genesis \u2014 \u201ca tower with its top in heaven\u201d \u2014 is thought to have stood. Ban Ki-moon called the destruction a \u201cwar crime.\u201d\n\nThe terrorists compounded the destruction by seizing marketable artifacts, and worse, captured Mr. Asaad and tortured him in hopes that he would tell them where invaluable relics and artifacts had been hidden. He refused. The interrogation lasted a month, and then he was charged with \u201cidolatry\u201d and beheaded in a public square outside the city\u2019s museum. His body was suspended from a Roman column at a nearby archaeological dig to make the barbarians\u2019 grisly point.\n\n\u201cThey killed him because he would not betray his deep commitment to Palmyra,\u201d Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, said. \u201cHere is where he dedicated his life, revealing Palmyra\u2019s precious history and interpreting it so that we could learn from this great city that was a crossroads of the ancient world.\u201d\n\nTerror affects people in different ways. For most, mortal fear compels compliance. For others, being made of stronger stuff, betraying principle and belief held over a long life is a fate worse than death. Mr. Asaad had spent his life uncovering, interpreting and preserving cultural relics, and he defied ignorant men who would ruin treasures carved by their forbears thousands of years earlier as a gift to posterity.\n\nSuch attempts to erase history are hardly only crimes of benighted lands across the sea. In the wake of murder in a black church in Charleston, S.C., by a young man obsessed with history he did not understand, monuments and artifacts of the Confederacy were marked in a fit of hysteria for destruction by men ignorant like those in Palmyra. \u201cThose who cannot remember the past,\u201d Santayana wrote, \u201care condemned to repeat it.\u201d\n\nWhen ISIS has been defeated, as it will be, and good men begin the arduous process of rebuilding its cities and restoring its pillaged antiquities, the Syrians of a later time might raise a statue to Khaled Asaad, who died so the future might understand the past.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The barbarians of the Middle East continue to discover new ways to commit atrocity in the charnel house they have made of their region.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The barbarians of the Middle East continue to discover new ways to commit atrocity in the charnel house they have made of their region.", "title": "EDITORIAL: ISIS beheads archaeologist for protecting history", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/23/editorial-isis-beheads-archaeologist-for-protectin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/19/6eb933e52ea188257f0f6a706700f790.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/19/6eb933e52ea188257f0f6a706700f790.jpg", "description": "The barbarians of the Middle East continue to discover new ways to commit atrocity in the charnel house they have made of their region.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "EDITORIAL: ISIS beheads archaeologist for protecting history"}, "Author": "THE WASHINGTON TIMES", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Khaled Asaad"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd338e\"", "article_summary": "One such was Khaled Asaad, an archaeologist who stood between the marauders and the priceless treasures of the past.\nIn the midst of fearful turmoil, a hero emerges who demonstrates that sometimes principle is worth more than life itself.\nSuch attempts to erase history are hardly only crimes of benighted lands across the sea.\nIn its campaign to eradicate traces of pagan civilization before the Prophet Muhammad, ISIS captured Palmyra in May, and celebrated by blowing up shrines.\n\u201cThey killed him because he would not betray his deep commitment to Palmyra,\u201d Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, said."}
