One of my all-time favorite essays discussed the notion of \u201ceffort shock\u201d:\n\nIt applies to everything. America is full of frustrated, broken, baffled people because so many of us think, \u201cIf I work this hard, this many hours a week, I should have (a great job, a nice house, a nice car, etc). I don\u2019t have that thing, therefore something has corrupted the system and kept me from getting what I deserve, and that something must be (the government, illegal immigrants, my wife, my boss, my bad luck, etc).\u201d\n\nAnd young people entering the workforce seem to be experiencing the greatest amount of \u201ceffort shock.\u201d This Slate article by Brooke Donatone from a month ago generated a lot of snickering about Millennials, and offers one of the all-time great opening paragraphs:\n\nAmy (not her real name) sat in my office and wiped her streaming tears on her sleeve, refusing the scratchy tissues I\u2019d offered. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about just applying for a Ph.D. program after I graduate because I have no idea what I want to do.\u201d Amy had mild depression growing up, and it worsened during freshman year of college when she moved from her parents\u2019 house to her dorm. It became increasingly difficult to balance school, socializing, laundry, and a part-time job. She finally had to dump the part-time job, was still unable to do laundry, and often stayed up until 2 a.m. trying to complete homework because she didn\u2019t know how to manage her time without her parents keeping track of her schedule.\n\nI suggested finding a job after graduation, even if it\u2019s only temporary. She cried harder at this idea. \u201cSo, becoming an adult is just really scary for you?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she sniffled.\n\nAmy is 30 years old.\n\nCue everyone\u2019s \u201cBy the time I was 30, I had [worked 60 hours a week/served in the military/gotten married/had children/founded a company/etc].\u201d stories.\n\nDonatone\u2019s conclusion:\n\nA 2013 study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies found that college students who experienced helicopter-parenting reported higher levels of depression and use of antidepressant medications. The researchers suggest that intrusive parenting interferes with the development of autonomy and competence. So helicopter parenting leads to increased dependence and decreased ability to complete tasks without parental supervision.\n\nAmy, like many millennials, was groomed to be an academic overachiever, but she became, in reality, an emotional under-achiever. Amy did not have enough coping skills to navigate normal life stressors\u2014how do I get my laundry and my homework done in the same day; how do I tell my roommate not to watch TV without headphones at 3 a.m.? \u2014 without her parents\u2019 constant advice or help.\n\n. . . The era of instant gratification has led to a decrease in what therapists call \u201cfrustration tolerance.\u201d This is how we handle upsetting situations, allow for ambiguity, and learn to navigate the normal life circumstances of breakups, bad grades, and layoffs. When we lack frustration tolerance, moderate sadness may lead to suicidality in the self-soothingly challenged.\n\nThe U.S. education system is failing our kids in a lot of ways. But perhaps none bigger than their inability to accurately communicate just how much effort and dedication it takes succeed in this world.", "card": "summary", "title": "Promoting STEM in a Celebrity-Obsessed American Culture , by Jim Geraghty, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 2014-01-02 07:38", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Promoting STEM in a Celebrity-Obsessed American Culture", "keywords": "Jim Geraghty", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Promoting STEM in a Celebrity-Obsessed American Culture , Jim Geraghty, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Jim Geraghty, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4b2\"", "article_summary": "Hopefully you can find some way to enjoy your passion of performing or athletics, but whatever you end up doing, you\u2019re going to have to make a living.\nIt\u2019s the message expressed directly and indirectly to all of our children: work hard, study, don\u2019t quit, and you can live your dreams!\nYou see a lot of educators beating the drums about STEM \u2013 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \u2013 and how central they are to everything from long-term earning potential to innovation to national security.\nBut not everybody\u2019s going to live out their big dreams.\nYou may dream of winning a gold medal as an Olympics sprinter, and just not be that fast."}
