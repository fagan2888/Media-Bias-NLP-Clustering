For Veterans Day, President Obama is paying tribute to military veterans past and present who have served and sacrificed their lives for their country.

The gods surely blush with envy.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s the conventional wisdom that Democrats always suffer in midterms because they lack \u201cintensity,\u201d meaning they don\u2019t care, and that presidents are always unpopular in their sixth year in office.\n\nSo much for insight.\n\nNext we visit the clueless camp where professional pundits gather. The consensus here is that the election wasn\u2019t a mandate for Republicans to overhaul government. I confess that I was one of these, but (mark your calendars) I was wrong. There is a difference between warning victors against the end-zone prance, as many of us did, and denying that Republicans were hired to do a job.\n\nThere\u2019s also no denying that the midterms were a referendum on President Barack Obama. The president prefers to say they were a referendum on his policies, which is perhaps an easier pill to swallow. But Obama is his policies, which happen to rub many Republicans \u2014 and at least a few Democrats \u2014 the wrong way.\n\nMoreover, people don\u2019t like being insulted and misled, as many feel they have been by this administration. This is not just a feeling but a demonstrable fact, especially vis-a-vis the Affordable Care Act. And it\u2019s not just the far-right fringe who object to the strategic misrepresentations along the way.\n\nThese obfuscations include telling the American people that they could keep the insurance they had if they liked it and also writing the law in such a way that the ACA\u2019s mandate to purchase government-approved insurance was not a \u201ctax,\u201d despite the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s role in policing its compliance.\n\nThe keep-your-insurance ruse is history now, but the memory still lingers in the minds of voters, who, contrary to what the Obama White House thinks, are not stupid.\n\nThere\u2019s no dishonor \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t stupid \u2014 to not understand the ACA. The then-Democratic-controlled Congress that passed the thing didn\u2019t even understand it. I\u2019d wager that most still don\u2019t.\n\nPunditry aside, there\u2019s no mystery to the midterm shellacking. It was a loud, clear shout-out to Congress to Just Stop It. Not only stop Obamacare, which more likely will end up being tweaked, but to stop executive overreach and disinformation to sway votes while betraying voters.\n\nThose who feel defrauded by their own government got third-party confirmation recently when remarks by one of the ACA\u2019s chief architects, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber \u2014 invoking the stupidity of voters and lauding the political advantage of a lack of transparency in government \u2014 went viral.\n\nThe comments were made on a panel about a year ago but were released a week after the midterms. Gruber was making the point that Obamacare never would have passed if the administration had been honest about the fact that the so-called \u201cpenalty\u201d for noncompliance with the mandate was really a tax.\n\n\u201cAnd basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what might have happened if truth had won the day. But we do know that truth squandered is trust lost.\n\nWe also know that once trust is gone, it\u2019s very hard to restore. Over time, and not just during this administration, we have lost trust in one institution after another. But when we have lost faith in our government, we have lost faith in ourselves.\n\nAt their core, the midterms were really about restoring that trust. This, it seems, is the mandate that precedes all others and will require the good-faith efforts of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u2014 Kathleen Parker: kathleenparker@washpost.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1uwq3yX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The election results show the public is tired of lies.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "The election results show the public is tired of lies.", "title": "Nation has lost trust in Obama", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/11/15/nation-lost-trust-obama/19048301/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The election results show the public is tired of lies.", "title": "Nation has lost trust in Obama", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ba4067fe8b23b321ba935ac3cdc000c5bda42dba/c=126-0-469-343&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/11/14/obama2.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc29d\"", "article_summary": "For Veterans Day, President Obama is paying tribute to military veterans past and present who have served and sacrificed their lives for their country.\n\u201cAnd basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to know what might have happened if truth had won the day.\nOver time, and not just during this administration, we have lost trust in one institution after another.\nBut when we have lost faith in our government, we have lost faith in ourselves.\nBut Obama is his policies, which happen to rub many Republicans \u2014 and at least a few Democrats \u2014 the wrong way."}
