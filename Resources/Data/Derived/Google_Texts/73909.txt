Stenehjem is not a conservative

Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem proved in his only debate that he’s no conservative, let alone a Republican. When asked if state spending was too much, not enough, or just right, without hesitation he stated “just right.”

If that is so, Stenehjem must plan on raising taxes on all of us. In order to make up for the overspending of $1.8 billion, how does he expect to keep spending at the same level? Does he just not know? And what about his vote in 1995 where he voted to allow tax dollars to be used to pay for abortions? His response at the debate was “Well, everyone else did.” Well, Mr. Stenehjem, how did the bill fail?

And how about the brief he wrote in support of Obamacare? This was at the same time our state was opposing it. Maybe he was a Democrat then.

And how about the attorney general budget that has grown by 300 percent over the years? Where is the conservative, small government thinking? I hope North Dakota wakes up and realizes that we need to change directions. It’s time to vote for someone who will stop growing government and give taxpayers real tax relief. It’s obvious Stenehjem is not that man.
