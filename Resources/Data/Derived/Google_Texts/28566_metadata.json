Aside from positioning Castro as a possible vice presidential candidate in 2016, it\u2019s a promotion that his fiercely Republican home state couldn\u2019t offer anytime soon.\n\nDemocrats, led by architects of Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, are pouring millions of dollars into the state to put Texas back in play on the electoral map. No Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas in two decades, the longest streak of political futility in the U.S. But the state\u2019s booming Hispanic population \u2014 Hispanics since 2000 have counted for roughly two out of every three new residents \u2014 has given Democrats hope. At the same time, a turnaround could still be far off.\n\n\u201cIf we do what we\u2019re supposed to do, we\u2019re going to be OK in Texas for a long, long time,\u201d said Lionel Sosa, a Republican former adviser to President George W. Bush who helped the GOP capture 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2004 presidential election.\n\nCastro is an up-and-comer described as an \u201call-star\u201d on Friday by Obama, who in 2012 picked him to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. A Mexican-American whose mother was a civil rights activist, Castro at the time was coming off an easy re-election in San Antonio, where he said he saw himself staying as mayor until term limits pushed him out in 2017.\n\nThose close to him said joining Obama\u2019s cabinet now after spurning a previous opportunity wasn\u2019t a matter of Castro growing pessimistic or impatient about his future in Texas.\n\n\u201cA lot of people take the longer view of the demographic changes occurring in our state. I think that (Castro) has always known both the demographic and political realities in Texas,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, another of the party\u2019s rising stars in San Antonio. \u201cBut opportunity is only going to knock so many times when the president of the United States asks you to serve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Julian Castro leaves uncertain Texas future behind", "author": "Paul J.
