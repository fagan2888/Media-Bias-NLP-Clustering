The video features dancers and cameos from Jets running back Chris Johnson and Hall of Famer Joe Namath. The best bits, however, were arguably the non-speaking parts.\n\nLined up in the back as part of the Mannings\u2019 crew were Broncos\u2019 offensive linemen Ryan Clady, Louis Vasquez and Orlando Franklin.\n\n\u201cI was happy and thrilled about doing it,\u201d said Franklin, who admitted the outtakes were funnier. \u201cI think Eli is a little better than Peyton in the rap game. But they did a great job. It\u2019s a catchy song. It gets in your head.\u201d\n\nManning making people giggle is standard procedure. Seeing the hulks, however, caught some Broncos off guard.\n\n\u201cI was laughing so hard, I couldn\u2019t even pay attention after a while,\u201d safety Rahim Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that (Manning) is sharing the love, and our offensive line deserves it. They work so hard, so to get that exposure is great for them.\u201d\n\nTamme excused. Tight end Jacob Tamme was excused for his second consecutive practice Monday for personal reasons. Tamme\u2019s wife gave birth to a baby girl Tuesday. Tamme starred in the team\u2019s scrimmage at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, and remains a valuable receiver and special teams player.\n\nFamous visitors. Broncos camp featured visitors who were as impressive as the players. Former Pro Bowl safety Brian Dawkins worked with the defensive backs during practice. Dressed in sweats and a sleeveless shirt, Dawkins looked like he could still take reps. Kicker Jason Elam, whose bucket list is bigger than most, also stopped by Dove Valley. The one-time record holder of the NFL\u2019s longest field goal before Matt Prater broke it, Elam will attend Oxford University this year, studying theology.\n\nFootnotes. Defensive tackle Malik Jackson returned to practice after an excused absence and made an impact. The former Tennessee star tipped and intercepted a pass by Manning in 11-on-11 drills. \u2026 Cornerback Chris Harris (knee) doesn\u2019t know if he will play in the preseason, but is confident he will start the opener on Sept. 7. \u201cIt will be seven months (out from surgery) at game time. I will be ready,\u201d Harris said. \u2026 The Broncos\u2019 starters are expected to play two quarter\u2019s Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. \u2026 An Air Force helicopter featuring a Broncos\u2019 flag few over practice.
