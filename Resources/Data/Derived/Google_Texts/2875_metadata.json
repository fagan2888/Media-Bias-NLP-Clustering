Inspectors based their findings on research at nine VA facilities, including the Phoenix VA, which was ground zero for the scandal in 2014 when it was discovered to have a \"secret\" waitlist concealing care delays.\n\nEvery VA inspector interviewed said his or her facility had either significantly scaled back the PC3 program or dropped it entirely due to these problems. VA contractors regularly \"blind-scheduled\" patients, or set up appointments without first confirming patient availability. Moreover, inspectors reported, contractors have not kept patient appointments within timeliness requirements, nor have VA staff given contractors necessary authorization in a timely manner.\n\nResearch also found a shortage of private physicians contracted through Health Net Federal Services and TriWest Healthcare Corporation, which handle private-care booking for the VA. Inspectors found TriWest took 21 days to create an appointment on average, even though its contract requires it to create them within five business days. Nearly all appointment requests were unfilled for certain specialties, according to the report, and contractors have failed to provide medical documentation and inaccurately reported unfilled appointments to the VA.\n\nTriWest said in a statement to the press that many of these problems were largely restricted to the early stages of the program and have since improved, according to Arizona Central. \"We are proud of the fact that the PC3 program was used by VA here in Phoenix to assist them in eliminating the initial backlog of more than 14,700 veterans between April and August 2014,\" the company said. \"Following that time, we evaluated together the opportunity for refinement and have implemented most of those changes, to include a brand new system through which we move patient information to speed service and enhance effectiveness.\"\n\nThe report comes less than a month after VA officials admitted to problems with payments to medical providers outside of the agency's system in testimony to the House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on health, FierceGovernment previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- download the report\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVA promises to fix problems with late payments to private medical providers\n\nVA scandal: Full OIG report finds \"unacceptable\" lapses within Phoenix facility\n\nOIG report: No evidence care delays caused VA deaths\n\nLawmakers call for resignation of Phoenix VA head over secret waitlist\n\nSecret VA wait list reveals 40 vets died while awaiting treatment\n\nAs FBI opens criminal probe, Congress pushes bill to improve veterans' access to care\n\nVA scandal: Audit reveals 57,000 vets awaiting medical appointments\n\n18 more vets dead as legislators pen VA reform bill\n\nInvestigation into VA wait lists expands to more hospitals\n\nSenate sends VA reform bill to Obama's desk", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than a year after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) came under fire for care delays, a heavily-touted solution that would allow veterans to seek private healthcare suffers from similar problems,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from the VA Office of Inspector General.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "More than a year after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) came under fire for care delays, a heavily-touted solution that would allow veterans to seek private healthcare suffers from similar problems,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from the VA Office of Inspector General.", "title": "OIG: Delays, scheduling violations plague VA's private-care fix", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/oig-delays-scheduling-violations-plague-vas-private-care-fix/2015-07-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "care delays,Care Delivery,Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient-Centered Community Care,Private Contractors,The Office Of Inspector General OIG,VA scandal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "VA inspectors uncovered issues ranging from care delays to cost overruns to improper scheduling practices within the Patient-Centered Community Care (PC3) program, according to the report.\nVA contractors regularly \"blind-scheduled\" patients, or set up appointments without first confirming patient availability.\nMoreover, inspectors reported, contractors have not kept patient appointments within timeliness requirements, nor have VA staff given contractors necessary authorization in a timely manner.\nInspectors based their findings on research at nine VA facilities, including the Phoenix VA, which was ground zero for the scandal in 2014 when it was discovered to have a \"secret\" waitlist concealing care delays.\nResearch also found a shortage of private physicians contracted through Health Net Federal Services and TriWest Healthcare Corporation, which handle private-care booking for the VA."}
