A school board in north Florida plans to restrict access to school bathrooms based on a person's biological gender.

The Ocala Star-Banner reports that the Marion County School Board reached a consensus on Thursday on a resolution to ban transgender students from using bathrooms for the gender with which they identify. The board plans to take a final vote in the coming days.

The resolution states that "transgender people are not a protected class under federal or state law or under Marion County Public Schools policy."

The issue was raised when a teacher reported a transgender student who was born female but identifies as a male at Vanguard High school in Ocala was using the boy's restroom.

The district's resolution runs counter to many federal court rulings.
