Another hard freeze warning has been issued for the Tucson metro until Sunday morning. Lows are forecasted to be below 28Â° tonight. Possibly the coldest temperatures we have seen all year.

Tips to Protect Your Home:

Cover all exposed outdoor pipes with insulation or towels

Use blowdryer to thaw frozen pipes

Remove, drain, store hoses inside

Close indoor valves that supply water to outside hose bibs

Open outside valves to allow many remaining water in the pip to expand without breaking

Keep garage door closed

Allow faucets to drip slightly

Protecting Your Plants

Cover: fruit trees, tropical plants with a sheet before cold weather strikes

Cover: new cactus blooms with styrofoam cups

Don't cut dead foliage until the spring
