FDR invokes the Neutrality Act, Sept. 25, 1939

On this day in 1939, a resolution providing for repeal of an arms embargo against belligerent nations and enactment in its stead of mandatory “cash-and-carry” rules for commerce between the United States and warring nations came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

After Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany on Sept. 3, 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the provisions of the Neutrality Act, first enacted in 1935 and subsequently renewed several times. On Sept. 22, however, FDR asked Congress to revise the legislation because, he argued, it indirectly aided the Germans, who had triggered the conflict by invading Poland.

A “cash-and-carry” provision in the Neutrality Act that Congress had added in 1937 permitted the sale of arms to European warring parties as long as they crossed the Atlantic on their own ships and paid for them at once in cash. Roosevelt believed that “cash-and-carry” would aid France and Great Britain in the event of a war with Germany, since they controlled the seas. The clause was set to expire after two years. In early 1939, after Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia, Congress rebuffed Roosevelt when he asked the lawmakers to renew its provisions.

As the new legislation made its way through Congress, Roosevelt managed to overcome isolationist sentiment in both chambers. After passage of the Neutrality Act of 1939 on Nov. 4, Britain and France could once again skirt the U.S. arms embargo.

The neutrality policy ended with passage of the Lend-Lease Act of March 1941. It allowed the United States to sell, lend or give war materials to nations the administration sought to support. After attacks by German submarines on U.S. ships, Roosevelt on Sept. 11, 1941, ordered the U.S. Navy to attack German and Italian warships in “waters which we deem necessary for our defense.”
