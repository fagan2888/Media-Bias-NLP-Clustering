Why? She was breastfeeding her 10-month-old son. The mother in question, Virginie Rutgers, said that she was holding a cover over her son as she nursed him when a cabin supervisor asked her to remove it for safety reasons.\n\n\u201cI was in a state of shock honestly,\u201d she told Seven News. Rutgers explained that the cabin supervisor \u201cstarted to raise his voice\u201d and became \u201cquite abusive.\u201d When flight attendants didn\u2019t give her an explanation as to why her behavior was wrong, she continued breastfeeding. This ultimately led to her being removed from the plane and met by police shortly thereafter.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a mother breastfeeding in public was discriminated against. In 2013, a flight attendant on an American Airlines flight offered to move a mother back a few rows, saying that it was \u201cbecause there are kids on this flight.\u201d The airline later noted that mothers should be more careful when choosing to breastfeed \u201cbecause of the offense that may be taken by others.\u201d\n\nIn another recent case outlined by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a mother named Angela Ames was reportedly denied a place to pump breast milk when she returned to her job after a maternity leave. After protesting this, Ames was told to \u201cjust go home and be with your babies.\u201d The ACLU notes that this is sex discrimination, even though the trial court held (in perhaps one of the silliest arguments ever made) that Angela\u2019s coerced resignation from her job wasn\u2019t sex discrimination, since men can technically lactate as well under certain circumstances.\n\nBreastfeeding in public is often viewed as \u201coffensive,\u201d inappropriate, or gross. And in many cases, employers or airlines don\u2019t have proper guidelines of how to deal or communicate with breastfeeding mothers.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that these cases aren\u2019t a result of miscommunication but rather lack of communication to begin with,\u201d Diana West, director of media relations at La Leche League International, a nonprofit dedicated to educate women about and promote breastfeeding, told Yahoo Parenting. \u201cIf a woman doesn\u2019t comply with airline instructions, it\u2019s technically a security issue, but breastfeeding shouldn\u2019t have been a problem in the first place.\u201d\n\nMore women should breastfeed their children not only because of the copious amount of research that have proven its health benefits, but also because it\u2019s important to create an accepting environment in public and work spaces where women can feel safe to do so. We need to support an upward trend in breastfeeding for all the benefits explained below, of course, but also because breastfeeding is in essence a reproductive right that all women deserve to have. Women should have a right to breastfeed in public without discrimination, even if they choose to feed their babies infant formula.\n\nBreastfeeding has been a natural part of human existence for thousands of years, but so has bottle feeding and wet nursing.

Wet nursing, which involves one woman breastfeeding another woman\u2019s child, became popular in many societies, particularly if a mother was too ill to breastfeed or had died during childbirth. As time went on, wet nurses, who were often women in lower social and economic positions, would nurse children of women in higher social positions. Thus breastfeeding began to be considered too \u201ccommon\u201d for royalty.\n\nSoon, the notion of mothers breastfeeding their own children came to be known as a practice undertaken by the lower, common classes. Only peasants who couldn\u2019t afford to feed their babies formula or hire wet nurses would do it. Fast-forward to the 1880s up until the 1960s, and there was a huge decline in the number of women who breastfed their own children; the practice was replaced by infant formula. As a result, breastfeeding was branded and stigmatized as an old-fashioned practice among poor and uneducated people.\n\n\u201cSociety\u2019s negative view of wet nursing, combined with improvements of the feeding bottle, the availability of animal\u2019s milk, and advances in formula development, gradually led to the substitution of artificial feeding for wet nursing,\u201d one report on the history of infant feeding says, also noting that infant formula companies pushed advertising so much that it had a huge impact on society\u2019s view of breastfeeding.\n\nThroughout history, there have been times when doctors and writers advocated for a woman breastfeeding her own child, claiming that it would be better for the child than a wet nurse. But wet nursing remained a popular alternative in addition to feeding bottles, which had also been around since ancient times, and infant formula.\n\nWhile breastfeeding began to gain more popularity in the 1960s (and has recently risen, with 77 percent of mothers breastfeeding their own children, according to a 2013 CDC report), the stigma still remains, particularly in public and work spaces. And while laws allowing women to breastfeed in public do exist, many times they\u2019re not enough.\n\nCopious amounts of research have outlined the benefits of breastfeeding; it mainly protects the baby's immune system and prevents a variety of disorders from allergies to diabetes and obesity. Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nThe Benefits\n\nBased on heaps of research, there is no doubt that breastfeeding is better for both the mother and child than infant formula.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s healthier. One recent study from Henry Ford Hospital found that babies who are breastfed actually have much stronger immune systems than those who aren\u2019t. Instead of keeping babies in a sterile environment and preventing them from being exposed to bacteria, which can be detrimental to their immune systems, breastfeeding allows for \u201cexposure to these microorganisms\u201d which helps \u201cstimulate the immune system,\u201d said Dr. Christine Cole Johnson, an author of the study. It\u2019s the mix of cells, hormones, and antibodies from the mother\u2019s breast milk that is protective to the child, preventing the development of a variety of disorders like allergies, childhood leukemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes, ear infections, eczema, and diarrhea.\n\nAnother recent study out of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill found that breastfed babies developed stronger stomachs, and the process prepared them more for eating solid foods, too.\n\n\u201cThis study provides yet more support for recommendations by the World Health Organization and others to breastfeed exclusively during the first six months of life,\u201d Dr. Amanda Thompson, an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cWe can see from the data that including formula in an infant\u2019s diet does change the gut bacteria even if you are also breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding seems to really smooth out the transition to solid foods.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, in addition to providing the infant with greater immune protection, breastfeeding has been shown to increase a child\u2019s IQ. According to one study, babies who were breastfed for 12 months grew up to have a higher IQ, complete more education, and make more money compared to babies who were breastfed for less than one month. Scientists still aren\u2019t sure why this is the case; it\u2019s possible that because breast milk is rich in long-chain saturated fatty acids, it can contribute significantly to brain development.\n\nOn top of all this, breastfeeding is much safer than infant formula as it provides babies with better nutrition and makes it easier for them to absorb all the protein, calcium, and iron in it. Infant formula, on the other hand, contains higher levels of arsenic, according to one recent study.\n\nIt\u2019s important to raise awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding, and also the notion that it truly is a woman\u2019s reproductive right. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires employers to \u201cprovide reasonable break times\u201d for a mother to nurse her child up to one year after birth, and requires them to provide a safe place, shielded from view, that can be used by the employee. Yet, the stigma remains and makes it difficult for women to breastfeed at work or in public without some form of discrimination, no matter how subtle. It\u2019s up to us to change that view in society, and provide a healthier alternative to infant formula to mothers and children across the country.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "breastfeeding, reproductive rights, breast is best", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Breastfeeding is natural and beneficial for both mother and child, but many women are held back by the fear of being judged in public.", "title": "Breastfeeding Is Natural, So Let's Stop Telling Women To Hide It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/breast-best-why-we-need-make-women-feel-comfortable-breastfeeding-public-work-spaces-328116", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/breastfeeding_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Breastfeeding is natural and beneficial for both mother and child, but many women are held back by the fear of being judged in public.", "title": "Breastfeeding Is Natural, So Let's Stop Telling Women To Hide It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/breast-best-why-we-need-make-women-feel-comfortable-breastfeeding-public-work-spaces-328116", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/breastfeeding_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/breastfeeding_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-04-05T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-05T09:02:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Breastfeeding is natural and beneficial for both mother and child, but many women are held back by the fear of being judged in public."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb65\"", "article_summary": "This isn\u2019t the first time a mother breastfeeding in public was discriminated against.\nWomen should have a right to breastfeed in public without discrimination, even if they choose to feed their babies infant formula.\nInfant formula, on the other hand, contains higher levels of arsenic, according to one recent study.\nBreastfeeding is natural and beneficial for both mother and child, but many women are held back by the fear of being judged in public.\nIt\u2019s up to us to change that view in society, and provide a healthier alternative to infant formula to mothers and children across the country."}
