For all the complaints about the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center over the years — it’s too small, too outdated, too gloomy — it never reported a bat invasion until its ambitious eco-friendly renovation was completed. The center now features a 6.75-acre living green roof, bird protective glass and a new population of insects that bats can’t resist. Five species of bats have unexpectedly been attracted to this new urban habitat on the West Side along with a flurry of bird species like foraging American kestrels, according to delighted watchers at the New York City Audubon Society.

The center was once among the deadliest city buildings for migrating birds; fatalities are now down an estimated 90 percent among flocks that used to collide with the old reflective glass but now can better sense the new pixelated glass exterior. And for all the calls for demolition, the center has never seemed more lively, as conventioneers come and go below in sunlight freed through expansive new skylights and glass walls.

The enormous rooftop carpet of succulent, thirsty sedum plants — enough to cover more than five football fields — was designed to soak up millions of gallons of rainwater annually and better insulate the center in winter and summer. Energy consumption should be cut an estimated 25 percent by the green roof and energy-efficient glass designs of FXFowle Architects and Epstein Global. The sedum, a desert transplant, reduces damaging runoff to the city’s overtaxed sewer system and cuts greenhouse gases.

Three years ago, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signaled doom for the Javits Center with a plan to replace it with something much bigger in Queens, even as a previously begun renovation went forward. The result is a center that, whatever its limitations, is notably rich in eco-friendly innovations that deserve emulation as the city builds and rebuilds itself into the future.
