LONDON (AP) — Entertainer Elton John and longtime mate David Furnish have officially converted their civil partnership into a marriage.

The ceremony took place exactly nine years after they entered into a civil partnership.

The couple was able to marry under new laws that took effect in England earlier this year.

John had earlier tweeted about their plans and Sunday posted a photo on Instagram showing them getting ready to sign official papers.

“That’s the legal bit done. Now on to the ceremony!” the couple wrote on their posting.

They planned a celebration at their estate near Windsor Castle west of London. An A-list crowd is expected.

The singer has praised England for changing its laws to allow same-sex marriage. He said the wedding would be a joyous occasion shared with their children.
