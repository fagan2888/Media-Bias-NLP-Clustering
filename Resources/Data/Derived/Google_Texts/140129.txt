One of the most Republican states in the nation suddenly has a new lieutenant governor who’s a Democrat.

Republican Gov. Nikki Haley’s new right hand man is Yancey McGill, a long-time state senator from the rural eastern part of the state. The lieutenant governor’s job is pretty powerless and thankless in South Carolina, and few people wanted it when it came open this week after Glenn McConnell decided to step down to become president of the College of Charleston, his alma mater.

And it’s especially undesirable because the main job is to preside over the Senate, which goes home Thursday. A new lieutenant governor will be elected in November in a race that’s already underway.

Mr. McGill volunteered even though it meant leaving the state senate seat he’s held for 25 years. He isn’t likely to run again, as he narrowly held on to his seat the last election. Republicans grumbled but in the end voted overwhelmingly for him. After all, Mr. McGill’s views aren’t that different from their own – he has sided with Republicans on ethics and budget matters.

Mr. McGill took the pledge in front of his family and friends. There was reason to celebrate after all—he’s the first Democrat to hold the post since 1995, and becomes the only Democrat to currently hold statewide office.
