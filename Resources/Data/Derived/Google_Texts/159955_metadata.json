And the tech supports behind Healthcare.gov will be asking more users to act in the name of fixing the site, too. According to registrants speaking with Ars, individuals whose logins never made it to the site's database will have to re-register using a different username, as their previously chosen names are now stuck in authentication limbo.\n\nThe website for the Affordable Care Act (aka \"Obamacare\") launched just last week. With all the scrutiny and debate happening, if ever there was a website launch that was \"too big to fail,\" this was it. So, of course, it did\u2014depending on how you define \"failure.\" The inability of Obamacare portals to keep up with the traffic demands initially put upon them has been seized by politicians and conservative pundits as evidence that Obamacare \"is not ready for prime time\" in the words of Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Now, a week later, the site appears to be stabilizing, with waiting times dropping dramatically for those who haven't been able to register before.\n\nA test of the site this morning had me waiting four minutes to get to the signup page; others got on instantly. But problems persist beyond the front door. The contractors responsible for the exchange\u2014CGI Federal for the website itself, Quality Software Systems Inc. (QSSI) for the information \"hub\" that determines eligibility for programs and provides the data on qualified insurance plans, and Booz Allen for enrollment and eligibility technical support\u2014are scrambling to deploy more fixes. Technical support call center operators continue to handle an onslaught of calls from users who can't get back into the system after registering.\n\nIn addition to would-be Healthcare.gov registrants notifying Ars about the password reset and login limbos, Ars learned that changes made to profiles already within the system may not be saved either\u2014a problem that is only indicated by a very non-descriptive error message.\n\nArs attempted to contact the contractors with Healthcare.gov but did not receive a response as of this writing.\n\nThree years is not enough\n\nCGI has had some experience with these exchanges in the past. It built the Web portal for Massachusetts' \"Romneycare\" and is building exchanges for a number of other states. So with that experience behind them, why, with three years to prepare, did these sites have such a rough first week?\n\nThose familiar with how Federal IT projects usually roll will suggest an alternative question: with three years to prepare a system that is expected to cost $683.81 million\u2014and much of that preparation being bureaucratic haggling over the rules for its operation\u2014how did the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CGI manage to get anything up at all?\n\nFederal IT projects are infamous for blowing out the \"iron triangle\" of project management\u2014cost, scope, and schedule. Healthcare.gov hits all three sides of the triangle. Because of the legislative mandate for Healthcare.gov and its state-run cohorts, the project was handed a massive scope. With Congress eager to cut its throat, the program has been highly budget-sensitive. And with a hard deadline of October 1 and a heavy up-front regulatory process required to create the specifications for the portal, three years was a very tight deadline.\n\nBased on the Federal IT Dashboard, which tracks the project status and risk for most of the federal government's major IT programs, it would appear that HHS and the Obama Administration were relatively confident that the exchange sites would launch on time. However, they were less confident about it coming in under budget. Known as the \"CMS CCIIO Healthcare Insurance Exchange IT Investment,\" the program was assigned a \"medium risk\" evaluation (A \"3\" on a scale of 5) at the end of July. That rating wasn't because there was concern about the schedule. Instead, the risk rating was assigned because HHS' Chief Information Officer Frank Baitman was concerned about potential cost overruns for the website implementation.\n\nThere were even earlier causes for concern. Back in March, concerns about the funding levels for the program prompted Baitman and HHS management to rate the program as \"high risk\"\u2014giving it a score of 1 out of 5. In June, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan auditing body that provides oversight reports to Congress, said that it was still a crapshoot as to whether the system would work on time. This uncertainty persisted because the hub being built by QSSI still hadn't been completely tested (the hub is responsible for making automated decisions about eligibility). While the policies to govern how the hub works\u2014and how various state systems were supposed to work\u2014had been completed, there was still a lot of code to be written to make those policies into an actual system.\n\nAll of that pushed the development of the system closer and closer to the deadline. As one reddit user posted when the site ran into trouble on October 1, \"My wife works on this project but not as a developer. Last night she said, 'I have no idea how the site is going to go live tomorrow.'\"\n\nGarbage in, garbage out\n\nThe result of the headlong rush to October 1 was a system that had never been tested at anything like the load it experienced on its first day of operation (if it was tested with loads at all). Those looking for a reason for the site's horrible performance on its first day had plenty of things to choose from.\n\nFirst of all, there's the front-end site itself. The first page of the registration process (once you get to it) has 2,099 lines of HTML code, but it also calls 56 JavaScript files and 11 CSS files. That's not exactly optimal for heavy-load pages.\n\nNavigating the site once you get past registration is something of a cheese chase through the rat-maze. \"It's like a bad, boring video game where you try to grunt and hack your way through to the next step,\" one site user told Ars.\n\nOnce you get through all that, it\u2019s not clear that it's going to do you any good. Underlying problems in the back-end code\u2014including the data hub built by QSSI\u2014have been causing errors in determining whether individuals are eligible for subsidized plans under the program. In DC, that means health care plan prices won't be available to people registering through DC's portal until November. It may also mean that others who have registered already at the federal and state exchanges may get sticker shock later.\n\nOccasional Ars collaborator Jason Levitt contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=1020", "description": "Three years wasn't enough time to get this massive IT effort past the finish line.", "application-name": "Ars Technica", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare site hits reset button on passwords as contractors scramble \",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/arstechnica.com\\/information-technology\\/2013\\/10\\/obamacare-site-hits-reset-button-on-passwords-as-contractors-scramble\\/\",\"type\":\"post\",\"author\":\"Sean Gallagher\",\"post_id\":352091,\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-08T19:10:14Z\",\"section\":\"Technology Lab\",\"tags\":[\"enterprise-systems\",\"obamacare\",\"web-development\",\"type: report\"],\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.arstechnica.net\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/register-150x150.jpg\"}", "twitter": {"domain": "arstechnica.com", "description": "Three years wasn't enough time to get this massive IT effort past the finish line.", "title": "Obamacare site hits reset button on passwords as contractors scramble", "url": "http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/obamacare-site-hits-reset-button-on-passwords-as-contractors-scramble/", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/register-640x351.jpg", "height": 351, "width": 640}, "creator": "@thepacketrat", "site": "@arstechnica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Ars Technica: Serving the technologist for 1.2 decades", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"report\",\"title\":\"Obamacare site hits reset button on passwords as contractors scramble \",\"post_id\":352091,\"lower_deck\":\"Three years wasn't enough time to get this massive IT effort past the finish line.\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.arstechnica.net\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/register-150x150.jpg\",\"listing_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.arstechnica.net\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/register-300x150.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "Ars Technica", "description": "Three years wasn't enough time to get this massive IT effort past the finish line.", "title": "Obamacare site hits reset button on passwords as contractors scramble", "url": "http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/obamacare-site-hits-reset-button-on-passwords-as-contractors-scramble/", "image": "http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/register-640x351.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 10103365229664579}, "theme-color": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "http://arstechnica.com/", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/;icon-uri=https://cdn.arstechnica.net/ie-jump-menu/jump-subscribe.ico", "advertising": "ask"}, "article_summary": "And the tech supports behind Healthcare.gov will be asking more users to act in the name of fixing the site, too.\nA test of the site this morning had me waiting four minutes to get to the signup page; others got on instantly.\nArs attempted to contact the contractors with Healthcare.gov but did not receive a response as of this writing.\nNow, a week later, the site appears to be stabilizing, with waiting times dropping dramatically for those who haven't been able to register before.\nIt may also mean that others who have registered already at the federal and state exchanges may get sticker shock later."}
