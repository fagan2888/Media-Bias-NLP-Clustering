Larger health systems require significant investment to build and equip these facilities, and minor changes in interest rates and finance terms can make a big difference in borrowing costs. This has led some nonprofit healthcare systems to establish investor relations positions similar to those found in large for-profit corporations, holding investor briefing calls and \u201croadshows\u201d to meet with investors and bond analysts.\n\nThis outreach is important because the investors and bond analysts are nervous about the future ability of health systems to repay bondholders and frustrated by what they see as a lack of transparency. According to a recent study, more than half of U.S. hospitals lose money on patient care, and many of those who make money don\u2019t make a lot. Shrinking gross margin percentages are masked by large gross margin dollar amounts reported by health systems. Bond issuers attempting to assess risk\u2014a key factor in setting interest rates and fees\u2014find that key financial information like outstanding bank loans isn\u2019t required to be reported to regulatory bodies. As reported in the Wall Street Journal, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s alarming to these public bondholders that there\u2019s not more information made available,\u2019 said John Cheney, a managing director at health-care financial adviser Ponder & Co.\u201d The health systems going to the trouble of travelling the country meeting with investors and analysts are sympathetic, but sometimes reluctant to share detailed financial and performance information for fear of losing competitive advantage. One health system CFO said, \u201cOur competitors are mining our data, as we look at theirs.\u201d\n\nSince the passage of the Affordable Care Act, hospital mergers and consolidations have become the norm. As NPQ has reported, the basic philosophy of the ACA is that both quality and cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery will be improved when patients are served over time by a coordinated provider network that can monitor health and promote wellness as well as treat illnesses. \u201cPopulation health management\u201d requires integrated health systems providing comprehensive care to large numbers of patients, spurring both hospital mergers and hospital closures.\n\nIt\u2019s unsettling but perhaps unsurprising that charitable nonprofit hospitals that have grown into charitable nonprofit multibillion-dollar integrated health care systems are adopting practices associated with the world\u2019s largest for-profit corporations. Investor relations efforts might make some wonder: Can a nonprofit grow out of being a nonprofit, and, if so, how and when?\u2014Michael Wyland", "article_metadata": {"description": "Large nonprofit hospitals are adopting the corporate tactic of courting investors in hope of more financing at better rates, leading to investor demands for more transparency.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/05/18/nonprofit-hospitals-acting-like-big-business-by-wooing-bond-investors/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "Large nonprofit hospitals are adopting the corporate tactic of courting investors in hope of more financing at better rates, leading to investor demands for more transparency.", "title": "Nonprofit Hospitals Acting Like Big Business by Wooing Bond Investors", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/05/18/nonprofit-hospitals-acting-like-big-business-by-wooing-bond-investors/", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2010/10/newswire_icon17.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mlwyland"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/05/18/nonprofit-hospitals-acting-like-big-business-by-wooing-bond-investors/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Management, News,  hospital closings,  hospital mergers,  nonprofit hospitals, Affordable Care Act, Foundation Investment, Healthcare, Mergers, transparency"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s unsettling but perhaps unsurprising that charitable nonprofit hospitals that have grown into charitable nonprofit multibillion-dollar integrated health care systems are adopting practices associated with the world\u2019s largest for-profit corporations.\nLarger health systems require significant investment to build and equip these facilities, and minor changes in interest rates and finance terms can make a big difference in borrowing costs.\n\u201cPopulation health management\u201d requires integrated health systems providing comprehensive care to large numbers of patients, spurring both hospital mergers and hospital closures.\nShrinking gross margin percentages are masked by large gross margin dollar amounts reported by health systems.\nInvestor relations efforts might make some wonder: Can a nonprofit grow out of being a nonprofit, and, if so, how and when?\u2014Michael Wyland"}
