But the ACA requires all state-run exchanges to be self-sustaining beginning Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nTo raise the funds to meet this requirement, District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray is reviewing a bill thatallows the city\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange Authority (HBX) to continue assessing a fee on all health carriers doing business in the city for an additional 225 days. On June 3, the D.C. Council unanimously approved the bill, the Health Benefit Exchange Authority Financial Sustainability Temporary Amendment Act of 2014 , extending emergency legislation already in place.\n\nThe assessment, expected to be around 1 percent , will apply to all health carriers with direct gross receipts of $50,000 or more doing business in D.C., even if a carrier does not participate in D.C.s\u2019 health care exchange, D.C. Health Link. Revenue generated from the assessment will fund D.C. Health Link\u2019s $28 million proposed FY 2015 budget.\n\nHBX lauds the assessment as the funding option that is the \u201cmost fair\u201d way to pay for D.C. Health Link's operations, while having the least effect on premiums. If only those plans sold through the exchange were taxed (about 45,000), a 17 percent per-enrollee assessment would be necessary, drastically increasing the price of premiums.\n\nSome insurers are objecting to the assessment because federal law prohibits them from participating in the exchange. They also argue that it is unfair to tax carriers not participating in the exchange as a way to pay the costs of operating the exchange when they receive no benefit from it.\n\nBut others counter that an assessment is warranted on all carriers because they will benefit when they sell supplemental coverage to consumers participating in the exchange. \u201cInsurers who benefit and profit\u2014not the taxpayers\u2014should pay [to fund the exchange],\u201d said Mila Kofman, executive director of HBX.\n\nThe bill is subject to a 30-day congressional review period once it receives approval from the Mayor. Once approved by congress, the legislation is in effect for 225 days, while the D.C. council enacts a permanent version.\n\nHBX is looking at mid-July for the first assessment because it needs funds before FY 2015 begins Oct. 1. HBX adopted emergency regulations at their June 11 meeting establishing an appeals process for carriers who dispute the amount they have been assessed (not whether they should be subject to the assessment).\n\nThe District of Columbia may be opening itself up to a legal challenge and \u201csuch action may be necessary in order to . . . forestall broader detriment to the District of Columbia insurance market and its citizens,\u201d according to the American Council of Life Insurers.\n\nInsurance carriers have not taken legal action yet, but the next few months will be the time to see if D.C.'s unique exchange funding plan survives and what the reaction of carriers and consumers will be.\n\nContinue the discussion on Bloomberg BNA\u2019s State Tax Group on LinkedIn : Is it fair for all health insurance carriers to pay the assessment even if they do not participate in the health care exchange?\n\nFor more information about this and other state tax issues, sign up for a free trial of the Bloomberg BNA Premier State Tax Library.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/extras-excise-dcs-b17179891394/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The District of Columbia and other states that established insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were aided by federal funds for the first few years.
