As we recently reported, tele-health or technology-assisted remote care is a particularly hot space. This trend includes tele-psychiatry, which offers a more affordable way for patients to connect with a therapist on a secure video line.\n\nRegroup is one of a handful of fast-growing startups in the tele-psychiatry category, which also includes Palo Alto, Calif.-based Breakthough.\n\nToday, Regroup is launching to the public, with well over a dozen mental health professionals on board. You won\u2019t just find psychiatrists on Regroup \u2014 but life coaches and fertility specialists too.\n\nAccording to Chicago-based chief executive David Cohn, it\u2019s a huge market opportunity, given that roughly 62 million adults in the United States have a mental condition.\n\nOn Regroup, anyone with a webcam and an Internet connection can request a private session with a therapist, or join an upcoming session. You don\u2019t need to have a diagnosed disorder to talk to a therapist on Regroup \u2014 anyone can sign up.\n\nPrices for group and private sessions vary \u2014 it costs roughly $100 to $150 for a 30 minute video chat.\n\nIn the past, it would have cost you thousands of dollars out of pocket to regularly chat with a therapist on the Internet. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there [as] in the vast majority of cases, insurance will cover one of these sessions,\u201d said Cohn.\n\nNow in 23 states, insurance providers are required to reimburse people for online health services. In addition, the Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance providers offer coverage for these patients that is \u201ccomparable to coverage for general medical and surgical care\u201d beginning in 2014.\n\nRegroup is growing quickly, with traffic increasing 60 percent month over month.\n\nSome experts are concerned that services like Regroup will lead to a rise in misdiagnoses. Psychiatrists might miss the subtle signs of an underlying condition on a video stream, as it\u2019s easier to interpret body language in person.\n\nAt UC Davis, researchers just received a $2.5 million grant to study videotaped interviews with patients, and assess whether the quality of care is any better or worse than a visit to the therapist\u2019s office.\n\nCohn doesn\u2019t dismiss this argument entirely, but stresses that one of the advantages of telepsychiatry is that it\u2019s low touch. The stigma around mental health treatment has not abated in the U.S.. Some patients might feel more comfortable chatting with a therapist in their own home.\n\nCohn stresses that the connection is secure, given that Regroup\u2019s team of engineers hacked their own video technology, using open source communication project WebRTC.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, not seeing your therapist is like not having your teeth cleaned,\u201d said Cohn, whose wife is from Argentina, where most people see a therapist on a regular basis. \u201cWe are going to be part of what makes that happen here,\u201d he said.\n\nRegroup has raised $200,000 from an anonymous angel investor in Tennessee. The company plans to raise a first round of funding in the near future, so it can expand its team of marketing professionals and engineers.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2013-11-01T08:37:07+00:00", "author": "christina-farr", "modDate": "2013-11-01T08:37:07+00:00", "keywords": "affordable-care-act,chicago-startups,mental-health-startups,psychology,regroup,telehealth,telemental-health,therapy,top-stories", "type": "news", "id": 851651}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Regroup is one of a handful of fast-growing startups that are making it easier to chat with a therapist on a secure video line.", "title": "How Regroup is bringing the shrink\u2019s couch online\u00a0(exclusive)", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/01/how-regroup-is-bringing-the-shrinks-couch-online-exclusive/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/regroup-team-780x363.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Regroup is one of a handful of fast-growing startups that are making it easier to chat with a therapist on a secure video\u00a0line.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe37ca\"", "article_summary": "Today, Regroup is launching to the public, with well over a dozen mental health professionals on board.\nSmart investors and entrepreneurs are considering the new opportunities created by health care reform.\nThe stigma around mental health treatment has not abated in the U.S..\nYou don\u2019t need to have a diagnosed disorder to talk to a therapist on Regroup \u2014 anyone can sign up.\nRegroup is one of a handful of fast-growing startups in the tele-psychiatry category, which also includes Palo Alto, Calif.-based Breakthough."}
