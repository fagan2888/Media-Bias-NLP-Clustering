And to Sen. Marco Rubio specifically, a few moments later: \u201cSince you aren\u2019t a fan of all [the government\u2019s] giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Rubio responded:\n\nIf I thought raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay I would be all for it, but it isn\u2019t. In the 21st century, it\u2019s a disaster. If you raise the minimum wage you\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that\u2019s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. Here is the best way to raise wages: Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business. Tax reform, and regulatory reform. Bring our debt under control. Fully use our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing. Repeal and replace Obamacare and make higher education faster and easier to access\u2014especially vocational training.\n\nHere\u2019s how he clinched it, to rousing applause:\n\nFor the life of me I don\u2019t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.\n\nHere\u2019s the one big problem with that statement: Philosophy and Religion teachers postsecondary earn a mean annual wage of about $70,000. Welders, cutters, solderers and brazers take home closer to $40,000. Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAlison Griswold is a Slate staff writer covering business and economics.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sorry, Marco Rubio: Philosophers make way more money than welders", "Description": "Rubio was wrong, welders earn little more than half the annual wage of philosophers", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Slate", "author": "Slate", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "It was the first question of the GOP debate: Would you raise the minimum wage?
