His family says he suffers from a liver disease.\n\n\"He has a buildup of ammonia because he's not taking his medicine and he gets confused and forgetful,\" said Jim. \"He might appear normal otherwise.\"\n\nJim says that's possibly why he's gone. Search crews have looked downtown, in malls, fields, and wooded areas.\n\n\"We've had no luck whatsoever, but we don't want to give up,\" Jim said.\n\nThrough long days and sleepless nights, John's family has received several false sightings. Jim hopes in this season of giving, Wichitans will step up and help so they can widen the search.\n\n\"We want the surrounding communities to know and we're trying to get posters of him and social media and radio because he's got to be out there somewhere,\" he said.\n\nJohn Wilson is described as a 64-year-old man standing about 5'7\" and a medium build. He has brown shoulder length hair and a short beard. John was last seen wearing a brown baseball hat and an army green coat.\n\nIf you know where he is please call 9-1-1.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Instead of Christmas around the table with family, the Wilson's are out searching around south Wichita for their loved one.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Instead of Christmas around the table with family, the Wilson's are out searching around south Wichita for their loved one.", "title": "Search continues for missing Wichita man", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Search-continues-for-missing-Wichita-man-363529011.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/981/AE1/981AE1EDE35C447E9B76DE5FAEFAFE15", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D07/E4F/D07E4FA0403A4F4A90AB4EFEB52F262F.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Instead of Christmas around the table with family, the Wilson's are out searching around south Wichita for their loved one.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Search-continues-for-missing-Wichita-man-363529011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/John+Wilson.jpg", "title": "Search continues for missing Wichita man", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Search continues for missing Wichita man", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Search continues for missing Wichita"}, "article_summary": "John Wilson is described as a 64-year-old man standing about 5'7\" and a medium build.\n64-year-old John Wilson went missing 9 days ago.\nInstead of Christmas around the table with family, the Wilson's are out searching around south Wichita for their loved one.\nJohn's brother, Jim Wilson, and a search team have been looking for him every hour of daylight since he was last seen on a gas station's surveillance cameras walking southbound on Oliver.\nJim hopes in this season of giving, Wichitans will step up and help so they can widen the search."}
