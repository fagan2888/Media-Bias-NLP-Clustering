Accident damage caused by you or another driver You'll need optional collision insurance to repair or replace your car after an accident.\n\n4. Damage from striking a deer or other animal Comprehensive is required if you hit a deer. Or have other problems caused by animals, such as marauding bears eager for loot.\n\n5. Damage from hitting a pole in the parking lot Parking lot accidents can sneak up on you, especially during the heavy shopping days surrounding the holidays. What if you hit a pole or another obstacle while maneuvering through a crowded lot? You'll need collision coverage.\n\n6. Replacing a stolen vehicle Stolen car? You'll need comprehensive. \"It covers the theft of your whole vehicle and parts or equipment that are permanently attached or installed to your vehicle,\" Gusner says.\n\n7. Flooding damage Comprehensive covers it, which is especially important in high rainfall or hurricane regions like Florida and the Gulf states. Beyond flooding damage, comprehensive can also help with havoc from tornadoes and even volcanic eruptions.\n\n8. Damages caused by an uninsured driver Salvatore says drivers should consider adding uninsured motorist (UM) or underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) to their policy. She explains that UM coverage will reimburse you, a member of your family, or a designated driver for bodily injuries caused by an uninsured motorist or a hit-and-run driver. UIM comes into play when an at-fault driver has insufficient insurance to pay for your total loss. UIM also provides coverage if you're walking and hit by a car.\n\n(Photo: KellyNelson / Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mark Chalon Smith", "description": "Minimum liability car insurance is a great bargain ... until you actually have to use it.", "og": {"url": "http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2015/03/16/10-things-drivers-have-to-pay-for-when-they-only-h", "image": "http://media.propertycasualty360.com/propertycasualty360/article/2015/03/10/accident-injuries.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Minimum liability car insurance is a great bargain ... until you actually have to use it.", "title": "10 things drivers have to pay for when they only have minimum liability insurance"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minimum liability car insurance is a great bargain ... until you actually have to use it.", "title": "10 things drivers have to pay for when they only have minimum liability insurance", "image": {"src": "http://media.propertycasualty360.com/propertycasualty360/article/2015/03/10/accident-injuries-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "creator": "@PC_360", "site": "@PC_360", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-16", "sailthru.tags": "propertycasualty360, article, 54ff48c6150ba0b47d414049, Slideshow, Personal Lines,Auto,Coverage Issues, minimum liability,car insurance,liability limits,comprehensive coverage,collision cover", "keywords": "Personal Lines, Coverage Issues, Auto, insurance policy, food, insurance claims, Insurance Research Council, National Fire Protection Association, insurance laws, car insurance, Insure.com, Penny Gusner, Stolen car, Federal Highway Administration, collision insurance, Michael Barry, Jeanne M.
