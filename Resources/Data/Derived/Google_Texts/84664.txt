Since Oct. 1, more than 68,000 Rhode Islanders – roughly 6.5% of the state’s population – have signed up for health insurance through HealthSource RI, the state’s new Obamacare marketplace. But two-thirds of them have enrolled in a program that was actually created by Lyndon Johnson, not Barack Obama.

Medicaid, the government health program for low-income Americans, has gotten the majority of sign-ups on HealthSource RI: 48,602 of the 68,292 Rhode Islanders who used the new marketplace to enroll through March 8 were added to the state’s Medicaid rolls. (Even that may understate the Medicaid share, since 3,345 of the 19,690 who signed up for private insurance plans hadn’t paid their first premiums yet.)

In fact, while December was HealthSource RI’s biggest month for private insurance enrollment so far, the most recent reporting period from Feb. 12 to March 8 was actually the biggest one yet for Medicaid. The deadline to sign up for private plans for 2014 is March 31, but there is no deadline to sign up for Medicaid.

Medicaid enrollment has already far surprised Rhode Island officials’ expectations, which was for 28,000 residents to sign up by Sept. 30. Here’s a chart that shows the pace of individual enrollment on HealthSource RI since the marketplace began accepting applications on Oct. 1:
