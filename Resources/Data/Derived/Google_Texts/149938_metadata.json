It just won\u2019t be present on Elk Avenue as it has been.\u201d\n\nDon and Kay were not necessarily growing weary of their 550 to 600 hours of annual, unpaid work managing the hall of fame and its 13-foot by 13-foot museum in the back of the Crested Butte Mountain Heritage Museum. But the call earlier this year from the mountain-bike pioneers out in Marin County was enticing.\n\nA cadre of late 1970s Hall of Famers \u2014 Joe Breeze, Otis Guy and Marc Vendetti \u2014 were planning the Marin Museum of Bicycling in Fairfax, Calif. They had an entire floor that could support the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and Museum \u2014 a space ten times bigger than the Crested Butte space. Millions of visitors walk and ride across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County every year.\n\nAnd mountain biking \u2014 while it thrived in Crested Butte, driven by off-roading tinkerers who merged ten-speeds, single-speed paperboy cruisers and motorcycle parts into stout Frankenstein bikes in the early 1970s \u2014 was birthed in Marin County.\n\n\u201cThis was an opportunity for the museum to be visited by millions more people in a town that is responsible for the sport of mountain biking. We couldn\u2019t stay in the way. It would be selfish and self-centered to try to keep it anchored here,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWhat is the best scenario for the history of this American-born sport? A lot of the roots and cause of mountain biking came from Fairfax.\u201d\n\nLanding the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and Museum is a coup for the Marin County riders who have spent years dreaming of a place to acknowledge the region\u2019s role in mountain biking, which has grown from a handful of adrenaline junkies in Northern California to 40 million annual participants.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a perfect fit to have the hall of fame here,\u201d said Marc Vendetti, who was among the first cyclists to push balloon-tired clunkers up the slopes of Marin\u2019s Mount Tamalpais and then race down rutted fire roads. \u201cEveryone here is really excited. The town council and the local chamber are really behind it. It will be a celebration of cycling, really. We hope to create a place for cycling that can help promote not just the sport but the cycling lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe move certainly leans the decades-old argument over the birth of mountain biking toward California. But don\u2019t discount Crested Butte just because of the museum move, Cook said.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that all those pioneering California riders trekked to Crested Butte every year in the 1970s and 1980s to race in the Pearl Pass Tour to Aspen, which celebrates its 37th year this weekend and is recognized as the oldest mountain-bike tour in the world.\n\n\u201cThey had the technology but we had the terrain and they knew it. They all came out here to ride and they recognized that our terrain makes better equipment. They had their clunkers, which were good for braking and controlled downhill but they would have stayed clunkers had it not been for Crested Butte. Crested Butte will always have its place. It was the first destination for mountain biking.\u201d\n\nThe Cooks will now focus more attentively on their restaurant, Donita\u2019s Cantina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a changing economy for ski resorts and mountain towns,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt\u2019s just super lean and we\u2019ve been lean since 2001. It\u2019s time to do what we probably should have done many years ago and focus our entire brainpower on our restaurant. I\u2019m very grateful though. I would never trade what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve taken this as far as we could and now it\u2019s time to hand it off.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Crested Butte\u2019s Mountain Bike Hall of Fame moving to California", "title": "Crested Butte\u2019s Mountain Bike Hall of Fame moving to California", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/04/crested-buttes-mountain-bike-hall-of-fame-moving-to-california/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130904__MTBhall090413p1.jpg", "height": 402}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130904__MTBhall090413p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T12:51:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:01:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Crested Butte\u2019s venerable Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and Museum \u2014 a repository of fat-tire history and a shrine to the pioneers who first pedaled off-road \u2014 is moving to California.\nThey had an entire floor that could support the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and Museum \u2014 a space ten times bigger than the Crested Butte space.\nThey had their clunkers, which were good for braking and controlled downhill but they would have stayed clunkers had it not been for Crested Butte.\nA cadre of late 1970s Hall of Famers \u2014 Joe Breeze, Otis Guy and Marc Vendetti \u2014 were planning the Marin Museum of Bicycling in Fairfax, Calif.\nCrested Butte will always have its place."}
