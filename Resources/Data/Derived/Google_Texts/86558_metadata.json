You\u2019re on your own.\n\nRoofers and general contractors are not licensed in Texas, unlike in neighboring Gulf states such as Mississippi and Louisiana. So consumers must act like their own private detectives. Watchdog Dave Lieber says you need to know everything about the contractor you hire \u2014 past record, business reliability and so much more.Very few are ever convicted of crimes in Texas. Prosecutors see it as a business conflict for civil court. Yes, you\u2019re on your own.\n\nDOWNLOAD A COPY OF THE WATCHDOG\u2019s CHEAT SHEET TO HIRE GOOD PEOPLE HERE\n\n2. Use search engines to play detective\n\nAnyone who is a prospect should get a thorough search on Google and also a paid subscription website such as PublicData.com which costs $35 a year and allows you to find a person\u2019s civil and criminal record. Watchdog Dave Lieber says it\u2019s always better to know if the contractor dangling a contract in your face is a convicted thief before you sign on that dotted line.\n\n3. Use your smart phone camera.\n\nA smart phone is a great consumer protector, The Watchdog says. Use the video camera, still camera and audio recorder to capture important moments in transactions. Take photos of everyone you deal with, their car license plate, etc. Let them know you keep track. They are less likely to mess with you. Best idea from Watchdog colleague Marina Trahan Martinez is to take photos of their ID cards and even their driver\u2019s license.\n\n4. Roofers tells two lies. Here\u2019s #1\n\nSome \u2014 not all \u2014 roofers in Texas like to tell customers, \u201cHire me and I\u2019ll pay your deductible.\u201d Sounds great. What a deal. Only it\u2019s illegal under Texas law. Some roofers, especially the out-of-state guys, don\u2019t know. Others do know, and they do it anyway.\n\n5. Roofer lie #2\n\nSome roofers promise that they\u2019ll get the best deal for a homeowner with an insurance company. They\u2019ll handle the details. The only problem with that is it\u2019s illegal in Texas. A roofing company can\u2019t negotiate any details with an insurance company. That\u2019s the job of the homeowner, a licensed public adjuster, a construction consultant or a lawyer. But not a roofer. Still, some brag that they do it. They either know about the law and don\u2019t care or they don\u2019t know.\n\nAttendees receive a tip sheet showing best practices when hiring a contractor or a roofer. Want to read the tip sheet?
