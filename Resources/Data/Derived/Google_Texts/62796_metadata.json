He suffered major chest injuries. His vital signs were crashing.\n\nThis was not just another day in the hospital. It was a laboratory billed as the \u201cOR of the future,\u201d an ongoing experiment aimed at breaking down barriers that bog down care through open communication, better use of technology and teamwork.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn reality, trauma care is rarely this organized. But those who are prized for individual skills are increasingly learning that when it comes to treating trauma patients from accidents, natural disasters or terrorist bombings, communication and coordination can determine whether someone lives or dies.\n\nAt an office building less than a mile from the main Cedars-Sinai campus, doctors are guinea pigs in simulations designed to test such skills.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cmission control\u201d room filled with video screens where trainers keep track of the action. The walls are see-through. Open workspaces are favored over cubicles.\n\nAt the heart of the lab is a room that could be outfitted as the ER, operating room or intensive care unit \u2014 depending on the practice of the day. Medical simulation labs have evolved over the years, from simple lifelike models of body parts that doctors train on to full-blown replications of hospital rooms where trainees can practice different situations. The Cedars-Sinai space strives to speed up trauma care by eliminating workflow disruptions and honing communication skills.\n\n\u201cHealth care today is delivered more by teams rather than by individuals. We have to educate folks in teamwork skills,\u201d said William McGaghie, who heads a professional training institute at Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division.\n\nRegistered nurse Anna Doyle is used to working with doctors who parachute into the latest crisis, whether it\u2019s tending to the victim of a gunshot wound or rollover accident. It\u2019s often a chaotic scene, and not everyone takes the time to get to know one another.\n\nDuring a recent rehearsal, a resident piped up and asked for everyone\u2019s names. For a second, it felt like the first day of school as introductions were made.\n\nDoyle said she found the introductions calming \u2014 even if it was just practice.\n\n\u201cWe had a personal moment \u2026 that never happens,\u201d said Doyle, acknowledging that there\u2019s always a line of walking wounded in an emergency.\n\nArmed with a $4 million grant from the Defense Department, doctors and nurses at Cedars-Sinai have been testing ways to improve trauma care by running simulations at the newly opened lab that oozes tech startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a place for experimentation,\u201d surgeon-in-chief Dr. Bruce Gewertz said.\n\nBefore the lab opened, Gewertz and his colleagues followed real trauma patients from the moment they were unloaded from the ambulance to their transfer to the ICU. Along the way, the team documented obstacles that slowed down care: Too many people spoke at the same time, prompting a nurse to ask a resident to speak up. A patient went for a CT scan only to find another patient already in the scanner. A resident\u2019s cellphone rang while scrubbing in.\n\nMost of the time, researchers found, delays in care were caused by a lack of communication and logistical hurdles.\n\nThe goal is to get everyone on the same page during the \u201cgolden hour,\u201d a concept borrowed from military medicine when time is of the essence.\n\nThe team recently partnered with a consulting firm to develop an in-house iPhone app that displays a patient\u2019s vitals and blasts out the information to the trauma team as members are assembling. There\u2019s also a text-messaging feature that allows doctors and nurses swarming in from various parts of the hospital to communicate with one another before the patient arrives.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to determine how much it would cost if the app was part of routine care, but Gewertz said it\u2019ll be relatively inexpensive, involving the cost of the phones and a monthly license fee for protected data storage.\n\nOn a recent weekday, the team\u2019s cellphones buzzed with the condition of the first \u201cpatient\u201d of the day, the bus-crash victim.\n\nTypically, doctors don\u2019t know vitals until a nurse scrawls them on a whiteboard.\n\nApps can be helpful, allowing medical teams to \u201cknow the information en route so they\u2019re not coming in cold,\u201d said Pam Jeffries, president of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. Jeffries is not involved in the Cedars-Sinai effort.\n\nThe patient \u2014 a high-tech dummy \u2014 was wheeled in, moaning and complaining. Doctors and nurses sprang into action, ripping off the dummy\u2019s clothes and placing a breathing tube before transferring him.\n\nDespite the quick response, there were hiccups, mainly because of a lack of experience. Residents had trouble inserting the tube, and it took several tries to get it right.\n\nFor the second scenario, the team was not given advance information about the patient and kept going in circles asking for any details. A doctor said he heard it was a case of a pedestrian hit by a car.\n\n\u201cDo we know if it\u2019s male or female?\u201d another asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much more than auto versus\u201d pedestrian, the doctor said.\n\nThe chief resident said there\u2019s worry about internal injuries and to make sure blood supply and other essentials were ready.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, they also had to deal with a fire \u2014 simulated smoke from dry ice was pumped into the room. One called out for the fire alarm to be shut off while the rest prepared to move the patient to a gurney.\n\nIn the chaos, doctors didn\u2019t realize the wheel on the gurney was locked and wasted time fiddling.\n\nDespite the hiccups, the patients survived in both cases.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Armed with a $4 million grant from the Defense Department, doctors and nurses at Cedars-Sinai have been testing ways to improve trauma care by running simulations at the newly opened lab that oozes tech startup.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Armed with a $4 million grant from the Defense Department, doctors and nurses at Cedars-Sinai have been testing ways to improve trauma care by running simulations at the newly opened lab that oozes tech startup.", "title": "Defense Dept Grant Used To Speed Up Trauma Care With Smartphones", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/defense-dept-grant-used-to-speed-up-trauma-care-with-smartphones/187473/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Future-Operating-Room_Muha-795x534.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-25T10:24:16-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Armed with a $4 million grant from the Defense Department, doctors and nurses at Cedars-Sinai have been testing ways to improve trauma care by running simulations at the newly opened lab that oozes tech startup.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Future-Operating-Room_Muha-795x534.jpg", "title": "Defense Dept Grant Used To Speed Up Trauma Care With Smartphones", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "trauma care", "published_time": "2014-03-25T08:40:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-25T10:24:16-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1da\"", "article_summary": "Defense Dept Grant Used To Speed Up Trauma Care With SmartphonesArmed with a $4 million grant from the Defense Department, doctors and nurses at Cedars-Sinai have been testing ways to improve trauma care by running simulations at the newly opened lab that oozes tech startup.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorIn reality, trauma care is rarely this organized.\nThe Cedars-Sinai space strives to speed up trauma care by eliminating workflow disruptions and honing communication skills.\nBefore the lab opened, Gewertz and his colleagues followed real trauma patients from the moment they were unloaded from the ambulance to their transfer to the ICU.\nArmed with a $4 million grant from the Defense Department, doctors and nurses at Cedars-Sinai have been testing ways to improve trauma care by running simulations at the newly opened lab that oozes tech startup."}
