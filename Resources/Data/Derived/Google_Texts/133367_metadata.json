That can amount to thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe EEOC therefore had to reconcile that Obamacare provision with the prohibition on involuntary wellness programs, which is part of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nAlthough that landmark law \"limits the circumstances in which employers may ask employees about their health or require them to undergo medical examinations, it allows such inquiries and exams if they are voluntary and part of an employee health program,\" the EEOC said in a statement.\n\nThe agency added that the \"proposed rule makes clear that wellness programs are permitted under the ADA,\" and that \"companies may offer incentives of up to 30 percent of the total cost of employee-only coverage in connection with wellness programs.\"\n\nThe EEOC proposal would bar employers from firing, disciplining, coercing, or denying health coverage to employees who decline to participate in a wellness program.\n\nBUSINESS LOBBYING\n\nAbout 98 percent of U.S. companies with 200 or more workers, and 73 percent of smaller firms, offered wellness programs in 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Those numbers are up from 62 percent of larger firms and 26 percent of smaller firms offering such programs in 2006.\n\nWellness programs are generally managed by outside companies in what has become an $8 billion-a-year industry, research firm IBISWorld reported last month.\n\nReuters reported in November that leading U.S. corporations represented by the Business Roundtable, angered by the EEOC's legal action against Honeywell, were threatening to pull their tacit support for Obamacare unless the government backed off.\n\nSince then, the Business Roundtable has made meeting government officials about the issue \"a top priority,\" a senior official for the group said.\n\nThe Roundtable argues that wellness programs with hefty penalties are voluntary \"because employees can elect to participate or pay the penalty,\" said its outside counsel, Nancy Taylor.\n\nThe EEOC apparently agreed.\n\n\"Employers are going to be pretty happy about the proposed regulation,\" said Seth Perretta, a principal at Groom Law Group in Washington and an expert in employment law.\n\nIn a statement, Honeywell called the EEOC proposal \"a positive step toward enabling the implementation of the President's health care law and the desire of all Americans to lead healthier lives,\" and said no employee has been denied healthcare coverage \"or disciplined in any way as a result of their voluntary decision not to participate in our wellness programs.\"\n\nPatient advocacy and anti-discrimination groups, however, criticized the idea that a wellness program can be voluntary if opting out brings hefty financial penalties.\n\nThe EEOC proposal \"appears to diminish the protections that workers have against being coerced to disclose medical information to their employers when that information is unrelated to their ability to do their jobs,\" said attorney Jennifer Mathis of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n\nIf the EEOC proposal takes effect, employees who feel they are being coerced into workplace wellness programs could try to challenge it in court. In general, however, courts defer to federal agencies on such questions.\n\n(Editing by Michele Gershberg, Jonathan Oatis and Andre Grenon)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sharon Begley", "Author": "Sharon Begley", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "In what would be a significant and hard-fought victory for U.S. businesses, the Obama administration said on Thursday it will propose new rules for workplace wellness programs that would treat as voluntary even plans that penalize workers thousands of dollars for not participating.", "title": "Obama administration to remove hurdle to 'wellness' penalties", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
