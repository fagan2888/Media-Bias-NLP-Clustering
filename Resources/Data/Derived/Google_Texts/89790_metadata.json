It also would ask voters to extend the tax, which is set to expire in two years, until 2026.\n\nSupporters are hoping that the program\u2019s track record \u2014 it\u2019s given $55 million in tuition credits for 32,000 children to attend preschools \u2014 will make a stronger case this time with voters.\n\nProgram backers, including Mayor Michael Hancock, say the tax increase would reinstate axed summer programming, keep up with growing tuition, and accommodate increasing demand for full- or extended-day programs.\n\n\u201cOur school district benefits greatly by having all children who have participated in this program enter kindergarten ready to succeed,\u201d Cheryl Caldwell, Denver Public Schools\u2019 director of early childhood education, said during Monday\u2019s council meeting.\n\nMost speakers were affiliated with DPS or the Denver Preschool Program. No attendees testified against the proposal during the public hearing.\n\nJoMarie Garcia, the single mother of an incoming first-grader, hailed the program, saying she couldn\u2019t afford preschool otherwise. Her daughter finished preschool able to read, she said.\n\nBackers cite studies showing that children who have attended preschool with the program\u2019s help have made strides in kindergarten and beyond.\n\nOne study performed for the program showed that by the third grade, 64 percent of alumni were rated advanced or proficient in reading on standardized tests, versus 58 percent of Denver children who had not gone through the program. (Some may have attended preschools without the tuition credits.)\n\nThe council approved the proposed question 10-1.\n\nJeanne Faatz, who opposed the original preschool tax, voted no, saying the city shouldn\u2019t meddle in an area where federal, state and school district programs are at work.\n\nBut Chris Nevitt and several other council members called the preschool tax a proven investment.\n\nUnder the program, city families with 4-year-olds qualify for tuition credits based on economic need and the quality of the preschool they are seeking.\n\nA higher tax, supporters say, may enable the program to begin serving some 3-year-olds.\n\nThe increase would push the preschool sales tax to 0.15 percent, making Denver\u2019s combined sales tax rate 7.65 percent.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver City Council signs off on ballot measure to hike preschool tax", "title": "Denver City Council signs off on ballot measure to hike preschool tax", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/11/denver-city-council-signs-off-on-ballot-measure-to-hike-preschool-tax/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140728__denver-mayor-michael-hancockp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140728__denver-mayor-michael-hancockp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T14:31:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:34:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07c0\"", "article_summary": "The increase would push the preschool sales tax to 0.15 percent, making Denver\u2019s combined sales tax rate 7.65 percent.\nA ballot measure to extend and raise Denver\u2019s preschool sales tax is headed to voters after it won approval Monday night from the City Council.\nMost speakers were affiliated with DPS or the Denver Preschool Program.\nEight years ago, the current preschool sales tax of 12 cents per $100 purchase squeaked by, winning voters\u2019 approval by a 1.2 percent margin.\nBut Chris Nevitt and several other council members called the preschool tax a proven investment."}
