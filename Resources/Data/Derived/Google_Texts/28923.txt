EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Surrounded by five Giants greats, Bill Parcells was given his Pro Football Hall of Fame ring at halftime of Sunday’s game between the Broncos and New York.

Wearing his gold Hall of Fame jacket and with his Canton-bound bronze bust in front of him, the 72-year-old Parcells said it has been “a great life for me in the NFL.”

“At my age, I have a little more sensitivity and appreciation for the history of the game,” Parcells said, telling the sellout crowd at MetLife Stadium that the best thing for him was to be able to work in his own backyard with the team he grew up rooting for.

Parcells was elected to the hall this year and inducted last month.

Parcells led the Giants to the 1986 and 1990 NFL championships, the first over the Broncos in the Super Bowl.

He also took the New England Patriots to the 1997 Super Bowl, a loss to the Green Bay Packers. He coached the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, too, before retiring in 2006 — although he worked in the Dolphins’ front office for several seasons after that.

Parcells was joined at the ceremony by the other five living members of the Hall of Fame who played for the Giants: Y.A. Tittle, Frank Gifford, Sam Huff, Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson.

“Thank you for bringing championship football back to the New York Giants,” Carson said before Parcells was given his ring.

Leaving the field after the ceremony, Parcells stopped to hug Giants tight ends coach Mike Pope and current head coach Tom Coughlin. Pope was a member of Parcells’ staff for the Super Bowl wins in 1987 and 1991, while Coughlin was a receivers coach on the second one.
