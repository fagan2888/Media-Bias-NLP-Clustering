Otter made his remarks during a rare press Q and A in Boise Thursday.\n\nThe governor said tens of thousands of jobs are going unfilled in Idaho for a lack of educated or properly trained applicants.\n\n\u201cWhen they say to me, \u2018Butch which comes first, the chicken or the egg? Do we cut taxes to increase business or do we build the workforce,\u2019\u201d Otter said. \u201cQuite frankly, business isn\u2019t going to come if they don\u2019t have a workforce.\u201d\n\nReacting to the governor\u2019s remarks, Republican Speaker of the House Scott Bedke insisted there is room in the state budget to do both tax cuts and a school funding boost.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican-controlled Idaho House passed a modest trim to state personal and corporate income tax rates and increased a credit for low-income earners.\n\nAlso Thursday, an Idaho state House committee began consideration of Otter\u2019s plan to provide subsidized health insurance to more low income Idahoans. Republican lawmakers in Idaho have steadfastly refused to expand Medicaid at federal expense to cover this population at just above poverty level.\n\nOtter said he understands the ideological opposition to Obamacare, so he proposed a state-funded program as a fallback.\n\n\u201cThe question is no longer, \u2018do we need to do something?\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018where are we going get the money?\u2019\u201d the govern said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great and important step forward that we haven\u2019t had since Obamacare fell on us.\u201d\n\nThe proposed state program covers doctor\u2019s office visits, but not prescription drugs or hospitalization as Medicaid would. It has an ongoing cost of $30 million per year. That price tag has given members of the legislature pause and it\u2019s not clear what will happen next.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government and Politics", "description": "Idaho Governor C.L. \"Butch\" Otter is voicing skepticism that his fellow Republicans in the state legislature can both cut income taxes and do justice to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nwnewsnetwork.org/post/idaho-governor-weighs-mid-session-tax-cuts-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/northwestnews/files/styles/medium/public/201405/butch_otter.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Idaho Governor C.L. \"Butch\" Otter is voicing skepticism that his fellow Republicans in the state legislature can both cut income taxes and do justice to", "title": "Idaho Governor Weighs In Mid-Session On Tax Cuts, Medicaid Expansion"}, "story_id": 466480792, "twitter": {"site": "@nwNewsNetwork", "card": "summary", "creator": "@TomBanse"}, "author": "Tom Banse", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Idaho Governor Weighs In Mid-Session On Tax Cuts, Medicaid Expansion"}, "nid": 501431, "datePublished": "2016-02-11", "keywords": "butch otter, obamacare, medicaid, education spending, taxes", "wordCount": 336, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d7f\"", "article_summary": "Also Thursday, an Idaho state House committee began consideration of Otter\u2019s plan to provide subsidized health insurance to more low income Idahoans.\nEarlier this month, the Republican-controlled Idaho House passed a modest trim to state personal and corporate income tax rates and increased a credit for low-income earners.\nThe governor said tens of thousands of jobs are going unfilled in Idaho for a lack of educated or properly trained applicants.\n\"Butch\" Otter is voicing skepticism that his fellow Republicans in the state legislature can both cut income taxes and do justice to public education.\nRepublican lawmakers in Idaho have steadfastly refused to expand Medicaid at federal expense to cover this population at just above poverty level."}
