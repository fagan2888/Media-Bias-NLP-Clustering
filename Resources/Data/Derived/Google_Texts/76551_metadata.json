(AP) - Some Connecticut taxpayers might receive income tax refunds a few weeks later than expected as state revenue officials verify that fraudulent returns are not being submitted.\n\nKevin Sullivan, commissioner of the Department of Revenue Services, said the agency has narrowed questionable refunds to less than 1 percent of those requested. He did not say how many refunds are involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to get it back late rather than not all,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing taxpayers may have to learn to live with is slower refunds and greater security.\u201d\n\nSullivan said officials responded in part after hackers broke into a database of insurer Anthem Inc. that held information of about 80 million people and TurboTax, the country\u2019s most popular do-it-yourself tax preparation software, temporarily halted the processing of state tax returns because of an increase in fraudulent filings.\n\nVerification letters will be sent to the taxpayer\u2019s address on file and will direct taxpayers to the DRS website at www.ct.gov/DRS .\n\nSullivan said the agency has received several calls and emails from people who say they did not file a 2014 state income tax return but received a check.\n\nFederal and state tax officials blame breaches, identity theft, phishing and other forms of cybercrime for attempts to fraudulently claim refunds.\n\nTo help combat the problem, Connecticut tax officials are issuing refunds in the form of checks, rather than direct deposit, to first-time tax filers. An electronic deposit is \u201cgone instantaneously,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nVerenda Smith, deputy director at the Federation of Tax Administrators, said the association of state and municipal tax agencies speaks monthly with state tax officials to share information on finding and stopping tax fraud.\n\nData breaches add to the problem, she said.\n\n\u201cThe more information on you that\u2019s out there and has been stolen the more somebody is in the market for buying stolen information they can use to make fake returns more legitimate,\u201d Smith said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some Connecticut taxpayers might receive income tax refunds a few weeks later than expected as state revenue officials verify that fraudulent returns are not being submitted.", "Author": "STEPHEN SINGER", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/23/connecticut-taxpayer-refunds-delayed-by-fraud-veri/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Some Connecticut taxpayers might receive income tax refunds a few weeks later than expected as state revenue officials verify that fraudulent returns are not being submitted.", "title": "Connecticut taxpayer refunds delayed by fraud verification"}, "twitter": {"title": "Connecticut taxpayer refunds delayed by fraud verification", "description": "Some Connecticut taxpayers might receive income tax refunds a few weeks later than expected as state revenue officials verify that fraudulent returns are not being submitted.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf796\"", "article_summary": "Federal and state tax officials blame breaches, identity theft, phishing and other forms of cybercrime for attempts to fraudulently claim refunds.\nTo help combat the problem, Connecticut tax officials are issuing refunds in the form of checks, rather than direct deposit, to first-time tax filers.\nHARTFORD, Conn.
