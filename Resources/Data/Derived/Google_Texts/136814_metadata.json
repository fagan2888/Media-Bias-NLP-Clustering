But there are still millions in the state without health insurance. Undocumented people don\u2019t qualify for Obamacare benefits. Many others still find coverage too expensive, or face other obstacles in enrolling.\n\nOne of those people is Leaburn Alexander. I meet up with him at 6 a.m. as he is finishing his shift as the night janitor at a hotel near the San Francisco Airport. He clocks out just in time to catch the hotel\u2019s shuttle back to SFO, where he will catch a bus.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m on the beginning of my commute,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAfter an eight hour shift, my commute is like 2 and a half hours.\u201d\n\nI accompany Alexander on his commute to East Palo Alto, about 20 miles south. It actually takes three hours, on the hotel shuttle plus three more buses. He does this commute 5 days a week.\n\nAlexander doesn\u2019t have a car. The train would be faster, but cost three times as much. Alexander has no wiggle room in his budget.\n\nHe says he makes just under $11 an hour, and after taxes, child support and other expenses, he brings home just enough to cover rent. And all the other bills? He has a second job to cover those. His wife has been looking for work for over a year, and his oldest daughter is in college. Alexander doesn\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got this job,\u201d he says, of his night janitor position, \u201cthey informed me about different employee packages, different benefits and all that.\n\nBut Alexander says he can\u2019t afford the employee portion of the health insurance premium. Many people who are working lower wage jobs may qualify for Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid, if their incomes are low enough. But because Alexander had been turned down for Medi-Cal in the past, he presumed he still wouldn\u2019t qualify, even under Obamacare.\n\nEarlier this year, he went to get a physical at a community clinic, and they tried to sign him up for a county program. But even the $20 a month payment was too steep for his budget.\n\nWhile he\u2019d like to be insured, Alexander, 53, says he feels pretty healthy.\n\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s times where I\u2019d be tired from fatigue and my age, a little arthritis, but I still feel pretty good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what might be going on inside of me is a different story.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s blood pressure is high. He got free pills free from a clinic and plans to return when he runs out.\n\nThe only time in his adult life when he had health care was when he was incarcerated. He had substance abuse issues and was involved in a bank robbery. He says he had tried recovery programs, but didn\u2019t succeed, until he became a born-again Christian.\n\n\u201cThat was divine intervention. It really happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI been clean and sober since July, 2011.\u201d\n\nAnd so he\u2019s grateful for what he\u2019s got. He just doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019d get insurance right now.\n\nThe Remaining Uninsured\n\nUninsured Californians fall into a few categories, says Laurel Lucia with the U.C. Berkeley Labor Center. One is called the \u201cfamily glitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically spouses and children who can get coverage through a family member\u2019s employer but it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d she says.\n\nSometimes the employee part of the premium is affordable, but the family coverage is much higher. But because the employer made an offer of insurance to family members, \u201c(w)hen they go to Covered California they\u2019re told they\u2019re ineligible for subsidies,\u201d Lucia says. It\u2019s part of federal policy.\n\nA second uninsured group is Californians who are eligible for subsidies through Covered California \u2014 but still find the premiums unaffordable.\n\nFinally, Lucia says there may be nearly one million Californians who are eligible for Medi-Cal but don\u2019t know it, or have had difficulties enrolling.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly which category Alexander may fit into.\n\nThe Enrollment Counselor\u2019s Perspective\n\nOver in East Palo Alto, Irais Bazan is an enrollment and eligibility manager at the Ravenswood Family Health Clinic. Bazan has met people in all of those uninsured categories \u2014 and more.\n\n\u201cSituations can change at any minute,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019re adamant with clients, any changes, as little as you may think\u201d must be reported right away. Things like adding a dependent \u2014 or subtracting one, if you are no longer declaring a child as a dependent on your taxes. Or even small changes in income may make a difference.\n\n\u201cYou have to come back, let us know,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes these rules for these programs change.\u201d\n\nAnd someone who thought they weren\u2019t eligible for Medi-Cal or Covered California subsidies before may be eligible now. That may describe Leaburn Alexander. But while coming back to the clinic sounds like a minor hassle, for him, it\u2019s a big barrier.\n\n\u201cScheduling time to do that, an appointment. It\u2019s kind of rough, kind of hard right now,\u201d Alexander says.\n\nJust as Alexander has no wiggle room in his budget, he has precious little wiggle room in his schedule. After he wraps his overnight janitor job, he heads to a second job, washing dishes at a Stanford dining hall. He says he gets his sleep in 20 and 30 minute naps on his hours-long daily commute.\n\nHe has one full morning off each week, the only time he could meet with an enrollment counselor to update his family status, present income verification for himself and his wife, and see if he qualifies for health coverage. But that time is taken up with other needs of daily life.\n\n\u201cCome Wednesday,\u201d he says, about his morning off, \u201cthat\u2019s when my pastor comes and gets us and takes us grocery shopping.\u201d\n\nAlexander remains optimistic that his situation will improve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that through prayer that God will bless me with a better paying job,\u201d he told me. \u201cI got a feeling, that\u2019s coming. Because He knows my situation.\u201d\n\nAlexander hopes that job will be closer to home, and that he\u2019ll have the time and money to get health coverage.\n\nLisa Morehouse produced this story while participating in The California Endowment Health Journalism Fellowships, a program of USC\u2019s Annenberg School of Journalism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meet an East Palo Alto man who works two jobs. $20 a month for health insurance was too expensive for him.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Remaining Uninsured Face Challenges in Cost and Simply Signing Up\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/09\\/12\\/remaining-uninsured-face-challenges-in-cost-and-simply-signing-up\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-12 07:48:42\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-23 16:31:43\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21509,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\",\"Uninsured\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/09\\/LeaburnAlexander-e1410531393794.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Meet an East Palo Alto man who works two jobs. $20 a month for health insurance was too expensive for him.", "title": "Remaining Uninsured Face Challenges in Cost and Simply Signing Up", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/09/12/remaining-uninsured-face-challenges-in-cost-and-simply-signing-up/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/09/LeaburnAlexander-640x427.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california,uninsured", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A second uninsured group is Californians who are eligible for subsidies through Covered California \u2014 but still find the premiums unaffordable.\nThe Enrollment Counselor\u2019s PerspectiveOver in East Palo Alto, Irais Bazan is an enrollment and eligibility manager at the Ravenswood Family Health Clinic.\nSometimes the employee part of the premium is affordable, but the family coverage is much higher.\nBut there are still millions in the state without health insurance.\nBy Lisa MorehouseWhen the Affordable Care Act rolled out last fall, Californians enrolled in both Covered California and expanded Medi-Cal in high numbers."}
