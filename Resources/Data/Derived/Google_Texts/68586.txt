This is the barrel where Michelle Hansen found a dog that appeared to have been beaten to death in Marana. (Source: Tucson News Now)

A Marana woman has dealt with people dumping trash in the desert near her home but her latest discovery has her saying enough is enough.

Michelle Hansen found a dead dog in a barrel in the Marana desert when she was out riding an ATV just a few days ago.

It had some head trauma and other wounds on its body, she said. She believes that someone killed the dog.

She has no idea who did this, but said hopefully nearby pet owners keep an eye on their pets so this doesn't happen to them.

"Someone could have just taken this animal out of their yard or it could have been out on the street and someone could have just took it," Hansen said.

She buried the dog and named her Grace. She said the name is fitting because despite its appearance, there was a certain beauty about the dog.

"I think they (the dog's owners) have the right to know their animal is in a good place and that I cared enough to, not really save it, but her pride and dignity, whatever she had as an animal," Hansen said.

She has reported the dead dog to the authorities.
