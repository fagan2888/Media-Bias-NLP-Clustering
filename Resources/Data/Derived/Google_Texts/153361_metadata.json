Hundreds of people, mostly family members and neighbors of the couple, are hosted at lavish meals over a number of days, adding to the cost.\n\nSavani said the wedding and gifts for the 151 couples would cost more than 50 million rupees ($750,000), with around 100,000 guests joining in the three days of festivities that ended Sunday.
