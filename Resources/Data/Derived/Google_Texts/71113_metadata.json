Older voters remain opposed, but for the under-45s there's approval by more than two to one.\n\nTo my surprise, I found him unbothered. I sense that he knew that this would be the outcome.\n\nBut on abortion: no surrender.\n\nHe didn't expect any success in overturning Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision in the 1970s that allowed abortion, although he'd like to see it reversed, but he believed there was a cultural shift in America that would \"hollow it out\".\n\nIt was a conversation, intriguingly, in which he wanted to appear flexible (saying, for example, that hard line rhetoric on social questions \"didn't move the needle\").\n\nHe spoke about trying to find some common ground with liberal groups - on adoption, for example there's been some progress - but this was still politics in the raw.\n\nIt's from here that much of the toxic rhetoric about a Godless and misguided America has emerged. They talk about it as a cultural and constitutional heritage that must be defended.\n\nImage caption Colorado has legalised marijuana, which is sold in shops with taxes going to the state\n\nTwo hours north, beyond Denver, and in the lee of the high Rockies, the constitution is being put to a different use, by people who'd find themselves deeply out of sympathy with Mr Daly.\n\nColorado has legalised marijuana, and they talk of it in Boulder as a victory for the American way.\n\nI met a customer coming out of one of the shops where they sell cigarettes, tubs of marijuana truffles, and display all kinds of varieties as if they were a greengrocer's.\n\n\"I make a ton of money for the state of Colorado,\" the manager told me, through the tax that's imposed on every joint and hash brownie.\n\nDid he think that would mean that more states would follow them?\n\nHe laughed. Wasn't it obvious?\n\nThe governor, he supposed, was very pleased with him. and when they looked at the tax revenues, he thought other states would do it if they thought their voters would approve.\n\nI was struck, as always, by the passion with which liberals and conservatives fight for the pieces of the constitution that speak to them about America. In a sense they never leave the fundamental debate: what should the constitution mean now?\n\nImage caption Democratic senator Mark Udall (second right) and Congress candidate Andrew Romanoff are running against a strong Republican tide\n\nOn gun rights, for example, conservatives will try to stop any encroachment on what are known as \"second amendment rights\" - the right to bear arms.\n\nThe meaning of that amendment is hotly disputed among constitutionalists, but never mind.\n\nConservatives managed successfully to throw out two state senators last year - by means of the recall law that allows them to be defenestrated in mid-term - because they had proposed modest regulations in the Colorado legislature that would have limited the size of rifle magazines to 10 rounds and insisted on background checks on anyone buying a gun.\n\nThe point is the force of belief.\n\nListening to Senator Mark Udall, fighting to hold on to his seat against a strong Republican tide, it was striking how much this campaign, as so often in the United States, was coming back to fundamentals - pro-choice against pro-life on abortion, Obamacare versus a market system on health.\n\nBut there's one issue in Colorado that's fascinating, because it disturbs both sides.\n\nIt's a state in which everyone values the environment, a precious landscape and one that's needed by ranchers and farmers.\n\nSo Coloradans are alarmed by the increased incidence of extreme weather events - especially bush fires caused by drought, and flash floods - and they wonder about climate change.\n\nFor conservatives, climate science is regarded with extreme scepticism and even by some religious groups as an interference with God's plan, but they're aware of the public alarm at the predictions of changes in weather patterns that could have a profound effect.\n\nThey're alert to the subject, because in a mountain state the weather matters more.\n\nImage caption Colorado's governor John Hickenlooper watches President Obama playing pool in Denver\n\nLiberals are torn too. Colorado has opened itself up enthusiastically to fracking, the extraction of oil and gas under pressure to find reserves hitherto unexploited.\n\nThe claim by the energy companies is that it offers America the valuable prize of energy independence from the Middle East and will keep consumer prices low.\n\nBut for some, the presence of around 50,000 fracking sites across the state - about half of them in Weld County near Denver - is unacceptable.\n\nThe opponents believe that they are getting the first scientific evidence that the chemicals used in tracking are leaking, and are harmful to health.\n\nImage caption There are 50,000 fracking sites across Colorado\n\nThe energy companies are emphatic this is not true, and over the net few years they will battle it out with statistics, survey by survey.\n\nMeanwhile, there are many natural Democrats who are pulled towards the practical arguments - jobs and investment - while others remain unconvinced by the fracking arguments, and hostile to the rhetoric and the tactics of the big companies who're moving in and setting up fracking sites not only in wasteland, but near reservoirs and schools too.\n\nAll this makes Colorado a political laboratory. The Democrat governor, John Hickenlooper, is fighting a tough race and, in the run-up to polling day Mr Udall appears to be behind.\n\nColorado, which has become a swing state in recent years after many years as a solid Republican place, is unpredictable, but on Tuesday night might well abandon Barack Obama's party and turn red again.\n\nBut more interesting than the result is the fact that you can't leave there without reflecting on the extent to which voters are moved, now and in the preparations for the next presidential campaign in 2016, not so much by day-to-day employment figures or economic projections, but by belief.\n\nEveryone says they're fed up with politics and politicians, but they care.\n\nListen to the Today programme every morning from 06.00 GMT until 09.00 GMT or catch it later on the BBC iPlayer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#bb1919", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "description": "Americans are voting in mid-term elections which will decide who controls the Senate and pave the way for the 2016 race for the White House.
