Scott Applewhite\n\nOfficials in Rossville, Georgia have unanimously passed an ordinance to ban abortion clinics within the city limits, saying they\u2019re not interested in the \u201cdrama\u201d that comes along with offering reproductive health services.\n\nWhen reporters from the Times Free Press asked Mayor Teddy Harris why he put forth that ordinance, the lawmaker responded that he was simply thinking about what types of businesses he didn\u2019t want in his city. He doesn\u2019t think abortion clinics are \u201cappropriate\u201d because they\u2019ll bring \u201cdrama\u201d to Rossville.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a peaceful city,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have any protesters.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, 96 percent of the counties in Georgia don\u2019t have a single abortion clinic. Rossville is one of them. Since there aren\u2019t currently any abortion providers located there, Harris\u2019 ban is functioning as a preemptive measure. Anti-abortion groups are urging people to thank the mayor for his decision by contacting him directly.\n\nHarris is correct in suggesting that abortion clinics are often plagued by protesters. Persistent anti-abortion harassment outside of clinics often involves attempts to intimidate the women trying to enter, and sometimes even escalates into violence. For instance, back in 1997, there was an abortion clinic bombing in Atlanta, Georgia that injured six people.\n\nLike the Rossville mayor, some anti-abortion activists cite this uncertain atmosphere to argue that abortion clinics aren\u2019t appropriate businesses for quiet communities. But the \u201cdrama\u201d at abortion clinics isn\u2019t inherent to the patients and providers who spend time there. In reality, this conflict is a product of the protesters who insist on engaging in what they call \u201csidewalk counseling\u201d with the women visiting those reproductive health facilities. It\u2019s part of a coordinated strategy to make it too difficult to operate clinics. And now that abortion opponents are succeeding in driving clinics out of business, they\u2019re starting to target this harassment toward hospitals, too.\n\nRather than working to keep clinics out altogether, some areas have pursued a different type of solution to cut down on protests. Several states and cities have enacted \u201cbuffer zones\u201d around abortion clinics, helping to diffuse the tension by requiring protesters to stay a certain distance away from patients. But over the summer, the Supreme Court struck down Massachusetts\u2019 buffer zone law for going too far to impede protesters\u2019 free speech rights on public sidewalks, leaving officials scrambling to come up with different legislative fixes.\n\nFor women living in Georgia, potential protesters are just one of many barriers standing between them and their reproductive rights. The state \u2014 which is controlled by an anti-choice legislature and governor \u2014 has already imposed a mandatory 24-hour waiting period, a forced counseling session, a ban on insurance coverage for abortion, and unnecessary restrictions on abortion providers that make it more difficult for them to practice.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"We want to be a peaceful city.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"We want to be a peaceful city.\"", "title": "Mayor Bans Abortion Clinics From His City Because He Wants To Avoid \u2018Drama\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/12/3591241/mayor-georgia-abortion-clinic/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP399461318398.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We want to be a peaceful city.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP399461318398-321x214.jpg", "title": "Mayor Bans Abortion Clinics From His City Because He Wants To Avoid \u2018Drama\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP399461318398.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP399461318398.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-12T09:04:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Mayor Bans Abortion Clinics From His City Because He Wants To Avoid \u2018Drama\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\nLike the Rossville mayor, some anti-abortion activists cite this uncertain atmosphere to argue that abortion clinics aren\u2019t appropriate businesses for quiet communities.\nBut the \u201cdrama\u201d at abortion clinics isn\u2019t inherent to the patients and providers who spend time there.\nHe doesn\u2019t think abortion clinics are \u201cappropriate\u201d because they\u2019ll bring \u201cdrama\u201d to Rossville.\nHarris is correct in suggesting that abortion clinics are often plagued by protesters."}
