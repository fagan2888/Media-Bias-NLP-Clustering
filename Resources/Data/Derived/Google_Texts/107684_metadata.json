John Allen, who Obama appointed to craft the military effort against ISIS, is expected to step down from his position this November amid the U.S.\u2019s faltering efforts, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\n\nThe White House announcement comes just a month after incoming Marine Corps Commandant Lt. Gen. Robert Neller, testified the war is at a \u201cstalemate.\u201d\n\nTo turn this around, Petraeus urged Obama to escalate the military effort in Iraq through strengthened support for the Iraqi security forces, Sunni tribal forces and the Kurdish peshmerga, all of which are fighting against ISIS.\n\nThe administration should also embed U.S. advisers with Iraqi forces at the brigade level, he said, and \u201cexplore use of joint tactical air controllers with select Iraqi units to coordinate coalition airstrikes for those units.\u201d\n\nBut he warned that the military should \u201cexercise restraint\u201d to ensure it does not \u201ctake over Iraqi units,\u201d advising against American personnel being embedded at the Iraqi battalion level.\n\n\u201cI do not make recommendations for any kind of military action lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut inaction can also carry profound risks and costs for our national security.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former CIA Director David Petraeus returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to detail his strategy for the U.S. to escalate military involvement in Iraq and Syria.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Former CIA Director David Petraeus returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to detail his strategy for the U.S. to escalate military involvement in Iraq and Syria.", "title": "Petraeus Calls on US to Escalate Military Action in Iraq, Syria", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150922_Petraeus_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-01T09:21:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QwU4Hf"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Former CIA Director David Petraeus returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to detail his strategy for the U.S. to escalate military involvement in Iraq and Syria.", "title": "Petraeus Calls on US to Escalate Military Action in Iraq, Syria", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150922_Petraeus_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-09-22T19:06:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T09:21:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "David Petraeus, Senate Armed Services, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, Bashar al-Assad, John Allen"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec29\"", "article_summary": "Former CIA Director David Petraeus returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday for the first time since his 2012 resignation to detail his strategy for the United States to escalate military involvement in Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cI do not make recommendations for any kind of military action lightly,\u201d he said.\nIn testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Petraeus advised the U.S. to form enclaves in Syria protected by coalition airpower to strengthen support for moderate Sunni rebels, train additional forces, and provide haven for displaced Syrians.\nHe also urged the U.S. to take a hardline position against President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s indiscriminate barrel-bomb attacks that the Syrian Air Force continues to deploy across civilian areas.\n\u201cBut inaction can also carry profound risks and costs for our national security.\u201d"}
