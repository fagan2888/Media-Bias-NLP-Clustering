And while he is out touting the nation\u2019s lowest uninsured rate since 2008, a key problem has been neglected.\n\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians survey of 2,098 emergency-room doctors conducted in March showed about three-quarters said visits had risen since January 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported. This is a huge increase from a year earlier, when less than half of doctors surveyed reported an increase.\n\n\u201cMany doctors don\u2019t accept Medicaid patients because the state-federal coverage provides lower reimbursement rates than many private health-insurance plans.
