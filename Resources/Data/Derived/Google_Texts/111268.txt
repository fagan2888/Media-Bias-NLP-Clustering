Goodbye Bonnie’s Tracks, Peppermint Flake and Blue Moon ice cream — after 75 years the Bonnie Doon ice cream factory in Indiana is closing shop due primarily to Obamacare.

The company announced the declining economy and rising production costs as contributing to the decision; however, the encroaching implementation of the Affordable Care Act was the tipping point.

“It’s been a staple in the community for so long,” Adam Caroll, a Bonnie Doon employee of 21 years told Fox News.

“With the Obamacare it will just effect the business too much, so that was their main reason for shutting down the ice cream plant at this time.”

Many Indiana businesses fear the impending fiscal impact of Obamacare, Kyle Hannon, the Elkhart Chamber of Commerce president confirmed.

The Affordable Care Act requires “large employers” with more than 50 full-time workers to provide health care coverage. Businesses violating the mandate are penalized $2,000 for each uninsured employee.

“Company’s that were right on the edge of hiring more employees have held back because they don’t want to go over that magic fifty employee number….We’re still coming out of the recession, we’re doing very well. But you wonder how much better we could be doing now if people could hire large numbers without worrying about the implications,” Hannon said.

In addition, Obamacare cuts the hours of part-time workers and creates a larger base of full-time employees who require health care coverage. Previously, up to 34 hours a week was considered part-time. Now, anyone racking “on average at least 30 hours of service per week” will be characterized as a full-time worker.

The full economic impact of the Affordable Care Act on small businesses has yet to be seen.
