The Department of Health and Human Services announced that the new modification will preserve the the patient-provider relationship and ensure that individuals are not discouraged from seeking voluntary treatment.\n\nThis rule applies only to a small subset of HIPAA covered entities that either make the mental health determinations that disqualify individuals from having a firearm or are designated by their states to report this information to NICS. It also allows these entities to report only limited identifying, non-clinical information to the NICS.
