Rosie O’Donnell belts out a parody of the Grease song “There Are Worse Things I Can Do” while bashing presidential candidate Donald Trump.

The former talk show host made a surprise appearance at Disaster the Musical on Broadway on Thursday night (April 7) and sang the parody to help raise money for charity.

“When Seth [Rudetsky] said ‘would you do something at Disaster,’ I thought, ‘You know, what’s the biggest disaster?’ Out of all these talented singers and I’m the one singing for money, it doesn’t make sense,” Rosie said while introducing the performance.

In the parody, Rosie listed all of the “worse things” that Donald could do including build a wall, repeal Obamacare, do a weird thing with his hair, brag about his tiny hands, have bright orange skin, and much more.
