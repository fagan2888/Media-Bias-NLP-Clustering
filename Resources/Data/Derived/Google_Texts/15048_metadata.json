OEM serves as the agency\u2019s primary resource for development and coordination of strategic governance frameworks, execution, review, analysis, performance management and development of business requirements for enterprise level business solutions for CMS.\n\nTrenkle\u2019s decision comes as CMS and Department of Health and Human Services officials are coming under increasing pressure about the roll out of the HealthCare.gov website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much input Trenkle had in the development of the system. News reports suggest Henry Chao, who at one time was Trenkle\u2019s deputy and chief technology officer, is often cited as the lead technology manager behind the website.\n\nSenate Finance Committee members today interrogated HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the portal\u2019s problems. CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner received tough questions on Tuesday about the site\u2019s cybersecurity from members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nTrenkle in an interview with Federal News Radio in October 2012 said the Affordable Care Act gives CMS the opportunity to share services more easily. But didn\u2019t say he was in charge of the site\u2019s development.\n\nHe said CMS is leading an effort to develop the foundation for identity management, an enterprise portal, a master data management scheme and a business rules engine.\n\nTrenkle started at CMS in 2005 as the director of the Office of E-Health Standards and Services, where he was responsible for leading national programs for the development and implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and electronic prescribing standards.\n\nHe became CIO in December 2010 and oversaw the national operational infrastructure that supports CMS claims processing and other business services.\n\nBefore coming to CMS, Trenkle worked at the Social Security Administration where he oversaw the development and implementation of the agency\u2019s Internet on-line services for the public, including the first on-line retirement application. Prior to SSA, he was the General Services Administration\u2019s director of the Office of Electronic Commerce and the co-director of the Federal Electronic Commerce Program Office, where he led the federal implementation of standards and systems to support the first governmentwide electronic commerce initiatives including on-line procurement systems.\n\nAlong with Trenkle\u2019s move, Snyder said Niall Brennan, currently the director of the Office of Information Products and Data Analytics in the Office of Enterprise Management, will move into Nelson\u2019s role temporarily.\n\n\u201cNiall has extensive experience in working collaboratively across the enterprise since joining CMS in 2010, including regulation development, program implementation, advanced analytics and data infrastructure and governance,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSnyder also announced Tim Love, the deputy center director in the Center for Medicare, now is the acting deputy COO.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nAffordable Care Act gives CMS shared services a shot in the arm\n\nIT concerns at large agencies\n\nHealthCare.gov problems rekindle push for IT procurement reform", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "news_keywords": "cms, dave nelson, healthcare.gov, jason miller, michelle snyder, people, technology, tony trenkle", "application-name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "og": {"site_name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "description": "Tony Trenkle will leave as the CIO of CMS on Nov. 15 after eight years with the agency.", "title": "CMS CIO Trenkle leaving for private sector", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2013-11-07T05:29:11+00:00", "url": "http://federalnewsradio.com/management/2013/11/cms-cio-trenkle-leaving-for-private-sector/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "sailthru.canonical": "http://federalnewsradio.com/management/2013/11/cms-cio-trenkle-leaving-for-private-sector/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "All News", "tag": "CMS,Dave Nelson,HealthCare.gov,Jason Miller,Michelle Snyder,people,Technology,Tony Trenkle", "published_time": "2013-11-07T05:26:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T05:29:11+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-07 05:26:33", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Tony Trenkle, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief information officer, is leaving for the private sector.\n\u201cAs the CIO, Tony provided oversight and leadership to CMS\u2019 $2 billion annual expenditures on information technology (IT) products and services,\u201d she wrote.\nHe became CIO in December 2010 and oversaw the national operational infrastructure that supports CMS claims processing and other business services.\nRELATED STORIES:Affordable Care Act gives CMS shared services a shot in the armIT concerns at large agenciesHealthCare.gov problems rekindle push for IT procurement reform\nTrenkle in an interview with Federal News Radio in October 2012 said the Affordable Care Act gives CMS the opportunity to share services more easily."}
