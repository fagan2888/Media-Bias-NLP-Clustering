In April, a Kais\u00ader Fam\u00adily Found\u00ada\u00adtion poll found that bring\u00ading down pre\u00adscrip\u00adtion drug costs was a top pri\u00ador\u00adity for more Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans than re\u00adpeal\u00ading the health care law, 66 per\u00adcent to 60 per\u00adcent. This month, 72 per\u00adcent of all Amer\u00adic\u00adans and a ma\u00adjor\u00adity of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans said that pre\u00adscrip\u00adtion drug costs were un\u00adreas\u00adon\u00adably high. And, though it is one of the cent\u00adral pil\u00adlars of Obama\u00adcare, polling has fre\u00adquently found that more than half of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans sup\u00adport Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion in isol\u00ada\u00adtion from the over\u00adall law.\n\nThe Ohio gov\u00adernor is run\u00adning second to the in\u00addefatig\u00adable Don\u00adald Trump in New Hamp\u00adshire, the early-nom\u00adin\u00adat\u00ading state where Kasich\u2019s cam\u00adpaign has openly put al\u00admost all of its chips, per the latest Real Clear Polit\u00adics polling av\u00ader\u00adage. He\u2019s moved him\u00adself com\u00adfort\u00adably in\u00adto the top 10 na\u00adtion\u00adally after barely mak\u00ading the cut for the first de\u00adbate.\n\nBut as evid\u00adence emerges that Obama\u00adcare is not the polit\u00adic\u00adal flash point it once was, even among Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, Kasich is as\u00adcend\u00ading as an in\u00adcreas\u00adingly cred\u00adible chal\u00adlenger for the GOP pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial nom\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion.\n\nJohn Kasich\u2019s White House bid was nev\u00ader sup\u00adposed to go any\u00adwhere, giv\u00aden his great apostasy in the eyes of the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan base: his de\u00adcision to ex\u00adpand Medi\u00adcaid in Ohio un\u00adder the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act.\n\nOf course, Kasich isn\u2019t about to start say\u00ading nice things about \u201cObama\u00adcare\u201d be\u00adcause the law re\u00admains uni\u00adver\u00adsally un\u00adpop\u00adu\u00adlar with\u00adin the GOP, and his cam\u00adpaign isn\u2019t pub\u00adlicly wel\u00adcom\u00ading any ap\u00adpar\u00adent de\u00adcline in the polit\u00adic\u00adal pas\u00adsion about the law. From the start, Kasich has strained to dis\u00adtin\u00adguish between the whole law, in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal man\u00addate and all, and the par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlar pro\u00advi\u00adsion that he im\u00adple\u00admen\u00adted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he looks at it that way be\u00adcause he op\u00adposes Obama\u00adcare,\u201d said John Weaver, Kasich\u2019s seni\u00ador cam\u00adpaign strategist, in an in\u00adter\u00adview. \u201cUn\u00adfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, there are people who want to con\u00adflate the two.\u201d\n\nSpin aside, however, the fact re\u00admains that Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion was au\u00adthor\u00adized and fun\u00added as part of the ACA.\n\nKasich\u2019s primary claim to mo\u00admentum is New Hamp\u00adshire, an ec\u00adlect\u00adic state for con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adism and one that it\u00adself ex\u00adpan\u00added Medi\u00adcaid. Wheth\u00ader he can broaden his ap\u00adpeal bey\u00adond New Eng\u00adland is far from cer\u00adtain. His na\u00adtion\u00adal num\u00adbers have im\u00adproved but are mid\u00addling at best: 5 per\u00adcent, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to Real Clear Polit\u00adics. Most of the press cov\u00ader\u00adage not sucked up by the sum\u00admer of Trump has been pos\u00adit\u00adive to\u00adward Kasich and light on scru\u00adtiny so far, and he\u2019s yet to at\u00adtract any sus\u00adtained at\u00adtacks from his most prom\u00adin\u00adent GOP rivals.\n\nThose could be com\u00ading soon. Mike Murphy, who is head\u00ading the Right to Rise su\u00adper PAC back\u00ading Jeb Bush, told The Colum\u00adbus Dis\u00adpatch last week that the group would soon start spend\u00ading in Ohio and named Obama\u00adcare as one is\u00adsue where they could seek to con\u00adtrast Bush with Kasich.\n\n\u201cNor\u00admally, you don\u2019t see these things un\u00adtil pan\u00adic sets in, and pan\u00adic has def\u00adin\u00aditely set in. Pan\u00adic has set in in about four or five cam\u00adpaigns,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI know, be\u00adcause oth\u00ader cam\u00adpaigns have said so pub\u00adlicly, that they in\u00adtend to maybe come at us on that, and I wel\u00adcome that. That\u2019s fine. What they chose to do in their states is their busi\u00adness. I don\u2019t think you can get away with con\u00adflat\u00ading Obama\u00adcare with ex\u00adpand\u00ading health care us\u00ading your own tax dol\u00adlars.\u201d\n\nKasich has been hon\u00ading his mes\u00adsage on Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion since be\u00adfore he hit the cam\u00adpaign trail. He usu\u00adally de\u00adscribes it as a com\u00adpas\u00adsion\u00adate choice to help the poor, in the con\u00adtext of his Chris\u00adti\u00adan faith, and also as a fisc\u00adally re\u00adspons\u00adible move that brought Ohio tax dol\u00adlars back to the state. (Con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive wonks have ar\u00adgued that the money nev\u00ader would have been spent in the first place if Kasich didn\u2019t ex\u00adpand the pro\u00adgram).\n\nIt could also be that Obama\u00adcare simply hasn\u2019t caught up with Kasich yet be\u00adcause he didn\u2019t war\u00adrant much at\u00adten\u00adtion un\u00adtil re\u00adcently. Oth\u00ader cam\u00adpaigns cer\u00adtainly haven\u2019t for\u00adgot\u00adten about it, and they may turn to the is\u00adsue as they aim to sty\u00admie Kasich\u2019s rise and el\u00adev\u00adate their own can\u00addid\u00adates.\n\n\u201cIn a race where there are so many can\u00addid\u00adates and there will be ef\u00adforts by each cam\u00adpaign to dif\u00adfer\u00aden\u00adti\u00adate it\u00adself from the oth\u00aders, the Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion in Obama\u00adcare is sure to be an is\u00adsue of dis\u00adcus\u00adsion,\u201d one Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan strategist ad\u00advising sev\u00ader\u00adal oth\u00ader can\u00addid\u00adates told Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal re\u00adcently. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ne\u00adces\u00adsar\u00adily the first tool out of the bag, but it is a po\u00adten\u00adtially power\u00adful one.\u201d\n\nBut oth\u00aders with\u00adin the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party think the con\u00adven\u00adtion\u00adal wis\u00addom over\u00adrated how much Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion would be a prob\u00adlem for Kasich. In a bit of a twist, Trump could be help\u00ading Kasich out on that front, said John Fee\u00adhery, a long\u00adtime GOP strategist who has spoken ap\u00adprov\u00adingly of Kasich\u2019s cam\u00adpaign.\n\nBur\u00adied be\u00adneath the bil\u00adlion\u00adaire\u2019s bom\u00adbast\u00adic rhet\u00ador\u00adic can be found, Fee\u00adhery ar\u00adgues, a pop\u00adu\u00adlist mes\u00adsage that seems to be res\u00adon\u00adat\u00ading with a lot of con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive voters and aligns in many ways with how Kasich sells Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion.\n\n\u201cPeople mis\u00adun\u00adder\u00adstand where the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party is on a lot of is\u00adsues. For ex\u00adample, on tax cuts for the rich, the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party for many years said that we can\u2019t raise taxes on rich people. Trump is say\u00ading \u2018F\u2014- that.\u2019 It\u2019s a mes\u00adsage much more geared to the lower-middle class. People are strug\u00adgling,\u201d Fee\u00adhery said. \u201cMedi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion helps people who are strug\u00adgling. It might be something that people don\u2019t like when it\u2019s at\u00adtached to Obama, but they want health care.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s team seems to see the race the same way. Weaver por\u00adtrayed the gov\u00adernor\u2019s mes\u00adsage as \u201ca pos\u00adit\u00adive ver\u00adsion of that pop\u00adu\u00adlism that Trump is es\u00adpous\u00ading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have every reas\u00adon and right to be angry, angry at your gov\u00adern\u00adment, angry at your banks, angry at all sorts of in\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtions that we use to trust that we no longer can,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut hav\u00ading said that, there are solu\u00adtions to these is\u00adsues and we can make things good again. It\u2019s a more pos\u00adit\u00adive ver\u00adsion of that mes\u00adsage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Dylan Scott", "description": "Recent polling shows shifting priorities, even among Republicans, on health care.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Recent polling shows shifting priorities, even among Republicans, on health care.", "title": "Obamacare Hasn't Knocked John Kasich Out of the Race for the White House", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/management/2015/09/obamacare-hasnt-knocked-john-kasich-out-race-white-house/120200/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315kasich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@govexec", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315kasich/open-graph.jpg", "description": "Recent polling shows shifting priorities, even among Republicans, on health care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare Hasn't Knocked John Kasich Out of the Race for the White House"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-03T14:22:34Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315kasich.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Hasn't Knocked John Kasich Out of the Race for the White House", "keywords": "john kasich, 2016 election, affordable care act", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/03/090315kasich/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "2016-election,affordable-care-act,channel-management,type-story,length-long,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Recent polling shows shifting priorities, even among Republicans, on health care."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4b7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUn\u00adfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, there are people who want to con\u00adflate the two.\u201dSpin aside, however, the fact re\u00admains that Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion was au\u00adthor\u00adized and fun\u00added as part of the ACA.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he looks at it that way be\u00adcause he op\u00adposes Obama\u00adcare,\u201d said John Weaver, Kasich\u2019s seni\u00ador cam\u00adpaign strategist, in an in\u00adter\u00adview.\n\u201cMedi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion helps people who are strug\u00adgling.\nIt could also be that Obama\u00adcare simply hasn\u2019t caught up with Kasich yet be\u00adcause he didn\u2019t war\u00adrant much at\u00adten\u00adtion un\u00adtil re\u00adcently.\nIn a bit of a twist, Trump could be help\u00ading Kasich out on that front, said John Fee\u00adhery, a long\u00adtime GOP strategist who has spoken ap\u00adprov\u00adingly of Kasich\u2019s cam\u00adpaign."}
