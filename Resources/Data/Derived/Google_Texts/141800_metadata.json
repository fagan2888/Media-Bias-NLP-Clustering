It seemed like people were taking it too conservative down here. I think I made up a lot of time.\u201d\n\nIt was the second gold medal in two days for the U.S., following Ted Ligety\u2019s victory in giant slalom on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy, now that I think about it,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cJust before the second run I was trying to convince myself how much I wanted to win this race. Some of that was good, but then I was like, \u2018Stop it! Stop that! It\u2019s about the process. It\u2019s about the turns.\u2019 I kind of pulled myself together.\u201d\n\nLigety\u2019s victory, the first gold medal for the U.S. here, eased some of the pressure on Shiffrin but in the end she reinforced her remarkable reputation for performing under pressure. She was the favorite at the 2013 championships and the heavy favorite at the Sochi Olympics. She was supposed to win, and she did. Now she\u2019s done it again.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m in a little bit of denial about it,\u201d she said of the big event pressure she handles so well. \u201cI always say that I don\u2019t really feel pressure. I think I feel it, it\u2019s just about how I handle it. It\u2019s just about finding the right attitude and the right moment and putting it together for a win.\u201d\n\nHow does a teenager who turns 20 next month put into perspective three gold medals in three years? How do those achievements compare, especially now with one coming four miles from her family home?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different because I probably know half the people in the stands,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cOh, man, I don\u2019t know. It is different, and I can\u2019t really explain it. They\u2019re all equally amazing. Tough hill, tough race, a lot of really fast racers, and I\u2019m glad to walk away with this one.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins gold in women\u2019s slalom at world ski championships", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin wins gold in women\u2019s slalom at world ski championships", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/14/mikaela-shiffrin-wins-gold-in-womens-slalom-at-world-ski-championships/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150214__mikaela-shiffrin-ski-dp-021415p1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20150214__mikaela-shiffrin-ski-dp-021415p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T11:34:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:14:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing, World Ski Championships 2015"}, "article_summary": "I think I made up a lot of time.\u201dIt was the second gold medal in two days for the U.S., following Ted Ligety\u2019s victory in giant slalom on Friday.\n\u201cJust before the second run I was trying to convince myself how much I wanted to win this race.\nBEAVER CREEK \u2014 EagleVail\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin did it again, but she gave a flag-waving hometown crowd a major scare Saturday en route to her third gold medal in slalom in the past three years.\n\u201cWhen I was at the beginning of my run, I knew I was attacking but it was kind of a conservative line,\u201d Shiffrin said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy, now that I think about it,\u201d Shiffrin said."}
