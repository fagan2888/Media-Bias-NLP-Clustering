A former clinic director says dozens of veterans died while awaiting treatment at the Phoenix VA hospital.\n\nReports of problems at VA medical facilities date back at least 14 years, and in each case were followed by promises of action, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said.\n\n\u201cWe have come to the point where we need more than good intentions,\u201d Murray told VA Secretary Eric Shinseki at a hearing Thursday of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cWhat we need from you now is decisive action to restore veterans\u2019 confidence in VA, create a culture of transparency and accountability and change these system-wide, yearslong problems,\u201d Murray said.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nLawmakers from both parties were equally blunt.\n\nSen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said the VA is \u201csuffering from an absence of public leadership and is foundering as a result.\u201d\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the Obama administration \u201chas failed to respond in an effective manner\u201d to reports about the Phoenix VA and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cThis has created in our veterans community a crisis of confidence toward the VA,\u201d McCain said.\n\nRyan Gallucci, deputy director for national legislative service of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, told the committee that VFW members are outraged and frustrated that nearly a month after the allegations surfaced, \u201cwe still do not know who the veterans are who may have died waiting for care.\u201d\n\nThe VA operates the largest single health care system in the country, serving some 9 million veterans a year. Surveys show that patients are mostly satisfied with their care but that access to it is becoming more of a problem as Vietnam veterans age and increasing numbers of veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars seek treatment for physical and mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\u201cIf the system is failing, it is their duty to fix it,\u201d Gallucci said of Shinseki and his top aides.\n\nUdall said Shinseki\u2019s experience as a senior military leader makes him ideally suited to resolve many of the challenges facing the VA.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, given evidence of mismanagement on multiple fronts in Colorado and across the nation, it appears that you have either been shielded from the realities on the ground or have decided to keep your distance from critical issues and delegate site visits to others,\u201d Udall told Shinseki in a letter.\n\nShinseki, a retired four-star Army general who has headed the VA since 2009, has promised a preliminary report within three weeks on treatment delays and falsified patient-appointment reports at VA health centers.\n\nThe report \u2014 and another due in August from the department\u2019s inspector general \u2014 should give officials a window into complaints about long waitlists and falsified records at the VA\u2019s 150 medical centers and 820 community outpatient clinics nationwide, Shinseki said. Separately, President Barack Obama has named deputy White House chief of staff Rob Nabors to review VA health care procedures and policies.\n\nAs a sign of his seriousness, Shinseki said that in 2012 and again in 2013 the agency \u201cinvoluntarily removed\u201d 3,000 of its 300,000 employees for poor performance or misconduct. Some employees were given new assignments, others retired and some were fired, Shinseki said.\n\nBut some in Congress say more must be done.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Shinseki it was time to call in the FBI, \u201cgiven that the IG\u2019s resources are so limited, that the task is so challenging and the need for results is so powerful.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal, a former state attorney general and federal prosecutor, said in an interview that if Shinseki does not seek help from the FBI, \u201cI will almost certainly make the request on my own\u201d to Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey.\n\nRichard Griffin, acting inspector general for the VA, said an initial review of 17 people who died while awaiting appointments at the Phoenix VA hospital found that none of their deaths appeared to have been caused by delays in treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be on a waiting list, and it\u2019s another thing to conclude that as a result of being on the waiting list that\u2019s the cause of death, depending on what your illness might have been at the beginning,\u201d Griffin told the Senate panel. \u201cOn those 17, we didn\u2019t conclude so far that the delay caused the death.\u201d\n\nGriffin said his office was working off several lists of patients at the giant Phoenix facility, which treats more than 80,000 veterans a year. He said a widely reported list of 40 patients who died while awaiting appointments there \u201cdoes not represent the total number of veterans that we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nHe said his office had 185 employees working on the Phoenix case, including criminal investigators, and said he expected to have a report completed in August. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona and the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section also were assisting in the investigation.\n\nSince reports of the Phoenix problems came to light last month, allegations about problems at VA facilities have spread nationwide. At least 10 new allegations about manipulated waiting times and other problems have surfaced in the past three weeks, Griffin said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Pauline Jelinek contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., right, speaks with Sen.
