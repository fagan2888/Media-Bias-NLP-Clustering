Can Colorado\u2019s defense keep Utah junior Devontae Booker from running wild? Booker has netted 1,255 yards through 11 games and trails UCLA\u2019s Paul Perkins by only 10 yards in the race for the Pac-12 rushing title. Utah isn\u2019t pass-happy like most Pac-12 teams. So if the Buffs can keep Booker somewhat under control, it would improve the odds greatly for Colorado.\n\n2. Will CU junior receiver Nelson Spruce finish the season with a flurry? In recent weeks, opposing defenses have been determined to not let Spruce beat them. And they\u2019ve done a good job of that. Spruce has averaged 7.5 catches for the past six games after averaging 11.2 receptions for the first five games. Spruce has been kept out of the end zone for the past four games. If he doesn\u2019t score a TD against Utah, that may not bode well for the Buffs.\n\n3. Will Utah kick returner Kaelin Clay become a one-man momentum changer? He is the nation\u2019s only player with four returns for a touchdown in 2014: three on punt returns, one on a kickoff return.\n\n4. Can Colorado walk-on safety Ryan Moeller replicate his breakout performance of last weekend at Oregon? Best known for being a standout running back at Rifle High School, Moeller was thrust into a starting role against the Ducks because of a rash of injuries at safety. The redshirt freshman responded with a game-best 14 tackles. Another comparable performance against Utah would cause some to wonder if stardom is in his future.\n\n5. Each of the three previous meetings between Colorado and Utah has been decided by 7 points or less. Can the Buffs hang close again and finally, in the season finale, notch a Pac-12 victory?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boulder,Colorado,Colorado Buffaloes,Utah", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "Five things to watch in Saturday's Pac-12 matchup of Utah at Colorado in Boulder.", "title": "5 things to watch: Utah at Colorado football", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/11/28/five-things-watch-utah-colorado/32620/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/11/utah-colorado-football-495x349.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Five things to watch in Saturday's Pac-12 matchup of Utah at Colorado in Boulder.", "title": "5 things to watch: Utah at Colorado, Saturday at 11 a.m.", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/11/28/five-things-watch-utah-colorado/32620/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/11/utah-colorado-football-495x349.jpg", "creator": "@tomkensler", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Five things to watch in Saturday's Pac-12 matchup of Utah at Colorado in Boulder."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc415\"", "article_summary": "Each of the three previous meetings between Colorado and Utah has been decided by 7 points or less.\nHere is the final installment of the season for my weekly \u201cFive things to watch\u201d \u2014 this time for Saturday\u2019s 11 a.m. (Pac-12 Network) conference matchup between Utah and Colorado in Boulder.\nCan Colorado\u2019s defense keep Utah junior Devontae Booker from running wild?\nSo if the Buffs can keep Booker somewhat under control, it would improve the odds greatly for Colorado.\nCan Colorado walk-on safety Ryan Moeller replicate his breakout performance of last weekend at Oregon?"}
