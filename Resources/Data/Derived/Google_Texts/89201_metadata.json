Additionally, those that provided services were found to be seven times more likely to perform population-based mental illness prevention activities and almost three times as likely to be involved in policy or advocacy for activities to address mental health issues.\n\nJonathan Purtle, DrPH, assistant professor in the Dornsife School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Health Policy and Management, was the lead author of the study, \u201cPrevalence and correlates of local health department activities to address mental health in the United States,\u201d which was published in the journal Preventive Medicine. Purtle\u2019s co-authors in the study were Ann Klassen, PhD, Jennifer Kolker, MPH and James Buehler, MD.\n\n\u201cMental health is important for public health in two main ways,\u201d said Purtle. \u201cOne is that mental health conditions adversely impact quality of life and are highly prevalent. Depression is among the top conditions in the world that leads to an adverse quality of life. And the second part if why mental health is important is a huge body of research tells us that mental health conditions hugely increase the risk of developing physical conditions and injury.\u201d\n\nProviding a more holistic sense of health, linking the mental and physical aspects, is important.\n\n\u201cFor 100 years, people in the United States have been saying mental health is a public health issue. And people in the public health field have been saying, \u2018Yes. It is,\u2019\u201d Purtle said. \u201cThat said, many of these organizations have been focused on physical health and mental health has been looked at as the domain of psychologists and psychotherapists, which is an individually-based view of health.\u201d\n\nWith local health departments taking on a more holistic view of health that includes mental health services, there are opportunities to leverage that into further growth.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, to retain their tax-exempt status, non-profit hospitals must conduct a community health needs assessment every three years. Local health departments could provide opportunities for partnerships with these hospitals to to better address those community mental health needs, according to the Drexel research team.\n\nThe Drexel team found that roughly 25 percent of local health departments implement strategies to target the mental health service needs of under-served populations. If a local health department already had some form of mental health care services to offer, the study indicated that it was almost three times as likely to attempt to reach underserved populations.\n\nWhen looking at those local health departments that implemented strategies to reach underserved populations, it was found that roughly 80 percent of them sought to access gaps in mental health care and just over 88 percent attempted to increase access to mental health services. Additionally, almost half of those local health departments were found to be involved in policy and advocacy activities addressing mental health.\n\nAny news media interested in speaking to Purtle or his colleagues should contact Frank Otto at 215.571.4244 or email fmo26@drexel.edu.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2016/January/LHD_Mental_Health/", "site_name": "DrexelNow", "image": "http://drexel.edu/~/media/Images/now/ui/og-drexel-logo.ashx", "type": "article", "title": "Local Health Departments Key to Expanding Mental Health Care in U.S. - DrexelNow"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Server": "SCPRODPUB3"}, "article_summary": "Additionally, almost half of those local health departments were found to be involved in policy and advocacy activities addressing mental health.\nDrexel\u2019s professors found that of the 505 local health departments they studied, between 30 and 40 percent provided some form of mental health care services.\nAnd the second part if why mental health is important is a huge body of research tells us that mental health conditions hugely increase the risk of developing physical conditions and injury.\u201dProviding a more holistic sense of health, linking the mental and physical aspects, is important.\nLocal health departments could provide opportunities for partnerships with these hospitals to to better address those community mental health needs, according to the Drexel research team.\nWhen looking at those local health departments that implemented strategies to reach underserved populations, it was found that roughly 80 percent of them sought to access gaps in mental health care and just over 88 percent attempted to increase access to mental health services."}
