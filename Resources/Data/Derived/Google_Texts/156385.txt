CONCORD — Gov. Maggie Hassan on Friday urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to fully investigate alternative routes for the Kinder Morgan natural gas pipeline, and require developers to “comprehensively address” the questions and concerns of New Hampshire residents...Kinder Morgan is hoping for FERC approval to build a new natural gas transmission line through Southern New Hampshire.
