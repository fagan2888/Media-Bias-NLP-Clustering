North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles off the east coast of the Korean peninsula on Monday, South Korea's defense ministry said, Reuters reported.

Pyongyang, which routinely conducts short-range missile tests, launched four short-range missiles late last month in a similar display of force, officials have said.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency said that in Monday's test, missiles likely flew about 300 miles after being launched off the North's east coast, adding they were believed to be Scud-C models.

The distance means the missiles are capable of hitting targets in South Korea and Japan.

The launch comes days after the start of annual U.S. and South Korean joint military exercises, which Pyongyang routinely denounces as preparation of war.
