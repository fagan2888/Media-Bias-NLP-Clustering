The shower\u2019s radiant\u2014the point from which the meteors appear to emanate\u2014rises in the east around 3 a.m. local daylight time. With the moon then in the southern sky, position yourself where buildings or tall trees block its light.\u201d\n\nThe best time to catch what you can of them is indeed after 3 a.m. local time, says Earthsky.org. And if you\u2019re lucky you might glimpse one that leaves a trail across the sky. Meteors are also falling during Cinco de Mayo, but the peak night is May 6.\n\n\u201cThis year, 2015 is not a particularly favorable year, as a bright moon will be shining during the prime time hours of this meteor shower, in the dark hours before dawn,\u201d Earthsky.com says. Meteor buffs will be on the lookout, despite the moonlit glare, knowing these swift-moving meteors frequently leave persistent trains.\u201d\n\nHalley\u2019s Comet, the Eta Aquarids\u2019 parent, takes 76 years to orbit the sun. Earth passes through the debris stream twice annually, creating two meteor showers. The second one of the year is flashier and thus better known, the Orionids, peaking in October.\n\nMeanwhile, though, intrepid sky watchers can soak up a bit of soft, balmy night spring air while straining to wish upon a falling star. It will be better visible the farther south you go, with the best show being in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n\u201cThe best viewing time is roughly from about two hours to one hour before sunrise,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cNo matter where you live, the last hour of darkness just before dawn tends to feature the greatest number of meteors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Eta Aquarid meteors will be all but drowned out by moonlight, but watch for them anyway on May 6 after 3 a.m.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/05/eta-aquarids-struggle-against-blazing-moonlight-cinco-de-mayo-160252", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/meteor_shower-thinkstock_image_95462830.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Eta Aquarids Struggle Against Blazing Moonlight on Cinco de Mayo"}, "abstract": "The Eta Aquarid meteors will be all but drowned out by moonlight, but watch for them anyway on May 6 after 3 a.m.", "dc": {"title": "Eta Aquarids Struggle Against Blazing Moonlight on Cinco de Mayo"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/05/eta-aquarids-struggle-against-blazing-moonlight-cinco-de-mayo-160252", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Moon, Space, Astronomy, Meteor Showers, Shooting Stars", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-05T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Eta Aquarids Struggle Against Blazing Moonlight on Cinco de Mayo"}, "article_summary": "Earth passes through the debris stream twice annually, creating two meteor showers.\nSquint and you might catch a glimpse of the Eta Aquarids, debris from Halley\u2019s Comet, if you get up before dawn on Wednesday May 6.\nThat is the best shot one has at seeing them in the light of the blazing moon, which turned full on May 3.\nMeteors are also falling during Cinco de Mayo, but the peak night is May 6.\n\u201cNo matter where you live, the last hour of darkness just before dawn tends to feature the greatest number of meteors.\u201d"}
