It applies to workers in \u201call licensed acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, long-term care facilities, ambulatory and community clinics and ambulance providers.\u201d\n\nMany health professionals believe that wearing masks is more effective than not wearing them because they do contain viral particles that could spread from a cough or sneeze as far as 20 feet.\n\nBut evidence is sparse that even when worn correctly, masks prevent transmission of influenza from a healthcare worker to a patient, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cNo studies have definitively shown that mask use by either infectious patients or health-care personnel prevents influenza transmission,\u201d the CDC says.\n\nThe masks can impair communication, especially for those hard of hearing, are uncomfortable and can be scary for some patients. Health care workers may take them off and forget to put them back on.\n\nDespite policies at each health care setting that encourage workers to remind each other about the policy, colleagues may be loath to call out unmasked, unimmunized co-workers \u2014 who can be easily spotted because they don\u2019t have a special sticker on their nametag.\n\nHealth care workers are allowed to take off the masks in break rooms and cafeterias, when they take a sip of coffee or water, and \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 sometimes leave them, or misplace them. For some, they are a poor fit.\n\nThat\u2019s why some health care organizations around the country don\u2019t require masks for their unimmunized workers.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic\u2019s two hospitals in Rochester, Minn., for example, do not require their use for their 32,000 health care workers, even for those who aren\u2019t vaccinated, which is about 8 or 9 percent of the eligible workforce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not practical; it\u2019s counterproductive,\u201d said Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, chair of Mayo\u2019s immunization and infection control committees, who called the mask \u201ca scarlet letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get hot under the masks, patients can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying sometimes, so you do take them off. They\u2019re not patient friendly, and they can be scary to patients.\u201d\n\nAnd, Sampathkumar said, wearing masks \u201cis hard to enforce.\u201d Calling out a co-worker for not wearing a mask may in effect identify the person as having a certain medical condition, which could disclose protected medical information.\n\nInstead, Mayo strongly urges employees to get immunized and encourages them to stay home when they\u2019re getting sick. \u201cMasks are only worn by personnel who are having symptoms and must be at work, or because the patient has an illness that could be transmitted, not because of your vaccination status,\u201d Sampathkumar said.\n\nBut in San Diego, Scripps Mercy Hospital\u2019s infectious disease specialist, Dr. Nancy Crum-Cianflone, said they are better than nothing.\n\n\u201cThere are legitimate arguments against policies requiring masks (for unimmunized health care workers),\u201d she said, \u201cbut there are a lot more legitimate arguments for it.\u201d\n\nBottom line, she said, is that health care workers \u201cwho don\u2019t have a legitimate reason for not getting them are getting vaccinated at much higher rates.\u201d\n\nFor her, masks are extremely uncomfortable. \u201cPersonally,\u201d she continued, \u201cI would go crazy wearing one. You feel like \u2014 well, you\u2019re not exactly suffocating, but \u2014 you feel like you\u2019re not getting enough air.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cit\u2019s a moral obligation for health care providers to do everything we can to protect our patients and do no harm.\u201d And if you really can\u2019t get vaccinated, \u201cthen you should put on a mask.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas R. Talbot, chief epidemiologist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., and a leader with the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America, shared his view that masks are a good thing, although enforcement is problematic.\n\nWith the masks, \u201cyou don\u2019t eliminate the amount of virus that gets out, but you dramatically reduce the amount,\u201d Talbot said.\n\nHe added that there isn\u2019t much data that mask wearing prevents infections, because the topic is hard to study. But, he said, it makes sense. We know you can shed virus even before you have symptoms, and the mask can prevent that spread.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cIf you say you have to wear a mask if you\u2019re not vaccinated, but there\u2019s no one coming around to remind people, and have accountability, then you don\u2019t have commitment.\u201d\n\nAt Vanderbilt, exceptions to getting vaccinated are granted only after a rigorous professional review of the employee\u2019s excuse. With an exemption comes a requirement to wear a mask.\n\nWithout that exemption, starting this year, the stakes for Vanderbilt\u2019s health care workers rise. Those who refuse will go on unpaid leave, he said, predicting Vanderbilt\u2019s immunization percentages will rise from last year\u2019s 92 percent to 98 percent.\n\nLike time-outs before surgery to prevent operations on the wrong body part, \u201cif it\u2019s not tracked and followed up, and people held accountable, people aren\u2019t going to do it \u2026 and any program will fall apart,\u201d Talbot said.\n\nPatient safety is all about a culture of safety, he said.\n\nWorkers know they need to stay home when they\u2019re starting to feel sick. \u201cBut we know that we as health care workers don\u2019t do that very well,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cAnd some may mistake early symptoms as just an allergy flare up.\u201d\n\nHe continued: Unvaccinated healthcare workers \u201cwho object to wearing the mask say, \u2018Oh my God, the mask is scaring patients\u2019 and take it off. Well, so is giving them the flu. If you can empower the provider to understand that, you help mitigate that risk.\u201d\n\nWe'll let you know when big things happen.\n\nEmail address:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego news from inewsource", "description": "Health care workers in San Diego County are required to wear surgical masks if they receive the flu vaccine, but some question their effectiveness", "title": "Health experts debate masks\u2019 value in flu prevention", "url": "http://inewsource.org/2015/09/29/masks-flu-prevention-debate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/flu-hospitals-2-e1443469743812.jpeg?fit=1200%2C801", "height": 801}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-29T12:45:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T22:02:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.wp.com/inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/flu-hospitals-2-e1443469743812.jpeg?fit=1200%2C801&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Health care workers may take them off and forget to put them back on.\n\u201cBut we know that we as health care workers don\u2019t do that very well,\u201d Talbot said.\nWithout that exemption, starting this year, the stakes for Vanderbilt\u2019s health care workers rise.\nHe added that there isn\u2019t much data that mask wearing prevents infections, because the topic is hard to study.\nThat\u2019s why some health care organizations around the country don\u2019t require masks for their unimmunized workers."}
