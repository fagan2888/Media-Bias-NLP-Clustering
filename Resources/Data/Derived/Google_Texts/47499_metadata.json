The toughest thing for him was not being involved on a daily bases with wins and losses on the line everyday. He\u2019s been craving that, and it\u2019s great to see him back in the game. The game will be better for it. But like I said, I\u2019m not thrilled that he\u2019s working in the NL West.\u201d\n\nWeiss and La Russa, who was Weiss\u2019 first manager in Oakland, talk to each other frequently. Weiss kidded that that might have to stop.\n\n\u201cI would think so,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can talk about family, but that\u2019s where we draw the line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Diamondbacks CEO Derrick Hall, La Russa will oversee the team\u2019s baseball operations. That makes him the boss of both general manager Kevin Towers and manager Kirk Gibson. La Russa has been given the green light to make big changes.\n\n\u201cThe entire organization is obviously frustrated with the results on the field and we are looking to improve,\u201d Hall said in a statement. \u201cTony brings us a wealth of knowledge, experience and success, and will work closely with Kevin (Towers) and Kirk (Gibson) in evaluating our current state to determine the future of our baseball operations. He is excited and enthusiastic about the challenge, and we are fortunate to have this Hall of Famer on board and a part of the team.\u201d\n\nLa Russa, who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer, also was reportedly eyeing the Seattle Mariners\u2019 team president vacancy during the offseason.\n\nPregame notes of note:\n\n* The Padres placed right-hander Andrew Cashner on the 15-day disabled list on Saturday with soreness in his right elbow. He was scheduled to start Sunday vs. the Rockies.\n\nHe\u2019ll be replaced by right-hander Donn Roach, who\u2019s been working as San Diego\u2019s long reliever. Roach (1-0, 2.57 ERA) last pitched on May 15 and worked 4 1/3 innings in a relief outing earlier this season.\n\n* If you think Jorge De La Rosa looks comfortable pitching at home, you\u2019d be right. He notched his 38th career victory at Coors Field Friday night, a venue where he is now 38-12 with a 4.15 ERA. His 38 wins Coors are the most in franchise history", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andrew Cashner,Jorge De La Rosa,Tony La Russa,Walt Weiss", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Rockies manager Walt Weiss had an inkling that Tony La Russa would get back into the daily business of baseball, he just wishes he hadn't picked Arizona.", "title": "Rockies' Weiss on La Russa hiring: \"DBacks just got a lot better\"", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/05/17/rockies-weiss-la-russa-hiring-diamondbacks-just-got-lot-better/17573/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2011/10/cardinals-tony-larussa.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rockies manager Walt Weiss had an inkling that Tony La Russa would get back into the daily business of baseball, he just wishes he hadn't picked Arizona.", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Weiss on Tony La Russa hiring: \u201cDiamondbacks just got a lot better\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/05/17/rockies-weiss-la-russa-hiring-diamondbacks-just-got-lot-better/17573/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2011/10/cardinals-tony-larussa.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rockies manager Walt Weiss he had an inkling that Tony La Russa would get back into the daily business of baseball, he just wishes he hadn't picked Arizona."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaee\"", "article_summary": "They got it Saturday when they named Tony La Russa, the four-time manager of the year, as their new Chief Baseball Officer.\nRockies manager Walt Weiss said he had inkling that La Russa would get back into the daily business of baseball, he just wishes his good friend hadn\u2019t picked the Diamondbacks.\nLa Russa has been given the green light to make big changes.\n\u201cWe can talk about family, but that\u2019s where we draw the line.\u201dAccording to Diamondbacks CEO Derrick Hall, La Russa will oversee the team\u2019s baseball operations.\nBut like I said, I\u2019m not thrilled that he\u2019s working in the NL West.\u201dWeiss and La Russa, who was Weiss\u2019 first manager in Oakland, talk to each other frequently."}
