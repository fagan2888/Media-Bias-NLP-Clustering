NEW YORK (AP) — Friends and family members of a man shot by police in a New York City housing project stairwell have recited poems and said prayers at his funeral.

Akai (uh-KY’) Gurley’s loved ones, including his mother, stepfather and 2-year-old daughter, gathered Saturday in Brooklyn.

The 28-year-old Gurley was killed Nov. 20. Police say Officer Peter Liang was patrolling a pitch-dark stairwell when Gurley and his girlfriend opened a door into the stairway.

Police have said Liang apparently fired by accident, killing Gurley. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said Friday that he would present the case to a grand jury.

An aunt of Gurley’s, Janice Asiedu, tells TV station New York 1 that she wants “justice to be served.”
