The End Of The Year Is The Perfect Time To Rebalance Your Portfolio (Morningstar)

Research has shown that rebalancing portfolios is one way to reduce risk, and investors should consider rebalancing at the end of the year, according to Christine Benz.

"But assuming that you are going to be doing some rebalancing within your taxable portfolio, you can also perhaps be a little bit preemptive in terms of managing your tax hit," Benz adds. "If you're going to be selling something and realizing capital gains on which you'll owe taxes, you may be able to find some losing holdings in your portfolio that you can sell, realize the tax loss, and use that tax loss to offset your capital gains burden."

Fidelity Is Fully Embracing Robo Offerings (Investment News)

Fidelity just made a deal with another robo-adviser, LearnVest, reports Liz Skinner. This comes two months after the firm made its first deal with a robo-adviser, Betterment Institutional. And in the future, the firm is considering launching its own automated advice platform.

Equities Are Going To Drive Convertible Bonds In 2015 (Advisor Perspectives)

Convertible bonds allow investors to switch their bonds into equity â€” so a strong equity market is great news for convertible bond investors. Since credit and sovereign yields have dropped to historic lows, "the potential for investors to retain bond-like qualities while potentially benefiting from supportive equity markets can make convertibles a compelling opportunity," according to Martin Kuehle.

However, it's important to remember that convertible bonds vary greatly by region.

"The US convertible bond market is by far the biggest, most efficient and over the long-run, the most fairly price. At the other end of the spectrum, Asia is the smallest, least-liquid and on average comes with the highest credit exposure," write Kuehle. "Being aware of these differences is integral to generation outperformance."
