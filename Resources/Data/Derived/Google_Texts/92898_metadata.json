I don\u2019t like showing a person sleeping at a podium,\u201d Trump said to dozens of reporters at a press conference in Trump Tower. The reporters gasped and chuckled at Trump\u2019s joke.\n\nTrump has long been critical of Bush \u2013 saying he\u2019s too low energy to be President of the United States.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard,\u201d Trump said, when asked if Bush could make a comeback with his presidential campaign.\n\nBush reportedly relaunched his campaign earlier this week with a book tour and slogan, \u2018Jeb Can Fix It.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nTrump added that fellow GOP candidates Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) don\u2019t have energy either.\n\n\u201c[Jeb] lacks the quality [of energy] that you need,\u201d he added. \u201cBen Carson does not have that energy.\u201d\n\nHe said a leader needs energy to \u201cstraighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade-deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a president right now that doesn\u2019t have energy. I mean you think Obama has energy? He has no energy and he\u2019s been a horrible president,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cCertainly, Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion,\u201d Trump repeated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump on Jeb Bush Impression: 'Don't Like Showing a Person Sleeping at a Podium'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump on Jeb Bush Impression: 'Don't Like Showing a Person Sleeping at a Podium'", "title": "Trump on mimicking Jeb Bush: 'A Person Sleeping at a Podium'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Trump-think-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/03/trump-jeb-bush-impression-dont-like-showing-person-sleeping-podium/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump on Jeb Bush Impression: 'Don't Like Showing a Person Sleeping at a Podium'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Trump-think-Getty.jpg", "title": "Trump on mimicking Jeb Bush: 'A Person Sleeping at a Podium'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, SNL,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "SNL", "published_time": "2015-11-03T14:04:36-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t like showing a person sleeping at a podium,\u201d Trump said to dozens of reporters at a press conference in Trump Tower.\nTrump has long been critical of Bush \u2013 saying he\u2019s too low energy to be President of the United States.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard,\u201d Trump said, when asked if Bush could make a comeback with his presidential campaign.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you don\u2019t have that.\u201dTrump added that fellow GOP candidates Dr. Ben Carson and Sen.
