The management of the California Nurses Association (CNA) is all set to meet representatives of the Kaiser Hospital in Fremont to bargain on a new four-year contract.

Kaiser is the operator of the largest hospital system in the Golden State and the eighth largest operator of health system in the entire country.

The powerful union's leaders have warned that it was ready to fight back and even take an industrial action if Kaiser, as is being anticipated, makes cuts in contracts or salaries.

Four years back, the union had endorsed the first contract proposed by Kaiser without any objection. But many things have changed in the past four years. The economy of the state as well as the country has improved a lot; while the federal government's Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made sweeping changes in hospital economics.

Nurse practitioner Rachel Phillips said pressure of work had increased significantly on them over the past years.

Speaking on the topic, Phillips said, "When I first started at Kaiser, I wasn't rushed with my patients. I could have 30 minutes with a new patient. That time has been whittled away. We're currently asked to see patients every 15 minutes, regardless of the complexity of their medical issues."

The improvement in the financial condition of the hospital operator would prompt nurses to ask for a bigger share from increased revenue.

Nurses at Kaiser's emergency rooms and intensive care units (ICUs) are also arguing that the hospital operator has been skimping on care, discharging patients who should be admitted, and closing cardiology and pediatric divisions.
