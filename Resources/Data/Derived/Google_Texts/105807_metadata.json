Now, just a few of years after he rose to the CEO seat, the mining industry is looking much less rosy, and so are Caterpillar\u2019s order books.\n\nVia the WSJ\u2019s James R. Hagerty:\n\nWhen Doug Oberhelman took over as chief executive of Caterpillar Inc. in July 2010, one of his worries was that the company and its suppliers wouldn\u2019t be able to increase production fast enough to keep up with demand. Now the big question is whether the world\u2019s biggest maker of construction and mining equipment can cut costs fast enough.\n\nIn an earnings call today, Mr. Oberhelman said the company is on a \u201ccost lockdown binge,\u201d as it works to limit the damage of falling demand from the mining industry for its equipment. What does that look like in practice? According to to Michael I. DeWalt, the Vice President of the company\u2019s strategic services division:\n\nWe\u2019ve had numerous temporary plant shutdowns, a reduction of more than 13,000 of our global workforce since this time last year. We\u2019ve had temporary layoffs for thousands of salaried management employees. We\u2019ve had reductions in program spending, substantially lower incentive pay, and we\u2019ve implemented general austerity measures across the company. In addition to lower cost, we\u2019ve also cut CapEx. And through the first 9 months of \u201913, it\u2019s down nearly 20%.\n\nThat sounds tough, and it could drag on for some time. Mr. Oberhelman told analysts on the call that he has been speaking with mining company CEOs about their view of how the industry is likely to fair in the coming years. \u201cAny expansion in the nearer term is dead,\u201d he said, although the CEOs were \u201cfairly optimistic on existing mine production also in the medium term.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the bigger picture:\n\nIf you get back to what\u2019s going to happen with the world economy, nobody knows. And I\u2019m not going to forecast it here today. As \u2014 we took a pretty benign view of all that in our release this time because we don\u2019t know. But they\u2019re feeling, I think, for the most part, that even 1 to 3 years out, the world will grow. China will not implode, it will continue to track iron ore and some coal. And they feel that, but they want to get that out of existing resources. And at some point, that plays right to our hand, just not right now.\n\nSee also:\n\nCaterpillar Earnings: Costs Put on \u2018Lockdown\u2019 \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The construction and mining equipment company is on a  is on a \"cost lockdown binge,\" as the mining industry backs away from the rapid expansion of the last decade", "title": "The Mining Bust Behind Caterpillar\u2019s Cost-Cutting \u2018Binge\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/23/the-mining-bust-behind-caterpillars-cost-cutting-binge/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZA271_cat_G_20130923201905.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "The Mining Bust Behind Caterpillar\u2019s Cost-Cutting \u2018Binge\u2019", "description": "The construction and mining equipment company is on a  is on a \"cost lockdown binge,\" as the mining industry backs away from the rapid expansion of the last decade", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "The construction and mining equipment company is on a  is on a \"cost lockdown binge,\" as the mining industry backs away from the rapid expansion of the last decade", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-23T22:38:28-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/23/the-mining-bust-behind-caterpillars-cost-cutting-binge/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-2712", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The construction and mining equipment company is on a  is on a \"cost lockdown binge,\" as the mining industry backs away from the rapid expansion of the last decade", "title": "The Mining Bust Behind Caterpillar\u2019s Cost-Cutting \u2018Binge\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/23/the-mining-bust-behind-caterpillars-cost-cutting-binge/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZA271_cat_G_20130923201905.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-2712", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-23T22:44:25-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb685\"", "article_summary": "Now, just a few of years after he rose to the CEO seat, the mining industry is looking much less rosy, and so are Caterpillar\u2019s order books.\nNow the big question is whether the world\u2019s biggest maker of construction and mining equipment can cut costs fast enough.\nAPIt has been a bit of a roller coaster for Caterpillar\u2019s CEO Doug Oberhelman, who took the top job at the construction and mining equipment giant during a global mining boom and construction recovery.\nIn an earnings call today, Mr. Oberhelman said the company is on a \u201ccost lockdown binge,\u201d as it works to limit the damage of falling demand from the mining industry for its equipment.\nMr. Oberhelman told analysts on the call that he has been speaking with mining company CEOs about their view of how the industry is likely to fair in the coming years."}
