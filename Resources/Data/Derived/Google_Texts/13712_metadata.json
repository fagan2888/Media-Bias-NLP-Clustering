After decades of halfhearted government efforts to stop global warming, and the failure of the \u201cBig Green\u201d NGOs to do much of anything about it, new voices \u2014 and new strategies \u2014 have taken the lead in the war against fossil fuels.\n\nJeremy Brecher, a freelance writer, historian, organizer and radio host based in Connecticut, has documented the environmental movement\u2019s turn toward direct action and grass-roots activism. A scholar of American workers\u2019 movements and author of the acclaimed labor history \u201cStrike!,\u201d Brecher argues that it\u2019s time for green activists to address the social and economic impacts of climate change and for unions to start taking global warming seriously.\n\nHis latest book, \u201cClimate Insurgency: A Strategy Against Doom,\u201d which will be released early next year by Paradigm Publishers, examines the structural causes of our climate conundrum and calls for a \u201cglobal nonviolent constitutional insurgency\u201d to force environmental action from below. Brecher spoke to Salon about his vision for dealing with global warming, the changing face of environmental activism, and why he thinks the People\u2019s Climate March in New York on Sep. 21 is so important.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s unpack the book\u2019s key term: What is a \u201cglobal nonviolent constitutional insurgency\u201d?\n\nAround the world, we\u2019re familiar with insurgencies where an armed group resists the government and says that it does not legitimately have the authority to make law and govern some area or some group of people. And the characteristic of an insurgency is that it denies the legitimacy or legal right of those who claim to be the legitimate authorities to rule.\n\nThe concept of nonviolent insurgency is of a kind of social movement where the same basic claim is made: that those who claim the right to rule actually don\u2019t have the right to rule, but where the means of challenging their power is not an armed insurgency but is rather what\u2019s come to be called \u201cpeople\u2019s power,\u201d or mass civil disobedience or civil resistance. And so a nonviolent insurgency may sound paradoxical, but in fact it is quite a common thing around the world and happens a lot and has happened a lot in the past.\n\nNow, \u201cconstitutional\u201d insurgency: That also sounds paradoxical. But when you look historically at certain social movements, they make a claim that the existing rulers are not legitimate because they are violating fundamental aspects of their own constitution \u2014 that is, the constitution that they claim gives them legitimate rule. And that\u2019s come to be known [by legal historian James Gray Pope and others as] a \u201cconstitutional insurgency.\u201d It denies the legitimacy of those who claim to be legitimate rulers, but it does so in the name of the very constitutional principle that they claim gives them their authority.\n\nSome notable examples would be Gandhi\u2019s Great Salt March and in general the Gandhian insurgency in India, where they violated English rule and said that it was legitimate to do so because they were representing the underlying principles of English constitutional law. The civil rights movement did not call itself a constitutional insurgency but if you look, say, at the movement in the South, essentially the participants engaged in civil disobedience said that they were upholding the law, that they were representing the fundamental constitutional principles of equality and justice.\n\nSo that\u2019s a long way around to saying that if the president of the United States authorizes the Keystone XL Pipeline to be built, he is claiming that he is acting under legitimate authority. I would say he\u2019s not acting under legitimate authority, he\u2019s violating a fundamental constitutional duty of the president of the United States and the United States government: to protect the common property of the people that\u2019s represented by the atmosphere.\n\n[Finally,] climate change is a \u201cglobal\u201d problem, obviously, and we know that the solutions have to be global. If some countries protect the climate and all the corporations run away to the countries that are not protecting the climate, we won\u2019t have any climate protection. We\u2019ll just have a shift in where the greenhouse gases that are destroying our planet come from. So ultimately it has to be a global solution.\n\nIn your book, you speak a lot about the \u201cpublic trust doctrine\u201d as motivating force for such a solution. What is the doctrine, and why do you think it\u2019s important for the climate movement?\n\nThe public trust doctrine is a fundamental principle of American law. It\u2019s explicit in many state constitutions, [although] not all of them. It\u2019s a principle of constitutional law at the state level and at the federal level. What the public trust doctrine in its various forms says is that certain aspects of the world are so important, we all depend on them so much, and they are so inappropriate to be private property, that they are universal common property. They belong to all, no one has the right to exclude others from them, no one has the right to destroy them; as they say legally: to \u201cwaste\u201d them or \u201clay waste\u201d to them.\u201d They are a common property of all people.\n\nThe other critical point about the public trust doctrine is that the governments are the trustees for the people, both the current populations and for posterity. What is a trust duty? That\u2019s when one person or one institution holds property in the interest of another, and they have a responsibility to protect the interests of the other. In fact, they have what\u2019s called a \u201cfiduciary\u201d duty, and that means that it is the highest level of duty, that they have a duty to pay no attention to their own personal interests and no attention to the interests of some third party that might like to have the use of those trust assets \u2014 they have to act entirely in the interests of the beneficiary owners of that trust.\n\nThis is actually a relatively new idea. It was developed primarily by Mary Christina Wood, a law professor at University of Oregon. But it has taken legs to a great extent primarily because of the credible threat posed by climate change and the failure of other government institutions to address it. All the attempts to apply those to climate change have so far not succeeded. So the idea of using the public trust doctrine was taken up as another possible route to deal with this overwhelmingly desperate problem for which there seems to be a dearth of ways \u2014 especially law-based ways \u2014 to deal with.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Traditional methods for fighting global warming have proven fruitless.
