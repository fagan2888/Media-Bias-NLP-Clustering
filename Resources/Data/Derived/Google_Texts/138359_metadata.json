Bill Monning, D-Carmel, will be tracking the program and its data to see if it can serve as a statewide model for providing care and improving health outcomes for the state\u2019s remaining uninsured. While other California counties are engaged in similar programs, Bullick said Monterey County\u2019s program is unique, including because it is aimed at the largest percentage of undocumented residents in the state.\n\nIf the program is approved by the supervisors, it would begin in October and offer a closed provider network, including lab and radiology services through Natividad under an agreement with the health department, and discounted pharmaceuticals through specific local Walgreens stores.\n\nOnce the $500,000 is spent, the program ends, Bullick said, though he said county health officials are hoping local employers step up with additional funding and will seek other funding sources to extend the program. The department is in line for a Blue Shield of California Foundation grant to help pay for administration of the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program is a collaboration between the county health department, Natividad Medical Center and the social justice organization Communities Organized for Relational Power in Action (COPA), which has pushed health coverage for uninsured illegal residents for years.\n\nOn Tuesday, COPA is planning to hold a press conference on the County Government Center campus to respond to the supervisors\u2019 vote on the pilot program.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the supervisors are set to consider a contract with newly appointed Natividad CEO Dr. Gary Gray that would pay him $418,184.85 annually. The board announced last week it had chosen Gray as the county-owned hospital\u2019s top administrator after a national search.\n\nThe proposed contract represents a $12,000 raise for Gray, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer who has also served as interim CEO since February. He replaced Dr. Kelly O\u2019Keefe, a member of the hospital board who served as interim CEO since shortly after former CEO Harry Weis abruptly left last summer following a pay dispute with county officials.\n\nWeis, Gray and Chief Financial Officer Daniel Leon were all involved in the dispute, which centered on contract bonuses tied to the hospital\u2019s bottom line. Neither Gray nor Leon qualify for bonuses anymore after renegotiating their contracts.\n\nJim Johnson can be reached at 726-4348.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salinas >> A pilot health program for Monterey County residents ineligible for expanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, mostly because they are in the country illegally, is finally ready for review by the Board of Supervisors.", "title": "Pilot uninsured health coverage program ready for supervisors", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150911/NEWS/150919935", "image": {"width": "192px", "identifier": "http://local.montereyherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/montereyherald.png?052016", "height": "192px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Pilot uninsured health coverage program ready for supervisors"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Salinas >> A pilot health program for Monterey County residents ineligible for expanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, mostly because they are in the country illegally, is finally ready for review by the Board of Supervisors.", "title": "Pilot uninsured health coverage program ready for supervisors", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20150911/NEWS/150919935", "image": {"src": "http://local.montereyherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/montereyherald.png?052016"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "news_local, Local governments", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "news_local, Local governments"}, "article_summary": "Salinas >> A pilot health program for Monterey County residents ineligible for expanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, mostly because they are in the country illegally, is finally ready for review by the Board of Supervisors.\nOn Tuesday, county supervisors are set to consider approving the pilot program aimed at improving health outcomes for the estimated 50,000 uninsured county residents, and allocating $500,000 in general fund money to cover pharmacy, laboratory and radiology services for eligible patients.\nAdvertisementThe program is a collaboration between the county health department, Natividad Medical Center and the social justice organization Communities Organized for Relational Power in Action (COPA), which has pushed health coverage for uninsured illegal residents for years.\nWhile the health department will track health outcome and cost data to assess the program\u2019s effectiveness, county health department director Ray Bullick said the real benefit is making sure uninsured patients get follow-up care they can\u2019t currently afford and help them avoid developing more serious illnesses that end up costing the county health care system much more in the long run.\nOnce the $500,000 is spent, the program ends, Bullick said, though he said county health officials are hoping local employers step up with additional funding and will seek other funding sources to extend the program."}
