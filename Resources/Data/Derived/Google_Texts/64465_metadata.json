Ackerson, meanwhile, had accused Hayes of being a substance abuser.\n\nIn advance of an August 2011 court hearing, however, Ackerson had made positive changes in her life, Sargeant said, and was optimistic that a family court judge would rule in her favor.\n\n\"She felt really good about the (psychological) evaluation,\" he said. \"We felt it was absolutely favorable. Some of the things alleged by Mr. Hayes \u2013 she didn't find that any of those things were true.\"\n\nBut a month before the custody hearing, Wake County prosecutors say, Grant and Amanda Hayes killed Ackerson in their Raleigh apartment and disposed of her dismembered remains in a Texas creek.\n\nGrant Hayes was found guilty of the crime in September, and prosecutors, now in their second week of testimony in Amanda Hayes' trial, are seeking to prove, in part, that she was resentful of and angry at Ackerson as a result of the custody fight.\n\nDefense attorneys contend their client, who is also charged with accessory after the fact to murder, had no knowledge of Ackerson's death and that she helped in the cover-up only because Grant Hayes \u2013 who they claim is a sociopath \u2013 lied to and manipulated her and then threatened to kill her if she didn't help dispose of the body.\n\nPsychologist Ginger Calloway, who performed the court-ordered evaluation on Grant Hayes and Ackerson, said on cross-examination that she made a number of observations about Grant Hayes and recommended that he see a psychiatrist about a possible mood disorder \"or other possible explanations for the illogical, disturbed thinking that he exhibits.\"\n\nBut prosecutors pointed out for jurors that she also made a number of observations about both of the Hayeses.\n\nCalloway testified that she observed that the wishes, comments and actions of the couple suggested that they \"would effectively erase Laura as the children's mother.\"\n\n\"There was a collective insensitivity to the children's needs for their mother,\" she said.\n\nCalloway said it was obvious that Grant and Amanda Hayes didn't want Ackerson in the children's lives.\n\nProsecutors said Friday that they are nearing the end of their case and that they could rest on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification":
