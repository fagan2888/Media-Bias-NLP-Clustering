Over the years, he has served as mayor of Burlington, the largest city in that state; as a member of the House of Representatives; and (currently) as a United States Senator. We met last week in his office in one of the Senate office buildings in Washington, D.C., and discussed the Clinton years, the way to beat the Right, and whether or not he should run for president in 2016. Needless to say, his take on the current political situation is not exactly the kind of thing you usually hear when you walk the marble halls of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThis conversation has been lightly edited.\n\nI\u2019ve followed what you have been saying for a long time. You and I are both concerned about the big change of our time, which is the concentration of wealth in this country, deindustrialization, the slow decline of the middle class.\n\nThe not-so-slow decline of the middle class.\n\nWhy is it so hard for Americans to talk about this? When the president talks about this, he uses this term \u201cinequality,\u201d and it sounds scientific, but it doesn\u2019t speak to people. For many years, you were the only person on Capitol Hill talking about this at all. Why aren\u2019t people furious about it?\n\nPeople are furious about it.\n\nWe have a very conservative Senate and House. Congress is dominated by large campaign contributors who exercise enormous influence. I think, the people here [in Washington] have almost developed an instinct not to attack the people who put money into their coffers. Obviously the Republicans are beholden to these guys. But too many Democrats are nervous about talking about issues including income and wealth inequality.\n\nBut in fact, the American people absolutely want to hear about it. I talk about it all the time. I give a lot of speeches and large crowds come out. People are very, very concerned about the overall impact of income and wealth inequality in terms of morality, in terms of economics, in terms of\u2014with Citizens United\u2014what it means to our political system.\n\nThe Koch brothers are not tucking their money under the mattress. They\u2019re spending it very significantly trying to buy elections so that candidates representing the wealthy are going to get elected. So it is a huge issue, which people are keenly concerned about. But you have a Congress significantly dependent on the one percent for their campaign contributions and you have the media that is owned by multinational corporations who are not excited about dealing with this issue.\n\nFor Salon, I\u2019ve been doing a series of articles about the history of inequality \u2014 where it comes from, when it got worse. You said the middle class is declining precipitously now\u2026\n\nWhat can I tell you? You know all the facts.\n\nCome on, now. You know this better than me.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know that I do. But you\u2019re looking at, today, an American male worker, the average guy in the middle, the median guy, is making $280 less than he did 44 years ago. Given inflation\u2014\n\nPer week?\n\nPer year. So 44 years have come and gone. There\u2019s a huge amount of increase in productivity. And that guy is making less in inflation-counted dollars than he did 44 years ago. That\u2019s extraordinary. Women are making less than they did \u2014 I don\u2019t have the numbers here \u2014 a number of years ago. Median family income has gone down by $5,000 since 1999.\n\nSo what you\u2019re seeing is a middle class which in fact is disappearing. You\u2019re seeing, up until very recently, more people living in poverty than any time in American history, because most of the new jobs that are being created are low-wage or part-time jobs. And people, believe me, they know it. They understand it. They are worried not only for themselves but for their kids. And meanwhile, while that\u2019s going on, they see another reality which is \u2014 the people on top are doing phenomenally well. Corporate profits are at an all-time high and people do not believe that that is what America is supposed to be about.\n\nAnd yet at the same time we just came through this financial crisis. I mean, there is no better expression of what\u2019s wrong with us. And what\u2019s the reaction? The Tea Party movement, another wave of conservatives sweeping over Capitol Hill.\n\nThe reaction is that you have some very smart people, like the Koch brothers, who do a very effective job of taking the discontent \u2014 that\u2019s what your book was about \u2014 and channeling it in exactly the wrong direction. So you have the rather remarkable reality that the people who founded the Tea Party are the Koch brothers. And if the people, the working class members of the Tea Party, knew what their founders believed in, they would be in for a very big shock. And it\u2019s one of our jobs to get the word out.\n\nGetting back to the history of it. Everybody knows about the \u201980s, the Reagan tax cuts. Everybody talks about deregulation. But we often have trouble talking about the \u201990s. I was reading your book, \u201cOutsider in the House,\u201d about when you first came to Congress back in the \u201990s. And you had NAFTA, welfare reform, bank deregulation \u2014 what\u2019s the significance of these in the long term?\n\nYou had, in terms of NAFTA, the beginning of a disastrous set of trade policies absolutely pushed by corporate America with the goal of making it easier for plants to shut down in this country and move to Mexico.\n\nThat was the goal?\n\nOf course it was the goal. And to cultivate a race to the bottom.\n\nSo what NAFTA, which primarily dealt with Mexico, does \u2014 as well as CAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China \u2014 is it says to the average American worker\u2026 First of all it says, \u201cWe can make 5 cents more by moving to China, so we\u2019re going, have a nice day.\u201d Second of all, what it says is, \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about going to China. If you as a worker don\u2019t want us to go to China, if you as a union don\u2019t want us to go to China, you\u2019re going to have to take a cut in your salary. You\u2019re going to have to take a reduction in healthcare benefits we provide you. Or else, by the way, we\u2019re going.\u201d So what was engaged in was a race to the bottom.\n\nA year or two years ago, there was a piece in the paper that pointed out that GE was expanding a manufacturing plant in Louisville. I asked the guy, I said, \u201cThis is good. You\u2019re creating hundreds of new jobs. That\u2019s very nice. Why are you doing that?\u201d The guy said, \u201cWell, the truth is that when you look at transportation costs, the wage costs, and everything else, the United States is now becoming competitive with the international community.\u201d In other words, as wages go down, and you factor in quality of work, and infrastructure, lack of bribery and transportation costs, America is an increasingly better place [for employers] to work, which has always been the goal. So we are moving down \u2014 we\u2019re not at a Chinese level \u2014 but the goal is a race to the bottom, where workers earn less, have fewer benefits, and that was the goal and we\u2019ve succeeded in doing it.\n\nWelfare reform did a similar kind of thing, I think.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of angry people out there and for a whole bunch of reasons \u2014 political consciousness in this country is very, very low. And people think that huge amounts of their money are going to foreign policy, going to foreign aid, and huge amounts of money are going to welfare. That\u2019s not true, but that\u2019s what people think. So that became an issue where Democrats would say, we\u2019re going to cut. The Republican thesis is that the real cause of the economic decline is that you\u2019re paying too much in taxes and all of that money is going to unwed mothers and that really what the problem is. And it became quote-unquote \u201cgood politics\u201d for some Democrats to pick up on. And it caused a lot of pain.\n\nThese things, along with bank deregulation\u2014one of the sticking points for people like me is that these were all accomplished by a Democratic president.\n\nYes. Why should that be a sticking point? Why are you shocked?\n\nThat\u2019s supposedly the party of working people.\n\nNo. I don\u2019t think anyone thinks that. There\u2019s no question that the Republican Party has become a far-right party, significantly controlled by the Koch brothers and a few others. But the Democratic party has moved, you know. It used to be a center-left party \u2014 Truman, Roosevelt \u2014 it was the party of the American working class. I don\u2019t think there are many people who think that is the case now. It is far better [than the Republican Party], and there are some great people in the Democratic Party who spend an enormous amount of time and energy fighting for working people, and I work with those guys. But I don\u2019t think anybody would say, as a whole, that the Democratic Party is the party of the American working class.\n\nNow, in terms of this deregulation, I mean, one of the great magazine covers in history is the picture \u2014 who was it?\n\nIs it the three musketeers: Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers?\n\nSaving the world.\n\nYes! Classic!\n\nRight. That was one of the great covers of all time, because it tells you pretty much all you need to know about politics. You had Alan Greenspan, who to his credit is an Ayn Rand acolyte. On YouTube someplace there is some dialogue I had with Greenspan which has gotten a zillion viewers, about deregulation. I took him on and questioned him about the impact of deregulation. And he said \u201cNo, it\u2019s not gonna. . . \u201d You know, all these things he was wrong about. I asked him, I said, \u201cI listened to what you say and it sounds to me like you might not even believe in the concept of the minimum wage.\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nReally.\n\nI got one article about it in the L.A. Times. So you had, then, the head of the Federal Reserve basically acknowledging what today is\u2014 By the way, he was ahead of his time. Today, many Republicans acknowledge that they don\u2019t believe in the concept of the minimum wage. So you can work for three bucks. Salon can hire you for three bucks an hour.\n\nIt gets worse and worse, and more and more of our leaders think that\u2019s okay.\n\nWell, you have a situation where, for much of the media, the differentiation between the Democrats and the Republicans are: One party strongly supports gay marriage and gay rights, one party strongly supports the need to address climate change, one party strongly supports immigrant rights, one party has concerns about guns \u2014 and the other party is different. In fact, some things, like economics, is for some people not even relevant. The issue is abortion rights. You\u2019re a liberal? You\u2019re for abortion rights. He\u2019s not. You\u2019re a liberal. He\u2019s a conservative. The fact that you voted, as a liberal, to deregulate Wall Street or to give tax breaks for billionaires, we don\u2019t even consider that part of the political discussion.\n\nSo I think, and where I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the future of this country, I never believed in red states and blue states. I don\u2019t believe that. Recently I was in North Carolina, South Carolina, and in Mississippi, and had nice turnouts. And if you talk about economic issues you find that in this country there is a lot more commonality than the inside-the-Beltway pundits understand.\n\nFor example, a couple of years ago I helped lead the effort to prevent cuts in Social Security. I worked very, very hard for that. You go out to conservative states, you go out to the Tea Party guys, and you say, \u201cDo you think we should cut Social Security and Medicare?\u201d And they\u2019ll say, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d And yet here, you have not only a Republican Party moving very aggressively [in that direction]. You have some Democrats.\n\nYou ask people about Citizens United: \u201cDo you think billionaires should be able to buy elections?\u201d Across the political spectrum, people say no.\n\n\u201cDo you think we should give more tax breaks to billionaires?\u201d Across the political spectrum, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve noticed the same thing. I\u2019m an author, I\u2019m not a politician, but I lecture around the country and these issues make people really mad. People from all walks of life. Here in Washington, D.C., you\u2019ve got all of these political scientists and all these consultants whose job it is to win elections, and if what you\u2019re saying is true, why aren\u2019t they out there hitting this with everything they\u2019ve got?\n\nBecause they\u2019re caught in a bind. The bind is\u2026 Look, if you spend four hours a day \u2014 which is certainly not uncommon around here, Democrat [or] Republican \u2014 being on the phone dialing for dollars, the people you\u2019re going to dial for have a lot of money. And you know what? Some of them do not mind paying more taxes. They understand that that\u2019s the right thing to do. But if you\u2019re hustling up to corporate leaders, if you\u2019re hustling up to wealthy people, they do not want to pay more in taxes. They do not necessarily want to see the minimum wage raised. They certainly do not want to see changes in trade policy.\n\nSo all of this speaks to the extraordinary influence of money in Congress. You know, I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, I don\u2019t think that there is anything that Wall Street does not want that will get passed here. It\u2019s just not going to happen. Or corporate America, anything it doesn\u2019t want, it\u2019s not going to happen. In other words, there is not the political strength to take on corporate America or Wall Street. That\u2019s just the simple fact.\n\nI\u2019ve heard you, in other conversations with reporters, use the term \u201coligarchy\u201d to describe what\u2019s\u2014\n\nYeah. And I believe that. I remember, distinctly \u2014 I can\u2019t remember what happened yesterday, but I sometimes can remember what happened 50 years ago \u2014 and I remember during elementary school, the teachers, looking at these textbooks, and they said, \u201cLook, there are countries in Latin America who have a few very wealthy families who control the whole country. And sometimes they fund both political parties.\u201d\n\nIn Latin America?\n\nYeah. This is 50 years ago. So you had this party and that party, two years these guys serve, and the next two years, doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s one ideology. So if you look at the grotesque distribution of wealth in America, in which the top 1 percent today own 37 percent of the wealth, and the bottom 60 percent own 1.7 percent of the wealth; where one family\u2014the Walton family, of Wal-Mart\u2014own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent; where the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, that smacks to me like oligarchy.\n\nAnd what it is, is the worst level of wealth inequality that exists among major countries, and worse than any time since 1929, before the Great Depression. That\u2019s wealth. And then if you look at income since the Wall Street crash [of 2008], 95 percent of all new income generated in America goes to the top 1 percent. That smacks to me like oligarchy.\n\nAnd then, equally important, because of the Supreme Court decisions of Citizens United, et cetera, you now have a situation where the billionaire class can spend as much money as they want on elections. So it\u2019s not only economic, it is now political. These guys can buy elections.\n\nAnd if the Koch brothers get their way, we will do away with all campaign finance reform. That is now the official position of the leadership of the Republican Party. Which will mean that the Koch brothers won\u2019t have to waste their time doing independent expenditures; they can bring their team of candidates into a room and say, \u201cOkay, you want to run for U.S. Senate in Kansas? Here\u2019s your check for $100 million.\u201d Here\u2019s your check for $100 million, because it doesn\u2019t mean anything to the Koch brothers, their wealth increased by $12 billion last year. So Kansas is a nice state. \u201cHere\u2019s a hundred million. And here is your platform. And here is your media consultant and there is your think tank to write your speeches. We\u2019ll watch you closely, but here\u2019s your check for $100 million and have a nice day.\u201d That\u2019s called buying elections.\n\nSo right now they can do it in a significant way through independent expenditures. But they want to go further. Clarence Thomas in the McCutcheon decision voiced his support for that. And that\u2019s where they\u2019re moving, that\u2019s the leadership of the Republican Party. Add all of that together, when you have a few people owning and controlling and benefitting from the economy, and a few people controlling the political process. You tell me what the word is. I like the word \u201coligarchy.\u201d Do you have a better word?\n\nPlutocracy?\n\nPlutocracy. There you go.\n\nWhat drives me crazy is that we voted for it. This has happened gradually over years. And we\u2019ve let it happen. That\u2019s the puzzle that people like me are trying to figure out. How on earth did this come to pass?\n\nBut you know how this happened, because you wrote a book about it.\n\nI have my ideas.\n\nI think you\u2019re pretty much on track. But \u201cwe voted for it\u201d\u2014let\u2019s talk about \u201cwe voted for it.\u201d\n\nBecause it goes deeper than that. The election coming up in two months, the pundits here tell us, and they may be right \u2014 they may well be wrong, but they may be right \u2014 they estimate that 60 percent of the American people aren\u2019t going to vote. So those guys didn\u2019t vote for it. So you have 40 percent whose incomes are substantially higher, by the way, and are better educated than the general population. Of the 60 percent who don\u2019t vote, no one knows exactly, the guess is 75-to-80 percent of low-income workers don\u2019t vote. I recently talked to a union organizer in South Carolina who\u2019s trying to organize fast food people. And she just checked with the people \u2014 the five or six hundred people that she\u2019s working with, with the voter registration files, and I think 15 of them are registered to vote. You have 5 percent or lower of people working at minimum wage who participate in the political process. It\u2019s not relevant to them. And young people to very large numbers don\u2019t vote as well. And then the Koch brothers spend $400 million.\n\nSo the election system, the electoral system, is clearly rigged. And by that I mean culturally, throw in the media and everything else, what you have is a situation where a majority of the people \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t say majority \u2014 but many people do not understand the significance of government and politics on their lives. If you\u2019re a minimum wage worker and you want to raise your minimum wage \u2014 you\u2019re making $7.25 an hour and you want to raise it to $10.10\u2014and I [hypothetically] don\u2019t want to do it, you wouldn\u2019t vote for me.\n\nIt\u2019s very important to your life. But for a variety of reasons, that is not an issue that a lot of low-income workers are invested in. It has a lot to do with the media and it has to do with many, many things.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve been wrestling with lately is a kind of complacency that you see among Democrats, where they say, \u201cEventually, Democratic domination is inevitable. The demographic changes in this country\u2026\u201d\n\nBelieve me, I\u2019ve heard it 500 times.\n\nSo why do we need to worry?\n\nWhich is obscene. Forget obscene, it\u2019s the wrong word. It\u2019s pathetic.\n\nI\u2019ve been to those meetings with very high-ranking campaign leaders. And that\u2019s exactly what they say. So what they say is, during the Obama campaign, \u201cThis is how we\u2019ll win this election. We\u2019re going to get a huge percentage of the African-American vote. We\u2019re going to get 67 percent of the Hispanic vote. We\u2019re going to get 58 percent of the women\u2019s vote. Et cetera, et cetera. All those trends are on our side. And that\u2019s how we win elections.\u201d\n\nDuring the course of that discussion, the issue of how the party that created Social Security and Medicare is losing the senior vote\u2014or even the issue of seniors\u2014was not there. They have a list of the 87 different categories, and kind of toward the bottom is seniors. The white working class of America, which now votes overwhelmingly for Republicans, was not mentioned. Now, how can it be that the party that is struggling to raise the minimum wage, to fight for pay equity, do reasonable things for working-class people \u2014 not enough by any means \u2014 is losing the white working class to the other side? Very little discussion about that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Bernie Sanders sits down with Salon to talk inequality, the GOP, and whether or not he'll run for president", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Longterm Democratic strategy is \u201cpathetic\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Senator Bernie Sanders sits down with Salon to talk inequality, the GOP, and whether or not he'll run for president", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Longterm Democratic strategy is \u201cpathetic\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/28/we_need_a_political_revolution_bernie_sanders_on_americas_broken_political_system/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/bernie_sanders3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senator Bernie Sanders sits down with Salon to talk inequality, the GOP, and whether or not he'll run for president", "title": "Bernie Sanders: Longterm Democratic strategy is \u201cpathetic\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/bernie_sanders3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Frank", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American Politics, Bernie Sanders, Citizens United, Election 2016, Income inequality, Koch Brothers, Political corruption", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b61\"", "article_summary": "And meanwhile, while that\u2019s going on, they see another reality which is \u2014 the people on top are doing phenomenally well.\nThat\u2019s wealth.\nTopics: American Politics, Bernie Sanders, Citizens United, Election 2016, Income inequality, Koch Brothers, Political corruptionBernie Sanders is a legendary political independent from Vermont.\nBut I don\u2019t think anybody would say, as a whole, that the Democratic Party is the party of the American working class.\nI don\u2019t think there are many people who think that is the case now."}
