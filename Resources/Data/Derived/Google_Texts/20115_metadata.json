It was too painful for the Holocaust survivor, too close to reality.\n\nBut now, almost 70 years after his village in Poland was liberated by the Soviet army, Gersten is meeting the man who is the Oskar Schindler of his own life: Czeslaw Polziec.\n\nLike Schindler, Polziec is Catholic. His family secretly sheltered Gersten in rural Poland for two years during World War II.\n\nAs though such a reunion between survivor and rescuer were not emotional enough, this one is taking place Wednesday on the eve of Hanukkah, which coincides this year with Thanksgiving. Two celebrations of gratitude.\n\nGersten, 79, had tried to imagine how he might feel when he would finally meet his Polish friend at John F. Kennedy International Airport. He said only this: \u201cI think it will be a physical reaction.\u201d\n\nAnd it was. The two men embraced. Then, they embraced again.\n\n\"Hi, hi, hi,\" Polziec said, his English limited to just a few words.\n\nBut words seemed useless now anyway. For Gersten, none seemed adequate for a man who saved his life. A man who had, through his actions, given him precious assurance there was goodness left in a world that seemed purely evil.\n\n\u201cI am alive because of them,\u201d Gersten said of Polziec and his family. \u201cThey are heroes.\u201d\n\nGersten had waited for this day when he could express his gratitude in person. When he could show Polziec his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They were the greatest proof of the enormity of the Polziec family's actions.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, the two men will sit down for a formal dinner and on Sunday, several generations of Gersten\u2019s family, including a granddaughter traveling from Israel, will share a meal with Polziec at a New York restaurant.\n\n\u201cHow wonderful to be able to see him,\u201d Gersten said earlier this week, each word laced with the kind of anticipation a soldier coming home after battle feels. \u201cHow wonderful to be reunited, share memories.\u201d\n\nWith Polziec by his side, Gersten\u2019s Hanukkah promises to be special. He plans to perform an act he was never able to do when he was in hiding on Polziec\u2019s family farm, one that will celebrate the miracle of his survival.\n\nLife in the attic\n\nThe shared memories will take Gersten back to Frystak, Poland. To July 1942.\n\nGersten\u2019s mother, Frieda Tepper Gersten, worked as a peddler and traveled throughout southern Poland, selling fabric and other items. She and Leon moved from the town of Rzeszow to Frystak to live with her parents shortly after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. Gersten\u2019s father, Yonasan, was unable to get work in Frystak and stayed in Rzeszow with Gersten\u2019s sister and three brothers.\n\nGersten never saw his father or siblings again. He has no photos except one of his sister. He knows they all perished but everything else is blank. Where? When? How?\n\nThen one July day, the Germans ordered the Jews of Frystak to assemble in the marketplace. They rounded up 1,600 people, mostly children and the elderly, marched them outside town, slaughtered them and tossed their bodies like garbage into a mass grave.\n\nAmong the dead were Gersten\u2019s grandparents.\n\nHis mother knew she and her son would die, too, unless she escaped the Jewish ghetto. She disguised herself as a Catholic, a cross around her neck. With her boy, she walked into the countryside and knocked on the doors of her customers to ask for shelter for herself and her son - as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their son.\n\nMany turned her away. It was risky to come to the aid of Jews. It could prove fatal.\n\nBut the Polziecs were different.\n\nMaria and Stanislaw Polziec lived on a farm in nearby Zawadka with their four daughters and son, Czeslaw. They had barely the means to feed their own family, let alone buy food for five strangers.\n\nBut they took in the desperate Jews and created a living space for them in a dark attic above their barn. Czeslaw Polziec brought them food and stood guard when other people came to the farm.\n\nGersten remembers receiving one big loaf of bread a week. It was divided into five \u2013 the two boys got first pick. And there were potatoes. Gersten offered his uncle an extra potato for every two hours he entertained the boys with stories.\n\n\u201cFood was very tight,\u201d Gersten said. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t starving.\u201d\n\nThe space was adequate, too. The main problem was inactivity. There was nothing to do. Gersten watched spiders catch flies. Or plucked lice from his cousin\u2019s head. That\u2019s how he passed time.\n\nGersten was only 8 then; Polziec, 10. Their interaction was limited.\n\nSometimes, in the early morning, Gersten climbed down the ladder to help Polziec in the stable. There were two cows, a horse and pig.\n\nOther times, Polziec picked mushrooms and brought them up for soup.\n\nOn some winter nights, the attic got cold and the Polziecs invited their Jewish guests into their home to spend the evening in warmth.\n\nThey built an earthen bunker in the barn to hide Gersten and his family for the times when Germans raided the farm. It measured 4 feet by 3 feet and was just big enough to hold five people. It resembled a grave, really. The Polziecs slid a big, wooden grain storage bin over the opening to deflect suspicion.\n\nOne night, Nazi collaborators raided the farm and heard the footsteps of Gersten\u2019s family scurrying into the bunker. They questioned Stanislaw Polziec, who blamed the noise on children in the attic. The collaborators beat Stanislaw, bloodied him without mercy. Gersten could hear the Polziec family\u2019s screams. Still, the Polziecs did not betray the Jews.\n\nGersten said he remains impressed the Polziecs never showed any resentment toward their Jewish guests for the enormous danger they had brought them.\n\nGersten remained in the Polziec\u2019s attic for two years, until the day in 1944 when Soviet soldiers liberated the area. Gersten and his mother eventually moved to America.\n\n'Should we have let them die?'\n\nFor many years after, Gersten had dreams of being shot by the Nazis. He liked sleeping when it rained. All those months in hiding, he\u2019d felt secure on stormy nights, knowing the Nazis would not go out to look for Jews then.\n\nHe grappled with his own survival as he made a new life for himself in New York.\n\n\u201cMy mother was very religious,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had a more positive outlook about surviving, although we could never answer why God would want us to survive over others.\u201d\n\nGersten and his mother kept up with the Polziecs after the war. They sent a few dollars and care packages with clothes back to Poland.\n\nGersten earned a doctorate in educational psychology from Columbia University and started his own practice. He stopped speaking Polish \u2013 his mother tongue was Yiddish - and forgot it with time. He never yearned to return to the town where he lived as a boy. His house and the life he once knew were gone. So were most of his loved ones.\n\n\u201cI have ambivalent feelings about going back there,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the years, he lost contact with the Polziecs. But after his mother died, Gersten wrote to the Jewish Historical Society in Poland about what the Polziecs had done. About two years ago, he decided to submit the family\u2019s name to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official memorial to victims of the Holocaust. The memorial also recognizes non-Jews who helped Jews survive. Schindler\u2019s name is in that database, as are the Polziecs'.\n\nIn America, The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous helped Gersten find Czeslaw Polziec in Poland. His parents had passed away years before.\n\nThe New York-based foundation supports non-Jews who refused to remain passive during the Holocaust. About 650 rescuers in Europe receive funding for food and essential goods like heating fuel.\n\nThe foundation is sponsoring Polziec\u2019s visit to New York, including a dinner honoring him and his family.\n\nStanlee Stahl, the executive director of the foundation, visited Polziec in Poland. It was not possible for CNN to speak with him before the reunion - he was preparing to make the long journey across the Atlantic.\n\nBut Stahl described him as someone who has the handsomely rugged looks of a retired Marine. He served in the Polish army and then worked in security for many years.\n\nPolziec doesn\u2019t think of himself or his family as heroes, he told the foundation. They were God-fearing people, ordinary people, who simply did what they deemed the right thing to do in a desperate situation.\n\nShould we have let them die? he asked in a statement to the foundation.\n\n\u201cThe question alone does not bear thinking about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had every right to live. Nobody who has not lived through those desolate days will ever really understand what my parents did, and I am sure, were they still with us, they would be surprised that an honor has been bestowed upon them.\u201d\n\nStahl said the foundation has helped arrange 18 reunions between survivors and rescuers. But this year, because Hanukkah coincides with Thanksgiving, Gersten\u2019s reunion with Polziec is truly special.\n\n\u201cWe owe a great deal of gratitude to these righteous gentiles,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cThey saved the honor of humanity.\u201d\n\nGersten, meanwhile, said he remains amazed by the loyalty of the Polziecs, especially Czeslaw and his sisters, who were so young then. They went to school and church and interacted with so many people. Yet they never uttered a word.\n\nThat\u2019s something Gersten plans to point out when he sits down for Thanksgiving dinner with Polziec. He will be grateful that for two years, his Polish friend kept a secret.\n\nBut before that, on Wednesday night, Gersten is looking forward to lighting a Hanukkah menorah, which commemorates the rededication of the ancient temple and the miracle of one day\u2019s worth of oil lasting eight.\n\nGersten was never able to light a menorah when he was hiding in Polziec\u2019s home. The light would have given away the family\u2019s presence, put an end to their survival. Now with Polziec finally by his side again, Gersten\u2019s menorah will symbolize his own family\u2019s miracle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Moni Basu, CNN (CNN) -- Leon Gersten could not bear to watch \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d the movie about Czech industrialist Oskar Schindler who saved 1,200 Jews from Nazi extermination camps.
