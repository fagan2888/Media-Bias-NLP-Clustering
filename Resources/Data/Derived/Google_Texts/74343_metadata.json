He added:\n\nDespite all of that there is a huge thirst for knowledge and information from the outside world. North Koreans risk their lives to watch Hollywood films \u2026 and \u201cThe Interview\u201d is tremendously threatening to the Kims. They cannot abide by anything that portrays them as anything other than a god. This movie destroys the narrative.\n\nIt is unclear how successful the campaign will be in a country where citizens often lack even the most basic communications technology. The AP reports that North Koreans must obtain permission from the government to own a computer, and that they often cost as much as three months\u2019 salary.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, \u201caccess to televisions and DVD players [in North Korea] is believed to be more widespread.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a totalitarian country the state endeavors to control all citizens, and so every activity that is not government-sponsored is a subversive act,\u201d Halvorssen told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWatching a film is a crime for which you can be executed.\u201d\n\nHRF recently launched the #HackThemBack campaign, an initiative through which \u201cprivate citizens can help North Korean defectors, who are very excited about the film, amplify, refine and intensify efforts to break the monopoly of information that the Kim regime imposes over its 25 million people.\u201d\n\nThe initiative seeks to \u201chack\u201d the North Korean regime by providing its citizens with information about human rights and liberty via balloon drops, radio waves and DVDs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An activist has decided to bring \"The Interview\" to the people of North Korea.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An activist has decided to bring \"The Interview\" to the people of North Korea.", "title": "Activist's Clever Idea to Bring 'The Interview' to North Korea", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/lrphotos087927.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-01T22:45:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xgHvsD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An activist has decided to bring \"The Interview\" to the people of North Korea.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/lrphotos087927.jpg"}, "title": "Activist's Clever Idea to Bring 'The Interview' to North Korea", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-01-03T03:01:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T22:45:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "North Korea, The Interview, Pyongyang, South Korea, Human Rights Foundation, Seth Rogen, James Franco, Sony, Sony Hack, Communism"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaedd\"", "article_summary": "An activist has decided to bring \u201cThe Interview\u201d to the people of North Korea.\nPark Sang-hak, a North Korean defector and an activist against its regime, will launch into North Korea balloons carrying DVDs and USBs containing the controversial film, according to the Associated Press.\nNorth Koreans risk their lives to watch Hollywood films \u2026 and \u201cThe Interview\u201d is tremendously threatening to the Kims.\nPark said he plans to send 100,000 DVDs and USBs with the movie into North Korea.\nThe AP reports that North Koreans must obtain permission from the government to own a computer, and that they often cost as much as three months\u2019 salary."}
