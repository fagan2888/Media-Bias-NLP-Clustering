We\u2019re looking at how we can move to a lower-cost environment while protecting quality.\u201d\n\nSaving money and reducing variance\n\nAt Medical City Dallas (Texas) Hospital, the CQO Movement is being implemented in the form of the Clinical Value Analysis Team (C-VAT), a physician-led committee created to evaluate new products and technology.\n\nComposed primarily of physicians, as well as four of the hospital\u2019s top administrators, C-VAT focuses on physician collaboration and shares clinical practice processes with all of Medical City Dallas\u2019 sister hospitals, explained Amy Yazbeck, clinical resource director at Medical City Dallas Hospital and a member of C-VAT.\n\nThe team reviews new items and technology based on clinical and financial evidence, then looks at outcomes that physicians either expect to achieve or have seen at another hospital. Next, members vote on whether they will allow the product to be used.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to dictate practice\u2014that\u2019s not the goal,\u201d Yazbeck said. \u201cThe goal is to collaborate with physicians on the hospital side and be transparent with them about the financial impact.\u201d\n\n[See also: An Amazon-like coup for the supply chain.]\n\nYazbeck has seen two obvious improvements from the formation of the team. The first is a significant increase in communication. Rather than being told what they can and can\u2019t use, physicians present their requests to C-VAT and explain why they want to use a certain product and what they hope to achieve by using it. The C-VAT team members ask questions of the physicians and explain the financial ramifications of choosing the product.\n\n\u201cThe committee has done wonders for physician engagement here,\u201d Yazbeck said. \u201cThey feel like they have a voice. These meetings also encourage the requesting physicians to be more aware of their product usage, as well as the financial impact of their choices.\u201d\n\nThe second positive outcome of C-VAT has been in cost savings. Recently, the team evaluated a high-dollar product that was being used frequently in their healthcare system. The product had no clinical evidence supporting its use and yielded no additional reimbursement. C-VAT voted to remove it from the hospital, creating roughly $400,000 in savings.\n\nPromoting the profession, standardizing practices\n\nThe CQO Movement also increases the profile of supply chain managers, essentially promoting them from order placers and inventory managers to decision-makers and strategic planners.\n\n\u201cOnce the Affordable Care Act pushed hospitals to remove all these costs, it thrust the supply chain leader from a historic position of the tactical manager who moved boxes in the basement to a strategic thinker for the entire hospital,\u201d Petty said.\n\nKirkpatrick agrees. \u201cThe CQO Movement helps supply chain professionals be seen more as strategic assets and leaders in their facility. They\u2019ve moved beyond being thought of as gatekeepers who say \u2018no\u2019 to buying this, that or the other, to resources who really understand the products and their use.\n\n\u201cNow they can be a part of an interdisciplinary team, along with clinicians, physicians and IT professionals, who search for that [CQO] intersection together,\u201d Kirkpatrick added. \u201cThat kind of team can really change the face of medicine over time.\u201d\n\n[See also: Automating the supply chain .]\n\nPetty also believes that the CQO Movement will decrease the rate of errors, giving the example of two surgeons in the same clinic using two different procedures to remove a gallbladder.\n\n\u201cWhile both may be good practices, ensuring that physicians at the same hospital or region use the same best practice, CQO allows us the potential to lower the error rate\u201d and be more efficient, Petty said.\n\n\u201cOther industries have already accomplished this and we can, too,\u201d Petty continued. \u201cStandardizing outcomes and reducing variation are key. Medical errors and inefficiencies are \u2026 driving up cost and compromising quality, and they must be addressed under healthcare reform.\u201d\n\nHelping meet reform guidelines\n\nGathering data to find that ideal intersection can be time-intensive, but when new healthcare guidelines include not being reimbursed for ailments that happened during a patient\u2019s stay (skin ulcers, for example), it\u2019s becoming imperative to capture the information.\n\n\u201cA product could be the lowest cost, but if you have to use three or four of that item to do the job compared to one use of another, more expensive product, at the end of the day it\u2019s costing you more to use that cheaper product,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cThe CQO process is about looking at the true quality of a product, rather than marketing collateral, to make decisions. In actuality, the flashy new product may not improve outcomes at all. We have to make sure the cost is not beyond the intersection of quality and outcomes.\u201d\n\nWhile the CQO Movement is still too new to firmly gauge its success, Kirkpatrick believes it\u2019s only logical that it will help hospitals meet healthcare reform mandates. \u201cReimbursements will continue to be cut, so they must continue to lower their cost structures. But it doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of quality and outcomes,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/calculating-total-cost-healing-environment", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/med-city-dallas_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Though supply chain professionals are keenly aware of the importance of quality and cost, their clinical counterparts may not be as familiar with an organized movement to link these two components with patient outcomes.", "title": "Calculating the total cost of the healing environment"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/med-city-dallas_0.gif"}, "description": "Though supply chain professionals are keenly aware of the importance of quality and cost, their clinical counterparts may not be as familiar with an organized movement to link these two components with patient outcomes.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Calculating the total cost of the healing environment"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Though supply chain professionals are keenly aware of the importance of quality and cost, their clinical counterparts may not be as familiar with an organized movement to link these two components with patient outcomes.&#13; The Cost, Quality and Outcomes (CQO) Movement was launched by the Association for Healthcare Resource &amp; Materials Management (AHRMM) in January 2013, but it has already reaped many positive results for supply chain leaders.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc039\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe focus is the total cost of that healing environment, from the time a person is admitted to discharge.\nHealthcare reform has been a key factor in the creation of the CQO Movement.\n\u201cThe CQO Movement helps supply chain professionals be seen more as strategic assets and leaders in their facility.\n\u201cThat analysis goes well beyond calculating the total cost of these products to assessing the kind of outcomes we\u2019re getting from their use and how they\u2019re impacting areas such as readmission rates.\u201dThough the CQO Movement is still relatively new, its foundational concepts are not.\nThe Cost, Quality and Outcomes (CQO) Movement was launched by the Association for Healthcare Resource & Materials Management (AHRMM) in January 2013, but it has already reaped many positive results for supply chain leaders."}
