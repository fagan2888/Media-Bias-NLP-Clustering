And that kind of wakes us up. It feels good having the lead, and we got it in the first inning. I think \u2018De La\u2019 fed off that and he just did his job. It was one of the best performance I have seen from \u2018De La.\u2019 \u201c\n\nUnfortunately for the Rockies, there was more bad news on the injury front. De La Rosa, who might have had a chance for a complete-game shutout, left the game with one out in the eighth after fielding a grounder by Scott Van Slyke. De La Rosa appeared to re-injure the left groin that cost him the first two weeks of the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little concerning that he had to come out in the eighth, but we are hoping it\u2019s not too bad and he\u2019s able to make his next start,\u201d said Walt Weiss, who returned to manage after missing two games after undergoing an appendectomy on Wednesday. \u201cThe groin is a concern because it\u2019s been somewhat chronic, so we\u2019ll see how he is tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa said he tweaked his groin when his spike caught the turf.\n\n\u201cI felt it a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I told them about it, so they took me out.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa entered the game winless in four starts and with a 9.56 ERA. Last Sunday at Coors Field against the Dodgers, he lasted only four innings, giving up five runs on five hits and walking six.\n\nBut he was at his best Saturday night, allowing no runs on just two hits with no walks and three strikeouts. His ERA dropped exactly three runs to 6.56.\n\nThe Rockies not only beat L.A., they beat right-hander Zack Greinke, who entered the game 5-0 with a 1.52 ERA, second-lowest in the majors.\n\nIt was one of the most satisfying victories of a frustrating season for the Rockies, who won for just the second time in their last 14 games, and for the sixth time in their last 24.\n\nGonzalez, showing signs that he\u2019s waking up from his season-long hibernation at the plate, hit a solo homer to right-center off Greinke in the first. Greinke tried to throw a 2-0 fastball past Gonzalez and CarGo hit it 425 feet \u2014 not an easy feat through the Pacific air at Dodger Stadium.\n\nGonzalez hit a three-run, go-ahead homer in the ninth inning of Colorado\u2019s 5-4 win over the Dodgers on Thursday. That was his first RBI since April 25.\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019s near to regaining his form at the plate, CarGo answered: \u201cClose. I would say it feels good. I never doubted myself. I think the biggest thing for me is that I have been in this situation before. I try not to pay attention to the scoreboard. Anybody can have a bad month.\n\n\u201cI see myself at the end of the season hitting over .300. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to hit over .300, but that\u2019s my goal.\u201d\n\nGreinke departed after six innings, his only mistake being the misplaced fastball to CarGo.\n\nDescalo\u2019s two-run homer in the seventh provided a nice cushion. His first home run in a Rockies uniform, and his first ever against the Dodgers, came on an 83 mph changeup by reliever Sergio Santos.\n\nArenado cranked a two-run homer to left in the Colorado\u2019s three-run eighth. Arenados\u2019 seventh homer of the season also came off Santos, who was roundly booed by the Dodger faithful.\n\nThe game was filled with defensive gems. Dodgers center fielder Kike Hernandez turned into the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d in the fourth, robbing Michael McKenry of extra bases. Hernandez, running with his back to the plate, made an over-the-shoulder grab and then slammed into the padded center-field wall. Legendary Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully called it \u201cA Willie Mays catch.\u201d\n\nArenado countered in the seventh, making a bare-handed scoop of Jimmy Rollins\u2019 roller and throwing him out by a quarter-step. And Blackmon made a highlight of his own, making a running grab of Greinke\u2019s drive to deep left-center in the third.\n\nUnfortunately for Colorado, left fielder Corey Dickerson came up injured after his long chase toward the ball and was removed from the game after the inning. Dickerson has been playing with a painful case of plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He has said it doesn\u2019t affect him while he\u2019s hitting, but it flares up when runs on the bases or in the outfield.\n\n\u201cWhen he hit the track, the soft track, (the injury) bit him,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cLike we have talked about, it\u2019s something he\u2019s going to have to deal with, to some extent, for a little while. But he\u2019s done pretty well so far.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jorge De La Rosa dominant in the Rockies\u2019 win over the Dodgers", "title": "Jorge De La Rosa dominant in the Rockies\u2019 win over the Dodgers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/16/jorge-de-la-rosa-dominant-in-the-rockies-win-over-the-dodgers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516__De-la-rosap1.jpg", "height": 416}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516__De-la-rosap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-16T22:06:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T04:34:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff3b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDe La (Rosa) set the tone for us, and CarGo set the tone, too, with that first-inning bomb,\u201d Arenado said.\nDe La Rosa appeared to re-injure the left groin that cost him the first two weeks of the regular season.\nBehind a sparkling performance by left-hander Jorge De La Rosa and home runs by Carlos Gonzalez, Daniel Descalso and Nolan Arenado, the Rockies pounded out a 7-1 victory.\n\u201cThe groin is a concern because it\u2019s been somewhat chronic, so we\u2019ll see how he is tomorrow.\u201dDe La Rosa said he tweaked his groin when his spike caught the turf.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I told them about it, so they took me out.\u201dDe La Rosa entered the game winless in four starts and with a 9.56 ERA."}
