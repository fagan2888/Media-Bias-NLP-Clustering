Some breaking news from the Wall Street Journal…

Novartis AG /quotes/zigman/171707/delayed /quotes/nls/nvs NVS is recalling several million free samples of blood-pressure treatments and other medications over concerns a chemical used to package the drugs may have contaminated them.

The news comes a day after the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that some patients aged 60 and over may not need blood-pressure medication as higher readings may be normal for people in that age group. But those findings didn’t hurt Swiss-based Novartis, which makes the blood-pressure drugs Exforge, Diovan and Tekturna, as the company’s shares were up more than 1% to $78.57.

Further, late news of the recall — which included those blood-pressure treatments as well as Lescol cholesterol tablets and Parkinson’s disease medication Stalevo — that came after the close didn’t seem to impact the drug-making giant’s shares much in post-session trades. Shares were down marginally to $78.35, not enough to wipe regular session gains.

Most of the recall centered around Exforge, which accounted for 4.7 million of the 5.3 million bottles recalled. Ink on the sleeves of the bottles apparently had contaminated some of the medicines, though the company said it didn’t pose a safety risk to patients.
