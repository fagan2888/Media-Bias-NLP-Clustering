But because of the Affordable Care Act, those policies no longer cut it \u2013 and universities are forced to decide whether to offer significantly higher-cost plans or cancel coverage altogether.\n\nThe new rules affect a broad swath of American schools, especially the small ones.\n\nAt Bowie State University in Maryland, the cost of student health insurance policies went from roughly $100 a year to $1,800 a year.\n\nThe cancelled plan offered $5,000 worth of medical coverage to students for just $54 per semester. University administrators said an acceptable replacement under the Affordable Care Act would have cost $900 per semester, a 1,500 percent increase.\n\nStudents who need individual coverage are likely to find a better deal for themselves on the Maryland Health Connection insurance exchange, University spokeswoman Cassandra Robinson said.\n\nIn the end, the school decided to drop the policy for all of its 5,500 enrollees. Students were notified of the dropped coverage on the school\u2019s website.\n\n\"Bowie State University has suspended offering health insurance for domestic students for the 2013-2014 academic year,\" according to the school's official website. \"Due to new requirements of the Affordable Care Act which will go into effect on January 1, 2014, the cost of insurance for domestic students will increase to approximately $1800 per year.\"\n\nThe sticker shock didn\u2019t sit well with some students who spoke out against the price hike.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve haven\u2019t done anything Obama and I am disappointed in you,\u201d one student said. Another told Campus Reform, \u201cWe don\u2019t have that money. We can barely afford books.\u201d\n\nThe frustration has been felt across the country as colleges and universities have to decide whether to cut coverage or offer sky-high plans that in some cases triple the cost of premiums.\n\nIn New Jersey, students who enrolled in this past semester were the first class that had to shoulder the higher premium costs. Many community colleges in Bergen and Passaic counties were forced to cut student coverage altogether.\n\nIn Cranford, N.J., Stephen Nacco, the Union County Community College Vice President of Administrative Services, says the cost of health insurance is now \u201cmore than a thousand dollars per students and that it is dramatically different\u201d than what it had been in the past.\n\nStudents were paying so little before because the coverage they received was so scant. The costs have gone up because under ObamaCare, plans must offer coverage for services like annual checkups and alcohol abuse treatments. Because they offer a wider range of services, the premiums also increase.\n\nAccording to the New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities, students at nine schools in the state saw the cost of their policies triple, Paul Shelly, a spokesman for the organization told North Jersey.com.\n\nIt\u2019s been a similar story across most of the country.\n\nAccording to a 2008 study by the Government Accountability Office, about 6,000 students or about 7 percent of the total number of 18-to-23-year-olds in college, bought their own insurance, usually through plans arranged with the school.\n\nThe same study found that 60 percent of schools\u2019 plans had coverage of $50,000 or less for specific conditions, and almost all the rest had some sort of payout caps that they will have to do away with by 2014.\n\nIn the past, students at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kan., were offered a one-year plan that cost students $445, with payouts capping at $10,000. For the 2012-2013 academic year, the payout cap was increased to $100,000 per the new health care overhaul, which meant students at Bethany would have to shell out more than $2,000 for coverage. It apparently was too much in the end.\n\nBob Schmoll, Bethany\u2019s vice president for finance, told The Wall Street Journal, the school \u201cdecided not to offer coverage for our students next year\u201d given the proposed increase in premium. Schmoll says the school could have kept the limited-coverage plan but that it would have financially not been feasible.\n\nAdministrators at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, Cornell College in Iowa and the University of Puget Sound in Washington also told students they would be dropping school-sponsored coverage. The three schools say student premiums would have gone up 10-fold.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:27:03 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "While millions of Americans are watching their individual polices canceled due to ObamaCare regulations, the new health care rules are also having a major impact on campuses.", "twitter": {"description": "While millions of Americans are watching their individual polices canceled due to ObamaCare regulations, the new health care rules are also having a major impact on campuses.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447094209340.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Students suffer ObamaCare sticker shock as premiums soar, plans get cut", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Students suffer ObamaCare sticker shock as premiums soar, plans get cut\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447094209340.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-18T18:49:45Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"31ddaf89-5014-4bc6-a000-de2e97102edb\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "While millions of Americans are watching their individual polices canceled due to ObamaCare regulations, the new health care rules are also having a major impact on campuses.", "dc.identifier": "31ddaf89-5014-4bc6-a000-de2e97102edb", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthc", "description": "While millions of Americans are watching their individual polices canceled due to ObamaCare regulations, the new health care rules are also having a major impact on campuses.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Students Suffer Obamacare Sticker Shock As Premiums Soar, Plans Get Cut", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 01:27:03 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "While millions of Americans are watching their individual polices canceled due to ObamaCare regulations, the new health care rules are also having a major impact on campuses.", "title": "Students suffer ObamaCare sticker shock as premiums soar, plans get cut | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447094209340.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-11-18", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Students suffer ObamaCare sticker shock as premiums soar, plans get cut\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1447094209340.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-18T18:49:45Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/18/students-suffer-sticker-shock-from-obamacare.html\",\"post_id\":\"31ddaf89-5014-4bc6-a000-de2e97102edb\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "article_summary": "The costs have gone up because under ObamaCare, plans must offer coverage for services like annual checkups and alcohol abuse treatments.\nIn the past, students at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kan., were offered a one-year plan that cost students $445, with payouts capping at $10,000.\n\"Bowie State University has suspended offering health insurance for domestic students for the 2013-2014 academic year,\" according to the school's official website.\nAt Bowie State University in Maryland, the cost of student health insurance policies went from roughly $100 a year to $1,800 a year.\nThe cancelled plan offered $5,000 worth of medical coverage to students for just $54 per semester."}
