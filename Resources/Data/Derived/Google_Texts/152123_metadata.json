However, the included URL was written as healthcare.org instead of the more accurate healthcare.gov.\n\nThe incorrect message was removed, and the \u201cEdge of Glory\u201d singer re-posted the tweet this time with her photo turned the right way, but with the same incorrect link. Sigh.\n\nThat message later disappeared as well, and finally she got it right \u2013 and a bonus retweet from the White House.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time celebrities have botched Twitter tasks delegated to them from government forces. In 2011, Kim Kardashian was asked by the Los Angeles Police Department to warn her followers of an impending highway closure.\n\nKardashian complied, tweeting: \"Remember this weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San Fernando Valley and the West Side!!\"\n\nJust one problem. The closure wasn\u2019t until two weeks time. The \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star tried to correct her mistake, tweeting: \"Remember next weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San Fernando Valley and the West Side!!\"\n\nWrong again. She scrubbed both botches and finally got the dates right.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "news", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Political,/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Pop Tarts", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-07 06:16:49 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "On Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare \u2013 but botched things up not once, but twice.", "twitter": {"description": "On Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare \u2013 but botched things up not once, but twice.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/10/03/lady-gaga-tweets-for-obamacare-sends-out-wrong-address-twice.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/slideshow/2013/08/12/lovely-and-talented-lady-gaga/_jcr_content/slideshow-par/slide_image/image.img.jpg/0/0/1422604274743.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Lady Gaga tweets for ObamaCare, sends out wrong address\u2026 twice", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Political\",\"/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Pop Tarts\"],\"author\":\"Hollie McKay\",\"subSection\":\"entertainment/news\",\"title\":\"Lady Gaga tweets for ObamaCare, sends out wrong address\\u2026 twice\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/slideshow/2013/08/12/lovely-and-talented-lady-gaga/_jcr_content/slideshow-par/slide_image/image.img.jpg/0/0/1422604274743.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-03T17:10:01Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/10/03/lady-gaga-tweets-for-obamacare-sends-out-wrong-address-twice.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"716532bf-5de4-4acd-8326-b79d589d74a2\",\"section\":\"entertainment\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "On Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare \u2013 but botched things up not once, but twice.", "dc.identifier": "716532bf-5de4-4acd-8326-b79d589d74a2", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "On Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare \u2013 but botched things up not once, but twice.", "title": "Lady Gaga tweets for ObamaCare, sends out wrong address\u2026 twice | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/10/03/lady-gaga-tweets-for-obamacare-sends-out-wrong-address-twice.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/slideshow/2013/08/12/lovely-and-talented-lady-gaga/_jcr_content/slideshow-par/slide_image/image.img.jpg/0/0/1422604274743.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "political,poptarts", "description": "On Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare \u2013 but botched things up not once, but twice.", "prism.section": "entertainment", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Lady Gaga Tweets For Obamacare, Sends Out Wrong Address\u2026 Twice", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-07 06:16:49 EST", "column": "pop-tarts", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-10-03", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Political\",\"/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Pop Tarts\"],\"author\":\"Hollie McKay\",\"subSection\":\"entertainment/news\",\"title\":\"Lady Gaga tweets for ObamaCare, sends out wrong address\\u2026 twice\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/slideshow/2013/08/12/lovely-and-talented-lady-gaga/_jcr_content/slideshow-par/slide_image/image.img.jpg/0/0/1422604274743.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-03T17:10:01Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/10/03/lady-gaga-tweets-for-obamacare-sends-out-wrong-address-twice.html\",\"post_id\":\"716532bf-5de4-4acd-8326-b79d589d74a2\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"entertainment\"}", "dc.creator": "Hollie McKay"}, "article_summary": "Kardashian complied, tweeting: \"Remember this weekend the 405 Fwy is gonna be closed between the San Fernando Valley and the West Side!!\"\nOn Wednesday, the pop princess attempted to help the President out by tweeting her support for ObamaCare \u2013 but botched things up not once, but twice.\nThe incorrect message was removed, and the \u201cEdge of Glory\u201d singer re-posted the tweet this time with her photo turned the right way, but with the same incorrect link.\nShould Lady Gaga just stick to crazy costumes and thrusting about with her Little Monsters?\nFirst, Gaga posted a picture of herself \u2013 accidentally rotated sideways \u2013 holding a sign with the tag #getcovered."}
