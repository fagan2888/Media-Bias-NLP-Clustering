Students at the University of Denver were told to stay inside as police looked for a “suspicious person” on campus Sunday night.

The person, however, was a suspected bicycle thief who was not found, Denver police spokesman explained, clarifying the university’s alert.

The first message was sent out at 8:50 p.m. An “all clear” message was sent out at about 9:30 p.m.

The person was spotted near the 1900 block of South University Boulevard, according to one @DUalert tweet.

No one was immediately detained, however, Jackson said.

Comments on Twitter suggested the person was armed and dangerous, but that was never the case, Jackson said.

Messages to the university were not immediately returned Sunday night.
