House pled guilty to fraud charges after paying $1 million for a 2006 Bugatti Veyron and insuring the car for $2.2 million. He drove the Bugatti into the Gulf of Mexico and left the engine running, causing it to take in salt water. House reported he had lost control while using his cell phone and, the next day, he filed an insurance claim, not knowing that another motorist had videoed the entire thing and posted it on YouTube (sound NSFW). He faces up to 20 years in the Club Fed.\n\nThe New York Times offered a video report on the ultimate vehicle for virtual sex, a hyper-real, anatomically correct doll that is being programmed with a personality. The developer claimed that the personality was the hard part because, \u201cIf you get the doll confused and she says something inappropriate, you think she\u2019s dumb and you don\u2019t even want to go in the bedroom.\u201d Cousin Ray was highly amused. \u201cThink of the real world applications!

The argument is that her undisclosed gender dysphoria violated the Olympic rules because she was a woman competing as a man. This is, of course, the precise opposite of the usual argument deployed against transgender people\u2026the one they would hit her with if she wanted to compete as a woman, the one that conflates sex and gender.\n\nThe object is to leave persons who disrupt the sex binary no place to go and simply deny the existence of gender.
