New York University Langone Medical Center has acquired Huntington Medical Group on New York’s Long Island region, according to the NYU Langone Health System.

Patients at the newly-named NYU Langone Huntington Medical Group will have enhanced access to services system-wide, including at NYU Langone’s Manhattan hospital campuses and expanding network of ambulatory facilities.

The June agreement paves the way for both NYU Langone and NYU Langone Huntington to adapt to the changing healthcare environment from hospital-based to local ambulatory care, according to the health system.

NYU Langone Huntington patients who come to NYU Langone for complex care will receive follow-up care at NYU Langone Huntington.

NYU Langone Huntington will also run Epic’s electronic health record system, which NYU Langone has set up.

In April, NYU Langone added Lutheran Medical Center, now NYU Lutheran, to its health system.
