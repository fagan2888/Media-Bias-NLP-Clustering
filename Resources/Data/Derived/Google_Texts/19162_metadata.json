FATwater/Facebook.com\n\nDave Asprey, otherwise known as the man who successfully convinced your friends to drink coffee mixed with butter, is back with his latest invention: FATWater.\n\nThe fat-infused is positioned as a better way to both hydrate your body and burn more fat. The formula, Asprey claimed, is better than real water. He told the NY Daily News his formula stems from his previous career in Silicon Valley, where he focused on disruptive technology.\n\n\"This is disruptive technology for beverages,\" he said. Whether this \u201cdisruptive technology\u201d actually leads to improved diet and health is still up for debate.\n\nAsprey extracts fat from a coconut oil he's patented; then, he adds tiny droplets of it to his water. He suggests the fatty oil is what hydrates cells, because he's found body cells are more likely to absorb H2O molecules when they come with trace amounts of fat particles. Asprey also found that fat-infused water gives consumers an extra energy boost.\n\n\u201cThe oils enhance thermogenesis, which is a fancy word for \u2018fat burning\u2019,\u201d Asprey said. \u201cThey get burned as energy and have an appetite-suppression effect. It\u2019s not like we put in sunflower oil or canola.\u201d\n\nHow much fat is actually in each bottle? It's equal to two squares of Chocolove, a type of dark chocolate.\n\nFATwater is currently only being sold in Asprey's Bulletproof Coffee Shop in Santa Monica, Calif., in addition to some Los Angeles-based natural food stores. He does hope, however, to soon sell his product nationwide.\n\nExperts, on the other hand, are highly skeptical of Asprey\u2019s new water revelation. Even though his claims may sound appealing, many nutritionists are saying his formula isn't based on real science. Dietitian and nutritionist Rochelle Sirota told NY Daily News that so far, she is not impressed.\n\n\u201cIt is just getting crazier and crazier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the need? Coconut water can be very hydrating because of the electrolytes, but I do not get this whole thing.\u201d\n\nTo Martin Riese, the country\u2019s only water sommelier (a fancy way to say tap water sampler), FATwater is \"near water,\" at best.\n\n\u201cWater should not have calories and this has 20,\u201d he pointed out. \"I believe water should come from nature and not a factory.\u201d\n\nBut despite this skepticism, and claims that he is going too far (just look at Whole Foods' failed asparagus water), Asprey stands by his product.\n\n\u201cBiohacking is taking control of the environment around you so you have control of your biology, so you are less stressed and recover better and are a nicer person,\u201d he explained. \u201cI am making it easier for people to make those changes and feel good all the time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bulletproof, coffee, creator, dave, asprey, back, fatwater, fat, infused, water, you, can, drink", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Oil and water apparently do mix in this new fat-burning product from Bulletproof executive Dave Asprey.", "title": "Bulletproof Coffee Creator Is Back With Fat-Infused Water", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bulletproof-coffee-creator-dave-asprey-back-fatwater-fat-infused-water-you-can-drink-347976", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/15/dave-aspreys-fatwater.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oil and water apparently do mix in this new fat-burning product from Bulletproof executive Dave Asprey.", "title": "Bulletproof Coffee Creator Is Back With Fat-Infused Water", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bulletproof-coffee-creator-dave-asprey-back-fatwater-fat-infused-water-you-can-drink-347976", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/15/dave-aspreys-fatwater.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/15/dave-aspreys-fatwater.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-08-15T13:11:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-15T13:11:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Oil and water apparently do mix in this new fat-burning product from Bulletproof executive Dave Asprey."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd906e\"", "article_summary": "Oil and water apparently do mix in this new fat-burning product from Bulletproof executive Dave Asprey.\nThe fat-infused is positioned as a better way to both hydrate your body and burn more fat.\nThe formula, Asprey claimed, is better than real water.\nAsprey extracts fat from a coconut oil he's patented; then, he adds tiny droplets of it to his water.\nFATwater/Facebook.comDave Asprey, otherwise known as the man who successfully convinced your friends to drink coffee mixed with butter, is back with his latest invention: FATWater."}
