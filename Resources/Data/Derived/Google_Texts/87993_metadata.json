The survey of 362 AARDA members \u2013 96 percent of whom reported living with an autoimmune disease \u2013 found that more than 80 percent of respondents did not know what biosimilar medicines were and about 52 percent did not understand how biologics differ from chemical drugs.\n\nIn order to increase awareness among its member community, AARDA\u2019s white paper offers insight into:\n\n\u2022 biologic medicines, which are made from complex molecules of living material rather than chemical compounds, and the significance of these therapies for patients with severe medical conditions,\n\n\u2022 how biologic medicines effectively treat patients with a number of autoimmune diseases,\n\n\u2022 why biosimilar drugs are not \u201cgeneric\u201d versions of biologics,\n\n\u2022 what are the safety concerns for patients when switching between biologic and biosimilar products,\n\n\u2022 what are the policy issues surrounding the approval of biosimilar medicines in the U.S.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) established a pathway for the FDA to approve biosimilar drugs in the U.S. for interchangeable use with brand name biologic medicines. As biologic therapies reach the end of their patent protection, the FDA is preparing to release standards for the approval of biosimilar drugs on the basis of analytical and clinical comparison to the already marketed biologic product.\n\nLadd continued, \u201cIt is our hope that biosimilars will increase patient access to these treatments by lowering the cost of this class of drugs. However, patient safety must come first. The white paper will help to ensure all patients living with complex medical conditions are able to understand this category of drugs, be aware of their treatment options and safety issues and work to ensure that the FDA enacts policies that protect patient safety.\u201d\n\nThe white paper is available as a free, PDF download on AARDA\u2019s web site: www.aarda.org.\n\nBiologics Biosimilars Booklet\n\n- # # # -\n\nAbout AARDA\n\nAmerican Autoimmune Related Diseases Association (AARDA) is the nation's only non-profit organization dedicated to bringing a national focus to autoimmunity as a category of disease and a major women's health issue, and promoting a collaborative research effort in order to find better treatments and a cure for all autoimmune diseases.
