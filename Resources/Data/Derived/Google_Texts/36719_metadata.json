The United States entered the war in 1941, by which time China had been resisting Japan for nearly four years. China\u2019s wartime losses were staggering: somewhere between 14 million and 20 million Chinese are believed to have died in the eight years of conflict.\n\nWho was to rule China after Japan\u2019s surrender? The ruling Nationalists were led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, but their writ did not run to many parts of the country. The Communists had controlled China\u2019s northern provinces for most of the war, and the alliance between the Communists and the Nationalists had been fragile.\n\nChina was a difficult wartime ally, demanding Allied aid while accomplishing relatively little against the Japanese invaders. By 1945, the Chiang government enjoyed little popular support. What was to be the role of the Communists, who espoused democratic principles and practiced an austere lifestyle much at variance with that of Chiang\u2019s minions?\n\nIn Chungking, the government\u2019s shortcomings were highly visible: There was corruption, starvation, censorship of the press and a uniform fear of Chiang\u2019s secret police. In the words of historian Barbara Tuchman, China\u2019s charm was counterbalanced by \u201cthe filth, the cruelty, the indifference to misery and disregard for human life.\u201d\n\nThe KMT sponsored marches, songs and meetings to raise morale, but there were signs of rot. Skinny, sweaty rickshaw men provided transportation for the rich, while nearly naked coolies towed barges up canals, \u201cleaning so far against their harnesses as to be almost horizontal to the ground.\u201d As Richard Bernstein\u2019s writes, \u201cThe lines of conscripts roped together and marched off without proper clothing, arms, training, and food, the inability of the government to put a stop to Japanese atrocities \u2014 all of these things wore down [Chiang\u2018s] standing.\u201d\n\nSix hundred miles north of Chungking was the headquarters of Communist forces led by the charismatic Mao Zedong. The Communists had benefited from the war with Japan, which had obliged Chiang to suspend anti-Communist operations and to accept the Communists as partners in an uneasy alliance. Now the Communists sought American neutrality while they took care of Chiang. In Mr. Bernstein\u2019s words, \u201cChiang broke a fundamental rule of civil conflict, which is never to allow an armed force that you do not control into your camp.\u201d\n\nFor visiting diplomats and journalists the Communists downplayed their ideology and connections with the Soviet Union. They wore plain, medal-free tunics to underscore their austere lifestyle. The Communists \u201cwere friendly, relaxed, and good-humored with their American guests, dining with them, talking late into the night, drinking what they called tiger bone wine.\u201d\n\nThe Communists were emboldened by support from the Soviets, who had occupied three of China\u2019s northeastern provinces. In Washington, the Truman administration was preoccupied with popular demands for U.S. troops to be brought home. China was a nuisance but one that could not be ignored.\n\nThe administration relied heavily on analysis from its embassy. America\u2019s ambassador at this crucial time was Patrick Hurley, an Oklahoma oil millionaire disposed to issuing Indian-like war whoops when excited. Ever an optimist, Hurley was an admirer of Chiang Kai-shek, and took seriously Washington\u2019s commitment to one China.\n\nTwo of the State Department\u2019s leading Sinologists were at odds with Hurley\u2019s rosy view. John Service and John Davies, both of whom had been brought up in China, made repeated visits to Mao\u2019s capital at Yenan. In Mr. Bernstein\u2019s view, they and other visitors were deceived by the hospitality they found there. Given Hurley\u2019s view, the atmosphere within the American mission was toxic. Davies and Service argued that the United States should reach out to the Communists. The Communists were going to win, and there was no point in alienating the winners.\n\nThe United States\u2019 close relations with Chiang\u2019s government remained a complicating factor. Not only did U.S. aid continue, spurred by a vigorous China lobby in Washington, but Chiang sought to entangle the United States in the civil war that was clearly in prospect.\n\nIn August 1945, Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered that Japanese troops in China were to surrender only to Nationalist forces. In response, the U.S. Army airlifted thousands of Chiang\u2019s soldiers to key northern cities where, unsurprisingly, there were clashes with Mao\u2019s forces. In December, Gen. George Marshall arrived in China to facilitate a compromise between the Nationalists and the Communists. For months, the two sides exchanged unacceptable demands.\n\nUltimately, war came, and over the next four years Chiang\u2019s troops were forced off the mainland. For the reader today, the events of 1945 are like a slow-motion train wreck: One knows the outcome, but can see no way to avoid it.\n\nThe Nationalists were not the only losers. Service was dismissed by the State Department in 1952. Davies was fired two years later on grounds that his reporting from China had reflected poor judgment.\n\nIn \u201cChina 1945,\u201d Mr. Bernstein has provided a lucid, attractively written account of one of the most fateful years in China\u2019s history. If you read only one book on this crucial period, Mr. Bernstein\u2019s work should be it.\n\n\u2022 Historian and biographer John M.
