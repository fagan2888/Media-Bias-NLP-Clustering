In a recent interview with The Washington Examiner, former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, who spent 16 years in Congress, said one of the reasons he left Washington is career politicians.

The Examiner’s Healthcare reporter, Paige Cunningham, sat down with Sen. Coburn and asked him questions covering his friendship with President Obama, to practicing medicine, and Medicare reform.

Coburn, an OB/GYN by trade, said that he recently filled in at a friend’s practice, but he would never go back into medicine:

“I would never go back and practice medicine the way it is today, never. I’d have to be a concierge doctor. There’s no way I’d play the game they’re having to play. It’s just so much work that doesn’t help a patient.”

He was also very critical of the Affordable Care Act, saying “it is the most screwed-up system in the world”:

“The Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable to the country as a whole, unless [people] have a subsidy. Healthcare doesn’t have to be screwed up the way it is. Healthcare was doing really well until the government got involved.”

Coburn didn’t pull any punches when commenting about career politicians, whom he said are more interested in elections than the “biggest issues,” which is why he says Washington won’t reform Medicare:

“It’s totally tied to people who are in Congress for a career. If they truly were patriots, they would have fixed Medicare already. Common sense would say, if you’re up here and this is the biggest problem, why don’t you fix the biggest problem? They’re more interested in elections than they are in fixing the health of the country. That’s the disgusting part of Washington, that’s part of the reason I left.”

After leaving Congress, Coburn joined the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research as part of their “Project FDA,” which aims to reform the Food and Drug Administration.

Coburn has no additional plans to re-enter the political arena, nor has he issued a 2016 presidential endorcement yet. His biggest worry is new, unfunded tax liability:

“We’re worried about who the president is going to be 20 months from now, but we’re not worried about the $6 trillion unfunded liability.” “Nobody’s talking truthfully to the country about the significance of our problems.”

Coburn says that what he enjoys most about no longer being in Congress is finally having his time to himself.
