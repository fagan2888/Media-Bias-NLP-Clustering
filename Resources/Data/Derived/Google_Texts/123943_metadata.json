THEY ELECTED MARTHA LANING STATE CHAIRWOMAN AT THEIR CONVENTION EARLIER THIS MONTH. LANING RAN AND LOST A RACE FOR THE SHEBOYGAN-AREA STATE SENATE SEAT LAST YEAR. SHE'S BECOME MORE ACTIVE IN PARTY POLITICS IN JUST THE PAST FEW YEARS. MARTHA LANING JOINS US NOW ON \"UPFRONT.\" GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. MARTHA: THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. MIKE: WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- HE RAN FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE -- WHAT WERE THE LESSONS LEARNED? MARTHA: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR VALUE, WE FIND A LOOK MORE COMMON GROUND THAN UNCOMMON GROUND. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE TO BRING TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WHEN WE PUT OUT OUR MESSAGE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WISCONSIN STANDS UP FOR. THAT WILL MAKE US MAKE BETTER CHOICES FOR OUR FUTURE. MIKE: DO YOU THINK IN THE PAST, THE PARTY HAD TOO MUCH POLITICAL BACK-AND-FORTH? MARTHA: I ABSOLUTELY THINK INSTEAD OF LESS ATTACKING PEOPLE, WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THE ISSUES. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC ISSUES, FAIRNESS, FOR EXAMPLE , GIVING A TAX BREAK TO MANUFACTURERS SO THEY ARE BACK TO PAYING LITTLE TO NO STATE INCOME TAX WHILE ALL OF THE OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE RETAIL OR CONSTRUCTION PAY 7%? THAT'S NOT FAIR AND THAT RESONATES WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE START TALKING ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. MIKE: DO YOU SEE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUDGET? MARTHA: ABSOLUTELY. THIS BUDGET IS A MESS. $2.2 BILLION DEFICIT. IT IS THAT WAY BECAUSE OF THE POOR CHOICES WE HAVE MADE. WE NEED TO BRING OUR PROGRESSIVE VALUES BACK. WE NEED TO INVEST IN EDUCATION BECAUSE EDUCATION ENSURES OUR BUSINESSES HAVE THE SKILLED WORKFORCE THEY NEED TO BUILD SUCCESS FOR THEM. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE STRONG FUNDING FOR OUR TECHNICAL SCHOOLS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THE TRAINING THEY NEED TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE. WE NEED TO TURN THINGS AROUND AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE BAD CHOICES THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WISCONSIN IS ON A BETTER TRACK. MIKE: WHAT KIND OF EXPECTATIONS DO YOU HAVE -- WE LOOK AT THE FALL OF 2016. WHAT KIND OF GAINS CAN YOU MAKE? MARTHA: WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SITUATION HERE IN THE STATE AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES -- THAT WAS GOVERNOR WALKER'S FLAGSHIP JOB AGENCY. WE JUST LEARNED THIS WEEK THAT THEY WERE ENCOURAGING COUNTIES TO GIVE OUT BONDING TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT WAS USING TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FOR A MASERATI. WHEN YOU ARE HEARING ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, IT MAKES YOU SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND OUR LEGISLATORS ARE NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE IN ENSURING THAT OUR AGENCIES ARE USING TAX DOLLARS IS POSSIBLY -- RESPONSIBLE. DEMOCRATS WILL BRING REAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE WANT TO HAVE FAIRNESS AND INTRODUCE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. WHEN WE HAVE THAT MESSAGE, IT WILL RESONATE WITH VOTERS. MIKE: YOU SPEAK OF RESONATING WITH VOTERS -- WHY HASN'T THE DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE RESONATED WITH VOTERS IN A LOT OF RECENT STATE ELECTIONS? MARTHA: PART OF IT IS THE SWING. WHEN THINGS ARE TOUGH AND WHOEVER IS IN OFFICE AT THE TIME, PEOPLE WANT TO BLAME SOMETHING. THAT IS CHANGING. DEMOCRATS NEED TO GET A MESSAGE OUT THAT RESONATES WITH THEIR VOTERS DURING OUR RETURN ELECTIONS. -- MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WE WILL TURN THINGS AROUND BY MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO VOTE IN THOSE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. YOUR LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS AFFECT YOUR LIFE MORE THAN FEDERAL ELECTIONS. WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THAT. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS UPCOMING ELECTION. RUSS IS ONE OF US. HE OBJECTS TO MONEY IN THE ELECTIONS COME OUTSIDE MONEY. HE PUT OUT A BADGER PLEDGE TO SENATOR JOHNSON TO SAY LET'S LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE THIS. WHATEVER MONEY WE CAN EARN BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE WILL USE ONLY THAT MONEY. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS NOT RESPONDED TO THAT. WE KNOW RUSS IS OUT THERE REPRESENTING US AND HE WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BE SURE THAT HE CONTINUES TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE. MIKE: DO YOU THINK HE WAS HURT BY THE REVELATIONS THAT HIS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPORTING CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR OFFICE, SOME OF THAT MONEY WAS BEING USED TO KEEP FORMER STAFFERS ON THE PAYROLL? MARTHA: I DON'T THINK HE WAS BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP -- BLOWN UP INCORRECTLY. THEY ENDORSED MY CAMPAIGN. I KNOW A LOT OF SUPPORT CAME MY WAY BECAUSE OF HIS ENDORSEMENT. THE WAY THAT MONEY CAME THROUGH WAS NOT ALWAYS THROUGH HIS ORGANIZATION. THAT IS A KEY -- I DON'T THINK THAT IS AN ISSUE. PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THAT BADGER PLEDGE TO SAY RUSS IS SAYING HE WILL USE MONEY DURING THIS CAMPAIGN THAT HE EARNS HIMSELF. WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT SENATOR JOHNSON SAYS ABOUT THAT. MIKE: GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM TODAY. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNIE SANDERS IS COMING TO WISCONSIN. THE VERMONT SENATOR, WHO IS THE DARLING OF PROGRESSIVES, WILL HOLD A RALLY WEDNESDAY EVENING AT THE ALLIANT ENERGY CENTER IN MADISON. REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WALKER CALLED ON REPUBLICANS TO REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS TO REPEAL AND REPLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AFTER LAST WEEK'S SUPREME COURT DECISION UPHOLDING THE ACA.
