The national average was 2.2 percent, up from 1.9 percent in 2013.\n\nThe BEA also revised the economic growth rates of the state in 2012 and 2013.\n\nFor 2012, GDP was revised downwards, from 1 percent to 0.3 percent. For 2013, Connecticut\u2019s economic growth was revised upward slightly, from 0.9 percent to 1 percent.\n\nThe federal government routinely updates economic data as more information becomes available or methodologies change. In this case, the BEA revised its GDP number for Connecticut \u2014 and every state in the nation \u2014 \u201cbecause previous information that was not available became available,\u201d said BEA spokeswoman Jeannine Aversa.\n\nNew information that drove the revisions included the Census Bureau's Economic Census of Manufacturing for 2012 and the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures for 2013.\n\nBEA economist Clifford Woodruff said these census reports were behind Connecticut\u2019s drop in GDP in 2012, as was a national downward revision of the broadcasting and telecommunications sector.\n\nPat Flaherty, an economist with the Connecticut Department of Labor, has a different view of the performance of the state\u2019s economy. He says it has grown year over year since it bottomed out during the recession and questions the BEA\u2019s 2012 revision. The year before, the agency had increased the state\u2019s GDP for that year in a revision.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to speculate the GDP for a state,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cAll estimates are subject to error.\u201d\n\nEven so, Flaherty said, \u201cThe state has no official position on the BEA GDP figures.\u201d\n\nConnecticut does not measure its GDP, leaving that task to the federal government.\n\nThe BEA report said the manufacturing of durable goods, an important part of Connecticut\u2019s $250 billion-plus economy, fell slightly from 2013 to 2014, from $19.4 billion in output to $18.7 billion. Total manufacturing in Connecticut in 2014 was $27 billion, down slightly from $27.8 billion in 2013.\n\nMuch of the state\u2019s sizable defense industry falls into that sector.\n\nYet Flaherty said he does not believe Connecticut\u2019s manufacturing industry is shrinking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the output in manufacturing has actually decreased,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, Flaherty believes the BEA reclassified some types of manufacturing activity, shifting it to a research and development category.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same activity happening, they\u2019re just putting it in a different class,\u201d Flaherty said.\n\nResearch and development activity is included by the BEA in \u201cProfessional, Scientific, and Technical Services\u201d a sector that has grown steadily in Connecticut.\n\nOther growing sectors in the state include financial services, insurance and health care services.\n\nFlaherty said an aging population in Connecticut has resulted in an increased demand for health care services, as has the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of health insurance coverage in the state.\n\nPeter Gioia, vice president and economist at the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, said he \u201cwas not shocked\u201d the BEA determined manufacturing in the state has slipped, faulting a strong U.S. dollar that hurt some exports and the sluggish Connecticut economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe have been lagging the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expects a turnaround in Connecticut\u2019s manufacturing sector this year, led by growth in aerospace and defense.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a change (in the GDP) in 2015,\u201d Gioia said, citing increased spending by the Pentagon on Connecticut-made weapons systems and a boost in commercial sales.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to predict what the Connecticut economy will do.\n\nFred Carstensen, director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut, sharply revised downward an optimistic projection of the state\u2019s economy based in part on the BEA\u2019s revised GDP data.\n\nHe said Connecticut is hampered by having to rely on federal economic data, which can lag one to three years behind, and \u201cno capacity to cross-check the federal data with state data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe core problem is that Connecticut, unlike many states, has absolutely nothing in place to track its own performance in real time. It is, as some say, a data desert,\u201d Carstensen said.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/08/some-bright-spots-in-cts-sluggish-economy/", "news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Politics, Washington, Bureau of Economic Analyisis, Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, Connecticut Department of Labor, Connecticut economy, Fred Carstensen, GDP, gross domestic product", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/08/some-bright-spots-in-cts-sluggish-economy/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There are bright spots in Connecticut's sluggish economy, even as Connecticut's key manufacturing sector has lagged, a recent federal report says.", "title": "Some bright spots in CT\u2019s sluggish economy", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/08/some-bright-spots-in-cts-sluggish-economy/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/07/Thumbnail.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/08/some-bright-spots-in-cts-sluggish-economy/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Washington \u2013 There are bright spots in Connecticut's sluggish economy, even as Connecticut's key manufacturing sector has lagged, a recent federal report says.\nBut it\u2019s hard to predict what the Connecticut economy will do.\nHe expects a turnaround in Connecticut\u2019s manufacturing sector this year, led by growth in aerospace and defense.\nThose bright spots include healthcare, finance and professional services like information technology, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis says.\nFor 2013, Connecticut\u2019s economic growth was revised upward slightly, from 0.9 percent to 1 percent."}
