I didn\u2019t even know I was going to do a 1620 in my run until three minutes before I dropped.\u201d\n\nOutside of a win last month in U.S. Snowboarding\u2019s fifth and final Olympic qualifier at Mammoth Mountain, Kotsenburg hasn\u2019t climbed to the top of a snowboarding podium since he was 11 years old.\n\nBut by Saturday, he was snowboarding royalty, sharing his sport\u2019s rootsy ways with plenty of \u201cstoked-s\u201d and \u201csick-s\u201d to the horde of media crowding him in the finish corral of Russia\u2019s burly Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.\n\nHe celebrated alongside silver medalist Staale Sandbech of Norway and Canadian Mark McMorris.\n\n\u201cI grew up with Mark and Staale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not enemies at all. It\u2019s sick to be able to podium with them and everyone is stoked for each other.\u201d\n\nSandbech and McMorris had risen to Saturday\u2019s finals on a wave of technical precision that has recently dominated slopestyle snowboarding. The pair\u2019s heralded triple corks \u2014 three backflips thrown while spinning 90 feet down a monster jump \u2014 were championed as snowboarding\u2019s future.\n\nThe Olympic judges on Saturday knocked the triple-cork down a notch. After the first run of the 12 finalists from seven countries, judges had made it obvious that mad spinning was not going to win the contest. Kotsenburg, the only American in the finals, threw only one double-cork, but his 1620 with solid grabs and the \u201cHoly Crail\u201d grab he invented two weeks earlier at Aspen\u2019s X Games earned him the top score of the first-of-two runs. (The two-handed trick sees him grabbing behind his back and pulling the board while the other hand grabs the nose of his snowboard while he spins three to four rotations.)\n\nAfter seeing judges score triples low, some athletes dialed back their triples to doubles.\n\n\u201cI would have done triple on the first jump but I thought the judges wouldn\u2019t like it and would mark that score low. That\u2019s why I just did the double cork. I think the triple cork is way harder, but I was just going on what the judges were scoring today,\u201d said Canadian Max Parrot, a triple-corking master who won both the X Games big air and slopestyle contest last month with this solid triple backflips.\n\nParrot was mildly critical of the scoring, saying judges on the World Snowboard Tour often share their expectations with riders, who can then tailor runs to their preferences.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything from these judges. I don\u2019t even know the name of the judges,\u201d said Parrot, who finished fourth after hitting a triple-cork 1620 \u2014 what\u2019s essentially the same trick as Kotsenburg\u2019s, but with three backflips.\n\nMcMorris, who entered the Olympics as a medal favorite even with a broken rib suffered two weeks ago at the X Games, said he felt confident about his second run in finals, believing it would either pass Kotsenburg\u2019s 93.5 points or come in a close second. It was 88.75.\n\nMcMorris seemed relieved to shed the Olympic pressure.\n\n\u201cThat was the run,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hitting triples and then they all switched it to \u2026 double instead of triples. A lot of people were talking about my score being low, but that is the least of my worries. I just wanted to go big and land clean and do technical tricks. And you gotta be happy with the way you ride \u2026 it\u2019s up to the judges and you can\u2019t do anything about them.\u201d\n\nKotsenburg said he doesn\u2019t adjust his riding to suit judges.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m not going to let a score judge how I snowboard,\u201d he said after qualifying second in the final round of qualifying to make the finals.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it should be, U.S. Snowboarding and U.S. Freeskiing\u2019s head coach Mike Jankowski said. Those double grabs are technical. And Kotsenburg was the most creative, solid rider of the day, he said, describing his rider as an artist whose colorful flourishes can separate him from a pack of spinning acrobats.\n\n\u201cHe wants to put his stamp on the run,\u201d Jankowski said. \u201cThe course is the canvas. Your board is the paintbrush. He is the spice master. He\u2019s about putting his punctuation on every part of that course from the start to the finish.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor Sage it\u2019s about the process. And not the outcome. We are out there to have fun and he\u2019s going to do it his way. He\u2019s going to make it look good. He\u2019s going to make it fun and that\u2019s what he did today. And whether the judges like it or not, its not going to change the way he rides.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: jlbevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sage Kotsenburg of Park City wins first Olympic slopestyle gold medal at Sochi Olympics", "title": "Sage Kotsenburg of Park City wins first Olympic slopestyle gold medal at Sochi Olympics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/sage-kotsenburg-of-park-city-wins-first-olympic-slopestyle-gold-medal-at-sochi-olympics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_072936_Sage-Kotsenburg-slopestyle-gold-medal.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_072936_Sage-Kotsenburg-slopestyle-gold-medal.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T07:40:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:18:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc641\"", "article_summary": "After seeing judges score triples low, some athletes dialed back their triples to doubles.\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2014 Slopestyle snowboarding\u2019s Olympic debut saw an emphasis on style over technical trickery as Park City\u2019s Sage Kotsenburg took home the discipline\u2019s first-ever gold and the first medal of the Sochi Winter Olympics.\nAnd whether the judges like it or not, its not going to change the way he rides.\u201dJason Blevins: jlbevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins\nThe pair\u2019s heralded triple corks \u2014 three backflips thrown while spinning 90 feet down a monster jump \u2014 were championed as snowboarding\u2019s future.\n\u201cI would have done triple on the first jump but I thought the judges wouldn\u2019t like it and would mark that score low."}
