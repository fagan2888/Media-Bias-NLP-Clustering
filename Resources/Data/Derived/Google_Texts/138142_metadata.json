Mark Begich, a Democrat from red-state Alaska who faces a challenging bid for second term in the Senate, told CNN last week that \"I'm not really interested in campaigning\" with Obama if the President came to Alaska, he said.\n\nIt was a similar story from Sen. Mark Udall. The Colorado Democrat is also up for re-election, but his seat isn't considered that vulnerable as of now.\n\nIn an interview with CNN last week, Udall refused to say whether he'd like some help on the campaign trail if the President comes to Colorado, a purple state that Obama won in both the 2008 and 2012.\n\n\"We'll see what the President's schedule is, what my schedule is. But Coloradans are going to re-elect me based on my record, not the President's record,\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana both have made news in the recent months by not appearing with Obama when he's held an event in their state. Both face challenging re-election campaigns in GOP friendly states.\n\nRepublicans are highlighting such instances as proof that Obama is toxic for vulnerable Democrats in red or purple states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama has told Senate Democrats that he's willing to stay away from election battles where his presence would not be helpful, a Democratic source said -- an apparent nod to his poll numbers.", "pubdate": "2014-02-06T14:53:21Z", "author": "By Jim Acosta and Dana Bash, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "President Barack Obama has told Senate Democrats that he's willing to stay away from election battles where his presence would not be helpful, a Democratic source said -- an apparent nod to his poll numbers.", "pubdate": "2014-02-06T14:53:21Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/06/politics/obama-democrat-senators/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140129003503-exp-lead-intv-senator-begich-red-democrats-obama-state-of-the-union-00043723-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140129003503-exp-lead-intv-senator-begich-red-democrats-obama-state-of-the-union-00043723-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/06/politics/obama-democrat-senators/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Obama offers to stay away from some Senate races, source says - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2014-02-06T16:58:02Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Obama's comments came when he and former President Bill Clinton attended the Senate Democrats' issues conference at Nationals Park on Wednesday.\nRepublicans are highlighting such instances as proof that Obama is toxic for vulnerable Democrats in red or purple states.\nSources at the meeting said Obama assured Democrats that maintaining control of the Senate is his top priority this year.\nThe meeting served as a question-and-answer opportunity between Senate Democrats and the President.\nReplay More Videos ...
