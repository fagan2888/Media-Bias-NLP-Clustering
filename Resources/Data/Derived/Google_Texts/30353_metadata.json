Steve King \u201cdid vote to raise his own pay by $20,000 a year and take perks like free health care for life.\u201d That\u2019s a double whopper.\n\nThere was no vote to raise congressional pay by \u201c$20,000 a year,\u201d as the ad\u2019s narrator says. That\u2019s about how much salaries for members of Congress have automatically increased since King, a Republican, was first elected in 2002.\n\nThere also was no vote to \u201ctake perks like free health care for life.\u201d King voted for a House budget proposal that called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. If the health care law were repealed, members of Congress would once again obtain their health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, but it wouldn\u2019t be at no cost to them.\n\nMowrer is challenging King for his 4th District House seat. King has threatened to pull out of an Oct. 23 debate if the Mowrer campaign doesn\u2019t pull the ad, which was still running as of Oct. 8, according to Kantar Media Intelligence\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nPay Raises\n\nThe ad\u2019s narrator knocks King for not supporting a minimum wage increase, and says, \u201che did vote to raise his own pay by $20,000 a year.\u201d That\u2019s false \u2014 there was no such vote.\n\nSince 1989, pay for Congress has automatically increased each year unless members pass legislation blocking the salary hike. The amount of the increase is determined by a formula based on private sector wages.\n\nThe ad cites King\u2019s vote against H.Res. 184 in February 2009. It was a vote on a rule allowing for consideration of H.R. 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, without amendments. King voted against both the resolution, which passed on a 398-to-4 vote, and the appropriations bill, which passed on a vote of 245 to 178.\n\nThe $410 billion spending bill did include a provision \u2014 added by H.Res. 184 \u2014 rejecting the pay raise scheduled to take effect in January 2010. But the amount of the increase wasn\u2019t $20,000. Instead, it was to be a much smaller bump of $2,610. King\u2019s campaign says his was \u201ca vote against a broken House procedure barring all amendments on a huge spending bill,\u201d and not a vote for a raise.\n\nWe thought the \u201c$20,000 a year\u201d claim might have been a mistake, so we reached out to the Mowrer campaign for an explanation. We were told by a spokesman that the figure refers to how much salaries for members of Congress have increased since 2003, which was King\u2019s first year in Congress. That year, most members of Congress made $154,700. From there, Congress received a salary adjustment in six of the seven years from 2003 through 2009, when the salary for most members of Congress was raised to $174,000. So, now King is making nearly $20,000 more a year than he was in 2003.\n\nSince 2009, Congress has consistently voted to block its annual pay raises. As a result, members\u2019 salaries have not kept up with inflation. When adjusted for inflation, King\u2019s 2003 salary would have the buying power of $199,977 in 2014. That\u2019s almost $26,000 more than he currently makes.\n\nNow, each year from 2003 to 2007, King did vote in favor of House resolutions with rules \u2014 similar to those he now decries \u2014 that had the effect of blocking any amendments to appropriations bills, including ones that could have potentially kept the increases from taking place. That\u2019s according to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report on votes affecting congressional salaries. But it\u2019s impossible to know whether amendments to prevent the increases would have passed had they been allowed.\n\nNo Free Health Care\n\n\n\nThe ad\u2019s narrator also says that King voted to \u201ctake perks like free health care for life.\u201d There was no vote on that, either.\n\nThe ad cites King\u2019s vote in favor of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2013. That proposal called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, among other things. If that happened, members of Congress would no longer be required to purchase their insurance coverage through the exchanges created by the health care law. Instead, they would be able to return to receiving their insurance coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. That still wouldn\u2019t mean \u201cfree health care for life\u201d for federal lawmakers.\n\nPrior to the Affordable Care Act, the federal government, on average, paid 72 percent of health insurance premiums for its employees, including members of Congress. But that\u2019s still not the entire premium.\n\nBased on a final rule issued by the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, members of Congress are eligible to return to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program upon retirement, according to a Congressional Research Service report on their health benefits. But even as federal retirees, they would still be responsible for paying the same premiums as active federal employees. So, again, there would be no \u201cfree health care for life.\u201d\n\n\u2014 D\u2019Angelo Gore", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A TV ad from Democrat Jim Mowrer claims Iowa Rep.
