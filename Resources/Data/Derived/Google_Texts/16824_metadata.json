Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said there is strong evidence that the IRS violated the constitutional rights of the groups when it delayed their nonprofit status applications and asked inappropriate questions about their political beliefs.\n\nThe agency\u2019s insistence that it has retrained employees and instructed managers to behave better did not mollify the judges, who said past IRS behavior doesn\u2019t lend itself to the benefit of the doubt.\n\nPHOTOS: Best states for concealed carry \u2014 ranked worst to first\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find the IRS to be an agency we can trust,\u201d Judge Sentelle said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, a group of conservative House Republicans called for IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to be impeached. They delivered a series of speeches on the chamber floor saying the man brought in to clean up the agency has failed.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, didn\u2019t go as far as calling for impeachment, but he did say \u201cthe IRS is not being led well.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nThe agency\u2019s myriad problems include ignoring many taxpayers\u2019 calls and succumbing last year to a massive computer hack in which hundreds of thousands of taxpayers\u2019 most sensitive information was stolen from IRS computers.\n\nThe agency continues to grapple with fallout from the tea party targeting. An inspector general said hundreds of groups\u2019 applications for nonprofit status derailed while the IRS put them through intense scrutiny.\n\nSome groups dropped out rather than face the inquiry, while others battled. At least two groups have been awaiting a decision for more than five years.\n\nIRS officials acknowledged they erred but said the problem was bad training and confusion about a 2010 Supreme Court decision, not an intent to target groups for political purposes. The agency says it tried to follow all nine of the inspector general\u2019s regulations for cleaning up its act.\n\n\u201cIRS responded enthusiastically,\u201d said Judith A. Hagley, the Justice Department lawyer representing the IRS.\n\nThe judges Thursday were not convinced.\n\n\u201cHow much has really changed?\u201d said Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg.\n\nA lower-court judge sided with the IRS, saying that since most groups were approved, the targeting has stopped. That judge tossed the cases, saying they were now moot.\n\nBut the tea party groups pointed to a report last year by the Government Accountability Office that said conservative nonprofit groups were still more likely to face follow-up audits from the IRS, evidence that political targeting was continuing.\n\nMs. Hagley acknowledged \u201cpotential problems\u201d but said those were later in the process \u2014 not in the initial stage that the tea party groups were challenging.\n\nThe IRS is also holding on to answers to the intrusive questions it asked of tea party groups and said it is required by law to make that information available to the public.\n\nMs. Hagley said the groups were specifically warned. If they didn\u2019t want the information released, she said, they should have refused to answer the questions and sued if the agency didn\u2019t approve them.\n\nBut John Eastman, an attorney for True the Vote, one of the groups challenging the IRS in court, said the tax agency suggested that not answering the questions would lead to dismissing the application without a ruling one way or another. No ruling means no chance to sue, Mr. Eastman said.\n\nHe asked the appeals court judges to order the IRS to expunge all of the answers it coerced from the tea party groups. He also said the IRS should take the groups off the special audit list and that the rest of the case should be sent back to a lower court so more facts could be gathered.\n\nThe tea party groups are also trying to pursue a case against former IRS executive Lois G. Lerner and other staffers involved with processing the applications, accusing them of violating the groups\u2019 constitutional rights.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge said the IRS isn't to be trusted as he and his colleagues tried Thursday to figure out whether the tax agency is still targeting tea party groups for intrusive and illegal scrutiny.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal judge said the IRS isn\u2019t to be trusted as he and his colleagues tried Thursday to figure out whether the tax agency is still targeting tea party groups for intrusive and illegal scrutiny.", "title": "Federal judge calls IRS untrustworthy in tea party case", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/14/federal-judge-irs-untrustworthy-tea-party-case/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/06/19/irs_14303.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/06/19/irs_14303.jpg", "description": "A federal judge said the IRS isn't to be trusted as he and his colleagues tried Thursday to figure out whether the tax agency is still targeting tea party groups for intrusive and illegal scrutiny.", "card": "summary", "title": "Federal judge calls IRS untrustworthy in tea party case"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Internal Revenue Service"}, "article_summary": "Ms. Hagley acknowledged \u201cpotential problems\u201d but said those were later in the process \u2014 not in the initial stage that the tea party groups were challenging.\nHe asked the appeals court judges to order the IRS to expunge all of the answers it coerced from the tea party groups.\nThe agency continues to grapple with fallout from the tea party targeting.\nThe tea party groups are also trying to pursue a case against former IRS executive Lois G.
