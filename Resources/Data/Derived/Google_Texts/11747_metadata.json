And what was making him happy at that point was the assurance his playing time would increase.\n\nBut there\u2019s more.\n\nFaried had some admitting to do. He had not played the way anyone had expected this season, and in a meeting with Shaw last week he got down to the gritty truth as to why.\n\n\u201cI knew I was kind of just slighting myself and just not focused on the main goals that I wanted to achieve,\u201d Faried said. \u201cIt was just all on me.\u201d\n\nBut wait. There\u2019s more.\n\n\u201cI just had to bring myself back in and gain my confidence back, pretty much,\u201d he said.\n\nThose were bombshells.\n\nBut, truthfully, Shaw already knew them on some level in his mind. Faried just spelled it out for him, right there, in direct fashion, in order to exorcise some demons and get back to what should be the always-fun business of being the \u201cManimal.\u201d\n\nBut it underscored another truth about the relationship between Shaw and Faried. It\u2019s much less complicated than it seems. There are times they talk. There are times they don\u2019t talk. There are times when they\u2019re content with each other, and there are times when they\u2019re on each other\u2019s nerves.\n\nBut they\u2019ve never strayed from one thing: the truth.\n\nStraight shooters under the same roof aren\u2019t always going to see eye to eye. And when these two don\u2019t, they\u2019re not going to be shy about expressing what\u2019s on their minds.\n\nThey have struggled at times to learn what makes the other tick, but they have never stopped trying. And the honesty component \u2014 a cornerstone of any healthy relationship \u2014 has been the biggest and best bond between them.\n\nSo, this week, Shaw called Faried into his office to understand Faried more. Faried pulled no punches in the meeting with Shaw. Shaw pulled no punches in expressing what he needs to see from him to get him the minutes he desires.\n\nThey both left feeling better. And, yes, a bit closer.\n\nAnd Faried averaged 30 minutes in the next two games.\n\n\u201cIt feels great to get my minutes and be out there with my teammates and bring that energy and get them going and focused,\u201d Faried said. \u201cIt feels good to be back out there, period.\u201d\n\nThis relationship has been mischaracterized again and again as being adversarial. If anything, it has elements similar to a father and a son, just figuring things out as they move through life.\n\nFaried and Shaw never hated each other. Faried hated not playing as much as he wanted; Shaw hated some of the bad habits Faried displayed on the court. And at the end of the day they\u2019ve always had one thing in common \u2014 the desire to perform well and win games.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Kenneth Faried, Brian Shaw understanding each other more", "title": "Dempsey: Kenneth Faried, Brian Shaw understanding each other more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/dempsey-kenneth-faried-brian-shaw-understanding-each-other-more/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_095810_kenneth-faried.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_095810_kenneth-faried.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T18:24:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:17:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Faried hated not playing as much as he wanted; Shaw hated some of the bad habits Faried displayed on the court.\nSo, this week, Shaw called Faried into his office to understand Faried more.\nThe latest chapter in the relationship between Nuggets coach Brian Shaw and his growing star, Kenneth Faried, featured a smile and a Santa Claus hat in Nuggets yellow.\nThere are times when they\u2019re content with each other, and there are times when they\u2019re on each other\u2019s nerves.\nFaried and Shaw never hated each other."}
