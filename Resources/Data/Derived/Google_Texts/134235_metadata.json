I am saying we are too important to fail,\u201d Health and Hospitals president Ram Raju told the City Council.\n\nHe said Obamacare, despite \u201call its positive impact,\u201d has dealt a financial blow to the already cash-strapped system, which runs 11 hospitals.\n\nCuts to federal aid for hospitals that care for uninsured patients could cost $300 million next year, and grow to $460 million a year after that. Health and Hospitals is also losing Medicaid funds. It faces a $1.2 billion budget gap next fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe cannot simply cut our way out of this dilemma,\u201d Raju said.\n\nIn addition to lobbying the feds and state to change course, HHC\u2019s turnaround plan depends on attracting more paying patients and signing more people up for its health insurance plan, MetroPlus.\n\nBut Raju acknowledged the changes are \"not yet sufficient to assure our long term financial sustainability.\"\n\nCouncilman Corey Johnson, chair of the health committee, said he likes the ideas but doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll be enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me ... to have confidence our public hospital system is going to be able to continue to exist in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see how we are going to be able to dig our way out of this hole. ... I must tell you I don\u2019t feel optimistic, and I\u2019m a pretty optimistic guy, but the challenges just seem so steep. They seem so overwhelming.\u201d\n\nHealth and Hospitals also recently took over health care at Rikers Island, the violence-plagued jail where the previous health provider, Corizon, had been widely criticized.\n\nJohnson pressed Raju on whether he considered the practice of solitary confinement there to be \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d It\u2019s being ended for young inmates, but is still used for adults.\n\n\u201cI probably think it is,\u201d Raju said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ERIN DURKIN", "twitter": {"description": "The city\u2019s public hospital system faces \u201cunprecedented threats to our survival,\u201d its president said Monday.", "title": "NYC hospitals plea for help as they struggle to survive", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nyc-hospitals-plea-struggle-survive-article-1.2572529", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2572528.1458602146!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health22n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "new york city council, corey johnson,", "parsely-author": "Erin Durkin", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "new york city council, corey johnson,", "nydn_tags": "obamacare, new york city council, corey johnson", "news_keywords": "new york city council, corey johnson,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nyc-hospitals-plea-struggle-survive-article-1.2572529", "parsely-title": "NYC hospitals plea for help as they struggle to survive", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-21T19:22:53-0400", "sailthru.title": "NYC hospitals plea for help as they struggle to survive", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-21T23:22:53", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2572528.1458602146!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health22n-1-web.jpg", "description": "The city\u2019s public hospital system faces \u201cunprecedented threats to our survival,\u201d its president said Monday.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The city\u2019s public hospital system faces \u201cunprecedented threats to our survival,\u201d its president said Monday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The city\u2019s public hospital system faces \u201cunprecedented threats to our survival,\u201d its president said Monday.", "title": "NYC hospitals plea for help as they struggle to survive", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nyc-hospitals-plea-struggle-survive-article-1.2572529", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2572528.1458602146!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health22n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare, new york city council, corey johnson", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2572528.1458602146!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health22n-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "ERIN DURKIN", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS CITY HALL BUREAU"}, "article_summary": "I am saying we are too important to fail,\u201d Health and Hospitals president Ram Raju told the City Council.\nHe said Obamacare, despite \u201call its positive impact,\u201d has dealt a financial blow to the already cash-strapped system, which runs 11 hospitals.\nThe city\u2019s public hospital system faces \u201cunprecedented threats to our survival,\u201d its president said Monday.\nHealth and Hospitals is also losing Medicaid funds.\nCuts to federal aid for hospitals that care for uninsured patients could cost $300 million next year, and grow to $460 million a year after that."}
