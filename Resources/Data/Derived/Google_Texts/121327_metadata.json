He mocked \u201cgentle Donald\u201d for being \u201cfrightened\u201d by debate moderators and offered up details for a one-on-one debate. He pushed the term \u201cTrumpcare.\u201d\n\nScrambling to regain his footing in Iowa after falling behind Trump in another poll, a fiery Cruz unloaded on his closest rival in the state on Wednesday night, packing as many contrasts as he could muster into a 40-minute speech.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to what I say, don\u2019t listen to what Donald says \u2014 really, don\u2019t listen to what Donald says, don\u2019t listen to what any of the candidates say,\u201d Cruz said here at a rally full of social conservatives. He continued, \u201cShow me your record. Show me when you\u2019ve walked the walk.\u201d\n\nCruz proceeded to contrast his record with Trump\u2019s on issue after issue, from health care to abortion to same-sex marriage to the Wall Street bank bailouts, a ratcheting-up of his standard stump speech that reflects his need to retake the momentum from Trump less than a week before the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s position on health care is that he supports Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine for everyone,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think Obamacare goes far enough, he wants to expand it.\u201d\n\nHe went on to add, using a term recently used by a supportive Cruz super PAC, \u201c\u2018Trumpcare\u2019 is socialized medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald is entitled to have that view \u2014 you might even call that view a New York value,\u201d he said, using one of his favorite critiques of Trump. \u201cAs Donald might observe, both he and Bernie Sanders are native New Yorkers. But if you care about Obamacare, there\u2019s a clear difference in opinion.\u201d\n\nHe took the same approach \u2014 casting Trump\u2019s positions as liberal, and then contrasting with his views \u2014 on a wide range of policy debates.\n\nCruz was aided in his efforts to draw contrasts by a number of socially conservative heavyweights, including prominent activists Tony Perkins and Bob Vander Plaats, as well as Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Steve King of Iowa, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, most of whom took, at a minimum, oblique shots at Trump. But Vander Plaats was particularly explicit as he made the case that in Iowa a vote for anyone other than Cruz is a vote for Trump. It\u2019s a message Cruz and his allies have been pushing hard in the final weeks before the caucuses as Trump has continued to lead.\n\n\u201cHe made a run at president, going up in the polls, [by] taking on the establishment. Now he says the establishment is warming up to him because it\u2019s all about the \u2018art of the deal,\u2019\u201d Vander Plaats said, referencing Trump\u2019s best-known book. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, the sanctity of human life is not up for the art of the deal. God\u2019s design for marriage, family, is not up for the art of the deal. Religious liberty is not up for the art of the deal. \u2026 Our relationship with the nation of Israel is not up for the art of the deal.\u201d\n\nThe crowd, which ate up the Trump criticism, cheered.\n\nCruz also doubled down on his invitation to have a one-on-one debate with Trump, who is declining to participate in Fox News\u2019 Thursday night contest, saying that he has booked a venue for Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to propose a venue: Western Iowa Tech in Sioux City. We already have it reserved. Eight p.m. Saturday night, a two-hour, one-on-one debate,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNow, if gentle Donald cannot handle [Fox News moderator] Megyn Kelly, how about for a moderator instead, Mark Levin?\u201d\n\nThe crowd applauded at the reference to the conservative radio host.\n\n\u201cOr if he doesn\u2019t like Mark Levin, how about Sean Hannity? And if he doesn\u2019t like Sean Hannity, how about Rush Limbaugh? And if gentle Donald is frightened by Mark and Sean and Rush, then we\u2019ll have no moderator whatsoever,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s do it!\u201d shouted someone in the crowd.\n\nCruz offered to let Trump invite half the audience, and said he would invite the other.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the moderators that \u201cDonald is afraid of,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Keep the Promise, a cluster of super PACs backing Cruz, announced that if Trump accepted Cruz\u2019s debate challenge, the groups would donate $1.5 million to veterans\u2019 groups.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He also ups the ante in his efforts to get Trump to debate him.", "title": "Painting him as a liberal, Cruz assails Trump over abortion, 'Trumpcare'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/painting-him-as-a-liberal-cruz-assails-trump-over-abortion-trumpcare-218313", "image": "http://static.politico.com/59/71/3ae94df34b89a6baacac3f80cd77/gettyimages-456137964.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He also ups the ante in his efforts to get Trump to debate him.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bf2\"", "article_summary": "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of embracing \u201csocialized medicine\u201d and accepting partial-birth abortion.\n| Getty Painting him as a liberal, Cruz assails Trump over abortion, 'Trumpcare' He also ups the ante in his efforts to get Trump to debate him.\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s position on health care is that he supports Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine for everyone,\u201d Ted Cruz said.\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s position on health care is that he supports Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine for everyone,\u201d Cruz said.\nEight p.m. Saturday night, a two-hour, one-on-one debate,\u201d Cruz said."}
