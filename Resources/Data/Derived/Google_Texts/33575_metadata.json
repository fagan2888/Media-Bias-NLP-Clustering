Still, panicked, knee-jerk selling is one of the biggest mistakes that retail investors can make.\n\nRelated: The Silver Lining Behind Black Monday\u2019s Stock Market Plunge\n\nToday\u2019s morning selloff may have been bigger than any one-day point loss for the Dow, but it\u2019s still doesn\u2019t approach the magnitude of stock market crashes. And market \u201ccorrections,\u201d or drops of 10 percent or more like the one we\u2019re now seeing, are typical even during long-term bull markets. Since 1946, the S&P 500 has experienced a correction, on average, every 18 months, but it had been more than 47 months since stocks pulled back by more than 10 percent.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been lulled into thinking that stocks will always go up and the ride will be relatively smooth, consider this a useful reminder.\n\n\u201cVolatility is a way of life when you\u2019re investing in stocks,\u201d says Wasif Latif, head of global multi-assets at USAA investments. \u201cJust because it hasn\u2019t been there the last two or three years doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone away. Now we\u2019re remembering what it feels like to be invested in stocks.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Stocks Tank, Trump Warns China Could \u2018Bring Us Down\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s also worth putting today\u2019s selloff in context. The market is still only at a 10-month low, meaning investments are still worth more than they were as recently as a year ago \u2014 and you\u2019re likely way ahead if you\u2019ve been in the market for longer than that. Including its recent losses, the S&P 500 is still up more than 75 percent over the last five years, and it\u2019s nearly tripled from its lows in early 2009.\n\nEven if this market turn is the start of something bigger than just a correction, one of the biggest risks of dumping your investments now is not knowing when to get back in. \u201cMarkets often bounce back as quickly as they drop,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in it to win it, and there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re going to get back in before the market zooms higher.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lesson that many retail investors learned the hard way when they pulled money out of stocks back in 2009.\n\nRelated: Millennials Still Don\u2019t Trust the Stock Market\n\n\u201cIn times like this, it\u2019s important to remember your investments are designed to carry you through decades, not days,\u201d Lane Jones, chief investment officer with Evensky &Katz wrote in a note to clients today. \u201cIt\u2019s important to stay focused on the long-term.\u201d\n\nOnce the markets calm down, you may want to revisit your asset allocation strategy to make sure that it fits your time horizon and risk tolerance. Then, no matter how gut wrenching it may be in the short term, keep calm.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Here\u2019s the best thing you can do if you\u2019re worried that today\u2019s tanking stock market i", "title": "Why You Should Ignore the Stock Market Sell-Off", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/24/Why-You-Should-Ignore-Today-s-Stock-Market-Sell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/24/Why-You-Should-Ignore-Today-s-Stock-Market-Sell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Ticker.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Here\u2019s the best thing you can do if you\u2019re worried that today\u2019s tanking stock market i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda604\"", "article_summary": "Related: The Silver Lining Behind Black Monday\u2019s Stock Market PlungeToday\u2019s morning selloff may have been bigger than any one-day point loss for the Dow, but it\u2019s still doesn\u2019t approach the magnitude of stock market crashes.\nHere\u2019s the best thing you can do if you\u2019re worried that today\u2019s tanking stock market is killing your returns: Nothing.\nAnd market \u201ccorrections,\u201d or drops of 10 percent or more like the one we\u2019re now seeing, are typical even during long-term bull markets.\n\u201cVolatility is a way of life when you\u2019re investing in stocks,\u201d says Wasif Latif, head of global multi-assets at USAA investments.\nThe market is still only at a 10-month low, meaning investments are still worth more than they were as recently as a year ago \u2014 and you\u2019re likely way ahead if you\u2019ve been in the market for longer than that."}
