That\u2019s an odd sentiment when you consider that the company\u2019s revenues in 2014 were $27.4 billion and its stock price makes it worth something like $92 billion. It\u2019s among the world\u2019s most valuable brands and has three times the United States market share of Subway, its nearest competitor.\n\nEnviable. Yet for years its new products, business ventures, even social media attempts have gone wrong: It sold a 90 percent share in Chipotle, now one of its strongest competitors; it introduced products like chicken wings, which went nowhere; it created a Twitter hashtag, #McDStories, that turned into a bashing event. And it has spectacularly failed to attract or even hold on to millennial customers, who\u2019ve fled in droves.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s the most visible target of an alliance of workers fighting for $15 an hour (most McDonald\u2019s workers make slightly more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25, but it varies by state), and its food is seen as anything but sustainable, fresh or healthy. A result has been a decline that includes a whopping 15 percent drop in its United States operating income in the last quarter of 2014.\n\nThe company is losing customers to higher-end burger chains like Shake Shack and Five Guys, to small but intriguing start-ups that make locally sourced, slow food appealing, like Dig Inn, to Chick-fil-A (around $5 billion in sales in 2013) and, of course, to Chipotle, which has sales in the $4 billion range.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s can\u2019t get a break. In the last two months, the company has made several well-publicized big announcements that were widely greeted with yawns or jeers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first was a decision to phase out chickens raised using antibiotics meant to treat humans. The second was to unilaterally raise the salaries of those minimum-wage workers the company directly employs by at least a dollar an hour, granting a small amount of paid vacation time to company employees and financial assistance for education to all workers in its system. And the third was to begin referring to itself as a \u201cmodern, progressive burger company.\u201d\n\nIs it too little, too late? Recall Polaroid trying to manage digital photography or BlackBerry struggling to recover after being devastated by the iPhone. Once again, an entrenched company has sat back while nimbler, more with-it others ate its lunch. Many of the new fast-food chains are paying workers better, sourcing sustainable ingredients, creating different forms of fast food and even making better burgers. Now McDonald\u2019s is trying to play catch-up.\n\nBut it\u2019s using half measures, and that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s not like the competition is going to go away, and the brand may be permanently tarnished. Fixing that isn\u2019t going to be easy, and it\u2019s not even clear whether it\u2019s possible.\n\nWhat McDonald\u2019s should do is go all in and really transform itself, because the effect of positive change would be immeasurable. Instead it tries to play it both ways, controlling what franchisees buy and sell but insisting that it cannot dictate how they treat employees. Thus the wage increase touches only around 11 percent of the chain\u2019s workers, and workers immediately decried it as inadequate. (Even Walmart did better.) No one turns down a raise, but this one virtually guarantees that most of the company\u2019s workers will remain eligible for food stamps, thus perpetuating the public subsidy for McDonald\u2019s labor force.\n\nThat the nonantibiotic move has taken this long (Chipotle has tried to be antibiotic-free for more than a decade, as has Panera) and is so incomplete \u2014 that is, there\u2019s no word about pork or beef, and the move is being phased in \u2014 also seems pathetic. (Even more pathetic is the refusal of the Food and Drug Administration to mandate the removal of nonmedicinal antibiotics from animal production, but that\u2019s another story.)\n\nThese moves demonstrate that McDonald\u2019s is hardly a \u201cprogressive\u201d company but one that is merely trying in a halfhearted way to catch up with changing market norms and to anticipate inevitable regulation.\n\nIf McDonald\u2019s were truly progressive, what would it do? It might revamp the menu in favor of sustainably sourced and fresher food (it\u2019s worth noting that in Britain, McDonald\u2019s uses free-range eggs and organic milk), and might increase its workers\u2019 wages (and hours) to something approaching a living wage.\n\nIt may be that the biggest beneficiary of McDonald\u2019s recent moves is the food movement, which, smelling blood, continues to apply pressure. (In response to the raise, some demonstrating workers chanted: \u201cHey McDonald\u2019s, let\u2019s be blunt/This is just a P.R. stunt.\u201d) And that movement continues to gain credibility as it attends more to the rights of humans than those of animals \u2014 not that animals don\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s all relative.\n\nIt\u2019s great that McDonald\u2019s blinked. I\u2019d love to see it become a truly progressive company \u2014 I\u2019d even help them if I could \u2014 but if that\u2019s not in the cards, it would be fine to see a continuing decline in its business. Either would be a satisfactory ending to the McDonald\u2019s story.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150408032112, "twitter": {"description": "Instead of playing catch-up, it should really transform itself.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s Turns \u2018Progressive\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/opinion/mcdonalds-turns-progressive.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003616592"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "bittman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bittman-circular/bittman-circular-thumbLarge-v5.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/opinion/mcdonalds-turns-progressive.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003616592", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/opinion/mcdonalds-turns-progressive.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "McDonald\u2019s Turns \u2018Progressive\u2019", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "April 8, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "McDonald's Corporation", "keywords": "Restaurants,Fast Food Industry,Wages and Salaries,Antibiotics,Poultry,Minimum Wage,Labor and Jobs,Public Relations and Publicity,McDonald's Corporation", "news_keywords": "Restaurant,Antibacterial,Poultry", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Mark Bittman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bittman-circular/bittman-circular-thumbLarge-v5.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MARK BITTMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Instead of playing catch-up, it should really transform itself.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bittman-circular/bittman-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "description": "Instead of playing catch-up, it should really transform itself.", "CN": "mark-bittman", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/mark_bittman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-04-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "McDonald's Corporation", "published": "2015-04-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "08bittman-1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150409090324, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/opinion/mcdonalds-turns-progressive.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/bittman-circular/bittman-circular-superJumbo-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "Instead of playing catch-up, it should really transform itself.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s Turns \u2018Progressive\u2019"}, "pdate": 20150408, "des": "Public Relations and Publicity", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/mark-bittman", "tagline": "Nutrition, agriculture and health policy.", "uri": "/column/mark-bittman", "display-name": "Mark Bittman", "identifier": "mark-bittman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003616592, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "McDonald\u2019s Turns \u2018Progressive\u2019", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "These moves demonstrate that McDonald\u2019s is hardly a \u201cprogressive\u201d company but one that is merely trying in a halfhearted way to catch up with changing market norms and to anticipate inevitable regulation.\nIf McDonald\u2019s were truly progressive, what would it do?\n(In response to the raise, some demonstrating workers chanted: \u201cHey McDonald\u2019s, let\u2019s be blunt/This is just a P.R.\nAnd the third was to begin referring to itself as a \u201cmodern, progressive burger company.\u201dIs it too little, too late?\nNo one turns down a raise, but this one virtually guarantees that most of the company\u2019s workers will remain eligible for food stamps, thus perpetuating the public subsidy for McDonald\u2019s labor force."}
