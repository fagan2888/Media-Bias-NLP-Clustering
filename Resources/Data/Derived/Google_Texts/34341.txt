What should investors watch for as they consider that the usefulness of statin drugs in fighting “bad cholesterol” is being questioned?

For the most part, statins have outlived their usefulness for a number of high-profile drug makers. Patents on some of the biggest sellers in this space, including Pfizer Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/238207/delayed /quotes/nls/pfe PFE superstar statin Lipitor, already have expired, opening the floodgates for a number of generic versions of these drugs.

Bloomberg Pfizer’s patent already has expired on its statin, Lipitor.

Patents long ago expired on other cholesterol-fighting drugs like Merck & Co.’s /quotes/zigman/574389/delayed /quotes/nls/mrk MRK Zocor and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s /quotes/zigman/220498/delayed /quotes/nls/bmy BMY Pravachol.

MarketWatch’s Elizabeth O’Brien notes in her “Retire Well” column today that doctors are wondering whether the use of statins in fighting low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, many not be helpful in some situations.

That doesn’t mean a chilling effect on statins would go unnoticed. Drug makers trying to invent better cholesterol drugs could be hurt. Some believe that new statins could be top sellers for years to come.

Further, companies like AstraZeneca /quotes/zigman/134653/delayed /quotes/nls/azn AZN , whose Crestor remains under patent, may see sales diluted.

But now that statins are widely circulated by a number of drug makers both under patented brands and generic offshoots, any pain that might be felt from new revelations will be spread throughout the industry.
