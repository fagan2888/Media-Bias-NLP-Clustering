The first state to legalize recreational cannabis use has drawn some criticism in recent weeks because parents and health officials have been claiming the marijuana-infused edibles aren\u2019t dissimilar enough from the ordinary stuff, putting young children in danger.\n\nOne of the marijuana industry\u2019s fundamental goals has always been the pursuit of authenticity. When a company produces brownies or cookies that contain certain doses of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), it doesn\u2019t want the products to seem unfamiliar. Doing so would confuse consumers, or otherwise turn them off if they feel like the chocolate chip cookie they\u2019re eating is somehow weird or alien.\n\nBut authenticity has its downsides. For one, people can\u2019t tell the difference between a brownie laced with THC and one without the psychoactive chemical. \"We've heard so many stories pf people consuming marijuana not knowing it was marijuana,\" said Rachel O'Bryan to Fox News. O\u2019Bryan is an attorney and founding volunteer leader of Smart Colorado, a group that advocates for stricter marijuana regulations. \"Without a stamp or a clearly visible difference, these products are deceptive.\"\n\nIndustry groups such as Smart Colorado would prefer more than simple changes to the packaging label; they\u2019d like to see physical stamping on the product itself, like a pot leaf, for example. The problem is, generic products like cookies and brownies aren\u2019t the only goods cannabis bakeries produce. More complex items, like infused liquids and loose bags of granola, don\u2019t leave as much room for visible differentiation.\n\nThis raises an entirely new set of questions. For typical fanfare sweets, like cookies and brownies, are kids smart enough to recognize the symbol when they see it? And even if they see it, does that necessarily mean they\u2019ll stay away? Perhaps, but that responsibility may be less up to the people making the food, and more up to the parents who buy them. In theory, if parents are accepting enough to purchase edibles for recreational or medicinal use, having an open conversation with their kids shouldn\u2019t be a challenge.\n\nRegulators are considering this law as we speak, in particular assessing the value in slapping a brand on the product and the packaging. The word \u201cpracticable\u201d comes up a lot, to determine whether an edible could reasonably carry such a marking. \"It works for some products,\u201d said Julie Berliner, owner of SweetGrass Kitchens, a marijuana-infused bakery. \u201cBut others, it's going to be extremely hard and more than likely impracticable.\u201d\n\nThis debate represents the next set of questions since Colorado\u2019s full legalization on New Year\u2019s Day this year. While the recreational cannabis industry has already yielded millions of dollars in tax revenue in the state, a number of unforeseen challenges have emerged in the nascent weed climate. Homicide rates may have fallen, for instance, but Republicans in Congress point to an increase in traffic fatalities since medicinal marijuana was legalized in 2009. Elsewhere in Washington, the second state to legalize the drug, dispensaries have run into a slew of issues with agriculture keeping up with demand.\n\nWith legalization also comes the need for education, as many people who decide to use marijuana for recreational or medicinal purposes haven\u2019t the foggiest which strains to buy. Though, researchers are confident that as legalization ramps up, so will the science that informs the public. In the meantime, the new frontier of legalized marijuana in the U.S. is still very much an experiment, a trial period for hardline skeptics and bubbling optimists to see, once and for all, who made the correct prediction.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colorado, marijuana, edibles, deemed, too, similar, real, thing, kids, may, mistake, them", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A legal requirement in Colorado could force all marijuana edibles to carry a recognizable stamp, though sellers say such a law is impractical.", "title": "Who's Responsible For Keeping Pot Brownies Away From Kids?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/colorado-marijuana-edibles-deemed-too-similar-real-thing-kids-may-mistake-them-harmless-296088", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/01/brownies_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A legal requirement in Colorado could force all marijuana edibles to carry a recognizable stamp, though sellers say such a law is impractical.", "title": "Who's Responsible For Keeping Pot Brownies Away From Kids?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/colorado-marijuana-edibles-deemed-too-similar-real-thing-kids-may-mistake-them-harmless-296088", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/01/brownies_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/01/brownies_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-08-01T09:36:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T09:36:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A legal requirement in Colorado could force all marijuana edibles to carry a recognizable stamp, though sellers say such a law is impractical."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7d7\"", "article_summary": "O\u2019Bryan is an attorney and founding volunteer leader of Smart Colorado, a group that advocates for stricter marijuana regulations.\nHomicide rates may have fallen, for instance, but Republicans in Congress point to an increase in traffic fatalities since medicinal marijuana was legalized in 2009.\n\"We've heard so many stories pf people consuming marijuana not knowing it was marijuana,\" said Rachel O'Bryan to Fox News.\nIndustry groups such as Smart Colorado would prefer more than simple changes to the packaging label; they\u2019d like to see physical stamping on the product itself, like a pot leaf, for example.\nFor typical fanfare sweets, like cookies and brownies, are kids smart enough to recognize the symbol when they see it?"}
