Although the DA said she did not see evidence of a moving violation, a grand jury which investigated only the moments before the shooting ruled the police officer\u2019s actions justified. Anaya, according to a surviving passenger in the car, as well as the DA, tried to avoid being stopped by police out of a fear of being arrested on a warrant for a \u201clow-level concealing identity charge.\u201d\n\nDespite the apparent lack of a justifiable cause to compel Anaya to stop in the first place, the DA appeared to blame the victim in the shooting, saying Anaya \u201cwas so fearful of getting arrested she lost her life, according to the Albuquerque Journal. As to the fact pattern surrounding the shooting, the Journal reports:\n\nBefore the shooting, officer Wilson used a driving maneuver to force Anaya\u2019s Honda sedan to stop on Camino Carlos Rey.\n\n\n\nThe State Police have said previously Anaya was \u201caggressively\u201d backing toward the officer after he got out of his patrol car. Reconstruction of the incident and [passenger Jeremy] Munoz\u2019s testimony indicated that Anaya did in fact backup toward Wilson\u2019s car, said [district attorney Angela] Pacheco.\n\n\n\nAs Wilson got out of his patrol car at the end of the chase, Anaya \u201cwas revving the vehicle,\u201d Pacheco said in relating the officer\u2019s testimony, although she said Wilson\u2019s dash-cam video does not show Anaya\u2019s vehicle when it traveled in reverse toward him\u2026\n\n\n\nThe officer, who\u2019s been with the State Police for less than two years, testified \u201che was in fear of his life and he was terrorized,\u201d Pacheco said.\n\nWill Wilson face charges for forcing Anaya\u2019s car to stop despite appearing to lack a justifiable cause to? Don\u2019t count on it, even though local cops in Santa Fe refused a request to join the chase because the State Police could not provide a reason it was happening. The incident provides another tragic example of the need for stricter rules about when police are allowed to pursue vehicles, whether on open roads or in city traffic, especially for reasons as flimsy as \"perceived\" moving violations.\n\nMost of the 16 shots Wilson fired at Anaya\u2019s car were while it was moving away from the officer, according to the DA, who suggested the copwas trying to stop her from fleeing. Anaya was fatally shot in the back and neck. A state toxicology report apparently found cocaine in Anaya\u2019s system, but the Journal says it wasn\u2019t mentioned in the DA\u2019s report on the grand jury\u2019s findings. Anaya\u2019s family\u2019s attorney wouldn\u2019t comment on whether a lawsuit was forthcoming.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Oliver Wilson shot at Jeanette Anaya and her car 16 times", "title": "New Mexico Police Fatal Shooting of Woman After Car Chase Over \u201cPerceived Moving Violation\u201d That Local Cops Wouldn\u2019t Join Ruled Justified", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/16/new-mexico-police-fatal-shooting-of-woma", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/ekrayewski/2014_01/jeanetteanaya_localmedia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Mexico state trooper Oliver Wilson shot at\nJeanette Anaya and her car 16 times at the end of a pursuit that\nbegan over what the District Attorney says Wilson called a\n\u201cperceived\u201d moving violation.
