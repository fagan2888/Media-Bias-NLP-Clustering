However, the U.S. Supreme Court gave states the option to forgo expansion. So far, Florida has resisted expanding the health program for the poor, despite the federal government\u2019s promise to pick up most of the costs.\n\nAs a result, more than a million Floridians are expected to fall through the so-called Medicaid \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d which is why this has become such a big issue in our state.\n\nNot expanding Medicaid has directly affected people in central Florida like Michelle Self.\n\nSelf has emphysema, asthma and a heart condition. She thought the Affordable Care Act would provide her free health insurance, but when she tried to sign up, she learned she couldn\u2019t afford the coverage being offered.\n\n\u201cThe cheapest I found was $97 a month,\u201d she said. \u201cWith no job and no income, how do you pay that with ObamaCare?\u201d\n\nThe same thing happened to Robert Evans.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t have any medical insurance,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThat is something that is needed.\u201d\n\nEvans and Self are homeless. They are too poor to qualify for free coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and they do not qualify for Medicaid as it stands today in Florida.\n\n\u201cYou feel like your back is up against the wall, and you don\u2019t know which way to turn or where to go,\u201d Evans said.\n\nMedicaid, the government\u2019s free health plan for the poor, only covers children, pregnant women, the disabled and single parents of underage children.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded the program to include nearly all low-income adults. But Florida lawmakers turned down more than $50 billion in federal funding in deciding against Medicaid expansion here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the most vulnerable and disadvantaged of our community are left out,\u201d said Bakari Burns, who runs a medical clinic for the poor on Orange Blossom Trail.\n\nBurns is hoping Florida lawmakers will reconsider as they meet in Tallahassee during the current legislative session.\n\nHe said more than 7,000 patients who are treated at his clinic fall into the coverage gap.\n\n\u201cTo me, (Medicaid expansion) does seem like a no brainer,\u201d Burns said.\n\nOthers agree.\n\n\u201cIf you are one of the almost two million Floridians who are hard-working, get up every morning, try to take care of your family and you are still making too little money to qualify for a tax credit, you are out of luck without the legislature moving ahead,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, during a recent visit to Orlando.\n\nThe coverage gap also includes the working poor. These are people who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid but do not make enough to qualify for full subsidies under the new law.\n\nIf lawmakers agree to expand Medicaid, 1.8 million uninsured Floridians could gain coverage.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, Dr. Maritza Rodriguez with Florida Hospital said the poor will continue to use emergency rooms for basic medical care.\n\n\u201cWhen they don\u2019t have insurance, they don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nThe federal government would pick up the tab for most of the Medicaid expansion through 2016. Then states would be required to pay 10 percent by 2020. Gov. Rick Scott believes it would strain Florida's budget, and he considers the expansion to be federal overreach.\n\nBut if Florida doesn\u2019t expand Medicaid, Jon Urbanek, Senior Vice President, Health Insurance Markets for Florida Blue, said the poor will continue using emergency rooms for basic medical care, and the rest of us will pay for that care.\n\n\u201cIt costs us all money. Everyone\u2019s premiums go up for hospital uncompensated care,\u201d Urbanek said.\n\nHe made another argument to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cFloridians are paying federal income tax, so there is tax money from Floridians that is going to go to another state to subsidize their Medicaid expansion, so that\u2019s another reason why it just makes sense,\u201d Urbanek said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "he Affordable Care Act was intended to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all low-income adults.
