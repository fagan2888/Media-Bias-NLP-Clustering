She had heard they don\u2019t offer much nutritional value because they are mostly water.\n\nGreat question. But although these vegetables might not be the MVPs of the nutrition game (we\u2019ll leave that to the dark leafy greens), they all have a place on the team.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children should eat one to three cups of vegetables every day. This is a significant amount, so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t so hastily dismiss those cucumbers.\n\nHere are 10 common myths that mischaracterize vegetables:\n\nCabbage: Just a cheap meal filler\n\nPart of the cruciferous family of vegetables that includes kale, cauliflower, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, cabbage is high in fiber for healthy digestion and satiety, vitamin C for the immune system and the absorption of iron, vitamin K for healthy blood and circulation, and cancer-fighting compounds.\n\nCarrots: Too much sugar\n\nCarrots contain high amounts of vitamin A for eyesight and immunity, vitamin C for that strong immune system, and fiber. As for its natural sugar, the fiber in a carrot slows down the absorption.\n\nCorn: Source of high-fructose syrup\n\nHigh-fructose corn syrup has certainly damaged corn\u2019s reputation, but the vegetable and the sweetener have little in common. All of the nutrition and healthy fiber in the corn plant has been stripped from the syrup. Corn is a high-carbohydrate vegetable, so it shouldn\u2019t be the only one your child eats. But it provides thiamine that helps convert carbohydrates into energy, heart-healthy folate, and antioxidants. Buying organic \u2014 always a good idea in the vegetable world \u2014 is especially recommended.\n\nCucumbers: Nothing but water\n\nYes, cucumbers are 95 percent water, helping our bodies stay hydrated in hot temperatures, but they also provide antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene that help us fight cellular damage, B vitamins that support nerve health, potassium for heart health, and fiber.\n\nCelery: Ditto\n\nThe vegetable provides vitamin K for blood health, folate for red blood cell production, vitamin A, fiber and yes, lots of water. Celery has been shown to lower blood pressure and the risk of cancer.\n\nGarlic: Flavor but no nutrition\n\nThis vegetable has been shown to lower blood pressure, protect the heart, fight cancer and regulate blood sugar levels and is antibacterial and antiviral, which means it is helpful during cold and flu season.\n\nOnions: Ditto\n\nNever say no to an onion, especially during allergy season. They are high in quercetin, an antioxidant known for being a natural antihistamine. Onions have also been shown to support heart health, and they provide vitamin C, calcium, iron, folate and fiber.\n\nIceberg lettuce: No nutrition\n\nYes, darker varieties of lettuces and greens provide more nutrition per serving, but if iceberg will get your kid to eat salad, embrace it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/veggieswp.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children should eat one to three cups of vegetables every day.\nOnions have also been shown to support heart health, and they provide vitamin C, calcium, iron, folate and fiber.\nA fellow mom recently asked me whether cucumbers and celery really count as green vegetables.\nCarrots: Too much sugarCarrots contain high amounts of vitamin A for eyesight and immunity, vitamin C for that strong immune system, and fiber.\nCelery: DittoThe vegetable provides vitamin K for blood health, folate for red blood cell production, vitamin A, fiber and yes, lots of water."}
