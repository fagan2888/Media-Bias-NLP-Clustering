President Barack Obama will seek another $45 million next year to expand the program.\n\nInfectious diseases account for about 1 in 4 deaths worldwide, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. While diseases such as Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome haven\u2019t posed a threat to the U.S., lapses in other countries may allow an outbreak to spread rapidly, Frieden said.\n\n\u201cNo country can protect itself solely within its borders,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cWe\u2019re all only as safe as the weakest link out there. This is an effort to essentially make the U.S. safer and make the world safer, to improve countries\u2019 capacity to better find, stop and prevent health threats.\u201d\n\nFrieden and Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. health secretary, held a videoconference today with the partners in the effort.\n\nWhile no other country made a specific financial commitment today, Frieden said, all the nations at the conference including China, Russia, France and the U.K. agreed to \u201caccelerate progress and address not just the health sector but include security in health in new ways.\u201d\n\nFirst Consensus\n\n\u201cFor the first time, really, we have a consensus on not only what are the threats, but what do we have to do to address them,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an example, Frieden said Turkey\u2019s government agreed to host a WHO office to respond to outbreaks in its region.\n\nThe agreement will also target emerging infections such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.\n\nThe 10 countries in line for the U.S. investment, which will be funded by the CDC and the Department of Defense, weren\u2019t identified. The CDC plans to build on test projects last year in Uganda and Vietnam, where the agency helped the two nations\u2019 health officials improve systems to detect and combat outbreaks of dangerous pathogens that include drug-resistant tuberculosis, Ebola virus and exotic flu strains.\n\nIn Uganda, CDC officials helped the country\u2019s Ministry of Health upgrade laboratories where tissue samples would be tested in the event of an outbreak, and developed a system for local doctors to report cases of illness by text message, according to an article published in the CDC\u2019s journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nUganda now is able to quickly transport tissue samples from rural outbreaks to a high-security lab in the capital, Kampala, by motorcycle courier and overnight mail, Frieden said. A mobile phone network-connected printer then texts lab results back to rural hospitals, he said.\n\n\u201cUltimately every country in the world should have this kind of system,\u201d Frieden said. The $40 million, he said, \u201cis certainly enough to make a good start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/global-effort-signed-to-halt-spread-of-infectious-disease", "title": "Global Effort Signed to Halt Spread of Infectious Disease", "description": "The U.S. won commitments from 25 countries and the World Health Organization to work together on systems to better detect and combat outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H7N9 avian flu and Ebola virus.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Tom Frieden", "news_keywords": "Health,Tom Frieden", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/global-effort-signed-to-halt-spread-of-infectious-disease", "parsely-title": "Global Effort Signed to Halt Spread of Infectious Disease", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-13T19:28:25.781Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The U.S. won commitments from 25 countries and the World Health Organization to work together on systems to better detect and combat outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H7N9 avian flu and Ebola virus.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Tom Frieden,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-02-13T19:28:25.781Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/global-effort-signed-to-halt-spread-of-infectious-disease", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The U.S. won commitments from 25 countries and the World Health Organization to work together on systems to better detect and combat outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H7N9 avian flu and Ebola virus.", "title": "Global Effort Signed to Halt Spread of Infectious Disease"}, "fb": {"status": "The U.S. won commitments from 25 countries and the World Health Organization to work together on systems to better detect and combat outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H7N9 avian flu and Ebola virus."}, "parsely-post-id": "N0XYQ46TTDSZ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19c7\"", "article_summary": "Infectious diseases account for about 1 in 4 deaths worldwide, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\nAs an example, Frieden said Turkey\u2019s government agreed to host a WHO office to respond to outbreaks in its region.\n\u201cUltimately every country in the world should have this kind of system,\u201d Frieden said.\nThe U.S. won commitments from 25 countries and the World Health Organization to work together on systems to better detect and combat outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H7N9 avian flu and Ebola virus.\nWhile diseases such as Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome haven\u2019t posed a threat to the U.S., lapses in other countries may allow an outbreak to spread rapidly, Frieden said."}
