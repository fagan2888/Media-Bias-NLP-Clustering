He was one of 107 players invited to try out for the team that will compete in 18U Worlds set for Japan later this Summer.\n\nBleday and the others began competing Tuesday, and he survived the first round of cuts, from 107 down to 40.\n\nSo that itself is a big deal, especially given the serious wealth of high school talent on hand up there in Cary.\n\n\"Oh yeah.\" JJ told us by phone Thursday. \"You're with the best of the best in the nation. And it's so much fun competing with that, at that level because you know that's how the professional level is, that's how college is. So it's fun to be experiencing it now because you could be dealing with it later on in your career if you want to keep making it in your future.\"\n\nFortunately Bleday's Mosley team played in a tournament at that facility in Cary in March. And in fact, he'd played in some other elite youth tourneys there. So perhaps an advantage there for him over the competition.\n\n\"Yes sir it is.\" says Bleday. \"I've been playing here at the complex since I was 14 years old. And just having that comfortability around it, it's great to have. Because you know you're not nervous. You're familiar with your surroundings. It's a lot of fun to play there, it's like a second home to you.\"\n\nThe next wave of cuts from 40 to 28 comes over the weekend. Greg will keep us up to date on how JJ fares.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Mosley senior to be JJ Bleday looking to make 18U version of Team USA Baseball.", "language": "english", "author": "Scott Rossman", "og": {"description": "Mosley senior to be JJ Bleday looking to make 18U version of Team USA Baseball.", "title": "Mosley's Bleday Past First Cut For 18U Team USA", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Mosleys-Bleday-Past-First-Cut-For-18U-Team-USA--311607861.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DF3/83A/DF383ABE07814E9EBF3EB8E131829709", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/67A/945/67A94536D90F41CE9EB2E2FBFD11548F.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Mosley senior to be JJ Bleday looking to make 18U version of Team USA Baseball.", "title": "Mosley's Bleday Past First Cut For 18U Team USA", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Mosleys-Bleday-Past-First-Cut-For-18U-Team-USA--311607861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/7bledayusa.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Mosley's Bleday Past First Cut For 18U Team USA", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mosleys Bleday Past First Cut"}, "article_summary": "Fortunately Bleday's Mosley team played in a tournament at that facility in Cary in March.\nMore Video...One of Mosley's own is taking his shot this month at making the 18U and under version of Team USA.\nHe was one of 107 players invited to try out for the team that will compete in 18U Worlds set for Japan later this Summer.\nJJ went up to the USA Baseball National Training Complex in Cary, North Carolina last weekend.\nBleday and the others began competing Tuesday, and he survived the first round of cuts, from 107 down to 40."}
