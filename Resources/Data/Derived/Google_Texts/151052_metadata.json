In addition, the letter says that a staff analysis reveals that some of those third-party sites include Google, Yahoo, Twitter and Advertising.com.\n\nMore than 9.5 million Americans have purchased health insurance or been automatically reenrolled in plans during the second enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act exchanges, according to recent data released by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe lawmakers' letter was released on Friday, less than a week after CMS said in an announcement that it is reviewing its privacy policies. In addition, the Obama administration made changes to Healthcare.gov less than a week after the report about the privacy violations.\n\nCMS admitted in the announcement it does use third-party tools to find out where users of the sites have issues and evaluate website traffic. The agency said it takes concerns about privacy seriously and will launch \"a review of our privacy policies, contracts for third-party tools and URL construction. We are looking at whether there are additional steps we should take to improve our efforts.\"\n\nHowever, lawmakers don't think that CMS is taking the right steps.\n\n\"Instead of making decisions piecemeal, after problems have been discovered, CMS should have a standard protocol that protects consume privacy,\" they write in the letter to Burwell.\n\nIn addition, they pose some questions to Burwell, seeking answers by Feb. 13, which include:\n\n\"Has HHS or CMS at any time authorized the sharing or distribution of any consumer information between Healthcare.gov and any company or non-U.S. government group, organization or entity?\"\n\n\"Has HHS or CMS at any time authorized the sharing or distribution of any consumer information between a company with access to Healthcare.gov consumer information and one or more third-party organizations?\"\n\n\"Is HHS or CMS aware of any instance, authorized or unauthorized, in which consumer information has been sold traded or otherwise used for any commercial or political purpose?\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the lawmakers' letter (.pdf)\n\n- check out the CMS announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare.gov might be violating consumer privacy\n\nObama administration made security changes to Healthcare.gov\n\nHHS: 9.5 million Americans have health insurance from public exchanges", "article_metadata": {"description": "In light of a report that\u00a0Healthcare.gov might violate consumers' privacy rights\u00a0by giving their personal data to third-party sites, lawmakers wrote a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell requesting information about the safety and security of the site.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthIT", "description": "In light of a report that\u00a0Healthcare.gov might violate consumers' privacy rights\u00a0by giving their personal data to third-party sites, lawmakers wrote a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell requesting information about the safety and security of the site.", "title": "Lawmakers blast CMS, HHS for Healthcare.gov privacy issues", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/lawmakers-blast-cms-hhs-healthcaregov-privacy-issues/2015-02-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthit.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealthit", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=783777884", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Congress,consumer privacy,Health Information Management,healthcare.gov,security,Sylvia Mathews Burwell", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Management"}, "article_summary": "\"Has HHS or CMS at any time authorized the sharing or distribution of any consumer information between a company with access to Healthcare.gov consumer information and one or more third-party organizations?\"\nThe lawmakers' letter was released on Friday, less than a week after CMS said in an announcement that it is reviewing its privacy policies.\n\"Is HHS or CMS aware of any instance, authorized or unauthorized, in which consumer information has been sold traded or otherwise used for any commercial or political purpose?\"\nIn addition, the letter says that a staff analysis reveals that some of those third-party sites include Google, Yahoo, Twitter and Advertising.com.\nIn addition, the Obama administration made changes to Healthcare.gov less than a week after the report about the privacy violations."}
