He said the key is that AMT is striving to control administrative overhead and partnering with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which provides the doctor and hospital network and medical claims administration. As a result, it has managed to hold member health plan cost increases to low single-digits \u2014 at a time when many employers are struggling with soaring health care bills.\n\n\n\nAMT is a not-for-profit that operates to benefit its members, so when there\u2019s surplus in excess of what it needs to fund an ample financial reserve, some of that money goes back to the members, thus lowering their cost of health coverage. Mishkin said that, over the past three years, AMT has returned $9.5 million to its members.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1945 by the New Jersey Fuel Merchants Association, it eventually opened its doors to other associations and in 1978 became the Association Master Trust, reflecting its diverse membership. Today, AMT\u2019s 16 New Jersey associations include the New Jersey Independent Electrical Contractors Association, the New Jersey State League of Master Plumbers and the New Jersey Veterinary Medicine Association.\n\nTOP 100 PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES: No. 16 AmeriHealth feels it's expanding its business by limiting its territory\n\n\n\n\u201cAMT was built for the purpose of helping employers create a solid benefit plan for themselves and their employees at the best cost possible; that has always been our philosophy,\u201d Mishkin said.\n\n\n\nAnd he said AMT would have no reason to exist if it didn\u2019t give its member associations what they want: comprehensive, competitively priced health plans and a high degree of customer service for members who need help sorting out issues with coverage and claims.\n\n\n\nAMT members aren\u2019t locked into purchasing an AMT health plan, but are free to shop for health plans at AMT as well as on the traditional health insurance market.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur employers look at their costs every year, and if they don\u2019t think we\u2019re the right option, they can leave. Then a year later they can come back in,\u201d Mishkin said. Most decide to stay: Mishkin said AMT has a 95 percent member retention rate.\n\n\n\nAMT currently covers about 18,000 members: small business owners and their families, and the employees and their families. About half of those members are enrolled in AMT\u2019s \u201cexclusive provider network,\u201d or EPO. The EPO provides access to about 22,000 doctors and hospitals in Horizon\u2019s New Jersey network. In addition, EPO members can use the doctors and hospitals in the nationwide Blue Cross network.\n\nQ&A with top executives about top private companies: How would you describe the impact of Obamacare on your business?\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is really terrific when you think that our EPO gives you access to so many great doctors and hospitals across the country,\u201d Mishkin said.\n\nThe EPO does not have an out-of-network benefit, so those who chose the EPO have to stay within the Blue network.\n\n\n\nThe EPO is one of about 40 plans that AMT offers. Some plans offer out-of-network benefits, and there is a variety of plans with varying levels of coverage and price.\n\n\n\nMishkin said the company\u2019s overall rate increase for 2014, across all its plans, is 9.8 percent. The EPO plans, however, came in at 6 percent, thus significantly outperforming the overall rate increase. After accounting for refunds of excess surplus to members, net rate increases fall to the low single-digits.\n\n\n\nUnder current New Jersey law, MEWAs have to cover all state-mandated health benefits, even though the coverage they provide is self-funded. Generally, New Jersey\u2019s mandates don\u2019t apply to self-funded pans, which are regulated by federal law.\n\n\n\nSen. Robert Singer (R-Lakewood) is sponsoring a bill that would exempt large employers in a MEWA, those with 100 or more workers, from providing the state-mandated coverage. In some cases, the state mandates go beyond federal law, such as one that requires coverage of certain services to individuals with autism.\n\n\n\nSinger argues that exempting large employers from the state mandates puts MEWAs on a level playing field with large employers that are big enough to self-insure their health care costs on their own, without going the MEWA route.\n\n\n\nMishkin said nearly all of his member employers have fewer than 100 workers, and covering the state mandates doesn\u2019t prevent AMT from offering price-competitive health plans. He estimates that AMT can deliver as much as a 10 percent savings on health care costs, depending on the plans selected, to employers with a typical AMT group of workers with an average age in the 40s or early 50s.\n\nClick here to see the Top 100 Privately Held Companies list No. 100 through No. 1.\n\n\n\nSen. Joseph F. Vitale (D-Woodbridge), chair of the Senate Health Committee, is opposed to exempting large employers in MEWAs from state mandates. He said AMT \u201cby all accounts runs a successful MEWA, and they are successful even under the current rules and regulations that some people are trying to change.\u201d\n\n\n\nVitale added, \u201cYou can be a successful MEWA and do it efficiently and effectively\u201d without reducing mandated benefits.\n\n\n\nMishkin said employers look to AMT to help give them an edge when hiring good workers.\n\n\n\nA number of the AMT members employ technical workers, \u201cand a lot of these techs can be hard to find,\u201d Mishkin said. \u201cOur members want to offer a good, solid benefit plan because that still makes a difference to get the employees you want.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the extra mile of customer service that AMT members receive.\n\n\n\nMishkin said Horizon fields the vast majority of phone inquiries, but AMT members who want additional attention will get it from the AMT staff.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have direct computer access right into the Horizon system so we can see exactly what has gone on with a claim, so that we can get it resolved,\u201d Mishkin said. \u201cThis is part of the service we bring: These are association members and we really want to help them through the tough times.\u201d\n\n\n\nMishkin added that Horizon provides \u201ca whole litany of services to us, and they\u2019re a big piece of the AMT product. We like Horizon\u2019s ability to provide cutting-edge, quality programs: They have been at the forefront of trying to provide care for patients that delivers good results at the best possible cost.\u201d\n\n\n\nEric DeGesero is executive vice president of the Fuel Merchants Association of New Jersey, which founded AMT\u2019s predecessor organization back in 1945. He is also executive director of the New Jersey Independent Electrical Contractors, which just came on board a couple of years ago as one of AMT\u2019s newest members.\n\nTOP 100 PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES: No. 1 Wakefern says ability to adapt to different needs and different times are keys to its success\n\n\n\nHe said AMT \u201chas to compete on its own merits to be successful, and we certainly do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nDepending on the plan choice, AMT may not always be the cheapest option, but \u201cWe offer great value in terms of the service that you get.\u201d He said when a member calls AMT with a question, \u201cYou get the same person every time, and you establish a relationship with the person who handles your account. You can\u2019t put a price on that value.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said AMT \u201coffers competitive, comprehensive benefits to small businesses. That\u2019s why we\u2019re successful.\u201d\n\n\n\nDeGesero said AMT has \u201cbeen providing benefits for almost 70 years to our members, and I\u2019m quite proud of the way we\u2019ve done it. Health coverage is so important, and it\u2019s essential that we do it right. My kids are covered by this \u2014 I have a vested interest in how this program works that goes beyond lots of other issues of public policy.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nPalatin has European licensing deal for female sexual dysfunction drug; could be worth more than $118M\n\nAfter just over two years, Revel closes its doors in Atlantic City\n\nSalvona moves to Hamilton, shifts into hiring mode", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Trenton is considering legislation to encourage more employers to join together and provide affordable health coverage to their workers by creating self-insured \u201cmulti-employer welfare associat", "title": "Through the years, N.J.\u2019s AMT has become an example of a MEWA done right | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140903/NJBIZ01/140909935/through-the-years-njs-amt-has-become-an-example-of-a-mewa-done-right", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140903/NJBIZ01/140909935/AR/0/AR-140909935.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Trenton is considering legislation to encourage more employers to join together and provide affordable health coverage to their workers by creating self-insured \u201cmulti-employer welfare associat", "title": "Through the years, N.J.\u2019s AMT has become an example of a MEWA done right | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140903/NJBIZ01/140909935/AR/0/AR-140909935.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Trenton is considering legislation to encourage more employers to join together and provide affordable health coverage to their workers by creating self-insured \u201cmulti-employer welfare associations,\u201d or MEWAs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "AMT members aren\u2019t locked into purchasing an AMT health plan, but are free to shop for health plans at AMT as well as on the traditional health insurance market.\nMishkin said Horizon fields the vast majority of phone inquiries, but AMT members who want additional attention will get it from the AMT staff.\nHealth coverage is so important, and it\u2019s essential that we do it right.\nA number of the AMT members employ technical workers, \u201cand a lot of these techs can be hard to find,\u201d Mishkin said.\nIn addition, EPO members can use the doctors and hospitals in the nationwide Blue Cross network."}
