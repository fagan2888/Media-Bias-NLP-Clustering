MORE room for shoppers in Gloucester has been made thanks to new public car parking spaces.

It is hoped that traffic nightmares which have marred big events at the Quays in recent years will be abated some degree after Gloucestershire College offered up its car park as a publiv pay and display.

The car park, which is in Llanthony Road opposite Gloucester Quays and close to Gloucester Docks, will be open to the public on weekdays from 4.30pm to 10pm and on weekends and bank holidays from 9am to 10pm.

The college has joined forces with Gloucester Quays and is offering the same price tariff as the waterside shopping complex.

The new car park will act as the official overflow car park for the Quays during big events such as the Tall Ships Festival and various markets that take place throughout the year. Queues and long delays in and out of the existing car parks have become common as visitor numbers have swelled.

The college’s vice-principal for customer services and marketing, Peter White, said: “The city is a thriving place and with a programme of exciting events all year round as well as the forthcoming Rugby World Cup this year, parking becomes a premium, so we are really pleased that we can support the city and our neighbours, Gloucester Quays, in this way.”

The new pay and display car park is managed externally by NSGL Parking and will cost £2 for a maximum of two hours, £4 for a maximum of four hours, £6 for a maximum of six hours and £10 for six hours or more during weekdays.

Drivers can park their cars for £1 during weekday evenings from 4.30pm until 10pm or £10 for six hours or more.

The Eastgate shopping centre and King’s Walk both charge £1.30 for one hour, £2 for two hours, £3 for three hours, £4 for hours and £6 for the whole day.

City councillor Paul Toleman (C, Westgate) said: “I am all in favour of this. It will be ideal when we have events on at Gloucester Quays it can be extremely difficult for drivers to move and find somewhere to park.”
