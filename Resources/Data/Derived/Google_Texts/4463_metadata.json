That system is now controlled by the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NTIA said it would continue to oversee the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) through September 2015, but then it would ease out of the role.\n\nThat announcement led to immediate criticism that the move would reduce the control the U.S. has over Internet functions and increase the risk that Internet freedom could slip away without that U.S. influence. Duffy's bill, H.R. 4398, says flatly that the NTIA cannot cede its control.\n\n\n\n\"As Americans, we value our constitutional right of freedom of speech and have promoted this value throughout the world,\" he said in a statement to The Hill. \"We should not give up our stewardship of the Internet so that the United Nations or countries like China or Russia, that do not hold free speech in the same regard, can have the opportunity to take control.\"\n\n\n\nDuffy's bill is the Global Internet Freedom (GIF) Act. The two-page legislation says the assistant secretary of Commerce for communications and information \"may not relinquish the responsibility of the National Telecommunications and information Administration with respect to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority Functions.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
