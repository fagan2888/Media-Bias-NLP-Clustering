This issue has ranked the highest in terms of primary challenges all year. In addition, fixing the long-term federal debt remains a high policy priority for manufacturers.\n\n\u201cCosts and uncertainty are up, and manufacturers\u2019 optimism is down thanks to the health care reform law,\u201d said NAM Senior Vice President of Policy and Government Relations Aric Newhouse. \u201cThe health care law has weighed heavily on manufacturers all year long\u2014and their concerns are not going away. It is standing in the way of manufacturing growth by seriously limiting investment and job creation.\u201d\n\nKey survey findings include the following:\n\nMore than 77 percent of manufacturers identified rising health care and insurance costs as their most important challenge.\n\nMore than 90 percent of manufacturers stated their health insurance premiums had increased, and a significant portion have had to increase employee copays (58.6 percent), reduce coverage (27.7 percent) and/or change insurance providers (17.6 percent) to lower their costs.\n\nAccording to the survey, the ACA and the accompanying uncertainties have had effects that extend well beyond premium payments and have placed a roadblock in manufacturers\u2019 efforts to invest and grow. When asked about how these uncertainties have impacted their business, nearly one-third said they had reduced their outlook for 2014, and a sizable percentage had reduced employment or stopped hiring (23.1 percent) and/or reduced or slowed down their business investment (20.2 percent).\n\nThe NAM/IndustryWeek Survey of Manufacturers was conducted among the NAM\u2019s membership of small, medium and large manufacturers.
