You can really move the needle on a lot of social issues just by focusing on the health and well-being of women.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said the biggest misconception she has heard in dialogues about gender, racial and class inequalities is that such inequalities don\u2019t even exist.\n\n\u201cThey do. They clearly do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they can also be solved. There\u2019s a lot of people doing that work.\u201d\n\nEducation remains in the forefront of solutions needed to combat disparity, O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cFor most marginalized groups \u2014 take Latinos, for example \u2014 education is either No. 1 or No. 2 on the list of issues they care about,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would think it\u2019s the things that you always hear about, like immigration, but parents everywhere understand that the best way to help their children is to give them a solid foundation in education.\u201d\n\nThe luncheon, scheduled at the Colorado Convention Center, is expected to draw more than 1,900 attendees.\n\nO\u2019Brien said she looks forward to her Colorado talk, adding she loves listening to \u2014 and learning from \u2014 the stories of others.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing people can do who want to make a difference is listen,\u201d she said. \u201cListen to other people\u2019s experiences and try to figure out what\u2019s the way forward.\u201d\n\nWant to attend?\n\nWhen: 11:30 a.m. Wednesday\n\nWhere: Colorado Convention Center\n\nCost: Individual $150; VIP $250; professionals under age 40 $75\n\nTickets: wfco.org", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Soledad O\u2019Brien to speak at Women\u2019s Foundation of Colorado event", "title": "Soledad O\u2019Brien to speak at Women\u2019s Foundation of Colorado event", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/10/soledad-obrien-to-speak-at-womens-foundation-of-colorado-event/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010_034019_soledad-obrien-stephen-colbert.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010_034019_soledad-obrien-stephen-colbert.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T14:54:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:27:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Soledad O\u2019Brien plans to bring her knowledge of social issues and marginalized groups to the Women\u2019s Foundation of Colorado.\n\u201cI think the Women\u2019s Foundation is very much in the same vein with the things I focus on in my tours and in my stories,\u201d O\u2019Brien told The Denver Post on Saturday.\nO\u2019Brien said she looks forward to her Colorado talk, adding she loves listening to \u2014 and learning from \u2014 the stories of others.\nThere\u2019s a lot of people doing that work.\u201dEducation remains in the forefront of solutions needed to combat disparity, O\u2019Brien said.\nWhen: 11:30 a.m. WednesdayWhere: Colorado Convention CenterCost: Individual $150; VIP $250; professionals under age 40 $75Tickets: wfco.org"}
