It\u2019s known as Project Liberty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWednesday\u2019s grand opening was a major milestone for backers of biofuels. It is only the second commercial-scale facility in the country to produce cellulosic ethanol, which is made from woody, inedible parts of plants, in contrast to traditional ethanol.\n\nThe project is designed to prove that ethanol can be produced commercially from waste agricultural material without taking away from food supplies or livestock feed.\n\n\u201cSome have called cellulosic ethanol a \u2018fantasy fuel,\u2019 but today it becomes a reality,\u201d Jeff Broin, POET\u2019s executive chairman, said in a statement. \u201cWith access now to new sources for energy, Project Liberty can be the first step in transforming our economy, our environment and our national security.\u201d\n\nFeike Sijbesma, chief executive officer of DSM, called the opening \u201can historical day in the development of plant-residue-based cellulosic ethanol as a viable, commercially attractive alternative to gasoline as we are moving from the fossil age to the bio-renewable age.\u201d\n\nThe grand opening included King of the Netherlands Willem-Alexander, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack Thomas J.

Terry Branstad (R) and others.\n\nAt full production levels, Project Liberty will make 25 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol a year, which the Energy Department estimated would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 210,000 tons annually.\n\nProject Liberty received about $100 million in both investments and research from the Energy Department.\n\n\u201cThe Energy Department\u2019s investments in projects like the Liberty biorefinery are helping to bring innovative, cost-cutting biofuel technologies online and diversify our transportation fueling options,\u201d Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz Ernest MonizThe Trail 2016: Donald and the Supremes Overnight Energy: EPA wants higher ethanol mandate Moniz dismisses Trump\u2019s call to change climate deal MORE said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHomegrown biofuels have the potential to further increase our energy security, stimulate rural economic development, and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.\u201d\n\nProject Liberty\u2019s opening follows the launch last year of a project in Florida that uses vegetative, yard and municipal solid waste to make ethanol. That was the first commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant in the country.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is required by law to mandate that a certain amount of cellulosic biofuel is mixed into traditional gasoline and diesel each year. With almost no commercial production of cellulosic fuels, the agency has had to keep the mandated volumes very low.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A federally-backed facility in Iowa started producing ethanol Wednesday.", "description": "A federally-backed facility in Iowa started producing ethanol Wednesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A federally-backed facility in Iowa started producing ethanol Wednesday.", "title": "First corn waste ethanol plant opens in Iowa", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/216523-first-corn-waste-ethanol-plant-opens-in-iowa", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/216523-first-corn-waste-ethanol-plant-opens-in-iowa", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-03T12:45-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Ethanol, Cellulosic ethanol, Renewable fuels,Ernest Moniz, Tom Vilsack,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-03T12:45:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/216523-first-corn-waste-ethanol-plant-opens-in-iowa", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A federally-backed facility in Iowa started producing ethanol Wednesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "First corn waste ethanol plant opens in Iowa"}, "dcterms.title": "First corn waste ethanol plant opens in Iowa"}, "article_summary": "A federally-backed facility in Iowa started producing ethanol from corn waste products Wednesday, becoming the first commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant in the country to use corn waste.\nThat was the first commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant in the country.\n\u201cSome have called cellulosic ethanol a \u2018fantasy fuel,\u2019 but today it becomes a reality,\u201d Jeff Broin, POET\u2019s executive chairman, said in a statement.\nIt is only the second commercial-scale facility in the country to produce cellulosic ethanol, which is made from woody, inedible parts of plants, in contrast to traditional ethanol.\nThe plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa, is owned by a joint venture between American biofuel maker POET and Dutch chemical materials company Royal DSM."}
