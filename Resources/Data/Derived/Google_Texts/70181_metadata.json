That\u2019s a three percent increase for the industry from the same period last year.\n\nRelated: Why Flying Is Getting Even More Miserable\n\n\u201cThe continued growth in passenger volumes can be attributed to the accessibility and affordability of air travel today,\u201d said John Heimlich, A4A\u2019s chief economist, in a statement. \u201cTo meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many routes.\u201d\n\nThe 10 publicly traded U.S. airlines collectively reported pre-tax earnings of $23.2 billion in 2015, up 14.6 percent from the year before. Even though operating revenues were flat, profits improved thanks to a $14 billion (or 9.5 percent) drop in operating expenses driven in large part by cheaper fuel.\n\nAirlines have been responding to the increase in demand by adding seats. Fares were down 5.1 percent in 2015 for the 10 largest U.S. airlines, and the number of passengers grew by 4.4 percent.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Best Time to Buy an Airline Ticket\n\nBut don\u2019t expect airline prices to go much lower. Once oil prices rebound, airlines could have trouble sustaining profitability as costs increase. Even now, some investors are concerned that fares have dropped too much, and that airlines are flirting with another round of ruinous fare wars.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A record number of Americans are expected to take flight this spring, as cheap fuel an", "title": "Feeling Crowded Yet?
