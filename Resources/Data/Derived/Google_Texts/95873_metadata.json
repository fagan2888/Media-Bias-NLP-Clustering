It started when he was two and a half and he picked up a Barbie and refused to put her down. He\u2019s gone through all of the toy phases that girls his age usually go through. Barbie gave way to Disney Princesses gave way to My Little Pony gave way to Monster High.\n\nMy son is now almost 7 years old and I thought that our pocketbooks were going to luck out and that he was going to skip over the very pricey American Girl doll phase. I really thought we were in the clear. Then American Girl catalogs started arriving in our mailbox a few months ago in preparation for the holidays. He has memorized every page of every catalog and decided that he wants a $130 doll, an $85 gymnastics equipment set and a $350 bright-blue Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nIn the process of writing his Christmas list in his very best first-grade penmanship, he looked up from the catalogs and asked me a very serious question.\n\n\u201cHow come there aren\u2019t any boys in this catalog? Boys can play with American Girl dolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, they can,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cThen how come they don\u2019t have boys in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI did know why; I just didn\u2019t want to admit it to my son. The sight of boys playing with dolls makes people uncomfortable. When people are uncomfortable, they look away. If people look away from your catalog, your sales sag. Brands want customers, not controversy.\n\nToy catalogs in Europe have started to erase the gender lines that were once drawn for their merchandise. Now, girls play with toy weapons and trains. Boys play house and care for baby dolls.\n\nLast year at this time, I found a graphic online that explained \u201cHow To Tell If A Toy Is For Boys or Girls.\u201d The first question was: \u201cDo you operate the toy with your genitalia?\u201d If the answer was \u201cyes,\u201d then \u201cthe toy is not for children.\u201d If the answer was \u201cno,\u201d then \u201cthe toy is either for girls or boys.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how it is in our house. Our children \u2013 both boys \u2013 are allowed to like the colors, clothing, toys and hobbies of their choice. Things aren\u2019t \u201cfor girls\u201d or \u201cfor boys.\u201d Our children know that and appreciate that \u2013 and so do their friends who play free of gender policing at our house, but don\u2019t enjoy the same freedom at home. But my sons see things differently in the pages of the toy catalogs of all major U.S. brands.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He loves dolls, and in our house toys aren't \"for girls\" or \"for boys.\" Toy catalogs need to catch up", "title": "My son is getting an American Girl Doll for Christmas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "He loves dolls, and in our house toys aren't \"for girls\" or \"for boys.\" Toy catalogs need to catch up", "title": "My son is getting an American Girl Doll for Christmas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/25/my_son_is_getting_an_american_girl_doll_for_christmas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/american_doll.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He loves dolls, and in our house toys aren't \"for girls\" or \"for boys.\" Toy catalogs need to catch up", "title": "My son is getting an American Girl Doll for Christmas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/american_doll.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lori Duron", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, american girl doll, dolls, Gender, gender-creativity, Toys", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd105d\"", "article_summary": "Then American Girl catalogs started arriving in our mailbox a few months ago in preparation for the holidays.\nMy son is now almost 7 years old and I thought that our pocketbooks were going to luck out and that he was going to skip over the very pricey American Girl doll phase.\nTopics: american girl doll, dolls, Gender, gender-creativity, Toys, Life NewsFor more than half of his life, my son has preferred dolls, toys and clothes that are marketed to girls.\nBut my sons see things differently in the pages of the toy catalogs of all major U.S. brands.\nBoys can play with American Girl dolls.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, they can,\u201d I replied."}
