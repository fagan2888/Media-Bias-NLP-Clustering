Provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are driving the adoption of these models, which are designed to improve the quality of American healthcare, while large employers and other payers across the country are also establishing new value-based purchasing models. Delivery of high-value, cost-effective care requires a focus on\u2014as well as a new approach to\u2014population health management. By coordinating the care of a population across the continuum, healthcare providers can deliver improved quality at decreased costs, and share these benefits with their partners in models such as accountable care organizations (ACOs). Performance-based contracts enable providers to gain additional revenue if they meet quality standards. Similarly, by using PHM strategies to reduce hospital readmissions, healthcare providers can avoid costly penalties under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.\n\nWith great potential to deliver a return on investment across multiple federal programs and quality-driven initiatives, PHM is a critical component in today\u2019s healthcare transformation. In order to execute on this enormous and complex undertaking, , however, healthcare organizations must develop and implement PHM strategies that leverage healthcare information technology to successfully manage the unique health needs and risks factors of an increasingly diverse population.\n\nThis new shift requires strategies and tools for PHM to evolve toward more efficient and consistent management of an entire population in order to help providers achieve quality and cost objectives as well as keep patients engaged in their wellness.
