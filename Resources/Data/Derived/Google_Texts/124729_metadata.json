Finally. Last week, the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points. It did so again yesterday morning, before recovering most of the loss by midday. The financial reporters were chasing their tails faster than ever. \u201cThe market is down! What does it mean?!\u201d And then, hours later: \u201cThe market is recovering! What does it mean?!\u201d\n\nBut counterintuitively, what working Americans saving for retirement really need is a market crash that lasts.\n\nRelated: Retirement? Bah!

You need a grizzly bear market\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diligently saving for retirement, say in your 401(k) or IRA, you\u2019ve been buying into a rising market for the past six and half years. And that\u2019s fine, but you could really use a good, solid break in the market. A deep sustained bear market.\n\nThat\u2019s when your retirement savings gets turbocharged. You\u2019ll be buying the market at a discount for the first time in years. With each paycheck-deducted contribution into your retirement savings, you\u2019ll be snapping up shares at a faster than ever pace. You deserve more bang for your buck. With a really horrible stock market, you\u2019ll finally be getting caught up a bit with your life-after-work nest egg.\n\nCome on bear market, stay ugly\n\nThe thing is, the market just hasn\u2019t committed to being really bad yet. But maybe this is finally our time. We just need it to go down and stay there for a while. Bear markets only last for an average of 14 months \u2013 while bull markets stretch on and on; for an average of more than three years (43 months), according to Putnam research.\n\nImagine if we could buy into a discounted market for a year or two \u2013 and then hang onto a raging bull run into retirement!\n\nRelated: 6 Tips from Warren Buffett on What to Do During a Market Crash\n\nDon\u2019t just get our hopes up\n\nMaybe we're just being overly optimistic \u2013 hoping for a really big, sustained drop in the markets. But if you walk on the sunny side of the street, you might want to crank up those salary deferrals into you 401(k), max out your IRA contributions and put some of that cash to work in your taxable brokerage account.\n\nAnd then hope for the worst.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Main Street.\n\nRead more from Main Street:\n\n'How I Retired Early': 6 Folks Share Their Unique Journeys and Secrets to Success\n\nThe 21 Best Places to Retire Overseas\n\n25 Collectibles Jittery Stock Market Investors Should Consider Buying", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Good news, retirement savers: the market\u2019s crashing.
