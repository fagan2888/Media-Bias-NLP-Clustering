Local law enforcement.\"\n\n\n\nPart of the president's plan includes funding for additional ATF and FBI agents to help process background checks.\n\n\"Everybody talks about a mental health issue and they want to track that,\" Arnott said. \"But the federal government doesn't have a way to do that.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate that gun control and mental illness are so often linked in the public mind,\" said Burrell Behavioral Health Psychologist Dr. Paul Thomlinson.\n\n\n\nMental health field workers fear their patients may not seek treatment because they're worried about having their rights curtailed.\n\n\"Because the minute people with mental illness get the message your records aren't confidential-- that's the minute we are unable to provide them effectively with services,\" said Dr. Thomlinson.\n\nIt's unclear at this point what kinds of changes may come with the executive action.\n\n\"We have no idea what day to day impact this would have on our sharing information,\" Thomlinson said.\n\n\"I don't understand how they're going to accomplish what they want to do,\" said Arnott.\n\nThe latest CBS News poll shows 51 percent of Americans believe gun laws should be more strict-- that's down seven percent since last fall.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "GREENE COUNTY, Mo. -- The FBI says it conducted a record 23 million background checks last year.&nbsp; Here in the Ozarks, many are voicing their concerns over President Obama&#39;s executive order-- including the Greene County Sheriff.", "author": "Lindsay Clein", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "GREENE COUNTY, Mo. -- The FBI says it conducted a record 23 million background checks last year.\u00a0 Here in the Ozarks, many are voicing their concerns over President Obama's executive order-- including the Greene County Sheriff.", "title": "Local Law Enforcement, Mental Health Community React to Stricter Gun Laws", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/local-law-enforcement-mental-health-community-react-to-stricter-gun-laws", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ozarksfirst/photo/2016/01/05/Obama%20guns_1452014776471_6234338_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "mental health, greene county, gun control, obama, guns, fbi, law enforcement, sheriff arnott", "published_time": "2016-01-06T03:41:52+0000", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T03:41:52+0000"}, "keywords": "fbi,gun control,obama,greene county,sheriff arnott,law enforcement,mental health,guns,News,Local News", "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Here in the Ozarks, many are voicing their concerns over President Obama's executive order-- including the Greene County Sheriff.\nMental health field workers fear their patients may not seek treatment because they're worried about having their rights curtailed.\nPresident Obama's gun control initiatives bring to the forefront a debate over the correlation between mental health and guns-- and also, an argument over privacy rights versus security.\n\"Everybody talks about a mental health issue and they want to track that,\" Arnott said.\n\"Instead of focusing on gun control, it would be nice if the president would focus on violent criminal control,\" said Arnott."}
