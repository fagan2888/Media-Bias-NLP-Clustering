As far as I know there are no songs about family far from home dreaming wistfully about Civic Holiday.\n\nNor is it consistently recognized as a statutory holiday. It differs province to province. Quebec doesn\u2019t celebrate it at all, and whatever you do don\u2019t tell them that they should. Civic Holiday stubbornly refuses to be pigeon-holed; it is consistently inconsistent.\n\nIn some cases provinces have given it their own name. In Alberta, it\u2019s Heritage Day. In B.C., it\u2019s British Columbia Day. Saskatchewan went with Saskatchewan Day, and not just because British Columbia Day was already taken.\n\nBut if there is a theme to this holiday it is the tendency to use it to tip our hat to our ancestors, and why not? They built a country while battling small pox and bad teeth.\n\nBut not all of our Civic Holiday heroes are the guys wearing mutton chops and powdered wigs or suffragettes in their whalebone corsets. Manitoba recently floated the idea of Terry Fox Day, named for the Winnipeg-born young man whose audacious goal, great courage and brief life galvanized the country just a generation ago.\n\nBurlington celebrates the great indian chief and warrior Joseph Brant. In Ottawa, it\u2019s Colonel By Day. In Guelph they pay tribute to John Galt, the Scottish Canadian novelist.\n\nAnd yet my favourite Civic Holiday celebration might just be Simcoe Day, celebrated in Toronto, Canada\u2019s favourite city. City council proclaimed Simcoe Day in 1969. It is named for John Graves Simcoe, a colonial war hero and a key figure in the fight to abolish slavery in Canada which, I\u2019m willing to wager, most of us didn\u2019t know about.\n\nSimcoe first came to notice as a British military officer who fought with valour in the Revolutionary War. In 1777 he tried to assemble a regiment of free black soldiers from Boston to fight the \u201crebels\u201d but instead was assigned to command the Queen's Rangers. Not long after he was wounded in the Battle of Brandywine, which is possibly the best name ever for a battle.\n\nLater he hatched a plan to capture the commander of the American forces, none other than George Washington. A year later he himself was captured. Eventually he was freed and would return to England to recuperate from injuries. But Simcoe wasn\u2019t done with the colonies.\n\nThe province of Upper Canada was established in 1791. Simcoe became lieutenant governor and, along with Attorney General John White, drafted the Act Against Slavery. Six of the 16 elected assemblymen in the Upper Canada legislature owned slaves. Three of the seven appointed members of the executive council were slave owners. Upper Canada didn\u2019t have tens of thousands of slaves, but those who had them were the people in power. And yet in 1793 Simcoe and White helped push through the Commonwealth\u2019s first anti-slavery legislation.\n\nYes, Simcoe was a remarkable man who left an indelible mark, which is a good reason to raise a glass in his memory. It seems there\u2019s a lot of history behind the blandly named Civic Holiday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Toronto Sun", "description": "In most of Canada the first Monday in August goes by that, ahem, inspiring name \u201cCivic Holiday.\u201d", "title": "Celebrating our Civic pride", "url": "http://www.torontosun.com/2014/08/01/celebrating-our-civic-pride?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Celebrating our Civic pride", "image": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297590182463_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464301688646", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "In most of Canada the first Monday in August goes by that, ahem, inspiring name \u201cCivic Holiday.\u201d", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "article_summary": "As far as I know there are no songs about family far from home dreaming wistfully about Civic Holiday.\nIt seems there\u2019s a lot of history behind the blandly named Civic Holiday.\nBut not all of our Civic Holiday heroes are the guys wearing mutton chops and powdered wigs or suffragettes in their whalebone corsets.\nAnd yet my favourite Civic Holiday celebration might just be Simcoe Day, celebrated in Toronto, Canada\u2019s favourite city.\nCivic Holiday stubbornly refuses to be pigeon-holed; it is consistently inconsistent."}
