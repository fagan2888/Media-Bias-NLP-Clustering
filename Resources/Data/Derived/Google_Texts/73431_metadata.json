In today\u2019s edition of Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer, however, Charles van der Horst, a retired Professor of Medicine at UNC, highlights what may well be the single most important reason: to save thousands of lives by demanding that state leaders expand close the Medicaid gap by accepting federal dollars to expand Medicaid coverage.\n\nHere\u2019s Dr. van der Horst:\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, I am rising early with other health care workers and students to carpool and bus to Raleigh, where we\u2019ll march once again down Jones Street for some old fashioned rabble-rousing.\n\nSince the ACA started, 31 states and DC have expanded Medicaid. Ten states led by conservative Republicans, initially vehemently opposed to Medicaid expansion, have reversed course. In three states where Republicans subsequently won governorship, they elected to continue the expansion. Two Republican-led states are in discussion to expand.\n\nThese leaders came to their senses when they realized the benefits in savings, the jobs created, the federal dollars flowing to their states instead of away, and the help to their citizens. When that many Republican governors and legislatures have expanded Medicaid, it is difficult to understand why McCrory, Senate Pro Tem Phil Berger and Speaker of the House Tim Moore have ignored the economic and health benefits to the state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "As was explained here earlier this week, there are lots of excellent reasons to bundle up and head to downtown Raleigh tomorrow morning.\nTen states led by conservative Republicans, initially vehemently opposed to Medicaid expansion, have reversed course.\nIn three states where Republicans subsequently won governorship, they elected to continue the expansion.\nSince the ACA started, 31 states and DC have expanded Medicaid.\nTwo Republican-led states are in discussion to expand."}
