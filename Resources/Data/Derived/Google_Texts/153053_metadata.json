PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) \u2014 As FIFA descends on St. Petersburg for the World Cup preliminary draw Saturday, it is entering the capital of a sponsorship empire.\n\nGovernment-controlled Russian gas company Gazprom is a huge presence in St. Petersburg, where it owns Russian champion football club Zenit and bases many of its roughly 400,000 staff. Entire streets in the historic center are lined with boards on lampposts reading: \u201cGazprom for the city.\u201d\n\nGazprom, whose boss Alexei Miller is a close political ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is almost as omnipresent in world football.\n\nIt is a major FIFA sponsor ahead of Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup, its logo prominent at the draw ceremony. With FIFA embroiled in scandal after the arrests of officials in May, some FIFA sponsors have criticized the organization and its president Sepp Blatter, but Gazprom has not. By sponsoring the Champions League, it has access to UEFA boss Michel Platini, the favorite to succeed Blatter.\n\nDespite spending an estimated $100 million a year to display its brand in some of world soccer\u2019s most desirable competitions, Gazprom doesn\u2019t sell directly to fans. Instead it specializes in vast energy supply, selling billions of cubic meters of Russian gas.\n\nAs a result, some suspect Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire may be an attempt to influence European political decision-making, or even a vanity project grown out of control.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re seeking to do is to influence countries,\u201d says Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports marketing at Britain\u2019s Coventry University. \u201cThey\u2019re seeking to influence the consumption of gas by countries, but they\u2019re also seeking to influence decisions around the distribution of gas.\u201d Sponsoring a club can give Gazprom public support in foreign countries while negotiating trade deals, as well as access to politicians, Chadwick argues.\n\nThe company holds a monopoly on all gas exports from Russia, giving it huge influence on world markets. However, it is often accused by European politicians of misusing that power to further the Russian government\u2019s political aims, including raising prices to put pressure on neighboring countries.\n\nAt World Cup and Champions League games, sponsors gain access to VIP hospitality areas which can contain major decision-makers such as the FIFA officials embroiled in disputes over Russia\u2019s right to host the 2018 World Cup, or club owners who may be major political players in their own right.\n\nUsing AC Milan\u2019s owner Silvio Berlusconi, a former Italian prime minister, as a hypothetical example, Chadwick outlined how he believes Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship could help the Russian government further political aims.\n\n\u201cRather than have to go up through normal diplomatic channels to negotiate with the Italian prime minister or even meet with the Italian prime minister, what you do is you sign a Champions League deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAC Milan plays in the Champions League and immediately you\u2019re in the corporate hospitality lounge of the club that\u2019s owned by Berlusconi. So I think it\u2019s about networking, it\u2019s about influence, it\u2019s about attempts to lobby.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "World Cup at center of Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire", "title": "World Cup at center of Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "World Cup at center of Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire", "title": "World Cup at center of Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/world_cup_at_center_of_gazproms_sponsorship_empire/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/russia-2018-world-cup-preliminary-draw.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "World Cup at center of Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire", "title": "World Cup at center of Gazprom\u2019s sponsorship empire", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/russia-2018-world-cup-preliminary-draw.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "James Ellingworth", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It is a major FIFA sponsor ahead of Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup, its logo prominent at the draw ceremony.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsST.
