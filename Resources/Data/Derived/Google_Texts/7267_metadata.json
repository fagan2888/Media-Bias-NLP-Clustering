The women then started to have much healthier children, and child mortality plunged.\u201d\n\nThat anecdote was the high point of a speech delivered by Secretary of State John Kerry in September at the 20-year reunion of the U.S. Delegation to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994. And Fatima\u2019s is only one of the poignant success stories told.\n\nHere are some of the statistical achievements revealed since 179 countries at the ICPD signed off on an agreement that promised to promote sustainable development, women\u2019s education/empowerment, and environmental enhancement:\n\n\u2022 Both infant and maternal deaths worldwide have been cut by 50 percent.\n\n\u2022 Sixty-one percent of married women ages 15-59 in the less developed world now use family planning.\n\n\u2022 The world population growth rate has fallen from 1.52 percent in 1995 to 1.15 percent projected in 2015.\n\nBut, as Kerry\u2019s anecdote indicates, numbers are only part of the story. In 1994, for the first time at an ICPD, leaders of non-governmental organizations (NGO) were included in every delegation. Their presence forced the delegates to hold firm to the principle of \u201cMake people count; don\u2019t just count people.\u201d\n\nHere are two of the hundreds of NGO achievements over the past two decades:\n\n\u2022 Thirteen African countries have now allowed injectable contraceptives to be administered by trained community health workers instead of doctors, vastly increasing usage.\n\n\u2022 According to the State Department: \u201cMarie Stopes International brings family planning services to women and men in 30,000 isolated urban shantytowns and remote rural locations in 26 countries, sometimes delivered by mule and camel train.\u201d\n\nVillagers who live on the remote shores of Tanzania\u2019s Lake Tanganyika face two interconnected crises: how to protect their health and the environment that they depend on for survival. Impoverished and without health care, women and infants are dying.\n\nTheir fish \u2014 the villages\u2019 livelihood and major food supply \u2014 are disappearing. Deforestation is a growing problem, as communities cut down trees in search of more firewood. This, in turn, forces Tanzania\u2019s last remaining chimpanzees from their home.\n\nYet, as I write, a turning point has been reached. \u201cTuungane\u201d \u2014 a multipronged project led by Pathfinder International, the Nature Conservancy and the Frankfurt Zoological Society \u2014 is partnering with these villagers. Their first job was to share knowledge with women on building latrines while ensuring that they finally have a choice about pregnancy.\n\nThe end result: Cholera disappears, babies live, mothers choose to use contraception to protect their own health and to devote their families\u2019 limited resources to the children they have. Villagers are empowered to live healthy lives in balance with their environment. And the fish population revives.\n\nA stove using minimal wood is introduced, so forest depletion is arrested. Chimpanzees are making a comeback.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to the story \u2026 in my next column.\n\nDottie Lamm (dolamm59@gmail. com) former first lady of Colorado, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the ICPD in Cairo in 1994.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lamm: 1994 Cairo pact helping with development, education  in developing countries", "title": "Lamm: 1994 Cairo pact helping with development, education  in developing countries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/12/lamm-1994-cairo-pact-helping-with-development-education-in-developing-countries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212__20141214_Z00_OP14C_LAMMp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212__20141214_Z00_OP14C_LAMMp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-12T10:34:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:43:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9958\"", "article_summary": "com) former first lady of Colorado, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the ICPD in Cairo in 1994.\n\u2022 Sixty-one percent of married women ages 15-59 in the less developed world now use family planning.\n\u2026 Fatima taught the women and the men about family planning \u2026 .\nIn 1994, for the first time at an ICPD, leaders of non-governmental organizations (NGO) were included in every delegation.\n\u2022 The world population growth rate has fallen from 1.52 percent in 1995 to 1.15 percent projected in 2015."}
