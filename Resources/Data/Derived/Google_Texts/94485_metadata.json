Other self-described patriots sneered, \u201cGeorge Washington wanted Obamacare, Pelosi says.\u201d And \u201cNo, Nancy, the Founding Fathers Would Not Have Supported Obamacare.\u201d Senators Rand Paul and Chris Coons penned a bipartisan op/ed for Politico Magazine titled: \u201cThe Founding Fathers Would Have Protected Your Smartphone.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast year a series of polls came out asking Americans if the Founding Fathers would be happy with the country today. A majority of Americans told pollsters these Framers would be disappointed.\n\n\n\nEven as we continue to debate what religion meant to the people who christened the country\u2014they now themselves have become a religion. And like all stern paternal deities, our Liberty Lords are frowning down on us because they know we can do better.\n\n\n\nNo one ever brings up Jesus\u2019 name when the 2000-year-old prophet would disagree with them. As in: \u201cJesus drank wine with hookers and outcasts, but as a Christian, I find that reprehensible.\u201d Jesus only gets used to corroborate personal conviction.\n\n\n\nAs an appeal to what we imagine to be our better selves we ask, \u201cWhat would Jesus do?\u201d And as Americans we\u2019re expected to ponder, \u201cWhat would the Founding Father\u2019s think?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first thing worth pointing out: there were a lot of Founding Fathers. It wasn\u2019t just guys with monuments in DC. Over 50 men signed the Articles of Association in 1774; another 56 men put their John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence (including John Hancock); and there were 40 signers of the Constitution. We\u2019ve never heard of most of these venerated sages.\n\n\n\nPop quiz: Gunning Bedford \u2013 punk band or Founding Father?\n\n\n\nThere are more than 140 men who meet the qualifications to be called a Founding Father in an era spanning 15 years (1774-1789). The framers were not a monolith then and certainly would never have a collective opinion about health care let alone about a smart phone. Our current Congress doesn\u2019t have a collective opinion about which day of the week it is, and our Supreme Court is uneasy about the 100-year-old technology of cameras filming them at work.\n\n\n\nThe Constitutional Convention was not a utopian Garden of Eden where demigods gathered to shape a nation that would become the best in the world. They were politicians and leaders in their community (read: mortals). They lived in a different time with different mores. They were not exactly for freedom (they owned slaves). They weren\u2019t exactly for democracy (women couldn\u2019t vote). They weren\u2019t exactly arbiters of human rights (Native Americans).\n\n\n\nThey also weren\u2019t exactly against the fiendish Big Government; they were Big Government. In 1791, George Washington quashed the Nation\u2019s first tax revolt, The Whiskey Rebellion, ended with four rebels killed by government troops. He\u2019s a hero to the modern tea party? Why?\n\n\n\nPresident number two, John Adams, also a Founding Father, joined the Federalists in Congress gleefully passing the Sedition Act which criminalized speech against the federal government. What Nazis.\n\n\n\nIf we were contemporaries of these mystical Founding Freedom Priests, we\u2019d have more complicated feelings about them. Just like we have about our modern presidents. No matter how much you like President Bill Clinton at this moment\u2014you were kind of sick of him in 1999. Dubya said history would judge him. Turns out he\u2019s not The Decider\u2014it\u2019s history. And history did wonders for Adams.\n\n\n\nThe Founding Fathers don\u2019t reside on Mount Olympus and, no, Independence Hall isn\u2019t in Valhalla (unless you think that\u2019s Philly).\n\n\n\nThese Fathers were just rebellious products of their era who had no idea if this experiment at self-governing would ever last.\n\n\n\nTo summon the thought of these men to give us pause in public discourse is to subscribe to the logical fallacy known as appeal to tradition. The Founders were into dueling (look on a $10 bill; the guy on it died in a duel as Founding Fathers Richard Dobbs Spaight and Button Gwinnett did). Why not bring back dueling? The Founding Fathers would be proud. Some of them at least. The Founding Fathers didn\u2019t believe in antibiotics! Or General Motors\u2019 safety! Or air travel! Or Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution!\n\n\n\nWhere does it stop? It really doesn\u2019t. Canonizing the men who founded the nation doesn\u2019t help discourse it just sanctifies history.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re better off humanizing than worshipping.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2014 TinaDupuy.com, distributed exclusively by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Aurora Sentinel", "description": "No one ever brings up Jesus' name when the 2000-year-old prophet would disagree with them.
