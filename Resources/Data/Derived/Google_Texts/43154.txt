I did not understand the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act that was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, so I analyzed it based on my paralegal knowledge from Brookdale Community College.

A subsection of the act on tax credits included the phrase “established by the State.” Clearly, the act allowed insurance exchanges to be established by either the states or the federal government. However, the plaintiffs argued that this phrase meant only exchanges “established by the State” qualified for tax credits.

Therefore, they argued, insurance exchanges established by the federal government would not qualify for tax credits. They did not care that millions of people who participated in the federal exchanges in 34 states would lose their subsidies and insurance coverage.

Justice Anthony Kennedy said the plaintiffs’ argument had a “serious constitutional problem” regarding states’ rights.

Here is my final summary and conclusion:

1. The act allows the states and the federal government to establish exchanges.

2. The states do not have to set up their own exchange; they can rely on federal exchanges instead.

3. However, if the states do use federal exchanges, Congress will say “Gotcha!”

4. This is because a hidden section of the act says only states can establish exchanges.

5. This is not logical. Why would the federal government give to the states with one hand, and take this away with the other?

6. Where are the states’ rights regarding the exchanges?

7. Accordingly, I believe the Supreme Court will: (a) do what is legally right, and (b) avoid disruption to millions of people by rejecting the challenge.
