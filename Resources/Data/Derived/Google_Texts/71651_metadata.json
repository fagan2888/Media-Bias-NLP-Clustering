The topline looks pretty good for the law\u2019s proponents, though the data is not without caveats.\n\nNearly 2.2 million people have selected plans from the state and federal marketplaces by Dec. 28, 2013 (the end of third reporting period for open enrollment), Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced today. A new HHS report provides the first demographic information about enrollees. December alone accounted for nearly 1.8 million enrollees in state and federal marketplaces. Enrollment in the federal Marketplace in December was seven-fold greater than the combined total for October and November \u2013 and eight-fold greater for young adults ages 18 to 34.\n\nRemember, this only refers to consumers who signed up for coverage through exchange marketplaces, and doesn\u2019t include another 3.8 million Americans who took advantage of Medicaid expansion or became insured through other \u201cObamacare\u201d provisions.\n\nAlso note, the White House assumed all along that enrollment would escalate quickly as Jan. 1 approached \u2013 and once healthcare.gov functionality was on track \u2013 which is precisely what happened.\n\nBut as we dig deeper into the latest figures, related questions arise. It\u2019s true, for example, that the 2.2 exchange enrollees are below the projected targets set before the open-enrollment period began. Then there are demographic concerns \u2013 about one-in-four enrollees are between the ages of 18 and 34, which isn\u2019t horrible, but it\u2019s a little below what the administration hoped for, and reinforces suspicions that it\u2019s older consumers who are the most eager to sign up.\n\nThat said, keep a few angles in mind.\n\nIn Massachusetts , according to analysis from MIT economist (and Obamacare architect) Jonathan Gruber, younger people tended to sign up later . The same thing seems to be happening in Colorado, one of the states that\u2019s kept close records on age. Sarah Kliff has that story at the Washington Post . And thanks in part to Obamacare\u2019s built-in shock absorbers \u2013 such as a \u2018 risk corridor\u2019 program that compensates insurers for greater-than-expected losses \u2013 the danger of low enrollment among young people isn\u2019t as great as commonly thought. As John Holahan , Urban Institute scholar and co-author of a report on the subject, told me recently, \u2018It\u2019s a problem if it goes on forever, but it\u2019s not a problem if it\u2019s just year one and if enrollment is improving over time \u2026 The system can handle it.\u2019\u201d First, I\u2019ve never been altogether convinced the demographic challenges matter that much, at least not at this phase. As Jonathan Cohn explained this afternoon, \u201cWashington Post\n\nSecond, by some independent estimates , enrollment totals at these levels reinforce the sustainability of the exchange marketplaces.\n\nAnd finally, if Republicans believe their repeal crusade can persevere going forward, they\u2019re living in fantasy land. It\u2019s genuinely absurd to think GOP candidates will spend the next 10 months telling the public, \u201cOur message to the millions of Americans who\u2019ve signed up for coverage is simple: vote Republican so we can strip you and your family of the ability to receive affordable health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "As of this afternoon, there are roughly 2.2 million reasons why the right-wing repeal crusade is gone -- and it's not coming back.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-enrollment-reaches-22-million", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "As of this afternoon, there are roughly 2.2 million reasons why the right-wing repeal crusade is gone -- and it's not coming back.", "title": "ACA enrollment reaches 2.2 million", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-enrollment-reaches-22-million", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/03930421.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-enrollment-reaches-22-million", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/03930421.jpg?itok=RUCLdHqz", "height": 553}, "title": "ACA enrollment reaches 2.2 million", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As of this afternoon, there are roughly 2.2 million reasons why the right-wing repeal crusade is gone -- and it's not coming back."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-13T17:00:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "ACA enrollment reaches 2.2 million", "published": 1, "date": "01/13/2014 17:00:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-enrollment-reaches-22-million"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "As of this afternoon, there are roughly 2.2 million reasons why the right-wing repeal crusade is gone -- and it's not coming back.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85d3\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s true, for example, that the 2.2 exchange enrollees are below the projected targets set before the open-enrollment period began.\nDecember alone accounted for nearly 1.8 million enrollees in state and federal marketplaces.\nNearly 2.2 million people have selected plans from the state and federal marketplaces by Dec. 28, 2013 (the end of third reporting period for open enrollment), Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced today.\nAs Jonathan Cohn explained this afternoon, \u201cWashington PostSecond, by some independent estimates , enrollment totals at these levels reinforce the sustainability of the exchange marketplaces.\nWe had a pretty good sense of ACA enrollment numbers shortly before New Year\u2019s, but the Obama administration fleshed out the details in a new report (pdf) this afternoon."}
