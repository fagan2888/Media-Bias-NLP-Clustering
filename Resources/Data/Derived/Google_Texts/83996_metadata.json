when uninsured people go to an emergency room, and the local taxpayer has to pick up the tab, \u2018Hey, right-wing Uncle Larry, why are you defending the socialist status quo?\u2019 That\u2019ll freak them out.\u201d\n\nWatch Schultz and Fugelsang\u2019s Thanksgiving tips, as aired Wednesday on MSNBC, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/John-Fugelsang-and-Ed-Schultz-have-tips-on-dealing-with-right-wing-relatives-MSNBC-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "John Fugelsang\u2019s advice: Tell conservative relatives Thanksgiving \u2018invented socialism for undocumented immigrants\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00cd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou can also point out that under Obamacare, we are now making people buy a corporation\u2019s private product \u2014 it\u2019s pretty much the opposite of socialism,\u201d Fugelsang argued.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be the liberal, you\u2019ve gotta be the good guy, you\u2019ve gotta be the peacemaker, you\u2019ve gotta go full-on Jimmy Carter.\u201dFugelsang also pointed out that a 2012 Forbes article showed Obama was in fact the smallest government spender since Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s administration, a bit of data to deploy against \u201csmall government\u201d advocates.\nJohn Fugelsang and Ed Schultz have tips on dealing with right-wing relatives [MSNBC]Comedian John Fugelsang had some advice for progressives dealing with conservative relatives at the Thanksgiving table this year, telling MSNBC host Ed Schultz that it takes a hearty helping of facts to minimize political squabbles.\n\u201cI think you might just want to blow their minds, Ed, and say that back at the first Thanksgiving, when the Wampanoag fed the Pilgrims, they didn\u2019t know it, but they had just invented socialism for undocumented immigrants,\u201d Fugelsang said.\nBut even if people have largely backed away from theories that Obama is a \u201csocialist muslim,\u201d Schultz and Fugelsang said, there were still likely to be relatives arguing that \u201cthe economy is still in the toilet\u201d despite recent heavy stock market gains."}
