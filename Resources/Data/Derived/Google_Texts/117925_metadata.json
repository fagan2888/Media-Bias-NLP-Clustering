It is simply recognition that shutting the bank is controversial and likely to produce a legislative fight at a time when Congress is anxious to get out of town in advance of the November mid-term elections.\n\nRelated: Small Biz COO \u2018Shocked\u2019 By GOP Position on Ex-Im Bank\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner late Tuesday announced that the bank\u2019s principal antagonist, House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), had agreed to back a six-month extension that will leave the bank in operation until the end of June 2015.\n\nAnother key Republican, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), has also bought in to the GOP criticism of the Ex-Im Bank. That argument holds that, by providing low-cost loans to the buyers of U.S. products and lending working capital to U.S. companies doing business overseas, the bank essentially offers a government subsidy to the firms it assists. In doing so, it takes away business from lenders who would otherwise be willing to offer credit to buyers on the open market.\n\nProponents of the bank say that there are two problems with this argument. First, they point out, most countries in the world have their own version of Ex-Im that offers trade financing to foreign buyers looking to buy their companies\u2019 products. Doing away with it, they say, would tilt the international playing field against U.S. exporters.\n\nRelated: McCarthy Rolls Over for Tea Party on Ex-Im Bank\n\nSecond, they claim, it is wrong to say that the free market would pick up the slack for the businesses that use the bank\u2019s services. While some deals, like the financing of Boeing jumbo jets, might be able to win the interest of a syndicate of large lenders, other deals the bank finances would not. Many of its clients do work in developing countries where conventional U.S. financial institutions have no presence and would therefore be unlikely to underwrite loans, at least at an affordable price.\n\nThe reprieve may do little more than guarantee a slow death for the bank, though, unless supporters can act quickly to push through legislation extending it further. Companies overseas that want to do business with U.S. firms aren\u2019t likely to be willing to sign on to deals that depend on a government agency that may not be around six months from now.\n\nKate Bernard, a managing director with DC-based public relations firm Hamilton Place Strategies, said that\u2019s why bank advocates are looking for a long-term deal. \u201cThe bottom line is that the goal is full multiyear authorization,\u201d she said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The deal being floated in Congress to approve a Continuing Resolution to fund the government and avoid another shutdown came with moderately good news for the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
