Brian Sandoval\u2019s proposed budget includes funding to hire about 100 additional correctional officers, at a cost of $7.5 million, based on a study by the Association of State Correctional Administrators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at minimum staffing,\u201d Cox told lawmakers. \u201cI really think and believe we\u2019re asking for something we\u2019ve desperately needed for years.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job, folks.\u201d\n\nNevada\u2019s average prison population of 12,739 in 2014 is projected to increase to 12,882 over the next two years. Cox warned that trying to forecast inmate population growth is tricky but that often it matches the pace of growth in the state\u2019s general population, as seen when Nevada boomed in 2007 before declining during the recession when people left the state to find jobs elsewhere.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s clear, we\u2019re starting to grow again. Certainly I hope the forecast is going to be accurate,\u201d Cox said.\n\nIn 2013, Nevada had 5,753 inmate admissions. Of those, 3,113 or 54 percent were new to the system; 23 percent were probation violators; and 16 percent were parole violators.\n\nSouthern Nevada Correctional Center, closed since 2007, is available if more beds are necessary but would carry a hefty price tag of $46 million to reopen and operate for two years, Cox said.\n\nSandoval\u2019s proposed $7.3 billion general fund budget includes $632 million for public safety, with a large chunk of that for corrections.\n\nBesides general inmate population growth, officials say the number of female inmates is pushing the limit on available beds. \u201cWe do have beds but will require staff to open those beds,\u201d Cox said.\n\nThe percentage of maximum- and medium-security inmates also is increasing, which means higher costs.\n\nAnother big cost factor is inmate hospitalization. Cox said Carson-Tahoe Regional Medical Center in Carson City is refusing to take inmates under Medicaid except emergency cases, forcing the state prisons in Nevada\u2019s capital city to take those prisoners to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno 30 miles away.\n\nUnder the federal health care law, inmates who require hospitalization for 24 hours or more are deemed to be Medicaid-eligible. Hospitals are re\u00adimbursed just a small fraction of their actual costs, a factor noted by state Sen. Ben Kieckhefer, R-Reno.\n\n\u201cIf the hospital can\u2019t make money nobody in the community gets health care,\u201d Kieckhefer said. \u201cThe bottom line is we don\u2019t pay a decent Medicaid rate for them to have 20 percent of their patients on Medicaid.\u201d\n\nEd Epperson, president and CEO of Carson Tahoe Health, echoed Kieckhefer\u2019s observation in a statement late Tuesday. He said the Department of Corrections previously covered inmates through a private insurer, but under the Affordable Care Act switched them to Medicaid, a move the state said would save $5 million.\n\n\u201cIn reality it was shifting the cost of inmate health care to hospitals and the federal government,\u201d Epperson said. \u201cOur small community cannot bear the medical care cost of the state\u2019s prison system, only receiving reimbursement for a mere 10 percent of charges.\u201d\n\nCorrections officials Tuesday also said they will ask lawmakers to rein in public records requests filed by inmates.\n\n\u201cWe have inmates asking for other inmate records,\u201d Cox said. Others have asked for facility staffing records, details on meals served in recent years and the number of copies made on a particular copy machine.\n\n\u201cA lot of inmate requests are just for harassment,\u201d Deputy Director Scott Sisco told reporters.\n\nContact Sandra Chereb at schereb@reviewjournal.com or 775-687-3901.
