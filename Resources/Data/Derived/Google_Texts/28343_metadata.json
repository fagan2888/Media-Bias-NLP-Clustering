New London. Unfortunately, the new law provides property owners with little additional protection from condemnation.\n\nThe law purports to do two things: first, codify a 2007 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling favorable to property owners and, second, decouple eminent domain from redevelopment subsidies. It fails miserably at both.\n\nWhen local officials declare that an area is blighted and \u201cin need of redevelopment,\u201d the designation both allows them to offer economic development incentives and authorizes the use of eminent domain. But sometimes officials honestly don\u2019t want to seize anyone\u2019s property; they just want the ability to offer subsidies to developers.\n\nBut officials cannot credibly promise not to condemn property once it has been declared blighted. Officials can change their minds. And the next city council isn\u2019t bound by past promises. Every redevelopment area is thus under constant threat of eminent domain\u2014intended or not.\n\nDecoupling the incentives from condemnation would remove the threat. And the law appears to do just that, allowing for the creation of \u201cnon-condemnation redevelopment areas.\u201d But the law lets officials transform a non-condemnation area into a condemnation area if property owners refuse to sell.\n\nWTF, New Jersey.\n\nThe law also muddies the issue of blight.\n\nIn Gallenthin v. Paulsboro, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that before cities can seize property for private development, officials must show \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d the property is blighted.\n\nPrior to Gallenthin, municipal officials could claim a variety of vague, subjective conditions like \u201cfaulty arrangement or design,\u201d \"excessive land coverage,\u201d or \u201cobsolete layouts\u201d could justify a blight designation. In Gallenthin, officials argued the mere fact that they could imagine a better use for the property in question, an undeveloped field, meant it was \"underutilized\" and that they could seize it.\n\nThe high court ruled, however, that it would be unconstitutional to seize property without clear, quantitative evidence of a property\u2019s malign influence on surrounding areas.\n\nThe new law, instead of codifying the court's \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, restates the old, vague conditions for blight. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling trumps the statute, the section of the law dealing with blight is probably moot on arrival. But property owners will likely be forced into litigation when local officials decide to make sure.\n\nSome clarification is clearly necessary. Officials in Harrison Township recently tried to declare the house pictured above\u2014and others in a similar state of decrepitude\u2014blighted. (They backed off after outraged owners and their neighbors protested.)\n\nIn another sneaky bit of nastiness, the new statute gives property owners only 45 days to challenge a blight declaration. So if a city files for condemnation five years after declaring a neighborhood blighted, owners cannot argue that their property isn\u2019t blighted\u2014unless they had the foresight to challenge the designation years in advance of a taking that was at that point only a distant, uncertain possibility.\n\nIs the law an absurdity that won\u2019t survive a court challenge\u2014or a serious invitation to more eminent domain abuse? It\u2019s hard to say.
