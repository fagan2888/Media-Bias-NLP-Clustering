The Las Vegas oddsmakers have made the Broncos a slight favorite, though the pointspread will fluctuate and could be around even by kickoff; this shows how close the game is expected to be. The two teams did not play in the regular season.\n\nOutsports\n\nThis will be the \u201cnewest\u201d Super Bowl in years in terms of players in their first game. Only four of Denver\u2019s 53 players have been in the Super Bowl before \u2013 quarterback Peyton Manning, receivers Wes Welker and Jacob Tamme and corner Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie \u2013 and none of Seattle\u2019s have any Super Bowl experience. This is the first time since the 1990 Buffalo Bills that a team has all Super Bowl virgins.\n\nBUD BOWL: The game matches two teams located in states that have legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington. Super Bowl 420, the Weed Eater Bowl \u2026 insert your pot pun here.\n\nWHERE: The game is being played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., though technically the host city is New York. Both teams are staying in Jersey City, so don\u2019t expect a lot of late nights in Manhattan for the players. Rest assured, no A-list parties will be held in Jersey City.\n\nWEATHER: The big news about the location is that it\u2019s the first time a game is being played in a cold weather climate in a non-covered stadium. The forecast for game time (6:30 p.m. local) is for the temperature in the mid-20s with a chance of snow showers, which would make it the coldest Super Bowl game ever. I think it\u2019s a terrible idea to hold the game outdoors in a cold climate, since weather should not be a determining factor once the conference playoffs are over. But hosting a Super Bowl was an inducement the NFL offered the New York Jets and Giants for building MetLife Stadium.\n\nKICKOFF/TV: The kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. EST, shortly after opera soprano Renee Fleming sings the National Anthem. She is the first opera singer to perform the song at the Super Bowl. Friend of Outsports and my source for all things opera, Jim Allen, has this to say about Fleming:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s marketed in the opera world as a sophisticated but unpretentious, non-Diva singer who just happens to be one of the most popular opera singers in the world. She\u2019s recorded albums of standards and of pop tunes, she\u2019s even been on Letterman to do a Top 10 list.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll show up, do her job, collect her paycheck and go home, no diva antics for her. She\u2019ll do OK with that ghastly song, at least she won\u2019t take five minutes to sing it like that horror at the 49ers-Seahawks game.\u201d\n\nThe game will be broadcast on Fox, with Joe Buck calling the play-by-play and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman doing the analysis. Every time Aikman calls a Super Bowl, we get a bunch of Google searches for \u201cIs Troy Aikman gay?\u201d For the record, I have no idea.\n\nWhat I do know is that Fox is by far my least-favorite NFL broadcast network. Buck is a pedestrian play-by-play guy and Aikman is a master of stating the obvious. Fox seldom uses graphics properly and spends way more time than the other networks inserting promos that are superimposed over the game. Expect many shots of whatever actor/actress is appearing on a Fox show. Plus, Cletus the Robot needs to be deprogrammed.\n\nFASHION NOTE: Denver is the home team and will wear orange jerseys with white pants. The Seahawks will wear their white away jerseys with navy pants with a neon green stripe. It will be a good contrast on TV.\n\nSHIRTLESS FASHION NOTE: Denver wide receiver Eric Decker and his wife, country singer Jessie James, have a reality show on E! They also did a photo spread for GQ magazine they featured a lot of him shirtless, which garnered zero complaints from our readers.\n\n\n\nGQ says Decker\u2019s jeans are made of \u201cdistressed denim.\u201d They also cost $215 a pair, which would totally leave me distressed if I had to pay that.\n\nDecker also has cut an ad for Axe hair gel, where he looks great in a suit.\n\nNICKNAMES: The Seattle defense is called the \u201cLegion Of Boom\u201d for its hard hitting and its master of ceremonies is cornerback Richard Sherman, who is loud and has the talent to back it up. Seattle\u2019s running back Marshawn Lynch can kick it into a gear that makes him impossible to tackle; they call it \u201cBeast Mode.\u201d When Lynch ran for a 67-yard touchdown in a 2010 playoff game against New Orleans, the crowd got so loud it registered on the Richter scale.\n\nDenver\u2019s 300-pound defensive lineman Terrence Knighton is nicknamed \u201cPot Roast,\u201d a name he got while playing in Jacksonville after he opted for pot roast over shrimp alfredo on a team flight.\n\nSUGAR HIGH: Lynch loves Skittles, and Seattle fans shower the field with them when he scores.\n\nINSPIRATIONAL: Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman is the league\u2019s first legally deaf player. He reads lips to understand plays and does not move until he sees the ball snapped.\n\nTRAIL OF TEARS: Broncos running back Knowshon Moreno can cry better than anyone in the NFL. \u201cNot uncommon at all,\u201d he told Sports Illustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that way for me, all the way back to high school and college.\u201d This video of him this season in a game at Kansas City went viral:\n\nQUARTERBACKS: Russell Wilson is Seattle\u2019s second-year quarterback, ultra-polite off the field and heavily engaged in charity. He seems like a very nice person. His Denver counterpart is \u2026 hmmm \u2026 need to look it up. Somebody called \u201cPeyton Manning.\u201d\n\nThe Papa John\u2019s and Buick pitchman set the NFL record this year for touchdown passes and yards thrown in a season. Manning drives to each home game in a Buick (naturally) with teammates Eric Decker and Jacob Tamme. Before the AFC Championship Game, Tamme said they listened to love songs on the radio on the drive over. \u201cBeautiful stuff,\u201d Tamme said. How cute.\n\nWilson, 25, is 12 years younger than Manning, and as a young player attended the quarterback camp Manning and his family run. \u201cI love him to death,\u201d Wilson says of Manning. Geez, we have a game where both teams seem to really like each other; what fun is that?\n\nOn the field, the quarterbacks are a total contrast. Wilson is young and mobile, capable of keeping plays alive with his athleticism. At the same time, he can be inaccurate and prone to making mistakes befitting a second-year player. In comparison, Manning moves like a statue but he makes up for it with a very quick release and a savant-like ability to figure out what the defense is about to do.\n\nThe way the two calls plays is also illustrative of youth vs. experience. Wilson gets his plays called in by offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, with limited ability to change the call. Manning gets two plays suggested to him by coordinator Adam Gase based on the game situation and he gets to pick one or change to something different depending on what he sees the defense do before the snap.\n\nOMAHA! During the game, listen to the sound on the field when Denver has the ball. Manning will yell out codes that could either be a play or dummy signals to fool the defense. His favorite is \u201cOmaha,\u201d which he has used 60 times in the playoffs. It usually has to do with when to hike the ball, but not every time, so teams are best to ignore it. The people in Omaha, Neb., love it though, and locals raised $25,000 for Manning\u2019s charity after he said it numerous times in the AFC title game. Manning can also be heard saying \u201cMarshall\u201d in honor of one of his young twin sons, or \u201cHurry, Hurry!\u201d to get the play run quickly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No, gay men don't only love award shows.
