Hundreds lined both sides of 23rd street from Walmart to the Chick-Fil-A for the 28th annual Life Chain.

Life Chain is a national movement that takes place during the first Sunday of October.

The event honors millions of babies that have lost their lives to abortion.

Organizers say this was the largest life chain so far in Bay County, but not everyone was supporting a pro-life message.

"I was actually driving by and I watched them line up and my heart stopped for anyone that had ever gotten an abortion because it's just wrong to judge someone," Charity Herron, a pro-choice activist said, "I posted something on Facebook and a bunch of people commented back and we decided it's our turn to speak our voice."

"Obviously abortion is a difficult issue that we are taking a stand against," Fr. Michael Nixon, the Pastor of St. Dominic Catholic Church in Panama City explained. "We do that not by being against something but by being for something and we are for life and for unborn babies, we are also for women and children and families."

Organizers of the Bay County Life Chain said there were more than 300 people lining 23rd street Sunday afternoon.
