The top skills tech companies are looking for are (drum roll please):\n\n\u2022 Windows administration\n\n\u2022 Wireless network management\n\n\u2022 Desktop support\n\nThe report tallies up results of 100 Denver-area technology executives response to Robert Half about hiring expectations for the rest of 2015.\n\nIn speaking to Dan McMahon, branch manager for the Denver office, he said that the hot industries are software development (full stack and mobile), big data and IT security.\n\n\u201cThe hottest hiring right now is in software development \u2014 your full stack, .NET development and mobile,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing anything with Big Data, anyone who is doing anything with business intelligence. And third, IT security.\u201d\n\nSome more Denver factoids:\n\n\u2022 91 percent of CIOs plan to hire in the next 6 months to fill vacated positions or expand.\n\n\u2022 50 percent report that it\u2019s a challenge to find skilled IT workers.\n\n\u2022 21 percent plan to expand their IT teams.\n\nSecurity companies have thrived. Just this week, Broomfield\u2019s Webroot reported strong third quarter growth thanks to small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nMcMahon said that all companies are becoming proactive about security, especially with the spate of security breaches at retailers.\n\n\u201cCompanies are being a little more proactive and making sure there is intrusion and penetration detection. Instead of spending money on this after something happens and there is data loss, they are finding it costs less to be proactive,\u201d McMahon said.\n\nThe report: Robert Half Technology IT Hiring Forecast and Local Trends Report for Denver.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "big data,CIO,Denver,mobile,robert half,security,survey,tech jobs", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "Staffing agency's survey reveals top tech jobs in Denver | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/06/04/staffing-agencys-survey-reveals-top-tech-jobs-in-denver/17400/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/06/June2015jobs.jpg?fit=495%2C413", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "Staffing agency\u2019s survey reveals top tech jobs in Denver", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/06/04/staffing-agencys-survey-reveals-top-tech-jobs-in-denver/17400/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/06/June2015jobs.jpg?fit=495%2C413", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver-area tech companies are more optimistic about hiring this year.
