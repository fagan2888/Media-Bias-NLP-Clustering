And it continues to be my goal as chair of the committee backing Proposition AA, the measure on this November\u2019s ballot that will set statewide excise and sales taxes on marijuana.\n\nWhile the 15 percent excise tax fulfills the promise of Amendment 64 by providing tens of millions of dollars annually for public school construction, the true import of the measure is ensuring that there are sufficient funds to enforce the regulations that will govern the cultivation and sale of marijuana in Colorado.\n\nProposition AA will raise the revenue needed for this regulatory oversight through a 10 percent sales tax on marijuana products. Compared to the state of Washington, which also passed an initiative to regulate marijuana last November and will impose a 25 percent tax on marijuana sales, this 10 percent figure is quite reasonable. It is also fair to the citizens of Colorado, since it ensures that marijuana users who take advantage of the regulated market will in essence be providing the funds needed to maintain it.\n\nThis is the responsible path. Through regulations, we are able to provide consumer protections, such as tracking, testing and labeling. We also protect our communities by diminishing the likelihood of marijuana being diverted out of the system.\n\nWe recently witnessed a spectacle in Civic Center in Denver, during which opponents of Proposition AA gave away free marijuana joints as a way of encouraging more people to oppose the measure. One of the organizers even falsely presented himself as a \u201cco-drafter\u201d of Amendment 64, in order to give the event \u2014 or perhaps himself \u2014 more credibility.\n\nIn reality, Amendment 64 campaign leaders like myself strongly support Proposition AA. It is consistent with the ballot title of Amendment 64, which began, \u201cShall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution \u2026 providing for the regulation of marijuana?\u201d\n\nThe people of Colorado responded affirmatively. And now, Proposition AA will provide the funding needed to regulate the system.\n\nIt is easy for activists to rile up a crowd with calls for no marijuana taxes, especially when they provide free marijuana. But it is not the responsible path.\n\nWe are at a turning point in U.S. history. While not everyone reading this column will have voted for Amendment 64 last November, my hope is that a growing number of Coloradans are beginning to appreciate that having marijuana cultivated and sold by regulated, taxpaying businesses is preferable to having those activities conducted underground, with profits flowing to drug cartels.\n\nEven the U.S. Department of Justice is now on record acknowledging this benefit. In a memo issued by Deputy Attorney General James Cole last month, detailing how the federal government will respond to the marijuana measures passed in Colorado and Washington, he wrote that a \u201crobust\u201d system of regulations could address federal enforcement priorities by \u201creplacing an illicit marijuana trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for.\u201d\n\nBut the U.S. Department of Justice was not giving Colorado carte blanche to move forward with its regulated system. Rather, the memo provided a stern warning that the federal government would be monitoring the state to ensure that there were \u201cnecessary resources\u201d to enforce the regulations that exist.\n\nThe acknowledgment of the benefits of regulating marijuana is a dramatic shift by federal law enforcement officials, and we are grateful for the respect they have given our state and its voters. In return, we are firmly committed to respecting their concerns by ensuring that the necessary resources they desire are available. This is not only the responsible thing to do, but it is also the intelligent thing to do.\n\nPlease join me in voting \u201cyes\u201d on Proposition AA so that Colorado can regulate marijuana responsibly.\n\nBrian Vicente is partner at Vicente Sederberg LLC and chair of the Committee for Responsible Regulation.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado marijuana sales tax, Proposition AA, would regulate marijuana responsibly", "title": "Colorado marijuana sales tax, Proposition AA, would regulate marijuana responsibly", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/26/colorado-marijuana-sales-tax-proposition-aa-would-regulate-marijuana-responsibly/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130925__marijuanap1-8.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130925__marijuanap1-8.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-26T18:04:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:28:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd253a\"", "article_summary": "Proposition AA will raise the revenue needed for this regulatory oversight through a 10 percent sales tax on marijuana products.\nPlease join me in voting \u201cyes\u201d on Proposition AA so that Colorado can regulate marijuana responsibly.\nAnd now, Proposition AA will provide the funding needed to regulate the system.\nIn reality, Amendment 64 campaign leaders like myself strongly support Proposition AA.\nAnd it continues to be my goal as chair of the committee backing Proposition AA, the measure on this November\u2019s ballot that will set statewide excise and sales taxes on marijuana."}
