Aurora Health Care has hired Olson, an advertising agency that has done work for Target, General Mills and MillerCoors, as its agency of record.

The agency, based in Minneapolis, will work with Aurora on strategy, advertising, media, digital, social media and public relations, according to a news release from Olson.

"Digital innovation in health care is moving at an astounding rate, and it was critical for us to find an agency with the expertise to leverage those changes in a manner that helps us better reach and serve our patients," Michael Brophy, Aurora's chief communications officer and chief of staff, said a statement. "Olson's combination of compelling creative and digital and strategic expertise set it apart."
