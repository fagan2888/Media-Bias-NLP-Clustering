“The pope is by his own words a Peronist," says Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News' Senior Judicial Analyst. "He is probably also a communist and a Marxist, who does believe the government ought to control and motivate the means of production and means of distribution.”

As both a devout Catholic and principled libertarian, Napolitano believes Jesus Christ would reject the pope's view of economics. "The essence of libertarianism is the primacy of the individual over the state and absolute freedom of the individual to make his or her own choices," Napolitano explains. "That's also the teachings of Jesus Christ: 'I have come to set you free.'"

In a conversation with Reason's Editor in Chief, Matt Welch, the Judge discusses his frustrations with Pope Francis on the eve of his first Papal visit to the United States. Napolitano takes issue with the pope's exhortations on economic issues and Catholic tradition when it comes to allowing marriage annulments and permitting priests to forgive abortion.

“Speeding up annulments…is a rejection of his papal role,” says Napolitano. “He has assaulted matrimony. For him to make annulments easier is a backdoor towards permitting divorce.”
