Those are headlines worthy of attention. They reinforce a partisan notion that Ted Cruz is one crazy Republican \u2014 and not only that, he beckons the tears of children. So if you\u2019re writing a headline and you\u2019re on the fence . . . you just roll with the report that Ted Cruz frightened the bejeezus out of some mom\u2019s poor young child. It\u2019s just too good. Right-wing nut makes kid bawl. Yeah. That\u2019ll do it.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened this weekend. Cruz spoke to a gathering in New Hampshire, breaking out some of his greatest hits (the Obama economy is \u201ca disaster,\u201d and Obamacare \u201ca trainwreck\u201d). He concluded, emphatically, that \u201cthe whole world is on fire.\u201d\n\n3-year-old Julia, in attendance with her mother, spoke up in a high-pitched voice: \u201cThe world is on fire?\u201d\n\nThe audience laughed. Cruz played along for a few moments and declared, \u201cYour mommy\u2019s here and everyone\u2019s here to make sure the world you grow up in is better.\u201d\n\nThe crowd applauded. Sometime afterward, news reports from the event used variations on the headlines mentioned above, and the incident was tweeted to the same effect. According to Julia\u2019s mother, however, her daughter had no such reaction.\n\n\u201c[She] was quite happy, and then she wanted a cookie,\u201d the mother, Michelle Trant, told Boston talk radio personality Jeff Kuhner.\n\nShe added that she talked to a Washington Post reporter after the event, and was unsure how word got out that Julia was emotionally devastated.\n\nAlways remember: The headline might be going just a bit too far.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Always remember: The headline might be going just a bit too far.", "title": "Mother says Ted Cruz did not make her young daughter cry - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/Ted-Cruz-600x367.jpg", "height": 367}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/03/16/mother-says-ted-cruz-not-make-young-daughter-cry/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "ted-cruz", "published_time": "2015-03-16T18:46:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T18:46:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf33b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe World Is On Fire!\u201d: Ted Cruz\u2019s Speech Terrifies 3-Year-Old Girl, Ted Cruz Scares Little Girl: \u2018Your World Is on Fire\u2019, WATCH: Ted Cruz scares young girl with fiery N.H. speech.\nThey reinforce a partisan notion that Ted Cruz is one crazy Republican \u2014 and not only that, he beckons the tears of children.\nyou just roll with the report that Ted Cruz frightened the bejeezus out of some mom\u2019s poor young child.\nCruz spoke to a gathering in New Hampshire, breaking out some of his greatest hits (the Obama economy is \u201ca disaster,\u201d and Obamacare \u201ca trainwreck\u201d).\nTed Cruz startles 3 year old with \u2018world on fire\u2019 comment is an accurate if relatively bland headline, meaning that it\u2019s less likely to get clicked than something eye-catching like ."}
