Brandy Angel Photography\n\nOn May 1, 2015, 8-year-old Lake Bozman lost his long battle with acute myeloid leukemia, but thanks to the skills of Georgia-based photographer Brandy Angel, he was still able to take part in his parents\u2019 wedding months later.\n\nThis past year, Lake\u2019s mother, Anna Bozman Thompson, married long-time boyfriend Travis Thompson. According to Anna, although she was able to feel her son\u2019s presence on her wedding day, it was difficult to take family pictures without him.\n\n\u201cI could feel my emotions taking over after the ceremony when it was time to take pictures. I became anxious and almost irritated, but I knew these pictures had to be taken,\u201d Anna shared in a Facebook post.\n\nSo, she asked Angel to superimpose an old image of him on the new wedding photos, which Angel achieved by blending a family portrait taken months earlier with the wedding shot.\n\n\u201cI needed this picture more than she or anyone could ever know,\u201d Anna told UK's The Times. \u201cThis is my family. And we will be together again.\u201d\n\nThe heart-touching photos have since gone viral, with Angel remarking that at one point they were trending even more than the Kardashians, USA Today reported. Angel believes that so many people are moved by the touching image because we\u2019ve all lost someone along the way.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Angel has helped families dealing with sickness and tragedy through her photography. She has helped others receive life-saving organ donations and granted dying wishes all with the power of her images. Last year she started a nonprofit foundation, Be The Change-Brandy Angel Foundation, to help further her efforts.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wedding, photographer, brandy, angel, honors, couples, son, who, died, cancer, viral, images", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Georgia-based photographer superimposed the image of a couple's deceased son in their wedding photos.", "title": "Family Honors Son Who Died Of Cancer By Including Him In Wedding Photos", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/wedding-photographer-brandy-angel-honors-couples-son-who-died-cancer-viral-images-360384", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/11/05/thompson.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Georgia-based photographer superimposed the image of a couple's deceased son in their wedding photos.", "title": "Family Honors Son Who Died Of Cancer By Including Him In Wedding Photos", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/wedding-photographer-brandy-angel-honors-couples-son-who-died-cancer-viral-images-360384", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/11/05/thompson.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/05/thompson.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-05T11:27:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-05T11:34:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Georgia-based photographer superimposed the image of a couple's deceased son in their wedding photos."}, "article_summary": "Photographer Brandy Angel was able to help a couple heal by including their deceased son in their wedding photographs.\nBrandy Angel PhotographyOn May 1, 2015, 8-year-old Lake Bozman lost his long battle with acute myeloid leukemia, but thanks to the skills of Georgia-based photographer Brandy Angel, he was still able to take part in his parents\u2019 wedding months later.\nI became anxious and almost irritated, but I knew these pictures had to be taken,\u201d Anna shared in a Facebook post.\nAccording to Anna, although she was able to feel her son\u2019s presence on her wedding day, it was difficult to take family pictures without him.\nSo, she asked Angel to superimpose an old image of him on the new wedding photos, which Angel achieved by blending a family portrait taken months earlier with the wedding shot."}
