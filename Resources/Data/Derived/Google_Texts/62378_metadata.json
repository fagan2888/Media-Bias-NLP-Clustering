Of the Fortune 1000 list of companies, just 35 have a woman as CEO, and about 14% of the executive officers at Fortune 500 companies are women.\n\nAnd that\u2019s despite women making up 46% of the U.S. labor force, and 51.5% of all management, professional and related occupations.\n\nWith all that being said, the trend is moving in the right direction, although slower than many hoped. Europe has made the most progress, with almost 30% of its corporates having three or more women on their board, according to a paper released this month by David F. Larcker and Brian Tayan at the Stanford School of Business:\n\nStanford Graduate School of Business\n\nSo what better way to recognize that progress than by recognizing the women who made it happen before anyone else? In that spirit, this week\u2019s pop quiz: What was the first corporation in America to have a female board member? And who was she?\n\nLarcker and Tayan say they have the answer. When you\u2019re ready to check it out, read on\u2026.\n\nVia their paper, which is available to read here (PDF):\n\nSome sources claim that Lettie Pate Whitehead was the first female to serve on the board of a major corporation. Whitehead\u2019s husband founded the first Coca-Cola bottler; she herself managed the bottler following his death and in 1934 was invited to join the board of the Coca-Cola Company as its first female director. However, the first female director in our sample predates Whitehead. Clara Abbott, wife of founder Wallace Abbott, served two terms on the board of Abbott Laboratories from 1900 to 1908 and from 1911 to 1924\u2014although the company was not yet publicly listed at the time.\n\nSee also:\n\nMore Women Are Primed to Land CEO Roles \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A paper out this month from the Stanford Graduate School of Business takes a look at the women who pioneered participation at the highest level of American corporate life", "title": "Friday Pop Quiz: Which Company Had the First Female Board Member?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/13/friday-pop-quiz-which-company-had-the-first-female-board-member/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-BY042_SKYBOX_G_20130822191407.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Friday Pop Quiz: Which Company Had the First Female Board Member?", "description": "A paper out this month from the Stanford Graduate School of Business takes a look at the women who pioneered participation at the highest level of American corporate life", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "A paper out this month from the Stanford Graduate School of Business takes a look at the women who pioneered participation at the highest level of American corporate life", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-13T23:04:50-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/13/friday-pop-quiz-which-company-had-the-first-female-board-member/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-2338", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A paper out this month from the Stanford Graduate School of Business takes a look at the women who pioneered participation at the highest level of American corporate life", "title": "Friday Pop Quiz: Which Company Had the First Female Board Member?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/13/friday-pop-quiz-which-company-had-the-first-female-board-member/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-BY042_SKYBOX_G_20130822191407.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-2338", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-13T23:09:00-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce79f\"", "article_summary": "In that spirit, this week\u2019s pop quiz: What was the first corporation in America to have a female board member?\nDespite decades of awareness that the corporate world needs to do a better job of opening its upper management to women, female representation still trails off dramatically the higher you get in the corporate pyramid.\nVia their paper, which is available to read here (PDF):Some sources claim that Lettie Pate Whitehead was the first female to serve on the board of a major corporation.\nClara Abbott, wife of founder Wallace Abbott, served two terms on the board of Abbott Laboratories from 1900 to 1908 and from 1911 to 1924\u2014although the company was not yet publicly listed at the time.\nWhitehead\u2019s husband founded the first Coca-Cola bottler; she herself managed the bottler following his death and in 1934 was invited to join the board of the Coca-Cola Company as its first female director."}
