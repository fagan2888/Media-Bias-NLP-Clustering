Co-hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” mocked The New York Times on Wednesday, saying the paper’s piece on Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio’s so-called “luxury speedboat” purchase is “a reach.”

“Now that I’ve seen the boat, I’ve changed my mind. It’s new money. I think I saw that boat on ‘Entourage,’ ” co-host Mika Brzezinski said sarcastically, The Daily Caller reported.

“It’s a 240-foot yacht!” co-host Joe Scarborough joked. “Oh wait a second, it’s a 24-foot fishing boat.”

“The New York Times is discrediting themselves with this story — as people who have never gone fishing,” said The Blaze’s Amy Holmes. “I mean, to call that boat a luxury speedboat is absurd.”

“No fisherman in America would call that a ‘luxury’ — that’s what you get to load your family up and go out fishing if you live if a place like, I don’t know, Miami?” said Mr. Scarborough, who represented Florida’s 1st District from 1995 until his resignation in 2001. “By the way, anybody that’s ever lived in Florida and bought a boat knows that you can buy it over, like, 20 years.”

“I don’t think there is a lot of deep-sea fishing at The New York Times,” said co-anchor Willie Geist. “$80,000 is not nothing, but if you call it a luxury speedboat, it makes people think he’s on a yacht owned perhaps by some other candidates.”

“I think candidates’ finances are fair game, and we do it to all candidates. But when you read through this, it feels a bit like a reach,” he said.

Mr. Scarborough argued: “If this is all The New York Times and Marco’s opponents have on Marco, Marco is doing pretty well right now.”

“Yikes,” Ms. Brzezinski added.
