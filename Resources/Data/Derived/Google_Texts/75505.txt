United Airlines on Friday said it has a tentative deal to combine more than 8,600 maintenance workers from United and the former Continental Airlines under one contract, a step toward improving the carrier’s rocky labor relations.

The deal with the Teamsters would immediately boost top pay by 25 percent, to an industry-leading $46.15 per hour, and result in 33 percent higher pay by the end of the six-year contract, said Don Wright, United’s vice president of maintenance operations. It would also pay workers $100,000 to take early retirement and create an $80 million pool for signing bonuses.

The Teamsters represented mechanics at both airlines before the 2010 merger that created United Continental Holdings Inc.
