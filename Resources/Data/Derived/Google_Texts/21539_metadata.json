More than 800,000 people have fled, according to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThere are some who don\u2019t want Muslims in this country,\u201d Prime Minister Andre Nzapayeke said on local radio Saturday. \u201cBut when the Muslims have left the country, what happens next? The Protestants will throw out the Catholics, and then the Baptists against the Evangelists, and finally the animists? It is time we regain control and stop ourselves from plunging into an abyss.\u201d\n\nThousands of Muslims left Bangui in a massive convoy Friday that was jeered by crowds of Christians. One Muslim who fell off a truck was quickly killed by the mob. Muslim women who could not get on the trucks tried to hand their children to strangers aboard the vehicles.\n\nNo one knows the true death toll from two months of the worst inter-communal violence in this country\u2019s history: It is often too dangerous for crews to recover the corpses. More than 1,000 were killed in early December, when a Christian militia attempted to overthrow the Muslim rebel government then in power.\n\nBabacar Gaye, the U.N.\u2019s special representative to the Central African Republic, has called for the murderers to be held accountable. Yet in a country where police officers long ago fled their jobs and courthouses are shuttered and looted, it\u2019s not even clear where to begin.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Future of Central African Republic\u2019s Muslims imperiled", "title": "Future of Central African Republic\u2019s Muslims imperiled", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/future-of-central-african-republics-muslims-imperiled/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__20140209_A16_ND09CENTRALAFRICAp1.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__20140209_A16_ND09CENTRALAFRICAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T18:30:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:40:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Babacar Gaye, the U.N.\u2019s special representative to the Central African Republic, has called for the murderers to be held accountable.\nDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 The mob violence wracking Central African Republic imperils the future of the country\u2019s Muslims, with tens of thousands fleeing the violence and untold numbers killed.\n\u201cOtherwise, the future of the Muslim community of this country will be gone.\u201dMuslims make up about 15 percent of Central African Republic\u2019s 4.6 million people.\nBangui, the capital, is engulfed in an orgy of bloodshed and looting despite the presence of thousands of French and African peacekeepers.\n\u201cThere are some who don\u2019t want Muslims in this country,\u201d Prime Minister Andre Nzapayeke said on local radio Saturday."}
