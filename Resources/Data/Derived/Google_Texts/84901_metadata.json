These include being wary of strong shore breaks and rip currents, along with identifying which beaches have lifeguard towers.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we have all collaborated and made a brochure like this,\u201d Ocean Safety Supervisor Cary Kayama said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to figure out how we can help educate the visitors, and even the locals, on ocean safety and what\u2019s the best way to do that. With the brochure, we can put it anywhere now, we just got to pay the printer.\u201d\n\nFunded and developed by the county, the brochure follows an ocean safety video released in February. The unveilings are part of an effort to lower Maui County\u2019s ocean-related death toll, which topped 21 last year (though that figure may include both drownings and people who died from other causes, such as heart attacks or strokes). The state Department of Health reported 16 drownings in Maui County in 2013 and 13 in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the hotels will put brochures in every single hotel room and have it readily available, that way (visitors) can pick it up and read through it wherever,\u201d Kayama said. \u201cHopefully they can use that information to make their ocean activity safer.\n\n\u201cThey think this is Disneyland\u2026 . They don\u2019t know the hidden dangers that we have so this is one way to educate them on the dangers,\u201d he said.\n\nInformation about sharks also is included in the brochure. In recent years, there\u2019s been a spike in shark bite incidents in Maui County waters. Statewide last year, there were 14 confirmed shark incidents, with eight of those reported around Maui, including two fatalities.\n\nSo far this year, there have been two confirmed shark attacks. In January, a Paukukalo fisherman was bitten on the leg after trying to push a hooked shark back into the ocean off the pali in Lahaina. The other attack killed Margaret C. Cruse, 65, of Kihei, in April, while she was snorkeling in the Kanahena Cove area of the Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve.\n\nThe brochure\u2019s shark safety tips include not swimming alone, exiting the water if fish or turtles behave erratically and avoiding murky water.\n\n\u201cThe feedback has been really great,\u201d Kayama said of the brochure. \u201cThis is the first time we have something like this, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been wanting to do for a long time.\u201d\n\nMaui Visitors Bureau Executive Director Terryl Vencl welcomed the brochure, which comes in addition to a safety pamphlet the bureau has passed out at the airport for years. She thanked the county for printing and designing the handout. And now, she has been lobbying hotels to make them available for their guests.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve all been sent the information, and it\u2019s up to each property, on what they want to do,\u201d Vencl said.\n\nOne resort that has embraced the brochure and the ocean safety video is the Fairmont Kea Lani, Maui, in Wailea. The resort plans to have the brochure inside all 450 hotel suites and play the video on its in-house information channel, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure (guests are) aware of the dangers that are around and be prepared to enjoy Maui responsibly and safely,\u201d said Tanya Matthews, regional director of sales and marketing for Fairmont Hawaii.\n\nMatthews said the hotel was \u201cdefinitely\u201d interested in providing the brochure to guests, and it has made it available at the front desk and with its concierge. She said the resort has always provided beach safety information to guests but \u201cnothing as professionally prepared or dedicated in the same way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time because we\u2019re in our peak family season,\u201d she said.\n\nThe key to the brochure\u2019s success, as well as the safety video, will be in its distribution, county officials said. Colin Yamamoto, ocean safety battalion chief for the Maui Fire Department, said he hopes transient vacation rentals and local schools also receive the brochures.\n\n\u201cWe need to reach out to high schools and even intermediate schools and educate them when they\u2019re young because years down the road we\u2019ll reap the benefits,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cThe key is prevention and education, and I\u2019m really focusing on those two things.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "An ocean safety brochure in every hotel, condominium, classroom and beach rental shack has been a longtime dream for many Maui County officials.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An ocean safety brochure in every hotel, condominium, classroom and beach rental shack has been a longtime dream for many Maui County officials.", "title": "Brochure informs visitors of \u2018hidden dangers\u2019 of the sea", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/brochure-informs-visitors-of-hidden-dangers-of-the/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/296934e01f808c19780f6a706700a12c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/296934e01f808c19780f6a706700a12c.jpg", "description": "An ocean safety brochure in every hotel, condominium, classroom and beach rental shack has been a longtime dream for many Maui County officials.", "card": "summary", "title": "Brochure informs visitors of \u2018hidden dangers\u2019 of the sea"}, "Author": "CHRIS SUGIDONO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the first time we have all collaborated and made a brochure like this,\u201d Ocean Safety Supervisor Cary Kayama said Thursday.\nOne resort that has embraced the brochure and the ocean safety video is the Fairmont Kea Lani, Maui, in Wailea.\nThe state Department of Health reported 16 drownings in Maui County in 2013 and 13 in 2012.\nWAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) - An ocean safety brochure in every hotel, condominium, classroom and beach rental shack has been a longtime dream for many Maui County officials.\nThe brochure\u2019s shark safety tips include not swimming alone, exiting the water if fish or turtles behave erratically and avoiding murky water."}
