An October poll, conducted a week after the government reopened, had placed him 11 points ahead. On Election Day, Cuccinelli lost by only 2.5 points. McAuliffe\u2019s precipitous tumble was due entirely to Obamacare.\n\nThere was bad news for Republicans as well. The government shutdown damaged Cuccinelli, possibly costing him the race. But there were other factors. The money gap (he was outspent three to one), outgoing Republican governor Bob McDonnell\u2019s ethics troubles, and Cuccinelli\u2019s dour mien all made it possible for a gasbag Democratic moneyman, who admitted he didn\u2019t read legislation and would hire someone to handle such trivia, to take Thomas Jefferson\u2019s seat in Richmond.\n\nYet in the 34th district of Virginia, right outside Washington, D.C., a very conservative delegate was able to run between 8 and 18 points ahead of Cuccinelli and win a district that just a year ago went for Tim Kaine for senator and Barack Obama.\n\nBarbara Comstock is as conservative as any right-winger could desire \u2014 pro\u2013free enterprise, pro-life, and pro\u2013second amendment. Her opponent, Kathleen Murphy, a doctrinaire liberal, was supported by the unions, Michael Bloomberg, NARAL, and Planned Parenthood.\n\nIf conservatives want to win elections and not just preen about their ideological purity, they should study Comstock.\n\nHow can conservatives cope with the \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d that are handing Democrats huge percentages of the women\u2019s vote? Comstock is not furtive about her opposition to abortion. At a debate the week before the election, she spoke affectionately of her son-in-law\u2019s birthmother and of her \u201ccourageous and loving\u201d decision to place him for adoption. She also took a page from Governor Bobby Jindal\u2019s book and endorsed making birth-control pills available over the counter, as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends. It\u2019s hard to paint her as someone who wants to keep women barefoot and pregnant when she advocates making birth-control pills easier to obtain. Her opponent opposed this.\n\nComstock fought back aggressively when Murphy accused her of opposing funds for cancer screening (this smear was used against a number of Virginia Republicans this year). Comstock pointed out that Kathleen Murphy was referring to a Democratic legislative effort to pull cancer-screening funds from the health department and turn them over to Planned Parenthood.\n\nComstock authored legislation to ease telework (traffic congestion plagues her region), require competitive bidding on state transportation projects (unions were unhappy, but taxpayers saved $400 million), curb human trafficking, and provide more in-state slots at Virginia colleges. She sponsored legislation on Lyme disease and joined efforts on all-day kindergarten programs and instant background checks for gun purchasers. Why those? Because her constituents requested them. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be serving them,\u201d she notes, \u201cnot the other way around.\u201d\n\nGovernment agencies usually spend all available funds at the end of the fiscal year rather than returning money to the treasury. Governor Bob McDonnell passed legislation offering state employees a 3 percent pay bonus if they could identify savings in their agencies. It was a win-win: State employees got a raise, and taxpayers got less spending. Comstock suggested applying the same principle to schools \u2014 with the surprising approval of the teachers\u2019 union. \u201cLots of teachers are in favor of eliminating \u2018curriculum specialists\u2019 and other bureaucrats,\u201d she says.\n\nComstock finds common ground where it won\u2019t compromise important goals or principles. She founded a Young Women\u2019s Leadership Program for middle and high-school students and invited a number of leading Democrats, such as Donna Brazile, as well as Republicans like Kate O\u2019Beirne to share their experiences and advice.\n\nPeople expect their state and local governments to take care of things like roads, bridges, congestion, schools, and public safety, she explains. One of her mentors is former Indiana governor Mitch Daniels, who, among other reforms, reduced wait times at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles from hours down to an average of seven minutes. It was a symbol of efficiency and good stewardship.\n\nBarbara Comstock doesn\u2019t believe in \u201cputting sticks in the eyes\u201d of her opponents. She fights false accusations aggressively but smiles whenever possible and offers concrete accomplishments that make her constituents\u2019 lives easier. Virginia is more conservative because its House of Delegates has such a smart and savvy member. She hasn\u2019t compromised her principles. She is not a sell-out, a squish, or a RINO. She\u2019s something all Republicans should aspire to be \u2014 a winner.\n\n\u2014 Mona Charen is a nationally syndicated columnist. \u00a9 2013 Creators Syndicate, Inc.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Primer from a Conservative Winner", "sailthru.author": "Mona Charen", "description": "The most alarming message for Democrats from Tuesday\u2019s election was the near obliteration of Terry McAuliffe\u2019s lead over Ken Cuccinelli.
