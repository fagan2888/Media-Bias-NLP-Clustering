Their machines whir and clang, but the researchers don't seem to hear it.\n\nDr. Smalley has a particular interest in stage 4 melanoma \u2013 the kind that\u2019s so advanced neither surgery nor drugs will help.\n\nHalf of late-stage melanoma cases are triggered by a gene mutation, called B-Raf. There's a way to block it, Dr. Smalley says.\n\nCarol Gentry tells story of discovery of melanoma breakthrough at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\n\"In an extremely short 8 years, we actually had progressed from having a gene to having a drug.\u201d\n\nDozens of patients at Moffitt, along with some other centers, tried the B-Raf inhibitor.\n\n\u201cAlthough the strategy appeared incredibly effective at first,\" Smalley said, \"the patients only tended to respond to the therapy for approximately half a year.\"\n\nDr. Jeffrey Weber, director of the melanoma research center at Moffitt, says tumors that respond to B-Raf inhibitors eventually develop resistance.\n\nThey tried giving a second drug, called Mek. It blocks signals from a different place on the same molecular pathway.\n\nDr. Weber\u2019s favorite analogy for the two-drug treatment is a thief speeding down a highway.\n\n\u201cGiving a B-Raf and Mek inhibitor is like blocking the road, laying the spikes down and blocking all the exits. The thief is invariably going to get caught.\"\n\nDr. Smalley said it worked better than anyone predicted.\n\n\u201cAnd the amazing part about it is the patients actually had fewer side-effects.\u201c\n\nMoffitt had the largest group of patients in the clinical trial that combined the B-raf and Mek drugs. The combo therapy had a median survival of about two years, Dr. Weber said.\n\n\"You open the chart, to see the patient on this combination B-Raf/Mek trial here at week 48, week 60, here week 72, here week 96 and all of a sudden you realize all these patients are coming back two years later still in remission and you're thinking, 'Wow, that\u2019s pretty impressive!'\u201d\n\nThe two-drug therapy \u2013 called a doublet \u2013 works fast, as Dr. Weber discovered. He was sitting on his porch one Saturday afternoon when he got a call about a patient he had seen just the day before.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was, 'Oh no, he\u2019s got some horrendous side effect, he\u2019s going to have to stop his treatment, he\u2019s got some problem. So he got on the line; I asked him what was going on. He was very impressed by the fact that his routine pain medicines, which had been given for a number of weeks before starting treatment, he felt he didn\u2019t to take them anymore.\u201d\n\nThe patient, a realtor from southwest Florida, had been taking OxyContin. He needed it, with a bone lesion in his right leg and a tumor in his left thigh. But now, to Dr. Weber\u2019s astonishment, the man was going for a walk.\n\n\u201cHe said I just want to make sure there's no problem all of sudden not needing pain medicines,\" Weber recalled. \"I said, 'Not at all, this is working unbelievably quickly to shrink your tumor.' So literally within 24 hours the guy obviously had evidence of regression, that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t using his pain medicines. He went on to have a near-complete remission. We just saw him last week; he\u2019s out three years. That\u2019s the kind of thing that sticks in your mind. You think, 'Boy, this combination is pretty potent.'\"\n\nThat leads to the inevitable question of whether science has arrived at the point where a stage 4 melanoma diagnosis may not be an automatic death sentence.\n\nWeber says, \"I think you\u2019re thinking of the 'C word' for cure and it is entirely possible that either with this combination or immunologic treatment or both that we\u2019ll be able to cure patients with melanoma, or at least render the disease a chronic disease.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s similar to the way HIV infected patients are now living for years, even decades, by taking multiple drugs several times a day.\n\n\u201cSo it seems as if we\u2019re in a new era, where all patients are going be treated with doublets of drugs,\" Weber said.\n\n\"At Moffitt, where we\u2019re engaged in cutting-edge care, we\u2019re beyond that, we\u2019re into triplets.\u201d\n\nFDA approved the two-drug therapy for melanoma in January. When Moffitt had a press conference to announce it, one of those who came was Dawn Dion, who had been in the clinical trial.\n\n\u201cWhen it was first diagnosed, I didn\u2019t expect to survive,\" she said. \"When you go on line -- don\u2019t do it, folks, it isn\u2019t pretty -- that\u2019s what they tell you. You\u2019re going to die.\u201d\n\nWhat really threw her was looking at her children.\n\n\u201cMy youngest one was six. All I could think was, 'Who\u2019s going to help her? Who\u2019s going to raise her?'\u201d\n\nThe answer, it turns out, is Mrs. Dion herself. She said she owes her life to Moffitt and the combination-drug trial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really allowed me to be with my children and be a mom, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for that.\u201d\n\nThe brand names for the B-Raf and Mek inhibitors are Tafinlar and Mekinist; both are marketed by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
