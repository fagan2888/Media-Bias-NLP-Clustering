That may not occur until 2-3 p.m. \u2014 and not before another round of freezing precipitation arrives in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\n\u201cStay home if you can,\u201d says Jesse Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very bad out there for a while. Fortunately it\u2019s a weekend. But the roads are slick. Even the sidewalks. It\u2019s tough to even walk, much less drive.\u201d\n\nThe freezing precip moving into Dallas-Fort Worth this morning is now between Austin and Waco, slowly crawling up Interstate 35. Moore says it should be in North Texas between 9 and 10 a.m.\n\nKXAS-Channel 5 meteorologist Rick Mitchell notes the slowly rising temperatures: \u201cAt 2 a.m. the temperature at DFW was 26. At 9 a.m. it is 28, so temperatures are slowly rising.\u201d\n\nThe TxDOT cameras show there are plenty of people out and about this morning. But as you can see from the traffic map below it\u2019s slow going; our media partners at KXAS-Channel 5 are reporting closed roads and spin-outs all over the skating rinks currently passing for area highways.\n\nRyan LaFontane, a TxDOT spokesperson, says crews are out using salt and sand and blades to clear the roads. But \u201cwe\u2019re continuing to urge folks: If you don\u2019t have to be on the road, stay home.\u201d\n\nThe North Texas Tollway Authority says roads are passable, but occasionally \u201cchallenging.\u201d\n\nThe road conditions also impacted bus service in the region.\n\nDART was running on its normal Saturday schedule, but officials said delays were possible.\n\nAbout 11 a.m., the Denton County Transport Authority announced it had suspended its operations \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\nBus service in the Fort Worth area was suspended until 1 p.m. The Trinity Railway Express was operating as usual, said Joan Hunter, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth Transportation Authority.\n\nAnd the weather, of course, continues to impact operations at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where an FAA-imposed ground stop holding inbound traffic at their originating airports was lifted just after 8 a.m., then reinstated minutes later when the airport ran out of gates due to de-icing delays.\n\nThe FAA lifted the ground stop just after 9 a.m. Check here for the latest.\n\nAs of 9:30 a.m., airlines serving DFW had cancelled more than 350 departures scheduled for Saturday, airports spokesman David Magana said. The cancellations constituted 35 percent of the airport\u2019s full schedule, which includes arrivals and departures.\n\nBut, Magana adds, \u201cAirlines plan to have their operations resume a near-normal state of flight operations by early this afternoon.\u201d That is, when we get above freezing. And that could take a while.\n\nDallas Love Field is reporting delays, but nothing as significant as a ground stop. And Dallas Area Rapid Transit says buses and light rail are running as scheduled.\n\nJust warn the kids before they go out this morning: In case of snowball emergency, break ice.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, the Dallas Zoo is closed today, but the Dallas Arboretum just sent word that it\u2019s opening at noon. Or you can just watch this.\n\nStaff writers Naheed Rajwani and Diane Jennings contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAyL2JlbmVhdGgtZnJlZXppbmctcmFpbi1yb2Fkcy10dXJuLXRvLXNrYXRpbmctcmlua3MtYW5kLWZhYS1zdG9wcy10cmFmZmljLWludG8tZGZ3LWFpcnBvcnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "[Editor's note: This item will be updated throughout the day.] Thanks to freezing rain that fell into the wee small hours of Saturday morning, the snow that fell Friday is\u2026", "title": "Temperatures climbing and streets clearing, but officials urge caution", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/02/beneath-freezing-rain-roads-turn-to-skating-rinks-and-faa-stops-traffic-into-dfw-airport.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/02/HighFive.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-28T12:54:29Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cStay home if you can,\u201d says Jesse Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth.\nThat may not occur until 2-3 p.m. \u2014 and not before another round of freezing precipitation arrives in Dallas-Fort Worth.\nAt 9 a.m. it is 28, so temperatures are slowly rising.\u201dThe TxDOT cameras show there are plenty of people out and about this morning.\nRyan LaFontane, a TxDOT spokesperson, says crews are out using salt and sand and blades to clear the roads.\nIt\u2019s tough to even walk, much less drive.\u201dThe freezing precip moving into Dallas-Fort Worth this morning is now between Austin and Waco, slowly crawling up Interstate 35."}
