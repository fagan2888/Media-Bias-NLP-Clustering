When more followed on subsequent plays, and on both fields, the coaches decided to break the teams apart and each team worked on its own field for the rest of the session.\n\nThe change in plans caused Redskins coach Jay Gruden to agree the day was somewhat wasted.\n\n\u201cInitially we had a couple on our field on the offensive field, and I was just going to cut that period out and have everybody go to the side, let everybody cool down and finish practice,\u201d Gruden said, \u201cbut then the other one broke out on the other field and it wasn\u2019t worth it. Injuries take place.\n\n\u201cObviously, it wasn\u2019t a good situation, but we missed an opportunity to get better today against a good team.\u201d\n\nGruden and Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien initially tried to let their teams know the fighting wasn\u2019t acceptable, but Gruden added: \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t two people. It was a group of men\u201d and \u201cFor whatever reason, it escalated into a nasty brawl.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said the Texans benefited from \u201ctwo and a half\u201d of their three days practicing against the Redskins. And both coaches agreed that joint workouts hold great value in helping to prepare a team for the start of the season.\n\n\u201cOther than having to separate today, we still got work done,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBut the two days that we were together there, we got a lot of situational work. It was good to work against them. Being in the hotel as a team, there\u2019s some bonding that goes on there, too.\u201d\n\nGruden\u2019s team worked for three days against the New England Patriots last year, spending the last day in shorts before meeting the Patriots in their preseason opener. The coach, in his second season, said expecting teams to battle for three days in full pads might be asking too much.\n\nThe fights came early in the joint portion of the workouts as a heavy rain fell.\n\nRedskins defensive lineman Chris Baker said one of the fights started when a Houston offensive lineman tried to \u201cclean him off the pocket.\u201d Baker says when he removed his helmet and confronted the player, the player hit him with a right hook and a brawl ensued.\n\nBaker says the Texans were angry because the Redskins got the best of them in their joint workout on Friday.\n\n\u201cI guess we kicked their butt yesterday so they came out here trying to be tough guys today,\u201d Baker said, \u201cbut it really didn\u2019t work. They had a rough day yesterday so they wanted to try to set the tone, but that\u2019s not going to happen here.\u201d\n\nTexans linebacker Whitney Mercilus agreed that his team struggled on Friday, but chalked the fights up to \u201cJust a whole lot of intensity on both sides of the ball.\u201d\n\nTeammate Cecil Shorts III added that the Texans expected the skirmishes and were prepared for it.\n\n\u201cIt just happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen two teams have been practicing for a while against each other, tempers flare. \u2026 We kind of figured something was going to happen and we prepared for it. We did a good job staying together. Nobody got hurt. It\u2019s over with. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Washington, Houston joint practice ends after brawl starts", "title": "Washington, Houston joint practice ends after brawl starts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/washington-houston-joint-practice-ends-after-brawl-starts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_012839_redskins.jpg", "height": 483}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_012839_redskins.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T12:56:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:56:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The joint portion of the final practice involving the Washington Redskins and Houston Texans came to an end Saturday when a series of fights broke out.\nBaker says the Texans were angry because the Redskins got the best of them in their joint workout on Friday.\nAnd both coaches agreed that joint workouts hold great value in helping to prepare a team for the start of the season.\nThe fights came early in the joint portion of the workouts as a heavy rain fell.\nThe change in plans caused Redskins coach Jay Gruden to agree the day was somewhat wasted."}
