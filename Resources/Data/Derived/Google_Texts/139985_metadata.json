Susan Collins remained divided on raising the minimum wage and providing universal health care during Monday night\u2019s debate in Presque Isle.\n\nThe locally televised debate was the first of several for the two in the lead-up to Election Day. It was co-hosted by WAGM-TV and Leaders Encouraging Aroostook Development. Moderated by WAGM News Director Kelly O\u2019Mara and Leaders Encouraging Aroostook Development board member Jason Parent, the live session saw the candidates wrangle with a variety of previously submitted questions facing the state and the nation.\n\nAmong the most divisive issues was raising the federal minimum wage. While both support boosting the federal rate of $7.25 per hour (Maine\u2019s minimum wage is $7.50 per hour), Bellows concurs with President Barack Obama\u2019s suggested $10.10 per hour, while Collins would like to see a more modest and gradual increase.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about an increase that large and its effects on small businesses,\u201d said Collins. Some small businesses may not be able to afford that hike, she said, which could in turn lead to about 500,000 jobs lost.\n\n\u201cI think a gradual increase makes more sense,\u201d she said.\n\nBellows countered that \u201c13 states raised the minimum wage this year, and they saw job increases.\u201d\n\nCollins cited discord over the minimum wage as an example of how a unilateral proposal such as Obama\u2019s on the minimum wage leads to gridlock on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong in Washington today \u2014 only one proposal gets considered,\u201d said Collins.\n\nBellows responded that raising minimum pay the full $2.85 would amount to just over $21,000 per year.\n\n\u201cCongress members who make $174,000 a year and don\u2019t support $21,000 for working families \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Washington,\u201d she argued.\n\nThe two also split on health care, with Bellows favoring a universal plan similar to those offered in Canada and many European nations.\n\n\u201cI support universal health care for all,\u201d said Bellows. \u201cI think the Affordable Care Act needs to be strengthened to expand access further. We need to invest in prevention. We need to invest more in making sure people get the primary care they need, as well as research.\u201d\n\nCollins disagreed.\n\n\u201cThere is so much we could have done in a bipartisan way to expand universal access to health care,\u201d Collins pointed out, such as tax credits to employers so they could offer medical insurance to employees. \u201cWhat we should not have is a government-run, government-controlled health care system.\u201d\n\nOn the question of affordable energy, both agreed more federal work needs to be done to support alternative energy sources.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should increase investment in solar, geothermal, tidal and biomass,\u201d Bellows said, adding that she favors lowering taxes for consumers.\n\nCollins supported increasing the supply of natural gas, adding, \u201cwe should pursue alternative energy and the use of locally grown wood.\u201d\n\nThe two sparred on several policy issues, including economic development, support for charter schools and even Maine\u2019s upcoming referendum Question 1 on whether or not to ban bear hunting via baiting, trapping and the use of dogs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought long and hard about this,\u201d Bellows said of the bear referendum. \u201cI grew up in Hancock, and we have a long tradition of hunting. I\u2019m voting \u2018no\u2019 on Question 1 because I think we need to uphold Maine\u2019s hunting heritage.\u201d\n\nCollins gave a nod to the state\u2019s hunting tradition, too, but she refused to state a public position on the question.\n\n\u201cI am not going to tell the people of Maine how they should vote on an issue,\u201d she said.\n\nOne question from the moderator called economic development initiatives an ongoing failure and asked candidates how they would improve state development efforts.\n\n\u201cIncrease infrastructure,\u201d Bellows said. \u201cWe need universal broadband Internet and universal cellphone service.\u201d\n\nShe referred to her walk across Maine and meeting many residents in need of jobs, with some jobs outsourced to other countries.\n\n\u201cWe need to stand for our workers and our communities,\u201d she said.\n\nCollins said workforce training is key.\n\n\u201cThere are jobs available,\u201d Collins said, \u201cbut workers don\u2019t always have the skills that match them.\u201d\n\nShe defended her work to support the Defense Finance and Accounting Services and the Maine Military Authority in Limestone, among others.\n\n\u201cRemember that the mainstays of our economy are agriculture and the forest products industries,\u201d she said.\n\nThe candidates found common ground in their support for public education and veterans\u2019 benefits. Considering whether to support charter schools or to make public schools better, both praised their public educations.\n\n\u201cThere are some cases where charter schools have succeeded,\u201d Collins noted, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think the federal government should dictate curriculum. I think that is up to the state and local governments.\u201d\n\nBellows said she is \u201cpassionate about universal public education. We need to invest in public education again.\u201d\n\nThe two also favored stronger veterans\u2019 benefits, noting family members\u2019 service.\n\n\u201cI support fair retirement benefits for our veterans,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my record of standing tall for those who have stood tall for us.\u201d\n\nBellows said more work needs to be done.\n\n\u201cI think veterans and their families watching tonight would agree that things are not OK with access to benefits,\u201d Bellows said. \u201cOnce we send people overseas to fight, we need to take care of them when they come home.\u201d\n\nThe candidates also agreed that the nation was ill-prepared to deal with the Ebola virus, and the two stated opposition to the idea of locating a nuclear power plant in Maine.\n\n\u201cThis election is more than just the policy differences between me and Susan,\u201d Bellows said in closing remarks. \u201cThis is a question of two different visions.\u201d Mentioning her nieces and nephew, she asked, \u201cwhat type of world will we leave for them? If you believe \u2026 that we need a change, then I ask for your vote.\u201d\n\nCollins recalled her efforts to save Defense Finance and Accounting Services, expand the National Weather Service office in Caribou and return potatoes to school nutrition programs.\n\n\u201cThese are just some of the projects I have worked together with you on, and I ask for your vote in November,\u201d said Collins.\n\nThe candidates will meet again in four other televised debates: 8 p.m. Oct. 22 at Husson University in Bangor, televised by MPBN; 7 p.m. Oct. 23 on WMTW in Auburn; 5:30 p.m. Oct. 27 on WGME in Portland, co-sponsored by the BDN; and 7 p.m. Oct. 29 on WCSH in Portland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PRESQUE ISLE, Maine \u2014 Though they found some common ground on veterans\u2019 benefits and public education, U.S. Senate candidates Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, and incumbent Republican Sen.
