Mark Begich may or may not win reelection to the US Senate this coming year. But he just won the Captain Louis Renault award. According to a November 21 AP report, his campaign expressed outraged shock over the discovery that a commercial opposing him for having supported and defended Obamacare used (gasp!) a professional actress.

(For those of you who don't get the "Casablanca" reference, click here or here.)

Begich's campaign manager, Susanne Fleek-Green, claims the spot is a "phony attempt to snooker Alaskans." An Anchorage Daily News headline says, "Begich blasts attack ad featuring actress pretending to be Alaskan," claiming that she "talks about Begich as if he is her senator."

But does she? And if so, does that matter?

Disingenuous?

Here's what the on-camera dialogue actually says:

I trusted the president and Senator Begich. Lots of promises were made to pass Obamacare. They knew the real truth. Now millions are losing their health care. Some are even losing their doctor. For too many of us, costs are going way up. Senator Begich didn't listen. How can I ever trust him again? It just isn't fair. Alaska deserves better.

Nowhere in that verbatim transcript is there a claim, "phony" or otherwise, that the speaker is Alaskan. There are other claims, though, and they're true ones.

It's true that Americans were promised lots of times – at least 24 – that "If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Period."

It's true, according to Federal Register records, that as early as three years ago, the administration and legislators knew that millions of health plans would be canceled.

It's true, as recent news stories have pointed out, that millions of Americans have already had their health plans shot out from under them – and that's just in the individual market, to say nothing of the millions more who stand to lose their company health plans when the employer mandate kicks in in 2015.

It's true that doctors and hospitals are being dropped left and right from the new, "better" Obamacare plans.

And it's true that costs – not just premiums, but copays and deductibles – are doubling, tripling or more.

But since an actress says that on screen, it's all obviously false.

Smoke screen

Since he can't or won't refute the message, Begich is trying to shoot the messenger instead.

Professional actors are nothing new in commercials. And if it's such an outrageous outrage that the woman in this commercial is a professional actress from Maryland, why is it perfectly okay that the smiling face on the healthcare.gov home page belongs to a professional model from Maryland? (For what it's worth, the 36 states that the federal website's supposed to serve exclude Maryland, which has its own exchange.)

He's also attacking a flea with an elephant gun.

The commercial is one of six produced by Americans for Prosperity, targeting three red-state senators (Begich, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana) and three House members (Ron Barber of Arizona and Joe Garcia and Patrick Murphy, both of Florida) who are up for reelection and vulnerable because of their support and defense of the increasingly unpopular government health-care plan.

If dissent is the highest form of patriotism, this ad and its companions are very patriotic. AFP president Tim Phillips told the New York Times, "We want to make sure Obamacare is the No. 1 issue [voters are] thinking about. We believe repealing Obamacare is a long-term effort, and a key part of that effort is keeping it in front of the American people night and day."

With a total budget of $3.5 million for five states, though, keeping it in front of the American people night and day is wishful thinking.

"The ads are specifically aimed at women," the Times notes,

because the group’s research has shown that they are not only more undecided than men about the merits of the Affordable Care Act, but that they also tend to make the decisions about their family’s health care.

Weakest of the lot

The Alaska spot that was enough to get Begich in such at uproar is actually the weakest of the campaign.

One of the Florida commercials, for example, features an emotional Hispanic woman saying

I trusted President Obama and Congressman Joe Garcia. Obamacare was supposed to make things better. Joe Garcia had to know the real truth. Millions losing their coverage, losing their doctor, having to pay more for their health care than ever before. Joe Garcia could have listened when he had the chance. We're hurting. It just isn't fair.

No one can accuse the Louisiana commercial of using phony actresses, because it uses news clips, including one from Landrieu herself, repeated twice, in which she says, "If I had to vote for the bill again, I'd vote for it tomorrow."

But the strongest of the lot – performing triple duty against Hagan, Barber and Murphy – features another professional actress against a plain, white, no-seam backdrop, saying

People don't like political ads. I don't like them either. But health care isn't about politics. It's about people. It's not about a website that doesn't work. It's not about poll numbers or approval ratings. It's about people. And millions of people have lost their health insurance. Millions of people can't see their own doctors. And millions are paying more and getting less. Obamacare doesn't work. It just doesn't work. Tell [name of politician] to stop thinking about politics and start thinking about people.

Guilt by association

Why, aside from the fact that those commercials highlight a candidate's big weak point, are Begich and the Anchorage News, among others, attacking them so vehemently?

Well, it seems that among the donors to Americans for Prosperity are – are you ready for this? – those nefarious bogeymen, the Koch Brothers.

So although the commercials have factual basis, although they're well within the mainstream of American political dialog, although they're strictly issue oriented, and although they avoid the politics of personal destruction, they must be inherently eeeeevil!
