The two groups spearheading the effort, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and Bedsider, are encouraging supporters to tweet their personal stories about how birth control has helped them in their own lives.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, the development of modern contraception was one of the 10 most important public health achievements of the 20th century. But you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it from the country\u2019s current politically-charged environment, in which Obamacare\u2019s effort to expand access to affordable birth control has met considerable resistance and many public schools still aren\u2019t allowed to teach kids anything about contraceptive methods. In the lead-up the the 2012 elections, much of the outrage over \u201cWar on Women\u201d was fueled by the incredulity that the U.S. was still debating birth control at all, as if the nation had suddenly regressed several decades.\n\nBill Albert, the National Campaign\u2019s chief program officer, notes that the nation has somehow \u201clost its way\u201d when it comes to family planning.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, many policymakers are way, way out of touch with the public,\u201d Albert told ThinkProgress. \u201cMany of them are cynically conflating abortion with birth control as if they are the same thing. We have an environment in which popular radio show hosts are free to say that college women who use contraception are sluts. And this is 2013! How far have we fallen? It\u2019s really quite amazing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day comes in. Advocates hope to move past the political discourse about birth control, which often suggests it poisons women\u2019s bodies or insinuates it\u2019s only necessary for morally corrupt women. They want to emphasize the actual experiences that Americans have with family planning \u2014 and get people talking about it in a positive way.\n\n\u201cWe have forgotten to talk about all that birth control has made possible, and how it\u2019s directly linked to a number of benefits for women, for men, for children, and for society,\u201d Albert explained to ThinkProgress. \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize birth control for all the economic opportunities it has offered to women. We don\u2019t talk about the freedom it gives to plan a family on our own terms. We don\u2019t talk about greater educational attainment or improved maternal health. We sort of take these things for granted. It\u2019s time for us to refocus.\u201d\n\nAlbert is quick to note that, despite the increasing politicized resistance to family planning, birth control isn\u2019t actually controversial. In conjunction with \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day, his organization has released new research that finds broad bipartisan support for contraception. Seventy eight percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans believe that policymakers who are opposed to abortion should be strong supporters of family planning programs \u2014 although that hasn\u2019t exactly been the case in deeply red states lately.\n\nThe grassroots effort isn\u2019t just about reclaiming political ground or dispelling societal stigma, however. Encouraging people to talk openly about their contraceptive of choice helps raise everyone\u2019s level of awareness about their options, and that additional education is sorely needed. Studies have found that most U.S. women are misinformed about which types of birth control are the most effective at preventing pregnancy, and they don\u2019t necessarily feel comfortable initiating these conversations with their doctors. Most general practitioners don\u2019t effectively counsel their female patients about their contraceptive options.\n\n\u201cThis is a way to just get people to talk about birth control,\u201d Albert said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t talk about it openly and honestly, how can we expect people to use it consistently and carefully?\u201d\n\nThe domestic campaign coincides with global efforts to expand access to family planning services. The third international family planning summit kicks off on Tuesday in Ethiopia. At last year\u2019s meeting in London, donors pledged to raise the money necessary to ensure that 120 million more women will have access to modern contraceptives by 2020.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "On Tuesday, national sexual health organizations want to make sure you take a minute to thank your favorite birth control method.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "On Tuesday, national sexual health organizations want to make sure you take a minute to thank your favorite birth control method.", "title": "\u2018Thanks, Birth Control\u2019 Day Wants To Remind Americans How Modern Contraception Has Changed The World", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/12/2925901/birth-control-day/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday, national sexual health organizations want to make sure you take a minute to thank your favorite birth control method.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018Thanks, Birth Control\u2019 Day Wants To Remind Americans How Modern Contraception Has Changed The World", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-12T12:40:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc329\"", "article_summary": "Health \u2018Thanks, Birth Control\u2019 Day Wants To Remind Americans How Modern Contraception Has Changed The World CREDIT: ShutterstockNational sexual health organizations are marking Tuesday as the first annual \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day, an opportunity for Americans to openly discuss the benefits of preventative health care.\nIn conjunction with \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day, his organization has released new research that finds broad bipartisan support for contraception.\n\u201cUnfortunately, many policymakers are way, way out of touch with the public,\u201d Albert told ThinkProgress.\nIt\u2019s really quite amazing.\u201dThat\u2019s where \u201cThanks, Birth Control\u201d Day comes in.\nIt\u2019s time for us to refocus.\u201dAlbert is quick to note that, despite the increasing politicized resistance to family planning, birth control isn\u2019t actually controversial."}
