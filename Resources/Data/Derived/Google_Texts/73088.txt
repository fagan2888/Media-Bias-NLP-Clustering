Since Donald Trump is more comedian than politician, it makes sense that his rallies would be ripe for comedy. So far, though, nobody has taken to the front lines and deployed the kind of humor that we see on late night monologues and, of course, all over the Internet.

That changed last night, when Jimmy Kimmel sent Jake Byrd, one of his “correspondents,” to a Trump rally in Dallas. It starts off with Byrd interrupting interviews with Trump supporters, and I’d give the comedy there a solid 7/10. But the best part, by far, comes inside the rally, when Byrd, with a giant cowboy hat complete with a “DTF” logo, finagles a seat directly behind Trump, in direct view of the cameras. His reactions there are priceless, and my favorite moment comes when Trump promises to abolish Obamacare, at which point Byrd jumps up in a fit of enthusiasm, yelling, “no more medicine!”

Watch the full video above, and let’s hope Byrd becomes a fixture at these rallies.
