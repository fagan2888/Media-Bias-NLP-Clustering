(Photo: David De Lossy, Getty Images)\n\nLet the parties begin!\n\nWith Thanksgiving out of the way, you thought you could hunker down in your small business or just kick back at home? No way \u2014 the holiday season is a perfect time to use social opportunities to build your small business.\n\nLong before Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or even MySpace, there was another kind of social marketing: people actually meeting other people at social gatherings. That's still the kind of marketing that works best. In small businesses, word-of-mouth marketing and customer relationships are the key to ongoing sales. Nothing beats the impact of connecting with a business owner face to face. So pack your social schedule.\n\nDuring the holidays, opportunities abound to meet new small business prospects and deepen relationships with current customers.\n\nNo place to go? I'm betting that's not true. I suspect you have more invitations in your inbox or Facebook posts than you actually pay attention to. You've probably received notices of Chamber of Commerce holiday mixers, industry association end-of-year parties, other companies' open houses, even neighbors' cookie-decorating parties.\n\nHere are some other ways to meet people during the holidays:\n\n\u2022 Volunteer at a local food bank, toy drive or other cause.\n\n\u2022 Offer your place of business for a charity's holiday event.\n\n\u2022 Organize a holiday get-together at a local sporting venue.\n\n\u2022 Set up a \"meet up\" to turn online contacts into real-life connections.\n\nIt's not too late to plan a holiday gathering to thank your clients or customers for their business.

You never know where you'll make an important new contact.\n\n\u2022 Your elevator pitch down pat. An elevator pitch provides a concise summary of your service, business or product idea that can be delivered in a short time.\n\nHere are some holiday networking hints:\n\n\u2022 Arrive early. You'll have a better chance to meet people when fewer people are yet there. Throughout the event, mingle, move around and don't be afraid to approach people. Especially look for wallflowers. They'll be happy you've approached them, and you might make a great contact.\n\n\u2022 Ask people what they do and listen when they tell you \u2014 networking is a two-way street. People are always flattered when you show interest in them.\n\n\u2022 Give out those business cards you stocked up on and ask people for theirs. Jot down a few notes on the back of the cards so you'll remember later who gave you which one.\n\nAfter your networking event, contact all leads as quickly as possible \u2014 ideally, the next day. People are busy, and it's easy for them to forget about you. If you've told a new contact you'd send them something, or provide a quote, or just give them the name of a contact that you think might help them, do it as soon as you are back at your place of business. If you don't hear back from them, you can check back with them right after the first of the year.\n\nThe holidays are also a great time to reconnect with your existing clients or customers. Plan one-on-one holiday lunches, dinners or drinks. It's not too late to host a small get-together at your office or at a restaurant for your best clients and staff.\n\nArrive early to events and mingle throughout the room to make the most of holiday business networking opportunities.
