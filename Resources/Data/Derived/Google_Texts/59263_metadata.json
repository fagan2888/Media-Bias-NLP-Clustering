And we\u2019re not fighting wars in Europe anymore,\u201d Coffey told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4, 1949, marks the founding of NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nPresident Barack Obama met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg upon the 67th anniversary Monday to discuss troubling developments including the Islamic State terrorist army, also known as ISIS, and the recent Brussels terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cIt is because of the strength of NATO and the transatlantic partnership\u2014this transatlantic alliance\u2014that I\u2019m confident that despite these choppy waters, we will continue to be able to underscore and underwrite the peace and security and prosperity that has been the hallmark of the transatlantic relationship for so many decades,\u201d Obama said.\n\nCoffey told The Daily Signal that \u201cthe cornerstone of our security and the security of the Western world really depends on NATO.\u201d\n\nWorld leaders formed the international alliance after World War I and World War II to prevent another devastating conflict.\n\nThe organization\u2019s mission is to \u201csafeguard the freedom and security of its members through political and military means.\u201d\n\nAll 28 member countries today\u2014including other world powers such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany\u2014work in consultation to reach decisions on important defense and security issues. If diplomacy fails, the organization can use military force to resolve a crisis affecting its members.\n\n>>> You\u2019d Better Believe NATO Still Matters Today\n\nIn his previous role as Heritage\u2019s Margaret Thatcher fellow, Coffey focused on relations between the United States and the United Kingdom and on the role of NATO and the European Union in transatlantic and Eurasian security.\n\nCoffey said the NATO alliance has been one of \u201cthe greatest tools of democracy promotion the world has ever seen,\u201d with hope of membership driving many countries to pursue reforms after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nAn essential part of the organization\u2019s founding mission was to prevent expansion of the Soviet Union. Coffey said the alliance remains critical to preserving international security.\n\n\u201cNATO today is there to do the same thing it was doing during the Cold War: to defend the territorial integrity of its member states. During the Cold War, it was the Soviet Union; today, it seems to be Russia,\u201d Coffey said, noting Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s use of its military to annex Crimea, invade Ukraine, and provoke the Baltic States.\n\nCoffey said NATO should take a \u201cback to the basics\u201d approach to combat a growing threat posed by Russia and should not pursue actions beyond its original mission to defend the territory of member states.\n\nThough the rise of ISIS and other developments in the Middle East are concerning to NATO\u2019s members, Coffey cautioned against the alliance being used as a \u201cglobal counterterrorism task force.\u201d He said previous military campaigns led by NATO, as in Afghanistan and Libya, tended to devolve into a \u201cwar by committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to turn our back on NATO,\u201d Coffey said.\n\nThe alliance can have a \u201cbright future\u201d if its sticks to its original mission, he said, but the alliance is \u201conly as strong as each member state.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEuropeans need to start spending more on defense, American needs to start spending more on defense, because our adversaries\u2014like Russia, Iran\u2014they\u2019re spending a lot more on defense. They\u2019re raising their defense spending while we\u2019re cutting ours.\u201d\n\nCoffey said the U.S. role in NATO \u201chelps make the whole North Atlantic region secure and stable,\u201d with subsequent economic prosperity resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n\u201cAll this is only made possible because of a strong U.S. inside a strong NATO,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meta: \u201cNow is not the time to turn our back on NATO,\u201d \u00a0The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Luke \u00a0Coffey says as the alliance turns 67.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Meta: \u201cNow is not the time to turn our back on NATO,\u201d \u00a0The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Luke \u00a0Coffey says as the alliance turns 67.", "title": "Who Says NATO Is Irrelevant?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160405_NATO-Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-08T15:10:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1qwCJYd"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Meta: \u201cNow is not the time to turn our back on NATO,\u201d \u00a0The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Luke \u00a0Coffey says as the alliance turns 67.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160405_NATO-Barillas.jpg"}, "title": "Who Says NATO Is Irrelevant?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2016-04-07T16:18:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-08T15:10:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "NATO, obama NATO, NATO birthday, NATO anniversary, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Jens Stoltenberg, Luke Coffey,  ISIS, Islamic State"}, "article_summary": "Policy leaders are reflecting on the legacy and future of NATO this week, the anniversary of the alliance\u2019s creation 67 years ago.\nThe signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4, 1949, marks the founding of NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\u201cAll this is only made possible because of a strong U.S. inside a strong NATO,\u201d he said.\nThey\u2019re raising their defense spending while we\u2019re cutting ours.\u201dCoffey said the U.S. role in NATO \u201chelps make the whole North Atlantic region secure and stable,\u201d with subsequent economic prosperity resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\u201c[U.S.] involvement in NATO means that Europe stays relatively secure and calm."}
