Weed, cocaine, and meth are among the go-to drugs people do to get high. These mind- and body-altering substances have the potential to control how you function as they find their way into the bloodstream, whether you swallow, inhale, or inject. However, aside from these illegal drugs, there are everyday foods that can potentially get you high without the drugs, according to Alltime10s's YouTube video “10 Foods That Can Get You High.”

Although they do make you hallucinate, and others work as aphrodisiacs, legal highs are not prohibited. They range from plants to foods you buy at the supermarket. What makes them similar is that they’re all legal, but this doesn’t mean they are safe for consumption.

For example, most people turn to their morning cup of Joe to jump start their day. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a drug that stimulates the central nervous system, causing an increase in alertness while giving a temporary energy boost and elevating mood. However, drinking seven cups of coffee a day can provide similar effects to hallucinogens. A 2011 study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences found high coffee intake can cause people to hear imaginary voices and even sense the presence of dead people.

Seven cups of coffee may be extreme, but if you prefer adding nutmeg to your coffee over sugar, this could be a double whammy. Nutmeg contains myristicin, a volatile oil used in the popular hallucinogen MDMA. Two tablespoons of the spice can cause an out-of-body sensation and lead to nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, and slow brain function for two days. The effects of consuming both coffee and nutmeg simultaneously could possibly wreak havoc on your body.
