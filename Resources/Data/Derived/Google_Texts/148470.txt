One of the best books on investing is All About Asset Allocation by Rick Ferri. He’s written several great investing books, but AAAA is my favorite. It’s a must read, particularly if you’re just starting out or want to learn more about passive investing.

In October of this year at a personal finance bloggers conference I had the chance to talk with Rick. He’s the founder of Portfolio Solutions, which manages more than $1 billion in assets. His investing philosophy, like mine, is one of long-term, passive investing with low cost index funds.

Rick was kind enough to agree to an interview for this week’s podcast. We cover a lot of investing topics.
