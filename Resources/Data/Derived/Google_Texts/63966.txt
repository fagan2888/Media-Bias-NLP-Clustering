On the last day of 2014, Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) released its 2013-2014 annual report, revealing an uptick in abortions performed and a drop in both contraceptive and cancer prevention services.



“We’ve come a long way since Margaret Sanger was jailed in 1916 for opening America’s very first birth control clinic,” tout Planned Parenthood chair Alexis McGill Johnson and president Cecile Richards as they introduce the report. “Today, 99 percent of sexually active American women at some point in their lives use birth control – and, thanks to Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act, more than 48 million women are now eligible to receive it with no copay.”



“Until 1973, young healthy American women were dying because of illegal and unsafe abortions,” the Planned Parenthood leaders say. “Today, abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in this country.”

According to its annual report, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions in 2013, up from its 327,166 performed in 2012. SBA-List states that, over the past three years, the abortion giant has performed nearly one million abortions.
