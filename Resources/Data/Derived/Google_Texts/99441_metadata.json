Friday, he was a man of few words at the pre-race news conference, his gaze aimed at the table before him. He offered only brief responses to the few questions from reporters, most of whom were focused on the presence of University of Colorado alums Jenny Simpson and Brent Vaughn and their chances of winning.\n\nIt was expected to be unseasonably warm and comfortable, but by early morning, the warm temperatures and breeze were replaced with autumn-like cross country weather: cloudy, gray, windy and temperatures hovering in the upper 30s, instead of the expected high of 60 degrees.\n\nBut Saturday, he showed \u2014 despite the relative absence of wins and titles in his otherwise successful career \u2014 why no one should have doubted him.\n\nDerrick put as many as 30 seconds between him and the next-closest racer during the open men\u2019s 12K at Flatirons Golf Course. He finished in 36 minutes, 14 seconds \u2014 25 seconds ahead of Luke Puskedra of Eugene, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen they let me go (on the third 2K lap), I felt like I was going to win,\u201d said Derrick, 23. \u201cBut you never know at altitude. You can collapse pretty quick.\n\n\u201cBy the time we started the fourth lap there, I knew that I was still moving well and I felt like that I could build up a big enough lead there that I could hold on.\n\n\u201cI felt really good. My rhythm was good. I was going to wait a little longer, but I felt like I was in a groove, and I felt like they were letting me have it, so I took it.\u201d\n\nDerrick was in the top 10 at the NCAA cross country meet four times while at Stanford, one of only six men to accomplish that feat, but he never won a title. In 2012, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials in the 10,000 meters, missing the U.S. Olympic team by one spot.\n\nAt the finish line Saturday, Vaughn and Derrick breathlessly exchanged words.\n\n\u201cHe was disappointed in me because I didn\u2019t give him a run,\u201d said Vaughn, who finished sixth in 37:08. \u201cTo be honest, (my race) was embarrassing because this is my hometown and I just got blown away. It feels terrible right now, but in the long run it\u2019ll be a good thing, because that\u2019s a good motivator.\u201d\n\nSimpson also had disappointment, finishing second behind a similarly dominant performance from Amy Van Alstine of the newly formed Northern Arizona Elite, based in Flagstaff, Ariz. Van Alstine, who won by 22 seconds in 27:35 in the 8K race, was in disbelief after crossing ahead of Simpson, a two-time Olympian and world champion in the 1,500 meters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very surprised,\u201d Van Alstine, 26, said after the race. \u201cI know Jenny Simpson; she\u2019s an Olympian. But she\u2019s my competitor, so I didn\u2019t go into it thinking, \u2018She\u2019s going to beat me.\u2019 I\u2019m really happy. Amazed.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s race went out conservatively. Van Alstine expected one of the runners to eventually take control, but when no one did, she decided to take charge, created some space and never relinquished the lead.\n\n\u201cAmy is the most competitive athlete I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d said Lori Taylor, her college coach from the University of Richmond, who was in attendance. \u201cShe obviously has the tools, the work ethic \u2014 all the things that everybody has to have.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s Amy\u2019s competitiveness that makes her different and always has.\u201d\n\nThe race result was a long time coming for Van Alstine, who finished runner-up during the USA Club Cross Country Nationals in Bend, Ore., in December. She has seen flashes of success, but otherwise remains an unheralded runner on the national stage. The win Saturday was the biggest of her career.\n\n\u201cI just felt really good, and I was kind of surprised Jenny wasn\u2019t in front of me,\u201d she said.\n\nSimpson \u2014 a 1,500-meter specialist who has the range to compete internationally from 800 meters to 2 miles \u2014 had never raced this long in her career. And near the end of the race, it showed in her more labored stride as she sat in fifth place. But as she\u2019s known for on the track, she picked it up during the closing kilometers of the race, passed several racers and ended up in second place.\n\n\u201cAs much hype as there was about me coming and this \u2026 I was really well aware of how challenging it was going to be,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to pace out a 5-mile race before. So I really just tried to key off the front group and tried to stay in contact with the lead \u2014 and not get too excited too early.\u201d\n\nBut she wouldn\u2019t change anything. She had an opportunity to be at the Millrose Games in New York City this weekend, but chose instead to compete in her home training town of Boulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I really would have loved to win,\u201d said Simpson, 27. \u201cBut the way I fought back in the second (half), I\u2019m really proud of that.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty\n\nU.S. Cross Country Championships Results\n\nWomen\u2019s Results (8K)\n\n1.
