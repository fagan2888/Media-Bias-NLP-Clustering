It just came apart.\u201d\n\nHe was starving in Petaluma in 1991 and contemplating taking a step off the curb and into the path of a moving vehicle when a fellow homeless man sharing a bench at Walnut Park told him where he could get a free meal. Johnson discovered there was a soup kitchen operated by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and also survival assistance from a young humanitarian endeavor called COTS, Committee on the Shelterless.\n\nHe availed himself of the food and of the compassion shown by COTS founders Mary Isaak and Laura Reichek and their helpers, but he declined a bed in the organization\u2019s cold-weather shelter. \u201cIt was hard to sleep and it was too hot,\u201d he recalls.\n\nBesides, at an encampment along a creek or beneath a bridge Johnson could drink or take methamphetamine.\n\n\u201cI did whatever I could to keep the misery at bay,\u201d he said. \u201cI never wanted to live that way. I didn\u2019t enjoy it. But it became my life.\u201d\n\nFor most of the 1990s, more than half of his 30s, Johnson grabbed construction-site work where he could, slept on the dirt and forgot what it was like to have a checking account, a phone or TV, bills, medical care, even a stick of furniture, a drivers license or a reason to keep track of what day of the week it was.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago, in 1999, that he grew thoroughly sick of the homeless existence. He remembers telling Michelle Baines, then manager of COTS\u2019 former Elwood Opportunity Center, a place with a shower and a phone and access to community resources, \u201cI\u2019m ready. I\u2019m ready to change. If you give me a job I\u2019ll keep it and you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\n\nBaines hired him to cook at COTS\u2019 winter shelter. Having worked in construction in his late teens and early 20s, Johnson also talked himself into a summer job performing repairs and odd jobs at the agency\u2019s transitional house and other properties.\n\nThat was his new beginning.\n\nThrough a dozen-plus years he ascended the ranks of the ever expanding and increasingly comprehensive COTS. \u201cMy trajectory followed COTS\u2019 growth very closely,\u201d he said.\n\nIn mid-2013, the nonprofits\u2019 board named him to succeed departing Executive Director John Records, who moved on whose more than 20 years at the helm had brought COTS national recognition for innovations it brought to helping people rise up from homelessness.\n\nNow Johnson, lanky and soft-spoken but driven at age 52, runs the place. His office is on the third floor of the $3.4 million Mary Isaak Center in south Petaluma, home to a bustling community kitchen, separate shelters for families and adults and myriad health, financial, therapeutic and other services aimed at helping people who are homeless to transition back into homes and productive lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eight years.\n Among the reasons to believe nonprofit chief Mike Johnson may", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The formerly homeless leader of Petaluma's Committee on the Shelterless wants to help the thousands in Sonoma County who are still out there to find homes.", "title": "COTS chief says Sonoma County needs to do more for its homeless", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/3396654-181/cots-chief-county-needs-to", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=RT4WWnDnypZLB2L7hnsTgs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYulL0UgrkbQcvrox$Nxgz7sWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-01-18T16:35:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06db\"", "article_summary": "If you give me a job I\u2019ll keep it and you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201dBaines hired him to cook at COTS\u2019 winter shelter.\nThrough a dozen-plus years he ascended the ranks of the ever expanding and increasingly comprehensive COTS.\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago, in 1999, that he grew thoroughly sick of the homeless existence.\nHe remembers telling Michelle Baines, then manager of COTS\u2019 former Elwood Opportunity Center, a place with a shower and a phone and access to community resources, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\nJohnson discovered there was a soup kitchen operated by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and also survival assistance from a young humanitarian endeavor called COTS, Committee on the Shelterless."}
