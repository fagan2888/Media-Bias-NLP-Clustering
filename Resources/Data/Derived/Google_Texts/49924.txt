They call themselves the 'Tin Can Tourists', and they made a stop in Panama City this weekend.

The 'Tin Can Tourists' are a vintage trailer and motor coach club . They travel around the country to meet with fellow vintage RV enthusiasts to promote and share their passion with one another.

This weekend, the Tin Tourists are making their very first stop at St. Andrews State Park and they say they are enjoying themselves.

"It's beautiful here, we couldn't have asked for prettier weather," explained Elizabeth Malyszek, a Tin Can Tourist. "The water is gorgeous, the city itself is beautiful, we have enjoyed some of the antique shops yesterday, we are looking forward to some good seafood tonight. Very happy to be here in Panama City."

If you want to go check out the vintage RV's, the Tin Can Club will be at St. Andrews State Park for the rest of the weekend.
