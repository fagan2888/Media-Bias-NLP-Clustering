There was an actual curse at first, a longheld belief that the Chambal River was unholy. There was the land itself, and the more earthly curse of its poor-quality soil. And above all there were the bandits, hiding in the badlands and causing countless eruptions of violence and fear.\n\nBut instead of destroying the river, these things protected it by keeping the outside world away. The isolation created a sanctuary.\n\nIt is a place of crocodiles and jackals, of river dolphins and the occasional wolf. Hundreds of species of birds \u2014 storks, geese, babblers, larks, falcons and so many more \u2014 nest along the river. Endangered birds lay small speckled eggs in tiny pits they dig in the sandbars. Gharials, rare crocodile-like creatures that look like they swaggered out of the Mesozoic Era, are commonplace here and nowhere else.\n\nToday, tucked in a hidden corner of what is now a deeply polluted region, where the stench of industrial fumes fills the air in dozens of towns and tons of raw sewage is dumped every day into many rivers, the Chambal has remained essentially wild.\n\nBut if bad news saved the river, good news now threatens to destroy it. The modern world, it turns out, may be the most dangerous curse of all.\n\n___\n\nSAGES AND BANDITS\n\nThe fears that shaped this region go back more than a thousand years, to when sages said the Chambal (the term refers both to the river and the rugged land around it) had been cursed and villagers whispered that it was unholy. In a culture where rivers have long been worshipped, farmers avoided planting along the river\u2019s banks.\n\n\u201cPeople always said things were different in this area,\u201d says a laborer working along the Chambal River on a hot afternoon. He is thin, with the ropy toughness and the distrust of outsiders so common here. He gives only his first name, Gopal. \u201cPeople,\u201d he says, \u201cwere afraid to come.\u201d\n\nA few centuries later the bandits arrived, men who hid in the maze of riverside ravines and kept outsiders away for generations.\n\nThey were the last true protectors of the Chambal, it turns out.\n\nFor hundreds of years, the outlaws ruled the labyrinth of scrub-filled ravines and tiny villages along the river. Spread across thousands of square miles, the Chambal badlands is a place where a dirt path can reveal a tangle of narrow valleys with 100-foot-high walls, and where a bandit gang could easily disappear.\n\nThe bandits\u2019 power \u2014 rooted in caste divisions, isolation and widespread poverty \u2014 was enormous. Countless governments, from Moghul lords to British viceroys to Indian prime ministers, vowed to humble them. Countless governments failed.\n\nAs India modernized \u2014 as British rule gave way to independence, and a modern nation began to take shape \u2014 the Chambal remained a place apart, a feared region where politicians seemed more like criminals and where, in most villages, bandits were the true power.\n\n\u201cWe were so isolated for so long,\u201d says Hemrudra Singh, a soft-spoken aristocrat with a crumbling family fort overlooking the Chambal River from the village of Bhareh. He understands that isolation well. Until 10 years ago, Bhareh could only be reached by boat during the monsoon season.\n\nOnly in the late 1990s did life in the Chambal begin to change significantly. Ancient dirt paths became paved roads, prying open villages that had been isolated for centuries.\n\nThe bandits\u2019 local political patrons were driven from power. Their foot soldiers were killed in shootouts with police, and their hideouts were forced deeper into the ravines by the spread of new roads. The last famed bandit, Nirbhay Gujjar, was killed by police in 2005.\n\nToday, cellphone towers and motorcycle dealers and satellite TVs are everywhere. New businesses and new schools have opened, ushered in by years of Indian economic growth. Farmers struggling with the poor soil now have fertilizers and tractors.\n\nIn so many ways, that has been good news. Poverty remains widespread across the Chambal, but there are more roads now to get crops to market, and mobile phones to call the doctor when someone gets sick. Unemployment remains rampant, but there are occasional new jobs.\n\nWith the good, though, came troubles that threaten the Chambal and its wildlife: polluting factories, illegal sand mining and fish poachers who hack at gharials with axes when the animals get tangled in their nets. As India\u2019s population and economy grows, more people are moving closer to the river.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indian river, protected by a curse, faces the modern world", "title": "Indian river, protected by a curse, faces the modern world", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indian river, protected by a curse, faces the modern world", "title": "Indian river, protected by a curse, faces the modern world", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/indian_river_protected_by_a_curse_faces_the_modern_world/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/india-the-rivers-curse.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indian river, protected by a curse, faces the modern world", "title": "Indian river, protected by a curse, faces the modern world", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/india-the-rivers-curse.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tim Sullivan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fa1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPeople always said things were different in this area,\u201d says a laborer working along the Chambal River on a hot afternoon.\nThere was an actual curse at first, a longheld belief that the Chambal River was unholy.\n\u201cWe were so isolated for so long,\u201d says Hemrudra Singh, a soft-spoken aristocrat with a crumbling family fort overlooking the Chambal River from the village of Bhareh.\nBut instead of destroying the river, these things protected it by keeping the outside world away.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsBHAREH, India (AP) \u2014 For many centuries, it was a curse that saved the river."}
