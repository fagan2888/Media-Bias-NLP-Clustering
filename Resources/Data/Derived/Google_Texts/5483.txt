Welcome to Wingnut Bingo, the drinking game that celebrates former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum’s unparalleled ability to connect social issues in a way that makes very little logical sense but sounds very, very scary, regardless of one’s political views! Unfortunately, this game does not include any references to Santorum’s proclivity for wearing sweater vests, as we do not want anyone to have to drink so much they need to be hospitalized.

Santorum actually seems to be in on our game already, indicated by the whopper of bingo bait he gave a crowd of anti-choice advocates at the National Right to Life Committee’s annual convention on Friday. Affirming that he’ll continue to oppose same-sex marriage despite the Supreme Court’s recent ruling to extend the right to people in all 50 states, the GOP presidential hopeful explained that the decision is actually the result of “a cancer that is infecting the body of America” — a “cancer” otherwise known as Roe v. Wade.

That’s right, marriage equality (a bad thing) is legal only because abortion (an even worse thing) is legal, and Santorum is the only guy who seems to understand that this situation is going to destroy the world. Everybody take a shot.

And, since it’s almost the weekend, let’s take a few more shots at Santorum…and his favorite oratory topics. Have a bottle of tequila at the ready, but first grab yourself a beer. If you lean to the right, consider cracking open a Guinness, just like ole Rick; more progressive players might want to sip a “too bitter” IPA. Here we go!
