Summa Akron surgeon Eric Espinal, M.D., told NPR that using the checklist felt odd, but given NASCAR drivers and airline pilots use them to avoid mishaps, he could as well.\n\nThe medical and nursing staff also meet to discuss the costs of various cases, and what can be done to save money--such as cutting down on surgeon tardiness to make sure the hospital doesn't keep pricey operating rooms open and unused for large periods of time.\n\nQuality of care has not always been first and foremost in the minds of hospital leaders. A study published earlier this year indicated the chairs of boards of U.S. hospitals discussed the issue far less than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nDespite the changes being made at the policy and provider levels, the American public does not believe that the ACA will improve the quality of the healthcare they receive. According to a Quinnipiac survey released earlier this month, only 19 percent believe the ACA will improve the quality of the care they will receive, Politico reported. However, that low score is tied to the poor performance of the HealthCare.gov website, which is unrelated to patient care.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the NPR article\n\n- here's the Politico article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 ways patients and providers can improve care\n\nStudy: Hospital boards need more focus on quality of care\n\nU.S. patients report inferior care\n\nHFMA CEO: How to close the 'value gap' in care delivery\n\nHealth system giants launch collaborative to raise quality, cut costs", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act is not only altering the U.S. health insurance system and the way Americans obtain coverage, but is changing the way hospitals operate as well, NPR reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is not only altering the U.S. health insurance system and the way Americans obtain coverage, but is changing the way hospitals operate as well, NPR reported.", "title": "ACA changing ways hospitals operate", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/aca-changing-ways-hospitals-operate/2013-11-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "ACA,healthcare system,hospitals,Ken Berkovitz,Operations & Business Management,patient care,Summa Akron City Hospital", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Now, the hospital's medical staff follows checklists, such as whether patients receive their antibiotics on time, and whether catheters are removed on schedule.\nThe Affordable Care Act is not only altering the U.S. health insurance system and the way Americans obtain coverage, but it is also changing the way hospitals operate, NPR reported.\nAccording to a Quinnipiac survey released earlier this month, only 19 percent believe the ACA will improve the quality of the care they will receive, Politico reported.\nHowever, that low score is tied to the poor performance of the HealthCare.gov website, which is unrelated to patient care.\nQuality of care has not always been first and foremost in the minds of hospital leaders."}
