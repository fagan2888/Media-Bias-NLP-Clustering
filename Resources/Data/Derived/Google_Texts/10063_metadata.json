While 56 percent disapprove of how Obama has handled both international affairs and ObamaCare, nearly six in 10 think he has botched his response to immigration concerns.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nOverall, 65 percent responded that the nation is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nSome have predicted that disappointment with Obama will lead to trouble for Democrats across the board in the upcoming midterm elections. Though slightly more than half of all respondents affirmed their opinion on the presidency will not have any bearing on how they will vote in November, more than one quarter confirmed they plan to cast a ballot in opposition to Obama.\n\nThe news is not necessarily great for the GOP, either. More than seven in 10 said they disapprove of how Republican legislators have handled their job. Of course, that number is five points lower than those who disapprove of the current Congress altogether.\n\nThe poll seems to suggest voters are anxious to find new representatives in D.C., with two-thirds expressing an interest to \u201clook around for someone else to vote for\u201d compared to just 23 percent who plan to support a congressional incumbent.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nBy a slim 46-44 margin, the poll found that voters are more likely to vote for a Democrat in November than a Republican; however, 45 percent believe the GOP will take back the U.S. Senate, while only 40 percent think it will remain under Democrat control.\n\nFour in 10 voters believe there will be no noticeable difference if the controlling party in the Senate changes. Of those who think a big GOP win will bring about changes, though, a majority think it would be a positive shift.\n\nWhile more voters trust Republicans to actually handle the issues facing the nation, they tend to believe Democrats are \u201cmore concerned with the needs of people\u201d like them.\n\nPhoto credit: Ron Foster Sharif / Shutterstock.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"A nation of slow learners...\"", "author": "B.
