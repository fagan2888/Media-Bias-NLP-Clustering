After it was over, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told National Review\u2019s Robert Costa that when the new budget agreement expires in mid-January, \u201ca government shutdown is off the table. We\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d A chastened Republican Party has learned its lesson.\n\nOr has it? McConnell, after all, knew the shutdown strategy was a loser from the start. The true test of whether the shutdown\u2019s denouement has prompted GOP introspection is whether its reactionary flank, which drove events during the past two and a half weeks, feels at all chastened, and evidence strongly indicates it does not. Indeed, a contrarian meme has entered the national conversation. By losing, the GOP extremists actually won. Failure is the new success. It isn\u2019t, really\u2014failure is, and ever shall remain, just failure\u2014but the currency of this too-clever-by-half conceit does provide some insight into the right\u2019s capacity for self-delusion, and the press\u2019s unfortunate willingness to lend those delusions credence.\n\n\u201cWe Won\u2019t Back Down On Obamacare\u201d was the headline on an op-ed by Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation, in the Wall Street Journal, on the day after DeMint\u2019s efforts to block Obamacare\u2019s funding ended in humiliating defeat. \u201cWe will continue to fight,\u201d DeMint wrote. As usual, DeMint did not acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act was hatched in large part at Heritage itself\u2014its subsequent rejection by Heritage being nothing but crude partisan politics\u2013and that the people who developed the plan, Stuart Butler and Edmund Haislmaier, far from being tarred and feathered, remain employees in good standing at Heritage. (\u201cThe president-elect did not invent the idea of a health exchange,\u201d Butler wrote as recently as 2008. \u201cHe came up with his own version of an idea that\u2019s been refined by people like us at the Heritage Foundation.\u201d) For Heritage now to take pride of authorship in Obamacare would require it to acknowledge that there is value in bipartisan success. Instead, Heritage\u2019s reflexive opposition compels it to declare the law a miserable failure; to pronounce its own attempt to halt the law\u2019s implementation a glorious failure; and to continue its doomed crusade to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIf anybody lost stature in the shutdown wars, you\u2019d think it would be Ted Cruz, the obnoxious freshman senator from Texas who loudly opposed any and all accommodation with the Obama administration (though he did not obstruct its final passage, as many feared he would). Cruz\u2019s punishment? He won the presidential straw poll at the hard-right Values Voters Summit, his 42% plurality putting him well ahead of Dr. Ben Carson and Rick Santorum (13% each), Rand Paul (6%), and Marco Rubio (5%). Meanwhile, Bloomberg BusinessWeek reports that Cruz\u2019s extremism didn\u2019t really cost him support from big business, because he never had any to begin with, relying instead on a few eccentric tycoons. They pronounced themselves highly satisfied with Cruz\u2019s performance.\n\nAnother obvious loser in the events of this past week, one would think, was House Speaker John Boehner. Boehner\u2019s hostage-taking by his party\u2019s reactionary wing, with whose tactics he strongly disagreed, made him look pathetically weak. \u201cJohn, what happened?\u201d President Obama asked Boehner two days into the shutdown, according to an Oct. 18 account in Politico. \u201cI got overrun, that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Boehner replied. Jeez, how do you recover from a humiliation like that? Making matters worse, Boehner, once he gave in to the reactionaries, was unable to deliver anything for them. He couldn\u2019t even get them to vote for a ludicrously unrealistic final compromise that was never going to go anywhere in the Senate.\n\nSo they hate him, right? Au contraire. Politico\u2019s Ginger Gibson reports that the reactionary wing \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier with him\u201d because Boehner had the guts to ride this thing down with them to inevitable defeat. \u201cI\u2019ve been really proud of Speaker Boehner the last two-and-a-half weeks,\u201d Rep. Paul Labrador of Idaho told Politico. (In January Labrador wouldn\u2019t support Boehner\u2019s re-election as speaker.) For this reason, Politico\u2019s John Harris pronounces Boehner a member of the \u201cshutdown winner\u2019s club.\u201d Boehner won because he lost. But a less exuberantly creative interpreter than Harris, observing Boehner\u2019s inability to extract a single meaningful concession from the Obama White House, would be hard pressed not to conclude that, if \u201cshutdown clubs\u201d there must be, Boehner\u2019s rightful place is in the losing one.\n\nA more sophisticated (and more logical) version of the failure-is-the-new-success argument is put forward by Bloomberg BusinessWeek (whose cover headline is \u201cThe Tea Party Won\u201d) and Peter Beinart of the Daily Beast (\u201cWhy The Shutdown Is A Republican Victory\u201d). Bloomberg BusinessWeek\u2019s Peter Coy and Beinart both argue that by shifting the debate from the budget sequester to defunding Obamacare and assorted other ridiculous demands, Republicans extracted from the Democrats tacit acceptance of the sequester cuts. That\u2019s correct insofar as those spending cuts remain in place today, and that we didn\u2019t hear much about them during the shutdown fight. But it\u2019s premature to conclude that congressional Democrats and the White House have given up on eliminating the sequester (and it\u2019s simply absurd to suggest, as Bloomberg columnist Ezra Klein does, that Democrats ought to give up on raising taxes to tackle the deficit). If anything, the GOP\u2019s recent humiliation ought to strengthen Democrats\u2019 hand in future budget negotiations.\n\nBack in 2002, Tim Carvell, now head writer for the Daily Show, wrote an essay in Slate titled \u201cFailure Is The New Success.\u201d The business press had long promoted the not-unreasonable idea that business failure often preceded business success, more or less in the spirit of Jerome Kern\u2019s Depression-era tune, \u201cPick Yourself Up.\u201d But something new was afoot, Carvell wrote. \u201cThe notion of failure as the necessary prelude to success\u201d had \u201creached its decadent phase.\u201d Dennis Kozlowski, former chairman of Tyco, had left the company under an ethical cloud (he\u2019s currently in prison) on more favorable financial terms than if he\u2019d served out his contract. Bad movies (like Showgirls; a more current example would be The Room) got re-branded as camp. The British journalist Toby Young parlayed his spectacular failure in American journalism into a best-selling book (and subsequent movie) titled How To Lose Friends and Alienate People.\n\nNow the notion of failure as triumph has migrated from the business and entertainment worlds into the political realm, where it is getting sympathetic attention from the press. But let\u2019s be clear. The Republican Party has damaged itself with independent voters and with mainstream political donors, whose support in national elections will matter a lot more than the approval of hard-right fanatics. It may even have hurt its chances of maintaining a House majority. Failure isn\u2019t success. It\u2019s just failure. And what the GOP\u2019s right flank is experiencing right now, in government and the court of political opinion, is failure. Let\u2019s not congratulate them for it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Actually, it's not.
