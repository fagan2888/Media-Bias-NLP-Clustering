Voice Media Group eyeing sale

The Voice Media Group -- owner of alternative weeklies like The Village Voice and LA Weekly -- said Tuesday that it was exploring possible merger-and-acquisition options, including the sale of its publications.

Voice Media's circulation is down across its eleven titles, as online classifieds are making the print version increasingly irrelevant. Village Voice circulation has fallen 55 percent, to about 110,000, since 2006, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Voice Media, which is made up of a group of editors, bought 13 publications from Village Voice Media Holdings in 2012 and sold off SF Weekly and Seattle Weekly the following year. It has also comitted to selling the OC Weekly (in Southern California).

The group's other titles include Phoenix New Times, Denver Westword, The Dallas Observer, The Houston Press, Riverfront Times (of St. Louis), City Pages (of Minneapolis), New Times Broward-Palm Beach and Miami New Times.
