That form will determine the credit you\u2019re entitled to, based on your 2015 income. If you didn\u2019t receive an advanced premium credit throughout the year when paying your premiums, then you will receive that credit after you file your taxes.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Common Tax Mistakes That Can Cost You Hundreds\n\nHowever, if you received the credit throughout the year, reducing your monthly premium payment, then the form will show if you received a credit that was too big, too small or just the right amount given your income. If your credit was too large, you will owe the government the difference.\n\nThat happens when your income is more than you estimated it to be when you signed up through the marketplace last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated formula but basically the lower the income, the bigger the credit,\u201d says Perlman. \u201cBut an estimate is an estimate. You\u2019re supposed to notify the marketplace if there is a dramatic difference in income mid-stream such as big promotion or big bonus or the reverse like being laid off or switching to a lower-paying job.\u201d\n\nPerlman noted that any major life changes \u2013 such as getting married or divorced or having a child\u2014could also affect your tax return, and ultimately, your premium tax credit. This may be more of a problem for people who automatically renewed for healthcare coverage and used the same income estimate as the previous year, even though circumstances have changed.\n\nRelated: 10 Important Tax Dates for 2016\n\nIf you don\u2019t have Obamacare\n\nLast year, if you had health insurance through your employer, you only had to check a box showing you had coverage during the year. This year is no different, except you also will receive one of two new forms: either a 1095-C or 1095-B form, depending on the size of your employer.\n\nThese forms show you\u2019re insured through your job and can help determine your eligibility for a premium tax credit if your company\u2019s health plan costs more than 9.56 percent of your income. Workers should receive the forms by the end of January. In some instances, workers may receive both forms.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a minimum health coverage through your employer, Obamacare or other means, you might have to pay a penalty, just like last year. Except this time, the penalty is steeper. In 2015, it was increased to $325 per person for a maximum of 3 people or 2 percent of net household income, whichever is greater. In 2014, the penalty was much more manageable at $95 per person or 1 percent of net household income. The penalty is set to increase again next year to $695, or 2.5 percent of net household income.\n\nRelated: Tax Trouble: 32 Celebrities Who\u2019ve Tangled With the IRS\n\nThe penalty is deducted from your federal tax refund or added onto the amount you owe the federal government in taxes. In some cases, you may qualify for an exemption if you don\u2019t have adequate health coverage such as a general hardship or short coverage gaps. Look over the new Form 8965 carefully, though. There are fewer exemptions than last year.\n\nAlso, if you had no coverage last year and want insurance through Obamacare in 2016, the open enrollment period closes on Jan. 31.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This is the second year that the Affordable Care Act and taxes will collide, and two c", "title": "Filing Alert: How Obamacare Affects Your 2015 Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/25/Filing-Alert-How-Obamacare-Affects-Your-2015-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082012_obamacare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/25/Filing-Alert-How-Obamacare-Affects-Your-2015-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082012_obamacare_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This is the second year that the Affordable Care Act and taxes will collide, and two c", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "If you didn\u2019t receive an advanced premium credit throughout the year when paying your premiums, then you will receive that credit after you file your taxes.\nThat form will determine the credit you\u2019re entitled to, based on your 2015 income.\nIn some cases, you may qualify for an exemption if you don\u2019t have adequate health coverage such as a general hardship or short coverage gaps.\nIf you don\u2019t have a minimum health coverage through your employer, Obamacare or other means, you might have to pay a penalty, just like last year.\nAlso, if you had no coverage last year and want insurance through Obamacare in 2016, the open enrollment period closes on Jan. 31."}
