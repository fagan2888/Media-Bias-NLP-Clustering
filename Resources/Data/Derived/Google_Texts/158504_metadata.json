McNeill and Thomas also received $25,000 and $50,000, respectively, for the charities of their choice.\n\nBut just a dang moment, said the promotion's London-based underwriters, Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital, White Mountains Re Sirius Capital and Markel Capital Limited. The money guys on the hook for those crowd-pleasers filed suit last week in U.S. District Court in Beckley, West Virginia, claiming that the aces weren't long enough.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim they should be let off the hook because the policy, issued to Old White Charities, the Greenbrier's nonprofit financial arm, clearly stipulates a minimum distance of 170 yards on the 18th hole for an ace to warrant a blizzard of \"Benjamins.\" The suit further claims that Old White Charities never paid its premium of $106,470 by its July 1 deadline.\n\nOld White Charities was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe long odds of a hole-in-1\n\nGranted, both players hit their aces with pitching wedges. The technology of golf equipment and the strength-training of tour pros have evolved to turn the modern game into something of a 3-club affair of driver, wedge and putter.\n\nThat said, an ace from 137 yards is hardly a chip-in. Or, more colloquially, an ace is an ace is an ace.\n\nAccording to the National Hole In One Association (I know; who knew?), the odds of us duffers holing an ace are approximately 12,500-1. A low-handicap golfer cuts that to 5,000-1, and a pro golfer halves that again to 2,500-1.\n\nTiger Woods hit his first ace at age 6; LPGA pro Michelle Wie holed her first at age 12.\n\nWaddaya say? Is it a gimmie? Or will Old White Charities be stuck with an enormous 19th-hole bar tab?\n\nHere's how insurers protect celebrity jewelry.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @omnisaurus.\n\nVeteran contributing editor Jay MacDonald is co-author of \"Future Millionaires' Guidebook.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "charitable giving", "description": "Charitable giving has its own set of insurance rules.
