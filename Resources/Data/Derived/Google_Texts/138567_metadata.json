It was over. This is like it was made in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nWhen the Rams left, untold thousands of local fans stayed faithful with little reason to believe they would ever see their beloved blue and gold back home.\n\n\u201cIt was like a supermodel leaving you,\u201d said 70-year-old Don Kirst, who paid 25 cents in 1957 to watch the Rams take on the Detroit Lions in his first Rams game at the Coliseum.\n\nMost fans at the rally wore gear in the L.A. Rams\u2019 traditional blue and gold shades, with many sporting jerseys from the 1970s and earlier. The most popular jersey was probably the No. 29 of Eric Dickerson, who set the single-season NFL rushing record in 1984.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy anything with that horrible snail logo,\u201d Troy said, referring to the St. Louis redesign of the traditional Rams horns.\n\nFormer Rams kickers Mike Lansford and Luis Zendejas attended the rally, signing autographs and addressing the crowd. Lansford, who kicked barefooted from 1982-90, is a Los Angeles-area native.\n\n\u201cI bleed blue and gold, just like you guys do,\u201d Lansford said to the crowd. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being the all-time leading scorer of a franchise that doesn\u2019t exist. \u2026 The previous owner, she wanted nothing to do with us. When Kroenke took over, he really reached out to people like us.\u201d\n\nThe Rams played at the Coliseum for 34 years before moving to Anaheim in 1980 for 15 more seasons of diminishing attendance. If the Rams are allowed to return, the historic Coliseum seems likely to be the Rams\u2019 temporary home again for two or three seasons until Kroenke builds his $1.86 billion stadium complex in Inglewood.\n\nThe Raiders and Chargers also were represented at the rally by a few fans of each team and banners towed behind planes. The Raiders have a robust fan base in every corner of California, and supporters considered holding a competing rally at the Coliseum on Saturday morning before deciding against it.\n\nThe Chargers claim 25 percent of their fan base is from the Los Angeles area. A handful of fans showed up at the Coliseum with \u201cLA Chargers\u201d gear.\n\nThe NFL is strongly considering the simultaneous move of two teams into the market, but any combination of the three is still possible. The league also could decide to delay its decision on relocation for a year.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boisterous Los Angeles Rams fans gathered for a rally at the Coliseum on Saturday, heralding their NFL franchise's possibly imminent return to Southern California after a 21-year sojourn in St. Louis.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Boisterous Los Angeles Rams fans gathered for a rally at the Coliseum on Saturday, heralding their NFL franchise\u2019s possibly imminent return to Southern California after a 21-year sojourn in St. Louis.", "title": "LA Rams fans rally at Coliseum to demand team\u2019s return", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/9/la-rams-fans-rally-at-coliseum-to-demand-teams-ret/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/09/la_rams_rally_football.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/09/la_rams_rally_football.jpeg", "description": "Boisterous Los Angeles Rams fans gathered for a rally at the Coliseum on Saturday, heralding their NFL franchise's possibly imminent return to Southern California after a 21-year sojourn in St. Louis.", "card": "summary", "title": "LA Rams fans rally at Coliseum to demand team\u2019s return"}, "Author": "GREG BEACHAM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - Boisterous Los Angeles Rams fans gathered for a rally at the Coliseum on Saturday, heralding their NFL franchise\u2019s possibly imminent return to Southern California after a 21-year sojourn in St. Louis.\nFrom long-faithful adults to 11-year-olds who have never seen the Rams in L.A., the fans brimmed with optimism about the NFL\u2019s impending decision on pro football\u2019s return to Los Angeles.\nMost fans at the rally wore gear in the L.A.
