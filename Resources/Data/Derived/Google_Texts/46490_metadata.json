It recently started offering a double cheeseburger and fries for $2.50 as a summer deal and rolled out an \u201cartisan grilled chicken sandwich.\u201d It has also, among other things, enlarged its quarter pounder, tested a new breakfast bowl full of kale, rolled out flavored hot coffee in some locations and even tested a lobster roll in New England restaurants. And it upped the toasting time for its hamburger buns by 5 seconds.\n\nSo far, though, the new deals and menu options have failed to entice diners.\n\nRelated: 9 Ways McDonald\u2019s Wants to Get You Excited About Its Food Again\n\nEasterbrook did acknowledge that changing McDonalds\u2019 image would take time, but he said Thursday that the company is \u201cseeing early signs of momentum.\u201d\n\nThe company will begin to offer all-day breakfast, which already accounts for 25 percent of the company\u2019s sales. And it is continuing to simplify its menu options to lower costs.\n\nAnalysts wonder if such changes will be enough to boost consumer appetites for McDonald\u2019s and how the company is going to reposition its brand.
