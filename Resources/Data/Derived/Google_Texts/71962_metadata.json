But it is clear our schools aren\u2019t turning out enough graduates who are prepared for the today\u2019s real world.\n\nTry these statistics compiled by the feds: One-fourth of the potential workers in the 25-to-34 age bracket are unemployed today. And between 2006 and 2013, median earnings for college grads increased only 6 percent. For the workforce at large, the jump was 15 percent.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe could ponder that at length. But let\u2019s get right to some good news: There are two public high schools in the metro area that are answering the challenges of the 21st century, Warren Tech \u2014 which has two campuses, in Lakewood and Arvada \u2014 and Pickens Technical College in Aurora.\n\nWhile somewhat different in their approach, they are preparing kids for jobs. Perhaps the motto at Pickens sums it up: \u201cEducation that works.\u201d\n\nJoe Shaw, who is starting his 11th year as principal at Warren Tech, says changes at the school during that time have been \u201cincredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t change with the times, we\u2019d be out of business,\u201d he emphasizes.\n\nSome 1,500 Jefferson County high school students attend classes at one of the two Warren campuses for three hours each day \u2014 either in morning or afternoon sessions. The rest of the day is spent at their regular \u201chome\u201d high school. Warren offers more than two dozen career-related courses of study in such areas as health care and medical sciences, computer science, food services, computer security and digital audio production.\n\n\u201cOur three Rs are rigor, relevance and relationships,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cWe feel we have the best facilities, the best staff and the best students.\u201d Yet, he explains that the student body is not \u201ccherry-picked\u201d for their academic skills. \u201cWe have everything from special education kids to class valedictorians.\n\n\u201cThey are here because this is what they want to do.\u201d\n\nWarren serves students from throughout Jefferson County as well as some from the Gilpin, Clear Creek and the Platte Canyon districts, so some travel as long as two hours just to get to the school and back. School buses do not serve Warren.\n\nDespite expanding with a second campus at Arvada West High five years ago, Warren still has a waiting list for admission.\n\nHowever, Shaw admits the school still has an \u201cimage problem,\u201d both among youths and their parents. To many, it still retains the image of a traditional \u201ctrade school,\u201d which Warren pretty much was in its earlier years. \u201cSome think we\u2019re just a school where the dumb kids go,\u201d he says. \u201cMy main job is marketing what we really are and what we offer.\u201d\n\nActually, it may be where the smart kids go. Here are some things that clearly set Warren apart:\n\n\u2022 Integration of academics and technical and vocational training. All of the courses offer regular academic credit in at least one subject. For instance, students in the machine shop study trig; those in health sciences get versed in anatomy; and those studying hydraulics learn chemistry and physics at the same time. Briefly put, they use what they learn. There is no wondering, \u201cWhy am I taking this? I\u2019ll never use it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Flexibility. The school can change course offerings and subject matter based on demands of the workplace. For instance, courses in masonry have been dropped but offerings in cyber-security and emergency response have been added.\n\n\u2022 College credits. Warren offers nine programs in conjunction with Red Rocks Community College. Some grads get diplomas from both schools at the same time. Shaw estimates that his students received $750,000 worth of college credits last year \u2014 without paying college tuition. How\u2019s that for a way to combat the high cost of a college education?\n\n\u2022 Faculty. Teachers are full-time employees of the school but they must have at least five years of work experience in their area of expertise. Warren teachers can earn higher pay than their counterparts at other schools. \u201cIn recruiting our teachers, we have to compete with the workplace,\u201d Shaw explains.\n\n\u2022 Industry partnerships. Each course of study has a citizen advisory committee comprised of members of the trade, craft or industry. There is an awareness that technology changes, and rapidly. In addition, manufacturers and other companies have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment to the school. And there are other close relationships between the school and employers, including NASA and St. Anthony Hospital.\n\nAlthough many Warren students have to travel a long way to get to class, the attendance rate is 93 percent. \u201cWe treat them like college students,\u201d Shaw explains. \u201cThey are not wandering around the halls. They are here for a purpose. We had only three disciplinary issues last year.\u201d\n\nThe graduation rate for Warren students is 85 percent, the same figure as the district average. Sixty-seven percent of graduates go on to college. Many of those who don\u2019t can readily find well-paying jobs.\n\nPickens, which is operated jointly by the Aurora Schools and the state community college system, serves both high school students (who take career-based elective classes) and older post-grads, who work for community college certification and pay a modest tuition.\n\nThe 1,300 students are divided almost equally between the two. The high-schoolers get their required core academic classes at other traditional schools. Pickens also accepts students from 11 other school districts.\n\nAlmost 50 technical and vocational courses are offered, some in night classes. They range from construction technology to computer sciences to human services, such as barbering.\n\nThe success of the two schools and the key role they play beg the question: Why aren\u2019t there more schools like Warren and Pickens?\n\nThere should be. But they are more expensive to operate than traditional high schools, and even mid-sized school districts likely don\u2019t have the resources or the school population base to make them practical. The obvious answer would be two or more districts combining to create a Warren or Pickens at a central location. You\u2019d think more school boards would examine those possibilities.\n\nThe success of these schools does not mean that a large number of youngsters should not follow the traditional path of aiming for a four-year education at a university.\n\nThe clear message today, however, is that a diploma doesn\u2019t guarantee a well-paying job. More than ever, before spending the big bucks kids and parents need a career plan and a goal for what the college degree will lead to after graduation day. Good luck with that bachelor\u2019s in Tibetan Culture.\n\nGetting an early start on a career path is also important in many cases. If your toddler says, \u201cI want to be a fireman when I grow up,\u201d perhaps you should encourage him or her and start checking which schools offer fire science.\n\nWhat Shaw calls a \u201chead start\u201d is part of the normal process at Warren. It is key to selecting the right courses at the school, as well as later at a community college or university.\n\nThere is an important flip side to that, too. Some kids come to Warren and find in the first year that what they are studying isn\u2019t what they wanted after all. But changing direction early prevents a waste of time and tuition money down the road.\n\nThe message in Pickens Tech\u2019s recruiting video cuts right through the political baloney of our day. Says the narration: \u201cMany experts will tell you how to stimulate the economy. \u2026 They will tell you about their complicated plans.\u201d\n\nThen, a cross-section of Pickens students, dressed in welders\u2019 gear and medical aide uniforms, look into the camera and say, \u201cI am America\u2019s stimulus plan.\u201d\n\nIn reality, they are.\n\nDick Hilker (dhilker529@aol.com) of Arvada is a retired suburban Denver newspaper editor and columnist.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hilker: At two Colorado technical schools, \u201ceducation that works\u201d", "title": "Hilker: At two Colorado technical schools, \u201ceducation that works\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/15/hilker-at-two-colorado-technical-schools-education-that-works/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815__20140817_Z00_OP17P_HILKERp2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815__20140817_Z00_OP17P_HILKERp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-15T14:12:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:55:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Although many Warren students have to travel a long way to get to class, the attendance rate is 93 percent.\nThe rest of the day is spent at their regular \u201chome\u201d high school.\nWe had only three disciplinary issues last year.\u201dThe graduation rate for Warren students is 85 percent, the same figure as the district average.\n\u201cWe treat them like college students,\u201d Shaw explains.\nSome 1,500 Jefferson County high school students attend classes at one of the two Warren campuses for three hours each day \u2014 either in morning or afternoon sessions."}
