The Urbee, an electric vehicle with ethanol backup, needed to be light and strong like a falcon and fast like a cheetah. But making this happen took a special 3-D printing technology to deliver strength and speed at a low weight.\n\nBy late 2011, Kor and his team had designed their dream. They built the car\u2019s body in Stratasys\u2019 RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie.\n\nComputers read the design software and \u201cprinted\u201d each car part layer by layer. A plastic bumper was born, then a hood and so on. While 3-D printing has long been used to make gears, grilles, tools, parts and prototypes for other manufacturers, it had never been used to build the entire body of a car.\n\nA part of a Urbee car was placed into the 3D printer that makes it at RedEye by Stratasys in Eden Prairie.\n\n\u201cIt became the first car to have its body 3-D printed,\u201d Kor said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the greenest practical car ever made. The Urbee uses eight times less energy than the average little car.\u201d\n\nStratasys, the leader in the 3-D printing world, is thrilled about the vehicle\u2019s possibilities. \u201cWithout 3-D printing you can\u2019t make a car as efficient as this one,\u201d said Stratasys spokesman Joe Hiemenz.\n\nTraditional prototyping takes years of altering designs, tooling and materials. With 3-D printing, designers can tweak details on a computer and click the Print icon.\n\nOnce printed, the Urbee car parts were shipped and assembled back in Kor\u2019s lab in Winnipeg. They were outfitted with two electric motors and a small ethanol engine. Today, the two-seater, three-wheeled Urbee is on tour. It\u2019s in England this month, where science and car enthusiasts are going ga-ga over the vehicle.\n\n\u201cOne day all cars will look like this. \u2026 I\u2019d like to license two-and-a-half billion Urbees,\u201d Kor said with a laugh, noting that there are only 1 billion cars in the world today. The goal is to commercialize his baby and to sell each one for about $16,000, the price of a Fiat 500. \u201cWe need a sustainable car like this. But it has to be low-priced and affordable,\u201d Kor said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Stratasys customer service supervisor Ashley Voigt hoisted a red Urbee bumper from one of Stratasys\u2019 refrigerator-sized printing machines. \u201cThis one took a straight day and a half to make. We could have made it faster if we didn\u2019t care how it looked,\u201d Voight said. By taking the time to precisely lay each plastic fiber, she got a smooth high-resolution surface that looks like a finished part.\n\nDuring an industry conference at Stratasys last month, Kor said he has already designed the Urbee 2. The first-generation Urbee gets 70 miles per gallon of fuel, while the Urbee 2 will get 120 to 290 miles per gallon.\n\nBut Kor first needs $3 million to convert drawings into reality. Fundraising started Oct. 30. If successful, production will begin in 2014 at Stratasys\u2019 RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie. A cross-country drive from New York to San Francisco is scheduled for 2015. On board will be Kor, his son and dog.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start with a half-scale model car in 2014. Once we have that tested, we are only a month away from making the full-scale model,\u201d Kor said. Because all the design components are in the computer, it doesn\u2019t take long to scale up.\n\nHiemenz said Stratasys is excited by Urbee\u2019s possibilities. \u201cJim is this long-haired and small-town guy with a great idea. This car can be charged from a garage outlet or with power from a solar panel kit attached to the car.\u201d\n\nThe Urbee is one of the sexier outcomes of the 3-D printing revolution. Twenty years ago, 3-D plastic \u201cprinting\u201d was a garage hobby. Now it\u2019s a $2.2 billion industry enthusiastically embraced by General Electric, General Motors, UPS and by Minnesota-based firms such as GVL Poly, Proto Labs and Anderson-Crane.\n\n\u201cIt took 20 years to make $1 billion. It only took five years to grow to $2.2 billion. We predict it will take three years to double again\u201d and by 2021 will be a $10.8 billion industry, said Tim Caffrey, an industry consultant with Wohlers Associates.\n\nWith 18,000 customers, 1,600 employees and $470 million in estimated 2013 revenue, Stratasys is the industry leader. It makes commercial and personal 3-D printers, and has a string of \u201cRedEye by \u00adStratasys\u201d \u00adfactories that act as third-party \u00adcontractors for other manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe call it the factory of the future,\u201d said RedEye general manager Jim Bartel last month while leading Kor and others on a tour of the 92 machines that print products for customers around the country.\n\nThe odorless factory buzzed with a sound akin to an inkjet printer, but these machines dispensed plastic fibers, not ink. \u201cThis is literally printing on demand. So we call this our digital factory,\u201d Bartel said. RedEye has facilities in the United States, Belgium, Turkey and Australia, and will soon open a medical equipment printing plant in Shanghai.\n\nStratasys CEO David Reis said the technology is ideal for quickly turning prototypes or parts for the likes of Kor Ecolgic and other manufacturers. Sales were $324 million in 2012. Reis just boosted his estimate for 2013 from $455 million to $470 million. Beyond that, he said the company is looking at printing metals. \u201cWe are in the process of evaluating metal, but if we do it, we would not do this on our own.\u201d\n\nAs for Kor, he said \u201cno thanks\u201d to metal. For him, the beauty of the Urbee is its aerodynamic and lightweight structure. \u201cWe tried metal. We built a clay car. We scanned and simulated the aerodynamics,\u201d Kor said.\n\nIn the end, the strong plastics proved best.\n\n\n\nDee DePass \u2022 612-673-7725\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "In Stratasys' RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie, computers read the design software and \"printed\" each car part layer by layer.", "title": "Stratasys 3-D printers go to work building a car", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/stratasys-3-d-printers-go-to-work-building-a-car/231299691/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138395471069824.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138395471069824.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "In Stratasys' RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie, computers read the design software and \"printed\" each car part layer by layer.", "title": "Stratasys 3-D printers go to work building a car", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/stratasys-3-d-printers-go-to-work-building-a-car/231299691/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138395471069824.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138395471069824.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In Stratasys' RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie, computers read the design software and \"printed\" each car part layer by layer."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee08\"", "article_summary": "They built the car\u2019s body in Stratasys\u2019 RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie.\nIf successful, production will begin in 2014 at Stratasys\u2019 RedEye 3-D printing factory in Eden Prairie.\nA part of a Urbee car was placed into the 3D printer that makes it at RedEye by Stratasys in Eden Prairie.\n\u201cWithout 3-D printing you can\u2019t make a car as efficient as this one,\u201d said Stratasys spokesman Joe Hiemenz.\nBut making this happen took a special 3-D printing technology to deliver strength and speed at a low weight."}
