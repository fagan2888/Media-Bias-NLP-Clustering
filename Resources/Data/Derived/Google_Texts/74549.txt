Thousands of students and residents in the Joplin area will have shelter during the upcoming severe weather season thanks to the construction of safe rooms that began after the deadly May 2011 tornado.

The Joplin Globe reports local school districts have spent more than $100 million on construction safe rooms since the tornado, which killed 161 people and destroyed schools, homes and businesses. Many of the safe rooms are finished, several others are expected to be ready soon. A few others won't be ready until summer or early fall.

The final safe room to be built at a Joplin school is nearly finished. Other safe rooms nearing completion or recently completed in the Joplin region are in Carl Junction, Carthage, Seneca, Diamond and Riverton, Kansas.
