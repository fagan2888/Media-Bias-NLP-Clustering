Grant, Business News, Politics News\n\nThis article originally appeared on GlobalPost\n\nFor the first time in more than a century a woman will feature on a US banknote.\n\nThe lucky woman \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been decided who yet, but there\u2019s a listof worthy candidates including Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt \u2014 will appear on the redesigned $10 bill, which now features the portrait of America\u2019s first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. The bill will be released in 2020 to mark 100 years of female suffrage in the United States.\n\nThis should be something to celebrate, right? Not so fast. And here\u2019s why.\n\nWhen Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced the \u201chistoric decision\u201d on Wednesday, he indicated the \u201cnotable woman\u201d would not be alone on the greenback.\n\nThat\u2019s right, she will have to share the banknote with Hamilton. They\u2019ll either appear together in one design or the Treasury will design more than one version.\n\n\u201cIt was personally very important to me to make sure that as we make this decision we continue to honor Alexander Hamilton who played such a formative role in the creation our country, the establishment of democracy as we know it and the principle of the soundness of our currency,\u201d Lew told reporters.\n\nThe United States has seven banknotes in circulation \u2014 the $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 \u2014 and each one features a male political statesman or president. Alone.\n\nSurely, the Treasury could dedicate one banknote to a woman?\n\nNope.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only reason why we shouldn\u2019t be cheering Lew\u2019s announcement, says campaign group Women on 20s. They\u2019ve been lobbying US President Barack Obama to replace Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, whose face now occupies the $20 bill, with a woman.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason why they chose the $20 note and not, say, the $50 bill, which carries the image of former President and Civil War Commander Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nMany Americans, particularly Native Americans, consider Jackson to be a \u201cgenocidal maniac,\u201d \u201cmass murderer\u201d or \u201cIndian killer\u201d for his appalling treatment of Native American tribes in the early 19th century.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We really couldn't feature a woman by herself?
