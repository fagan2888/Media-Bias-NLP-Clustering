After a two-year transition period, the funds will float in value like other mutual funds.\n\nHowever, the SEC said it has worked with other government agencies to reduce the accounting impact. The change is \u201cnow possible because of key tax guidance that the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have advised us they will release later today,\u201d SEC Chair Mary Jo White said at an open meeting on Wednesday.\n\nGuidance from tax authorities will eliminate \u201csignificant costs,\u2019\u2019 she added, and let investors in institutional prime money-market funds use a simpler accounting method to determine tax gains and losses on the fund. The Internal Revenue Service, for example, is expected simplify \u2018\u2019wash sale\u2019\u2019 rules that normally complicate rapid purchase-and-sale transactions in the same security.\n\nWithout guidance, investors in the funds would have to track individual transactions for tax reporting, which corporate treasurers have complained would impose an unbearable compliance cost.\n\nCorporations, which are regular users of the $2.6 trillion money-market fund industry, will be eager to see if the guidance will make it easier to continue using the market.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that the [Internal Revenue Service] does not or cannot effectively address the issue, it will both undermine the goal of the SEC\u2019s rule and have material implications of the cost-benefit analysis the SEC conducted,\u201d David Hirschmann, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness said Wednesday.\n\nUpdate: The Treasury Department\u2018s guidance is available here and the IRS has released guidance here.\n\nWrite to Emily Chasan at emily.chasan@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 Wednesday for sweeping changes to institutional money-market fund, but is working with other government agencies to reduce the accounting impact.", "title": "Tax Accounting to Be Simplified for Money-Market Funds", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2014/07/23/tax-accounting-to-be-simplified-for-money-market-funds/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CA271_IRS032_G_20140320084133.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Tax Accounting to Be Simplified for Money-Market Funds", "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 Wednesday for sweeping changes to institutional money-market fund, but is working with other government agencies to reduce the accounting impact.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Emily Chasan", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CFO Journal.
