Roberts Jr. has shown no inclination to insert himself into the political controversy over filling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. last week showed he has no intention of inserting himself into the current political controversy over filling the seat on the Supreme Court left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nBut in a 10-minute answer to a question in an Embassy Suites ballroom in northwest Arkansas, Roberts made clear what he does consider his job to be as the nation\u2019s 17th chief justice: a fierce defender of the judiciary\u2019s independence and a firm believer in judicial restraint \u2014 albeit a kind that at times is apparent only to him.\n\n[Roberts refuses to be drawn into controversy over Scalia\u2019s replacement]\n\nRoberts, 61 and now more than 10 years into his tenure, spoke to judges and lawyers from the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which stretches from Arkansas to North Dakota. In what were his most extended public remarks since Scalia\u2019s death in February, Roberts was determined not to take sides in the fight between Republicans and Democrats over whether to make the court whole again by confirming President Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland.\n\nThe Fix's Amber Phillips breaks down three ways the Merrick Garland nomination could play out. Which do you think is most likely? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nRoberts batted away a question about how the ideologically divided eight-member Supreme Court is functioning and refused to talk even about his own earlier observations that the court\u2019s reputation is suffering collateral damage from Washington\u2019s partisan political gridlock.\n\n[Roberts says political wars damage Supreme Court\u2019s reputation]\n\nBut Roberts was far more revealing when 8th Circuit Chief Judge William Jay Riley asked what the chief justice had learned from the 16 men who proceeded him.\n\nRoberts did not need to remind the audience that his official title is chief justice of the United States.\n\n\u201cYou realize, first and foremost, your responsibility to protect the separation of powers, which is of vital importance, even in little things,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI know that I represent you judges, here, in Washington.\u201d\n\nRoberts has made clear that he is not a fan of the president\u2019s State of the Union address. But he has gone every year he has been in his office, and he says his place of prominence in the front row is only proper.\n\n\u201cIf the president is going to be here and the speaker of the House is going to be here, I\u2019m going to be here, or I\u2019m not going,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I represent the judicial branch and that has to be shown [respect], even as a matter of protocol.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019s actions on the bench back that up. The only time he teamed up with the court\u2019s liberal justices to save a campaign finance restriction was upholding Florida\u2019s ban on judges asking directly for campaign contributions.\n\n[States may ban judicial candidates from personal fundraising]\n\n\u201cJudges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way of the ballot,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nLast month, he disagreed with his colleagues who held that a statute passed by Congress to help terrorism victims win their lawsuit against Iran\u2019s national bank did not intrude on the judiciary\u2019s powers.\n\nRoberts wrote a lofty dissent that detailed and praised the framers\u2019 decisions to safeguard the judiciary in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe authority of the political branches is sufficient; they have no need to seize ours,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nThat separation, Roberts said, is also the lesson to be learned from former chief justices John Marshall \u2014 \u201cthe greatest hero of our profession\u201d \u2014 and Roger B. Taney \u2014 \u201cthe greatest failure.\u201d\n\nMarshall\u2019s 1803 opinion in Marbury v. Madison established that it is the judiciary\u2019s exclusive province to \u201csay what the law is.\u201d But the genius of Marshall\u2019s opinion, Roberts said, was its finding that the court lacked the power to grant William Marbury\u2019s commission as a justice of the peace.\n\nThe decision \u201cwas the epitome of restraint,\u201d Roberts said. Marshall said \u201cthis is up to Congress to resolve.\u201d He diffused the conflict \u201cby staying out of it.\u201d\n\nRoberts said Taney did the opposite in his landmark 1857 ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford, which said that slaves and their descendents could not be American citizens and thus could not sue in federal courts. Taney\u2019s view of the slavery question that was tearing the country apart was \u201cthe president is not doing anything about this, Congress cannot solve this, it\u2019s up to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018Congress, you do not have the power to enact the Missouri Compromise because African Americans aren\u2019t people under the Constitution,\u201d Roberts continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the shamefulness of the legal opinion, it\u2019s the fact that it was an exercise of judicial activism. . . . He inserted the judiciary into most divisive political controversy in our history.\u201d\n\nRoberts paused. \u201cSo you learn that.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019s remarks last week were a reminder of his modest but engaging performance more than a decade ago at his confirmation hearings. But some of his most important decisions as chief justice have shown that \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nMany Republicans simply will not forgive him for his majority decision in 2012 upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. He believed it was the court\u2019s responsibility to look for a way to find the act constitutional.\n\nBut not a single fellow justice was willing to join the entirety of his compromise opinion, which eventually won five votes.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) seemed to be referring to the Obamacare decision when he said that \u201cmany of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the chief justice is part\u201d of the problem of the court being seen as political. \u201cThey believe that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. And certainly there are academics who agree.\u201d\n\nSome of those academics last week were even debating whether Roberts\u2019s role in saving the Affordable Care Act led to the anger in the Republican Party that gave rise to Donald Trump\u2019s success.\n\nOn the left, the charge is that Roberts has abandoned his sense of restraint when the subject is a conservative cause in which he believes. They point to his vote in striking a key part of the Voting Rights Act that had only years before been reauthorized by overwhelming majorities of Congress.\n\nRoberts had long been a critic of a provision that required some states with a history of discrimination to have any changes in election law approved in advance by the Justice Department or federal judges.\n\nWhere was the deference to the political branches, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked in her dissent to Shelby County v. Holder.\n\n\u201cCongress approached the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA with great care and seriousness. The same cannot be said of the court\u2019s opinion today,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNeither of those cases is finished business.\n\nBefore the justices finish their current term next month, they will issue their fourth decision on some aspect of Obamacare. And lawsuits filed on the restrictive voting laws that some states passed in the wake of the Shelby County ruling are filling the federal courts and finding their way to the Supreme Court.\n\nMore opportunities for the court to, as Roberts said last week, \u201cdo our job and mind the business that is ours under the Constitution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chief Justice John Roberts is determined not to take sides in the political fight over filling a Supreme Court seat.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Chief Justice John Roberts is determined not to take sides in the political fight over filling a Supreme Court seat.", "title": "Roberts emphasizes high court\u2019s restraint, independence", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/chief-justice-says-independence-and-restraint-should-be-high-courts-guiding-lights/2016/05/07/c42fdf5c-139d-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/04/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court_Roberts-04b06.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/chief-justice-says-independence-and-restraint-should-be-high-courts-guiding-lights/2016/05/07/c42fdf5c-139d-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c42fdf5c-139d-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "courts"}, "article_summary": "Roberts did not need to remind the audience that his official title is chief justice of the United States.\nThe same cannot be said of the court\u2019s opinion today,\u201d she wrote.\nBut some of his most important decisions as chief justice have shown that \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d is in the eye of the beholder.\n[Roberts says political wars damage Supreme Court\u2019s reputation]But Roberts was far more revealing when 8th Circuit Chief Judge William Jay Riley asked what the chief justice had learned from the 16 men who proceeded him.\nChief Justice John G.
