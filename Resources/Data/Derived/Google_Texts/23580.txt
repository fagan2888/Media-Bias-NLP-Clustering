History buffs and those with fond memories the Kansas Statehouse will be able to own a piece of the building.

The state is planning to auction off thousands of items salvaged from the renovated Kansas Statehouse in Topeka. The online auction is scheduled May 2-9.

The Kansas City Star reports bids will be taken on items ranging from brass hinges and door knobs to large desks and winding staircases.

Dave Webb of Stillwell, a former state representative and senator who now runs an auction house, will conduct the event. He says the highlight of the auction is the copper door that protected the staircase leading to the Statehouse dome.

The salvage comes after a 13-year, $325 million renovation that was completed last year.
