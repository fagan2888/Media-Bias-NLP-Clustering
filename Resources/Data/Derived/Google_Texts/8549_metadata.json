And that\u2019s why, from a Department of Health perspective, meaning [the] Nevada State Department of Health, we were closely watched from the planning [stages],\u201d Fajardo said.\n\nAt Fajardo\u2019s new clinic, three features will ensure top safety and care.\n\nFirst, the new surgicenter will follow new rules set by Nevada\u2019s health department, which state that colonoscopes \u2014 the tubes used to inspect the inside of the large intestine \u2014 must be thoroughly cleansed in four rooms. This is a change from the old rules, which allowed the cleansing to be done in one room.\n\nIn the first room, the tube will be manually washed. In the second, it will be sterilized in a machine. Third, it will be dried with another machine. The fourth room is the sterile room where doctors can obtain a new scope.\n\nThe second feature of the new surgicenter is that everything it will use will be monitored by the Department of Health. It will be using one syringe one time per patient.\n\nA third feature Fajardo highlights is that the center will use equipment that is not yet standard of care, such as a new device with three cameras that will provide a 330-degree view, which helps in looking for precancerous growth in the colon. Current devices now provide a 170-degree view, Fajardo said.\n\nFajardo is currently one of two main doctors at Las Vegas Gastroenterology.\n\nHe graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Medicine and completed his residency and chief residency at Mount Sinai School of Medicine Affiliate in New York.\n\nFollowing his residency, Fajardo specialized in gastroenterology and hepatology at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. There, he also obtained an advanced fellowship degree in gastrointestinal motility.\n\nFajardo, who moved to Las Vegas in 2007, said he initially opened his clinic with the desire for it to provide a type of health care that wasn\u2019t about a patient seeing a doctor because he or she is sick.\n\n\u201cI want the patient to be aware of the diseases so that they can take care of themselves first and we, as doctors, are tools toward this achievement of healthcare,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd this is very self-empowering because it has to be the patient actually knowing that they can take care of themselves\u2026 So when I \u2026 started the practice in 2009, it became my mission to educate the community on the things I know can help the individual.\u201d\n\nFajardo has also been a strong advocate for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B in the Asian community throughout the United States. He said he has partnered with community groups as a means of outreach, which in turn helped Fil-Ams be more educated about hepatitis B and colon cancer prevention.\n\n\u201cIn the past it was really a challenge to really convince nanay[s] and tatay[s] to get a colonoscopy because the concept is not something that they understand. Why would you go for a test which is very invasive, yet you don\u2019t feel anything?\u201d\n\nNow, however, Fajardo says the number of Fil-Ams requesting for colonoscopies has risen significantly throughout the past few years and that patients are the ones asking doctors to refer them to get a colonoscopy done.\n\nFor Filipinos and anybody else with health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Fajardo wanted to send a reminder that preventative services \u2014 including colonoscopies, mammograms, pap smears, and tests for prostate cancer, among other things \u2014 are covered 100 percent without additional cost to the insured individual.\n\nAn open house for the LV Surgery Center is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2015 from 10 am to 4 pm at 7315 S Pecos Road, Las Vegas, NV, 89120. An invite-only inaugural red carpet reception at the Mandarin Oriental will take place that evening, with special guests Martin Nievera and pianist Raul Sunico.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "News", "description": "THE sole Filipino-American gastroenterologist in Southern Nevada, Dr. Noel Fajardo, is set to unveil a new, state-of-the-art endoscopy surgicenter in the region this December.\r\n\r\nLV Surgery Center will be the first surgicenter accredited and approved", "title": "Fil-Am doctor to open endoscopy surgicenter in Southern Nevada | News", "url": "http://asianjournal.com/news/fil-am-doctor-to-open-endoscopy-surgicenter-in-southern-nevada/", "image": "http://asianjournal.com/news/files/2015/11/Dr-fajardo-240x300.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 255788754543881}, "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "THE sole Filipino-American gastroenterologist in Southern Nevada, Dr. Noel Fajardo, is set to unveil a new, state-of-the-art endoscopy surgicenter in the region this December.\n\u201cWhen we decided to put up an endoscopy or surgery center geared toward endoscopies, we wanted to be the first one that would provide the best care.\nAnd that\u2019s why, from a Department of Health perspective, meaning [the] Nevada State Department of Health, we were closely watched from the planning [stages],\u201d Fajardo said.\nThe second feature of the new surgicenter is that everything it will use will be monitored by the Department of Health.\nAn open house for the LV Surgery Center is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2015 from 10 am to 4 pm at 7315 S Pecos Road, Las Vegas, NV, 89120."}
