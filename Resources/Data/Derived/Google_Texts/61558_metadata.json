I never lost my appetite nor burst into tears, and I didn\u2019t suffer from any of the other typical symptoms of depression. Maybe I was more irritable than usual, a bit more prone to snap. And yes, I buried myself in my work. But I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d tripped down into the rabbit hole of depression.\n\nYou would think I would have been more self-aware, both personally and professionally. As a health journalist, I have often used my own stories to write about difficult-to-discuss medical conditions, including learning I had testicular cancer at age 26 and my misdiagnosis with H.I.V./AIDS \u2014 back when it was a death sentence. But I had never written about suffering from depression, even though it\u2019s plagued me since I first put pen to paper, at age 11, when I started keeping a diary.\n\nStill, I\u2019m far from alone. At least six million men in the United States suffer from depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The true number is likely to be even higher, said Dr. Matthew Rudorfer, the institute\u2019s associate director for treatment research, since men are less likely than women to report classic symptoms like low mood, sadness or crying, so they often go undiagnosed. Men, he told me, more often demonstrate \u201cexternalizing\u201d symptoms like irritability, anger and aggressiveness, substance and alcohol abuse, risk-taking behaviors and \u201cworkaholism.\u201d\n\nOh, that macho thing: Men don\u2019t get depressed; they just work, drink and compete harder. Andrew Solomon, author of the pathbreaking memoir about depression, \u201cNoonday Demon,\u201d told me that ridiculous attitude is part of the mind-set that guys should \u201ccover up our moods with militarism or athleticism.\u201d\n\nSo why speak up now? If there was a specific catalyst, it would be the death of my friend (his family asked me not to disclose his real name), a personal trainer who, one August morning, worked out his regular clients \u2014 and then went home and killed himself with a single gunshot to the head.\n\nEven with 20/20 hindsight I never would have guessed he was at risk for serious depression, let alone suicide. Just three days before his death, alive with excitement, he\u2019d talked with me about buying his first house and applying for a management role at the health club. Still, as one of his closer friends told me later, \u201cYou never know where depression lives.\u201d\n\nMost people, even those who know me well, don\u2019t see my depression. I\u2019m a \u201chigh-functioning\u201d depressive, for sure, and perhaps an artful one, too, obscuring its symptoms with a mix of medication, talk therapy, exercise and knowing when to close the door on the world. And unlike my surgical scars (thank you, cancer), those left by depression are invisible.\n\nI wonder, had I talked with my friend about my own struggle, if he might have said, \u201cMe, too.\u201d Indulging in some magical thinking, I imagine he would be alive today if we had shared our stories.\n\nIt\u2019s encouraging that new studies are refuting previous ones that showed women to be twice as likely as men to experience depression. For example, a 2013 University of Michigan study concluded, \u201cwhen alternative and traditional symptoms are combined, sex disparities in the prevalence of depression are eliminated.\u201d In other words, men and women may be equally at risk.\n\nThe first step in recognizing depression in men is diagnosing it properly, which means establishing accurate criteria \u2014 and making sure mental health practitioners know what to look for. The second step, which may be even more difficult, is getting men to speak up about it.\n\nWhich leads back to my own silence. One reason I\u2019ve been unable to talk about my condition until now is that, as the Cymbalta ad says, \u201cdepression hurts.\u201d When I first heard that tagline I rolled my eyes, but I\u2019ve since come to appreciate the copywriter\u2019s genius. Imagine suffering from a bad flu, the kind that seems to have poisoned your blood, physically incapacitating you. For me, depression can feel like the worst flu ever, with no end in sight. It is tough to talk about when you\u2019re in that much pain.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the stigma. As much as I understand that illness is illness, whether mental or physical, and that there is a greater openness about depression now than a generation ago, I feel shame.\n\nMy own encounters with stigma have been profound. I once dated a fellow who dumped me unceremoniously when he found out I took Lexapro, an antidepressant. Before the Affordable Care Act became law, I was rejected for health insurance \u2014 not because of my cancer history, but because of my medication history. Having sought help, I was penalized. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d my primary care doctor said to me.\n\nSo I have decided to be more truthful. Last fall, when I needed to beg off from a commitment, I didn\u2019t fabricate some physical ailment, as I had in the past. Instead, I emailed: \u201cThe depression I\u2019m suffering from right now makes it difficult for me to be there as promised. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nDepression need not be the loneliest fight, as Mr. Solomon has so well characterized it. But if I don\u2019t tell you, you can never really know me \u2014 or help. Now I can appreciate it when friends ask me how I\u2019m feeling (but not in that dreadful way: \u201cHow. Are. You?\u201d). And I appreciate those who offer: \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d\n\nSteven Petrow, a regular contributor to Well, lives in Hillsborough, N.C.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160208112520, "BN": "well", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/mind", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 8, 2016", "keywords": "Depression (Mental),Medicine and Health,Mental Health and Disorders,Suicides and Suicide Attempts,Featured,Mind", "GBLC": "Featured;Mind", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Opening Up About Depression ( 20160208 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Steven Petrow", "SCG": "well", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Steven Petrow", "byl": "Steven Petrow", "twitter": {"description": "As much as I understand that illness is illness, whether mental or physical, and that there\u2019s a greater openness about depression now than a generation ago, I still feel shame about my depression.", "title": "Opening Up About Depression", "url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opening-up-about-depression/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/09/science/09DEPRESSION/09DEPRESSION-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004194982, "description": "As much as I understand that illness is illness, whether mental or physical, and that there\u2019s a greater openness about depression now than a generation ago, I still feel shame about my depression.", "CG": "Health", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 8, 2016", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "Mind", "published_time": 1454948720, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T16:33:39-05:00"}, "utime": 20160208163339, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160208, "pdate": 20160208, "des": "Depression (Mental);Medicine and Health;Mental Health and Disorders;Suicides and Suicide Attempts", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/09/science/09DEPRESSION/09DEPRESSION-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Well", "description": "As much as I understand that illness is illness, whether mental or physical, and that there\u2019s a greater openness about depression now than a generation ago, I still feel shame about my depression.", "title": "Opening Up About Depression", "url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opening-up-about-depression/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/09/science/09DEPRESSION/09DEPRESSION-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opening-up-about-depression/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Opening Up About Depression", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/09/science/09DEPRESSION/09DEPRESSION-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Instead, I emailed: \u201cThe depression I\u2019m suffering from right now makes it difficult for me to be there as promised.\nStill, as one of his closer friends told me later, \u201cYou never know where depression lives.\u201dMost people, even those who know me well, don\u2019t see my depression.\nI never lost my appetite nor burst into tears, and I didn\u2019t suffer from any of the other typical symptoms of depression.\nAt least six million men in the United States suffer from depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\nIt\u2019s encouraging that new studies are refuting previous ones that showed women to be twice as likely as men to experience depression."}
