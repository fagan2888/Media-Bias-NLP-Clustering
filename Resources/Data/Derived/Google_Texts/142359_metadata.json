H&R Block is helping taxpayers meet their filing obligations in their offices in more than 14 countries and U.S. territories, as well as through an online service it set up last year at expats.hrblock.com (see H&R Block Offers Remote Tax Prep for Expatriates). The Tax Institute of H&R Block has also been working with U.S. expatriates abroad to help them cope with recent tax requirements, including the Affordable Care Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s not that FATCA necessarily changes the rules in a big way for U.S. expats, but what it\u0092s done has really heightened the awareness of these annual filing requirements that they have, even after leaving the United States on a permanent basis,\u0094 said director of expat services Roland Sabates in an interview last week. \u0093In the last year a lot of the potential clients that are contacting us are terrified. They\u0092ve just found out that they should have been filing these tax returns after moving abroad. It\u0092s an honest, innocent mistake, but now they\u0092re extremely concerned about the potential exposure to the foreign accounts reporting penalties.\u0094\n\nMany expatriates are finding out about these tax obligations from the foreign financial institutions that are serving them, who as a result of FATCA are now asking their U.S. clients to make sure they are compliant with filing all of their back tax returns with the IRS. In many cases, foreign banks are closing the accounts of U.S. citizens to make the compliance burden easier on the bank. Either that or they are asking for the information now on their customers\u0092 compliance with their U.S. tax reporting obligations and informing them that the banks will be reporting the information to the IRS going forward.\n\n\u0093A lot more banks are requiring expats to fill out and provide W-9 forms,\u0094 said Sabates. \u0093They\u0092re expecting to see information reporting documents for a lot of foreign source income, which we\u0092ve never seen in the past.\u0094\n\nThe Treasury Department has been reporting a spike in the number of citizenship renunciations by Americans in recent years, jumping 47 percent to 1,001 in the first quarter of this year, compared to 679 a year earlier, according to the Federal Register. The number tripled to 3,000 in 2013 from the previous year, according to IRS data (see Yul Brynner\u0092s Tax Spat Augurs Rush to Give up U.S. Passports).\n\n\u0093We\u0092ve seen people relinquish their citizenship in the past, so it\u0092s not that these are extremely large numbers,\u0094 said Sabates. \u0093What\u0092s startling is that it\u0092s happening at all. It\u0092s not necessarily the expat that moves to Switzerland for a job, gets married, and ends up staying longer than they were thinking. It\u0092s the children of that expat who have acquired citizenship by birth through their parents, and they may have no connections with the United States. They\u0092re finding out that they have these tax-filing requirements at the same time that they\u0092re finding out what being a U.S. citizen means. We\u0092ve seen a lot of family-based citizenship abandonment where you\u0092ve got a couple of kids who have gotten citizenship through their parents. Before they start getting into the working world and developing their wealth, the U.S. tax issues crop up and they\u0092re relinquishing their citizenship.\u0094\n\nThe Affordable Care Act adds another layer of complexity. \u0093There\u0092s a provision in the Affordable Care Act that deems compliance for any person who lives outside the United States for more than 330 days during the year or meets what\u0092s called a bona fide residence test,\u0094 said Sabates. \u0093They have permanent connections to a foreign country. They\u0092re not just there on a temporary basis for a short-term work assignment or for some other limited reason. Basically for anybody who is kind of a traditional expat\u0097the U.S. citizen or resident who has moved abroad on an indefinite or permanent basis\u0097they\u0092re typically not subject to the Affordable Care Act or these penalties. They\u0092re deemed to have minimum essential coverage. Where it gets tricky in that space is basically you can\u0092t be in the United States for more than 35 days. If you are in the United States for more than 35 days, then you have to meet this spongy bona fide residence test, which requires you to show that you have these permanent, lasting connections to your foreign country of residence. There are not limitations on your ability to stay, so it does become a little bit grayer in that space when you have somebody who, while they live abroad on a permanent basis, they\u0092re coming back into the United States regularly enough that they don\u0092t meet that 330-day test.\u0094\n\nTaxpayers who may be affected are U.S. citizens who graduate from college and teach English abroad for a few years. \u0093For the programs they\u0092re participating in, maybe they don\u0092t have classes so they come back to the United States for two or three months during the summer while they\u0092re not teaching,\u0094 Sabates explained. \u0093We work with them and let them know, if you\u0092re teaching English in Japan on a temporary work visa, you\u0092re probably not going to meet this bona fide resident test so if you want to qualify for this other provision, which is the foreign earned income exclusion, you need to make sure you\u0092re not in the U.S. more than 35 days during the calendar year. Now, for those types of taxpayers, the stakes are much higher, so if you spend more than 35 days back in the U.S., not only do you not qualify for that foreign earned income exclusion, you may be subject to the Affordable Care Act requirements there as well. There is a very broad exemption for expats, but there are some nuances where there are going to be certain individuals in specific situations that really are going to need to make sure they\u0092re going to be covered and they\u0092re not going to be facing Affordable Care Act penalties.\u0094\n\nIn some cases, clients have needed to prove how many days they were in the foreign country or in the U.S. \u0093The thing about those two tests is that they are not brand new to the ACA,\u0094 said Sabates. \u0093They\u0092re the two tests that you use to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, so that\u0092s what they base those requirements. The foreign earned income exclusion also allows you to exclude up to $97,600 of foreign source wages and compensation from U.S. tax. Since the mandate wasn\u0092t in effect for 2013, we haven\u0092t really been forced to have that tough conversation with our clients, but we do have quite a few folks who are English teachers abroad, and they are the ones who are really going to need to be cautious of the potential exposure to the ACA mandate next year.\u0094\n\nWhile the IRS is not yet imposing any penalties on taxpayers under the ACA, that could be an issue on next year\u0092s tax return when the penalty for 2014 is the greater of $95 per uninsured person or 1 percent of household income over the filing threshold. For 2015, the penalty will be the greater of $325 per uninsured person or 2 percent of household income over the filing threshold, and for 2016 and beyond, it will be the greater of $695 per uninsured person or 2.5 percent of household income over the filing threshold.\n\n\u0093When we\u0092re talking to them, they\u0092re saying, \u0091I\u0092m coming back this summer for a couple of months,\u0092 and we\u0092re saying, \u0091If you\u0092re doing that, you may not qualify for this foreign earned income exclusion. Not only will you not qualify for the exclusion, but you better make sure you have minimal essential coverage there as well,\u0092\u0094 said Sabates.\n\nHe noted that expats qualify for an automatic two-month extension to file until June 16 of this year because the 15th is on a Sunday, so if they haven\u0092t filed yet, they can still get their tax returns in on a timely basis. They will also need to be sure to file an FBAR by the end of June.\n\n\u0093The other requirement to be cautious of is the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, the FBAR,\u0094 Sabates added. \u0093That\u0092s filed separately from the tax return. That\u0092s going to be due by June 30. There\u0092s one big change this year. In years past, you could mail that form to the Department of Treasury in Detroit. This year all FBARs have to be electronically filed. They won\u0092t be accepting paper forms.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/blogs/debits-credits/hr-block-counsels-expats-aca-tax-requirements-70762-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Debits & Credits", "title": "H&R Block Counsels Expats on ACA Tax Requirements"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "news_keywords": "hr block, expatriates, affordable care act, taxes, obamacare, fatca, fbar", "description": "Nearly 6 million Americans living abroad are facing a June 16 deadline to file their taxes this year.", "title": "H&R Block Counsels Expats on ACA Tax Requirements"}, "article_summary": "Despite this obligation, a recent survey by H&R Block found that nearly one-third of U.S. expatriates are confused by U.S. tax filing requirements and more than three-quarters use a U.S.-based tax preparer.\nThe Tax Institute of H&R Block has also been working with U.S. expatriates abroad to help them cope with recent tax requirements, including the Affordable Care Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.\nWhere it gets tricky in that space is basically you can\u0092t be in the United States for more than 35 days.\nIt\u0092s the children of that expat who have acquired citizenship by birth through their parents, and they may have no connections with the United States.\nThey\u0092ve just found out that they should have been filing these tax returns after moving abroad."}
