Ryan wants Republicans to \u201cgo on offense on ideas\u201d in 2016, but he has only committed to drafting the playbook, not running the plays.\n\nThe leadership strategy of protecting members from difficult votes was one Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John A. Boehner of Ohio, employed \u2014 and one that did not always sit well with conservatives. So what does it mean if Ryan prevents his members from voting on the \u201cbold\u201d 2016 agenda he wants them to get behind? \u201cIt means we\u2019re not being adequately heard still,\u201d Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, said before leaving for a week's recess. Asked if members would judge Ryan\u2019s speakership on that, Gohmert said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to wait and see. It depends on how it happens.\u201d\n\nWhen House members return to Capitol Hill over the next week, Republicans said in interviews they are ready to dig into the five policy areas that Ryan has outlined for his agenda: national security, the economy, health care, poverty and constitutional powers. Ryan has pledged to set up committee-led task forces, which will offering listening sessions for members who want to contribute to the policy development.\n\nSeveral members say they want to go beyond merely developing ideas.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to see is an agenda that\u2019s backed up by substantive legislation, that\u2019s backed up by an affirmative floor vote of the House,\u201d Republican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores said.\n\nThe Texas Republican acknowledged the legislative calendar, with extended breaks for political conventions and campaigning, is not going to allow the House time to take up bills in each of the five areas this year. But he said it\u2019s worth drafting \u201ctangible pieces of legislation that I believe our presidential candidate can hang their hat on and say, \u2018If you put me in the White House, I\u2019ll sign that bill.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is particularly true when it comes to replacing the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have talked about repealing the law for years, but have yet to coalesce around an alternative health care plan. Voters back home have begun to notice, lawmakers said. Flores said he expects at least half the Republican conference would support bringing the matter to the floor.\n\n\u201cI think a number of us want to vote on something,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. \u201cBut shy of a vote is to make sure that this is the plan that we\u2019re all committed to, that we\u2019ll all vote on if and when the legislative calendar allows it to happen.\u201d\n\nManaging the expectations of the fractious Republican Conference represents a key test for Ryan, who assumed the speaker's post in October pledging to deliver a unified vision for the party. After sharing his priorities at the GOP issues retreat earlier this month, he received a standing ovation. Afterwards, he indicated the House is unlikely to vote on the policy ideas Republican members will develop because they can't be passed into law this year, given the Democrat in the White House.\n\n\u201cOur goal here is not to simply just pass things and watch them go nowhere because we have a White House that doesn\u2019t agree with us,\" the speaker said on \"Fox News Sunday\" in an interview with Chris Wallace taped after the GOP retreat concluded on Jan. 15. Before that, Ryan had said on multiple occasions that members would decide whether the agenda items would be drafted into legislation and brought to the floor.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said it's time for Republicans to deliver on their pledges to overhaul the tax code, the health care system and welfare and entitlement programs. \u201cI think we should not just talk about them but pass legislation and say here\u2019s what we are for,\u201d the Ohio Republican said.\n\nWhile most lawmakers share that sentiment, some acknowledge floor votes are unlikely given that the legislative calendar effectively ends in mid July.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we can keep doing what we\u2019re doing, which is nothing,\" Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C. \"That does not mean we can keep quiet. I think Republicans back home would understand that our welfare reform bill doesn\u2019t become law. They\u2019ll understand why our Obamacare replacement doesn\u2019t become law. But they won\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not offering those things in the first place.\u201d\n\nHouse Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., who has authored one of several Republican health care overhaul proposals, said it's important for Republicans to show they have solutions to the problems they believe Democrats have created. \u201cAnd my sensibilities tell me that the best way to do that is with a vote,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile most Republicans they should pass a health care plan to replace Obama's, Flores said, \"There\u2019s going to be a more reserved component of the conference that wouldn\u2019t want to do that because it might be tough in an election.\"\n\nRep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, isn't so sure about that. He said he has not heard from any members who are concerned about voting on the big ideas Republicans are discussing. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the job; it really is,\u201d the Oregon Republican said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not good for their district, they\u2019ll vote no.\u201d\n\nRep. Carlos Curbelo, a Republican freshman from a swing district in Florida, agreed. \u201cI might be traditionally one of those members who says, \u2018Oh let\u2019s try to do as little as possible here and I\u2019ll just try to run on being a nice guy and having a nice family.\u2019 That\u2019s not fair,\" he said. \"We need show how we would run this country differently \u2014 better \u2014 and we can only do that by advancing ideas.\u201d\n\nCurbelo said he wants to vote on a health care alternative, a revamp of poverty programs and even an immigration overhaul. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest; let\u2019s be transparent; let\u2019s show all our cards,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game has gone on for too long.\u201d\n\nDespite the overwhelming interest in holding floor votes on their ideas, some House Republicans understand why leadership is reluctant to go that route.\n\n\u201cNothing ever gets done in D.C. without presidential leadership,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said, adding that the policy ideas Republicans come up with will need to be vetted before they\u2019re ready for a vote.\n\nMajor bills are hard to pass under any circumstance, Mulvaney said, noting that when Democrats had full control of Congress and the White House, they weren\u2019t able to do much more than pass the 2009 stimulus bill and the 2010 health care overhaul. \"They never got to immigration, they never got to \u2014 in their minds \u2014 gun control,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean they didn\u2019t get all the big things, even when they ran the place unchecked.\u201d\n\nThe GOP will face similar challenges in the next Congress, even if a Republican is elected president this fall.\n\n\u201cMy preference would be to advance bills where you can get some level of consensus because even if there\u2019s a Republican president, we\u2019re still going to need the bill to pass the Senate,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., head of the moderate Tuesday Group, said. \u201cAnd no one is expecting that Republicans will have a filibuster-proof majority after this election.\u201d\n\nGiven those dynamics, Republicans need to be \u201cvery realistic\u201d in their approach to passing bills, Dent said, but added, \u201cI suspect there will be some who will pretend we\u2019re operating in a unicameral system.\u201d\n\nStill, if Republicans truly want to go on offense, as Ryan says, they need to prove they can execute their plays and actually advance their ideas through the legislative process.\n\n\u201cThe floor vote shows that we\u2019re willing to do more than talk about it,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThe floor vote shows that we\u2019re willing to put our constituents voting cards into the slot and vote on behalf of our constituents.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ryan\u2019s 5-Point Plan to Promote the GOP\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
