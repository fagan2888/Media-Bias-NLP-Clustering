In the somewhat distant past, we spoke of them in line with an ethical model; students who didn\u2019t pay attention to their teachers, for instance, were \u201cbad\u201d kids refusing to \u201cbehave properly.\u201d In the more recent past, we relied on a medical model and so would refer to the same kids as \u201csuffering\u201d from a brain \u201cdisorder...\u201d Attention Deficit Disorder most likely. Understood.org, a new, free online resource for parents, hopes to move us beyond these tired models to a more evolved way of thinking about children who experience difficulty learning. By framing and expressing this issue in a new way, the many children who currently flounder in the nation's classrooms may locate their own mental strengths and assets and so develop their minds to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOne in five people in the United States between the ages of 3 and 20 has problems with reading, writing, math, focus, and attention, according to Understood.org. The organization\u2019s Thursday afternoon press event, taking place in a well-lit, overly white space more similar to an art gallery than a conference center, began with, of all things, each participant receiving an atrociously misspelled name-tag.\n\nAs Shelly London, president of Poses Family Foundation, one of 15 organizations sponsoring the new website, explained, this gesture was intended to give us all \u201ca small taste of what it feels like to be a person with a learning disability.\u201d The site itself provides interactive simulations designed to help parents experience the world through their children's eyes, as well.\n\n\u201cThis tool absolutely gives parents an understanding of their children,\u201d Rachel Vitti, a former teacher and mother of four children, two of them diagnosed with learning disabilities, told Medical Daily. When working with her own son who has attentional issues, she found herself unable to understand what he might be going through. \u201cAre you blind? Pay attention!\u201d Vitti, a self-confessed former straight 'A' student, recalled saying to her eldest son. \u201cNo parent wants to admit this is happening,\u201d she said, explaining how what seems like an academic problem soon develops into social and emotional issues as well. Her son, a handsome and mature eldest child, nodded his head in agreement. \"I stopped trying,\" he told Medical Daily.\n\nEventually, it becomes overwhelming for your child, Vitti, a vital yet humble woman, said, and so as the parent you must \u201craise your hand and admit there\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nWith Understood.org, parents who have raised their hands will be able to access much needed tools and advice in both English and Spanish to help them guide a troubled child\u2019s progress. Featured on the website are apps and games targeted for specific ages and issues, practical tips for parents dealing with challenges, such as school projects and completing nightly homework, and a system offering personalized recommendations for help. Most importantly, the website is cultivating an online community for parents to chat with others who face the same issues, parents such as Michelle Smalley.\n\nPressure Points\n\nSmalley is the mother of a son who was diagnosed with dyslexia at an early age and now attends a special academy equipped to help him. She spoke of the \u201cpressure points\u201d \u2014 the moments of transition when a child is most likely to get noticed as having a learning disability. Essentially, four pressure points occur when a child begins school, when a child moves from elementary to middle school, when a child transitions from middle to high school, and when a child transitions into college or career.\n\nSmalley spoke of other mothers, \u201cwho\u2019ve been in denial,\u201d coming to her and asking for advice now that their children have graduated to Middle School, where their classroom abilities are questioned. As she sees it, what could be swept under the rug at an earlier age is now an obvious problem. Sooner or later many children will encounter a pressure point and their parents will be forced to face the same issues Smalley has confronted. A resource like Understood.org can help smooth the way. \u201cIt breaks my heart to know if he did not have this opportunity, he would be just another little boy who is depressed and unhappy and suffering,\u201d she told Medical Daily.\n\nBoys with learning issues were mentioned frequently at the event, however given a little help from Understood.org, this stereotype might soon die. \u201cStatistically, more boys than girls are diagnosed with a learning disability, but I believe the numbers are the same for both, it\u2019s just girls are not as disruptive so they don\u2019t get diagnosed as often,\u201d said Dr. Ned Hallowell, an author and psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard. He explained his view that many adult women who have been given a diagnosis of depression actually may suffer from an attentional or organizational issue. Having \u201cworked in the trenches\u201d for years, Hallowell says his \"learning disabled\" students need to understand they are not damaged, it's just they possess \u201cthe mind of a Ferrari and the brakes of a bicycle.\u201d\n\n\"'But you're lucky because I am a brake specialist,' I tell them,\" he said. Their special minds mean these kids also frequently are socially awkward, unable to read social cues.\n\nWith Understood.org, though, parents will be able to anticipate the academic, emotional, and social challenges faced by their children and guide them with skill. \u201cNever before have we had the ability to disseminate this information so widely,\u201d Hallowell said. \u201cThis is an amazing resource.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "understood.org, learning disabilities, disorders, education", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Understood.org, a new, free online resource for parents, provides tools for helping children with learning difficulties.", "title": "Changing The Label On 'Learning Disabled' Kids", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/understanding-your-childs-learning-and-emotional-challenges-new-online-resource-parents-307843", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/learning-difficulties.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Understood.org, a new, free online resource for parents, provides tools for helping children with learning difficulties.", "title": "Changing The Label On 'Learning Disabled' Kids", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/understanding-your-childs-learning-and-emotional-challenges-new-online-resource-parents-307843", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/learning-difficulties.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/learning-difficulties.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-10-23T18:48:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T08:46:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Understood.org, a new, free online resource for parents, provides tools for helping children with learning difficulties."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb885\"", "article_summary": "Boys with learning issues were mentioned frequently at the event, however given a little help from Understood.org, this stereotype might soon die.\nWith Understood.org, though, parents will be able to anticipate the academic, emotional, and social challenges faced by their children and guide them with skill.\nMost importantly, the website is cultivating an online community for parents to chat with others who face the same issues, parents such as Michelle Smalley.\n\u201cThis tool absolutely gives parents an understanding of their children,\u201d Rachel Vitti, a former teacher and mother of four children, two of them diagnosed with learning disabilities, told Medical Daily.\nShe spoke of the \u201cpressure points\u201d \u2014 the moments of transition when a child is most likely to get noticed as having a learning disability."}
