Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com said Wednesday it hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company’s services keep pace with a boom in users.

The value of the goods sold on Snapdeal’s online marketplace ballooned to $3.5 billion at the end of May, up from around $1 billion in August last year. The company is valued at $2 billion, making it India’s fourth-most valuable startup, according to data compiled by The Wall Street Journal.

Snapdeal’s employee headcount has exploded as it competes for customers with larger rival Flipkart Internet Pvt. and global giant Amazon.com. The company now employs 6,000 people, working in warehouses or on software updates, up from 1,300 in August last year.

Snapdeal and other e-commerce companies are riding a boom driven by declining smartphone prices, which is allowing millions of Indians to go online for the first time. Many of them are shopping online.

Chandrasekaran will be working with Snapdeal’s large group of 1,000 software engineers, which will double in size in the next year. They will be increasingly focused on improving Snapdeal’s mobile application, which now accounts for 75% of the online marketplace’s sales.

Chandrasekaran was most recently the chief product officer at Bharti Airtel, India’s largest cellular service provider by sales. He resigned after 13 months on the job where he launched the Airtel mobile application and a popular music streaming app called Wynk, but also the hotly criticized Airtel Zero—which offered access to certain mobile applications free-of-charge.
