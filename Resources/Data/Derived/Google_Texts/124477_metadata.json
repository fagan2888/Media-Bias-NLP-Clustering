Bernie Sanders, pose for a photo before debating at the University of New Hampshire\n\nAs the leading Republican presidential candidates are busy offering incoherent plans that would repeal Obamacare and make the insurance landscape more confusing \u2014 Donald Trump, for instance, put out a 40-word health care platform that makes very little sense \u2014 the Democratic candidates are having a substantive debate about how to make universal health care a reality.\n\nHillary Clinton is reaffirming her support for a policy that\u2019s popular among proponents of a single-payer insurance system \u2014 offering a counter to Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan that may be more well-received among liberal voters than her previous platform. The positioning reflects the Democratic base\u2019s appetite for creating a path to universal health care, a far-left stance that Sanders has staked out for himself this race.\n\nThis week, Politico noticed that Clinton\u2019s website has been updated to include her support for the \u201cpublic option,\u201d or an alternative government-run health plan that could compete with private insurance companies. (While universal government-run health care is sometimes characterized as \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d the public option has been characterized as \u201cMedicare you can buy into.\u201d)\n\n\u201cHillary has never given up on the fight for universal coverage,\u201d her website reads. \u201cAs she did in her 2008 campaign health plan, and consistently since then, Hillary supports a \u2018public option\u2019 to reduce costs and broaden the choices of insurance coverage for every American. To make immediate progress toward that goal, Hillary will work with interested governors, using current flexibility under the Affordable Care Act, to empower states to establish a public option choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe regularly update our website with additional details on Hillary Clinton\u2019s policy positions,\u201d a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign told reporters who asked about the change.\n\nThe public option was a central part of the fight to get health care reform passed during Obama\u2019s first term \u2014 a way for liberal lawmakers to bridge the gap between the country\u2019s private insurance market and their goal of creating a more efficient and more equitable government-run system. It was actually pretty popular among the American public at the time. However, in a serious blow to progressives, the policy didn\u2019t end up making it into the final version of the Affordable Care Act because a handful of conservative Democrats blocked it.\n\nAs her website notes, Clinton backed the public option during her 2008 campaign. But, even as she and Sanders have sparred over how to accomplish their shared goals of achieving universal health care, it\u2019s a policy that\u2019s been conspicuously absent from this presidential debate so far.\n\nBefore this week, the Democratic discussion over health care was mired in a conflict between Clinton\u2019s position to protect the status quo under Obamacare and Sanders\u2019 more ambitious vision of creating a single-payer system (and one that offers even more generous benefits than the Medicare program currently does).\n\nFor weeks, economists and health policy experts have been debating whether Sanders\u2019 plan is accomplishable, arguing about whether it\u2019s too thin on details and trying to figure out if the numbers add up. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign has positioned itself as a champion of Obamacare, arguing it\u2019s unwise to scrap the president\u2019s landmark health reform law altogether, and pushing for incremental changes to help cover the people who are still left uninsured. Curiously, Clinton surrogates also mounted a series of dishonest attacks against Sanders\u2019 health plan that appeared to be designed to confuse Americans about how government-run health care works in practice \u2014 misleadingly suggesting that single-payer would leave the country worse off by causing millions of people to lose their insurance.\n\nThe conflict ultimately sharpens old battle lines between a more pragmatic and a more leftist approach to governing. But the public option, which is a potential bridge between these two camps, was left out of the conversation completely.\n\nThat choice puzzled some people in the health policy space. In mid-January, the New Republic\u2019s Brian Beutler argued that the public option could be the policy to unite Clinton and Sanders: A way to address the progressive community\u2019s serious desire to get closer to universal health care that\u2019s more grounded in the reality of the current insurance market.\n\nThe state-based public option that Clinton\u2019s updated website describes isn\u2019t identical to the more robust federally run public option that Democrats envisioned in 2009. And, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be politically viable under a GOP-controlled Congress. But the fact that the former secretary of state is talking about a version of the public option again \u2014 an idea that Democrats appeared to have dropped altogether in recent years \u2014 helps put a path to universal health care up for more serious debate in this presidential election.\n\n\u201cFor progressives, it\u2019s an important step,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Steven Benen argues. \u201cClinton has found something bright and glittery to offer progressives, and probably general election voters, on health care. It\u2019s about time,\u201d Slate\u2019s Jordan Weismann agrees.\n\nThere have been other examples of the Democratic candidates\u2019 leftward shifts during this presidential primary season, too. Both of them are forcefully calling for progressive priorities like paid family leave and comprehensive immigration reform. And Clinton and Sanders are both calling to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding federal policy that makes abortion unaffordable for impoverished women, which is a historic first in a national election.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"For progressives, it\u2019s an important step.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"For progressives, it\u2019s an important step.\"", "title": "Clinton And Sanders Clash Over Path To Universal Health Care", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/24/3752417/universal-health-care-campaign/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/23104608/AP_265434549057-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"For progressives, it\u2019s an important step.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/23104608/AP_265434549057-321x214.jpg", "title": "Clinton And Sanders Clash Over Path To Universal Health Care", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/23104608/AP_265434549057-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/23104608/AP_265434549057-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-24T09:16:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The positioning reflects the Democratic base\u2019s appetite for creating a path to universal health care, a far-left stance that Sanders has staked out for himself this race.\n\u201cClinton has found something bright and glittery to offer progressives, and probably general election voters, on health care.\nHealth Clinton And Sanders Clash Over Path To Universal Health Care CREDIT: AP Photo/Jim Cole Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, left, and Sen.
