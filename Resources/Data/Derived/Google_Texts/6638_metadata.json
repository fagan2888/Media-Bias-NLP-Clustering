OF THE UNITED STATES?\n\n|| By FITSNEWS || Former U.S. vice president Al Gore should be a discredited laughing stock. His global warming myth is falling apart, not unlike his infamous claim to have invented the internet.\n\nBut Gore \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 is being seriously considered for the presidency. And no, we\u2019re not talking about the presidency of some uber-leftist environmental think tank, we\u2019re talking about the presidency of the United States.\n\n\u201cThe most ambitious vision for the Democratic Party right now rests with a politician most have forgotten, and whom no one is mentioning for 2016: Al Gore,\u201d liberal columnist Ezra Klein wrote this week. \u201cGore offers a genuinely different view of what the Democratic Party \u2014 and, by extension, American politics \u2014 should be about.\u201d\n\nUmmmm \u2026 okay \u2026 and what should it be about?\n\nAccording to Klein, Gore\u2019s battle against \u201cclimate change\u201d is a battle against an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to humanity. But Gore isn\u2019t (or wouldn\u2019t be) just a single-issue candidate, Klein says \u2013 because he also supports single-payer health care (a.k.a. Obamacare on steroids).\n\n\u201cYou can believe Gore a visionary or you can believe him a blowhard, but he\u2019s offering a very different, and much more radical, vision of what politics should be about than even Elizabeth Warren, to say nothing of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Klein continues.\n\nYeah \u2026\n\nWe\u2019re not arguing with Klein that American needs a \u201cmore radical vision of what politics should be about.\u201d It just needs to be radical in the precise opposite direction Gore would take us.\n\nSpeaking earlier this week at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Festival in Austin, Texas, Gore ramped up his ridiculous \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 eco-radical rhetoric.\n\nIn pushing for a massive energy tax hike (the same one embraced by liberal U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham back in 2009), Gore railed against \u201cclimate change deniers\u201d \u2013 saying they should pay a price for rejecting \u201caccepted science.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to put a price on carbon,\u201d Gore said, invoking the preferred \u201cprogressive\u201d nomenclature for raising taxes on energy. \u201cAnd in order to do that, we need to put a price on denial in politics.\u201d\n\nWow \u2026\n\nWhat Gore is suggesting is nothing less than the criminalization of free thought: Silencing dissent through force. Insisting America\u2019s leaders either embrace his demonstrably false myth \u2013 or face the consequences. That\u2019s radical, alright \u2026 radically anti-American.\n\nIn fact it\u2019s almost as radical Graham\u2019s recent suggestion that he would use the U.S. military on members of Congress if they didn\u2019t bend to his will.\n\nWho knows \u2026 maybe these two loons need to run on a ticket?\n\nOh, and before any Gore supporters presume this website is yet another faction of the \u201cright wing conspiracy\u201d led by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, check yourselves: We\u2019ve bashed them, too.\n\nOddly enough, as much as we believe Gore to be certifiably insane (and \u201clegit scary,\u201d as the cool kids say) \u2013 we hope he does run.\n\nHow come?\n\nWell, a Gore candidacy would bring the far left\u2019s increasingly emboldened totalitarian impulses \u2013 eloquently addressed in this recent guest column by our friend Bill Wilson \u2013 out into the open for all to see. That would force a long-overdue discussion about the real aims of all this radical \u201cprogressive\u201d propaganda \u2013 taking more money out of your pockets and more liberty out of your life.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/03/19/al-gore-really/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gore-582x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Al Gore?
