Welcome to our feature highlighting the numerous Colorado tech companies that make cool stuff. These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.

Avoka Technologies

Who can accurately type on a smartphone? That’s right, absolutely no one ever! That’s why we apply for credit cards, fill out job applications and register for services by phone, computer or in person. But someone was bound to figure this out. And in Broomfield, that is Avoka Technologies , which is gaining steam — and awards — for its mobile-friendly technology that lets you snap a photo of your driver’s license to quickly fill out address forms. Or log into your LinkedIn profile to auto-populate fields on a job application. Loan and credit card applicants can log into bank accounts and have their financials filled out without typing another key. Avoka says the process can take just 90 seconds. But Avoka doesn’t sell the app to consumers. Rather, its customers are the banks, the mortgage lenders and other businesses that integrate Avoka into their own app — and make sure proper security and privacy is used in the online form. (Avoka also uses “enterprise security” software, the company said.) Clients include Jaguar Land Rover Millennium Trust and others Ninety seconds to fill out a form ? Bring it Avoka!
