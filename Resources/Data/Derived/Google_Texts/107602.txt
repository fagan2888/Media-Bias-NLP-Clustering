BOCA RATON, Florida — Billionaire Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential frontrunner, hammered the core issues of immigration, trade, and national security in a speech before 8,000 on Sunday night, two days before Florida voters head to the polls.

Donald Trump zoned in on how he believes — in a truly populist nationalist form — that America and Americans should come first and none of his opponents would do that.

“General George Patton, can you imagine General George Patton right now? He’s spinning in his grave when he sees we’re not beating ISIS,” Trump said:

We are doing a politically correct war. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS. They cut off heads. They’re drowning people. We have to knock them out. We have to knock them out bad. We have to get back to our country. We have to rebuild our country now. It’s time. It’s now time that we rebuild the United States. Our roads are falling apart. Our schools are a disgrace. You see it on television — rat-infested, walls falling down. We build schools over there, we build it again, they blow it up, we build it again they blow it up. This goes on four or five times.

We are going to think so good and here’s what’s going to happen: We’re going to start winning again.

Trump noted that the rest of the world — especially China — is taking advantage of America, beating the United States at everything.

“Think about it: When was the last time the United States won at everything? We’re losing at war, we’re losing at trade, we’re losing at everything,” Trump said. “This isn’t China. I use China because it’s greatest abuser of all. China abuses us more than anyone. I hope they still like me after this speech by the way, but I don’t care. I have the biggest bank in the world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan, from China — 400 million customers — the biggest bank in the world.”

Trump said that, if the United States actually tried, “we could do great against China.”

“I sell condos in China for tens of millions of dollars — I love China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders,” Trump said. “We can’t keep letting it go on.”

Trump then laid out what he envisions a Trump presidency would look like.

“So here’s what’s going to happen,” Trump said:
