Dive Connections

Dive Connections is Charlottesville's finest dive store serving all of the Central Virginia area. We sell equipment and instruction, but our goal is to get people to GO DIVING! We believe that if divers go diving that more people will be attracted to the sport, and the lifestyle. We offer Discover Scuba training for all ages from beginner to advanced, and we can even help you become an instructor. Already know how to dive? Great! We have organized dive trips available throughout the year. We are dedicated to providing the highest possible quality products and services. Whether it is equipment sales or rentals, equipment service or repair, or training at the recreational, technical or career level, you can count on us to provide the highest possible value. Have you been out of the water too long? Don't worry! We are here to help you shake off those cobwebs, dust off that scuba gear, rebuild that confidence and get you back into diving! Give us a chance to prove it to you. We'd love to be your connection to everything underwater! So, if there is anything we can do to help you GO DIVING, please give us a shout.
