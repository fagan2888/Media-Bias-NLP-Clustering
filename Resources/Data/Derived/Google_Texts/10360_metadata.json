The top web strategist from Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign tells Andrew Romano why the deck is stacked against government technology\u2014and how we can fix our flawed system.\n\nIt was April 3, 2012, and Michael Slaby was pulling his second all-nighter in a row. As chief innovation and integration officer for President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, Slaby was overseeing the relaunch of BarackObama.com, which was scheduled to go live the following day. He and his team were scrambling.\n\n\u201cWe were breathing air into this thing to make sure it went up,\u201d Slaby tells The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd it ended up just being a stub site. It was really constricted and small. The bigger, broader site came a month later. But we knew we were going to get crushed with a huge amount of traffic on Day 1 and we just needed to get it live.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Slaby\u2019s counterparts in the Obama administration\u2014the folks who designed HealthCare.gov, the Obamacare portal site that went live on October 1 and has been plagued by problems ever since\u2014didn\u2019t have that luxury.\n\nOver the past two weeks, almost every reporter who\u2019s attempted to figure out why HealthCare.gov has been such a headache\u2014\u201cpreventing users from creating accounts, failing to recognize users who do have accounts, putting users in inescapable loops, and miscalculating healthcare subsidies\u201d\u2014has posed the same question:\n\n\u201c[Obama\u2019s] campaign was widely praised for the preternatural talents of its IT team\u2026So why has the administration seen the main website for Obama\u2019s signature achievement fail so badly at its moment of truth?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could the most tech-savvy White House in history launch a flawed Web site?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could the Obama administration, the brains behind the most sophisticated online political campaign ever, be responsible for something so boneheaded?\u201d\n\nIn short, why couldn\u2019t the Obama people just work their campaign magic on HealthCare.gov?\n\nTo answer that question, most journalists have focused on the site\u2019s technical glitches: \u201ca glut of stray software code that served no purpose\u201d; \u201csnafus with Javascript and CSS files and HTML tags\u201d; and how \u201chitting \u2018apply\u2019 on HealthCare.gov causes 92 separate files, plug-ins and other mammoth swarms of data to stream between the user\u2019s computer and the servers powering the government website.\u201d\n\nBut what if the problem is bigger than Javascript and CSS? What if the issue is not so much what was created as where it was created? What if the real lesson of HealthCare.gov is that the U.S. government, unlike Obama\u2019s campaign team, is set up to make boneheaded websites no matter how hard it tries?\n\nThat, in effect, is what Slaby tells me when I call him and ask him to respond to the folks who have been contrasting the campaign\u2019s successes with the White House\u2019s failures. \u201cI think a lot of the challenge here with the \u2018they ran such a tech-savvy campaign, why are the having problems building a website?\u2019 crowd is that this isn\u2019t apples and oranges,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more like apples and firetrucks.\u201d\n\nI ask Slaby to elaborate.\n\n\u201cThe campaign was working in an environment that was vastly more unconstrained in terms of what we could do, what technologies we could use, how we could build, how we hired people, how we procured outside help,\u201d he explains. \u201cAll of those variables would be wildly in favor of the campaign. They\u2019re all really stacked against the White House. We have set a lot of the technical projects in government up to fail by being a little irrational.\u201d\n\nAs Slaby sees it, there are four big reasons why HealthCare.gov is having more trouble than BarackObama.com did. First, it\u2019s just a vastly more complicated operation. \u201cPeople forget that this is an exchange,\u201d Slaby tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s not Amazon, where you can buy everything in the world directly from Amazon. You\u2019re creating an account on HealthCare.gov, but you\u2019re actually getting covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever. There are hundreds of these providers, so there are hundreds of integration points with all these systems. And then all of those systems are different, and not all of them are acting perfectly, either, so they\u2019re not that easy to integrate with. Every one of those connection points has the potential to cause a bottleneck.\u201d\n\nAnd time wasn\u2019t on the White House\u2019s side. \u201cWhen Congress writes the bill, they\u2019re not asking engineers how much time they should have,\u201d Slaby says. \u201cThey\u2019re just like, \u2018By 2014 we\u2019re going to have a site. And there are all these steps that need to happen before you can start building.\u2019 The bill doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Once we figure out all these details, the engineers will get two years to build.\u2019 It says, \u2018No matter what happens, this is going up in 2014.\u2019 It\u2019s just not how deadlines are typically set. In the private sector, nothing launches on time. Twitter struggled with scale and performance for, like, its first year. But the White House is not allowed to scale up for a year. Everybody in the world wants to look at this thing on Day 1. That\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

According to a new report in The Washington Examiner, a conservative publication, \u201cinsurers are only beginning to be able to assess the true depth of the site\u2019s technological problems\u201d\u2014and \u201cthere are red flags beyond the error messages that have been publicly visible.\u201d One of the biggest bottlenecks comes right at the beginning of the process. Users are required to enter their personal information, create an account, and log in prior to examining their insurance options\u2014extra steps that were imposed by officials who, the Examiner reports, \u201cdidn\u2019t want consumers to see the base price of the health insurance plans offered, which are inflated by new regulations, before the system could collect their income data and calculate what they\u2019d pay in premiums after receiving government subsidies.\u201d In other words, optics trumped usability.\n\nEven so, HealthCare.gov may have been destined to slip up simply because it was made by the U.S. government. As Slaby and other technologists see it, there are bigger forces behind the flaws of HealthCare.gov than just complexity and timing. The first is procurement law. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to buy things in government,\u201d Slaby says. \u201cNow, it should be hard. I want the government to be more restricted and not as nimble and fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants as the campaign was, because it\u2019s the government. They can\u2019t mess up.\n\n\u201cBut because they\u2019re not allowed to mess up we\u2019ve created a system where it\u2019s also very hard for them to do things that are new and innovative. The rules all favor incumbents. The people who get the job are not necessarily the people who are good at delivering a website. They\u2019re mostly just government contractors who are really, really good at the system. Then they subcontract, and that makes the process even more complicated. It\u2019s very hard to build technology by committee.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s employment rules aren\u2019t helping matters, either. \u201cIt\u2019s also very, very hard to hire and fire people in government,\u201d Slaby says. \u201cA lot of the technical staff have been there for a really long time, and a lot of the technical infrastructure that they\u2019re working with is older. Most of the stuff inside government is not awesome, cutting-edge, cloud-based, and responsive. The skills we really want are not all that present in the incumbent system, and they\u2019re very hard to go out and get.\u201d\n\nThe result is \u201ca series of faulty, overpriced governmental tech launches during administrations of both parties,\u201d as The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Farhad Manjoo put it this week\u2014HealthCare.gov included.\n\nThat should change. As our interactions with the federal government continue to move online, the simplicity and ease of those interactions, or lack thereof, will come to define how we feel about Washington, D.C.
