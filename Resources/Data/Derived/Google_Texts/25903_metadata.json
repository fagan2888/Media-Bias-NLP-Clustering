Tom Apodaca, R-Henderson, proposed a bill in late March to repeal Mission Hospital\u2019s Certificate of Public Advantage, as well as the Certificate of Need, which applies to any health care entity in the state.\n\nThe bill passed its first reading and has been with the Senate Committee on Rules and Operations, which Apodaca chairs, ever since, but the same provisions made their way into the Senate\u2019s budget.\n\nThe Certificate of Public Advantage was established for Mission Hospital in 1995, when it merged with St. Joseph\u2019s to become the largest health care provider in the area and the only one in Buncombe County. The COPA requires state regulators to monitor the Mission health system to prevent it from instituting anti-competitive practices.\n\nThe Certificate of Need is a regulation that requires all health care facilities to get state approval before expanding services or making large equipment purchases. The purpose of the CON process is to make sure medical services aren\u2019t duplicated, and that one area isn\u2019t saturated with health facilities while another area is underserved.\n\nLocal health agencies have mixed feelings about repealing the laws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an antiquated system,\u201d Apodaca said about the COPA and CON. Their repeal would increase competition and bring costs down, he added, and the changes are part of the Senate\u2019s overall Medicaid reform.\n\n\u201cNo. 1, I think it will drive down costs. I\u2019m a free-market guy,\u201d Apodaca said.\n\nHe\u2019s received no backlash in Raleigh over repeal of the COPA, which affects only Western North Carolina, but the reaction has been about 75 percent for and 25 percent against the repeal of the CON.\n\nCOPA\n\nMission Health officials are in favor of repealing the COPA, which they say is no longer relevant.\n\n\u201cMission believes that after almost 20 years, the COPA has outlived its useful life,\u201d Mission Health President and CEO Dr. Ronald A. Paulus said in a statement to the Times-News.\n\nAlthough Mission supports the COPA\u2019s termination, he writes, it did not initiate or request the termination, and the hospital appreciates that Apodaca \u201cis aware of the unnecessary waste and challenges imposed by the COPA.\u201d\n\nFlexibility, reduced financial burden and costs coming from the termination of the COPA would \u201ccreate important opportunities to adapt and respond to rapidly changing market conditions,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials with Park Ridge Health, which in the past has called for more stringent enforcement of the COPA agreement, are waiting to see what the details of the Senate\u2019s plan are, said Victoria Dunkel, communications director.\n\n\u201cThe COPA was designed to protect both Mission Health Systems and the people of Western North carolina and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s in either party\u2019s best interest for the COPA to go away,\u201d said Graham Fields, assistant to the president for external relations at Park Ridge Health.\n\nCON\n\nMission, Park Ridge and Pardee Hospital all seem to be on the same side when it comes to the CON law, however. They\u2019re concerned that other providers would offer profitable procedures and leave the hospital systems to provide the costly, but necessary, services that don\u2019t make money.\n\n\u201cThe Certificate of Need Law is very, very important to protect community hospitals,\u201d Fields said, adding that if the law is repealed, those profitable health services would shift elsewhere.\n\nMission \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d repealing the CON law, although it supports its modernization, Paulus said in the release.\n\nDunkel said that while the CON\u2019s removal could spur some free market competition, it doesn\u2019t address concerns about how hospitals can make up for having to perform procedures that do not make money. Highly profitable surgeries and other procedures performed by hospitals across the state make up for the loss they take from providing mandated services to underserved populations.\n\nCON laws provide support for \u201csafety net institutions that are otherwise subject to cream skimming and cherry picking by for-profit entities ... that do not share the burden of caring for those without insurance or with unprofitable clinical needs,\u201d Paulus said in the release.\n\nJay Kirby, President and CEO of Pardee Hospital, said the CON protects hospitals and their patients.\n\n\u201cA repeal of CON will result in unnecessary duplication of services, higher insurance premiums and higher health care costs for individuals and businesses in Henderson County and across the State,\u201d Kirby said in a statement to the Times-News.\n\nKirby said the CON helps the state manage the growth of health care services, and if it is repealed, private facilities will \u201cflood the state,\u201d serving only high-paying patients with high-cost procedures.\n\n\u201cThat means nonprofit hospitals like Pardee will face a higher percentage of under- and uninsured patients, making it very difficult to maintain the operations and services we make available today,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that Pardee works with a number of health care partners like Blue Ridge Community Health, Mission Health Partners, the YMCA and UNC Healthcare to expand access to care and reduce duplication.\n\n\u201cThe loss of CON will put all our efforts at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the CON is repealed and the COPA is continued, Paulus says, there would be \u201cgrave consequences for Mission Health and the region.\u201d\n\nRichard Saver, the Arch T. Allen Distinguished Professor of Law at UNC Law School, said CON laws swept the country in response to 1974 legislation requiring such laws in order to get federal funding.\n\nThe federal law was repealed in the \u201980s, but more than 30 states still have them on the books. Saver said the laws were meant to reduce wasteful duplication of facilities and make sure that one area wasn\u2019t overserved while another was underserved, allowing for more efficient allocation of medical services that also cut down on costs.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s CON law is considered to be fairly comprehensive, he said.\n\nBefore CON, many critics said it\u2019s \u201cnothing more than Soviet-style master planning that is inefficient and impedes competition,\u201d Saver said, but \u201cI think the nuances are a little more subtle.\u201d\n\nThe picture is muddled because the health market is unique, Saver said, with third-party insurers and doctors prescribing products, creating patterns and behaviors not seen in other markets. That\u2019s why, Saver said, \u201csome regulation of controlling new suppliers might be helpful.\u201d\n\nApodaca says the measure is not intended to undercut the viability of community hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe all want to keep small, local hospitals,\u201d Apodaca said. But he added that in this day and time \u2014 and with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that may be impossible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The North Carolina Senate\u2019s proposed budget calls for the repeal of two long-standing health care laws that local hospitals say could have wide-reaching effects on their bottom lines and markets.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-C082EA34-339D-430F-A35A-37C7D4326E43-pubHT"}, "og": {"site_name": "BlueRidgeNow.com", "description": "The North Carolina Senate\u2019s proposed budget calls for the repeal of two long-standing health care laws that local hospitals say could have wide-reaching effects on their bottom lines and markets.", "title": "Senate budget calls for repeal of CON, COPA laws", "url": "http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20150628/ARTICLES/150629921", "image": "http://www.blueridgenow.com/global/images/fb/HT.png", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150628, "fb": {"app_id": 123380601066653}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150629921-pubHT"}}, "keywords": "BUNCOMBE COUNTY (NC),  HENDERSON COUNTY (NC),  Article,  Update,  BUNCOMBE COUNTY (NC),  HENDERSON COUNTY (NC),  Article,  Update"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ac0\"", "article_summary": "The North Carolina Senate\u2019s proposed budget calls for the repeal of two long-standing health care laws that local hospitals say could have wide-reaching effects on their bottom lines and markets.\nHe added that Pardee works with a number of health care partners like Blue Ridge Community Health, Mission Health Partners, the YMCA and UNC Healthcare to expand access to care and reduce duplication.\nThe COPA requires state regulators to monitor the Mission health system to prevent it from instituting anti-competitive practices.\n\u201cWe all want to keep small, local hospitals,\u201d Apodaca said.\nThe Certificate of Need is a regulation that requires all health care facilities to get state approval before expanding services or making large equipment purchases."}
