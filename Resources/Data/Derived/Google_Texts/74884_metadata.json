The report finds 19% of retirees say they would have retired sooner had they not been concerned about losing employer-sponsored insurance.\n\nSo far, more than 8 million Americans have enrolled in plans on both state and federal exchanges, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The law mandates that every individual in the country have coverage by the end of open enrollment period, which passed on March 31, or face a fine of $95 a year or 1% of their annual income for failing to comply.\n\nSubsidies are available for those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which for 2013, was about $45,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four. Many experts predict subsidy levels for next year will likely not keep up with inflation within the health-care industry as premium prices are forecast to increase by double-digits.\n\nNational Center for Policy Analysis Senior Analyst Devon Herrick says it appears the report is downplaying other stats released on early retirement from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this year.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey are admitting the literature is clear, and that health benefits are playing a significant role in the decision to retire early,\u201d Herrick says. \u201cThey say it\u2019s only about 2 percentage points. But the CBO\u2019s most recent analysis says early retirement is at about 2 million, or nearly 2% of the labor force.\u201d\n\nThe move may be good for those who want to move out of their current position but were holding back due to benefits concerns. It may also be a positive for job seekers as some retirees were waiting longer to leave the workforce.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are stuck in jobs they don\u2019t like,\u201d he says. \u201cOr they want to retire, but can\u2019t pay the $10,000 a year for health coverage. An early retiree won\u2019t have to pay that now if health-care is available at a highly-subsidized rate. Folks may say, \u2018that\u2019s the last piece of the puzzle.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the move is not a positive for taxpayers, or the overall labor market, Herrick argues.\n\n\u201cThe downside is that taxpayers are helping pay the tab, and the economy is losing the institutional knowledge these people have,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND
