Deadline approaching for Obamacare enrollment

Hospitals, job counselors are helping people meet the deadline.

The March 31 deadline to sign up for insurance under Covered California is fast approaching, and for one branch of case workers, it’s crunch time to help people get signed up.

Rasheedah Scott is one of three certified enrollment counselors at the Verdugo Jobs Center, a title she earned through a training program to specifically assist individuals in joining the state’s healthcare exchange set up as part of the federal Affordable Care Act.

Since February, she and her co-workers have signed up about 240 people for healthcare, not by recommending a program, but guiding them through Covered California’s website, filling out applications and seeing what kind of coverage they qualify for.

While a majority of the people she’s helped are going to receive Medi-Cal, California’s program for low-income individuals, she’s also counseled people who could afford their own insurance and qualify for tax credits.

“There’s people and families who would rather sit down and get help if it makes them feel better as opposed to going home and not doing it right. It gives them immediate satisfaction,” Scott said.
