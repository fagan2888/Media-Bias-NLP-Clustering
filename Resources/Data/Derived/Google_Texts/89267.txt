Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie 'almost quit the sport when friend and fellow Olympian was killed'

Champion sailor considered retiring after death of Andrew 'Bart' Simpson

Simpson was killed last year during a practice run for America's Cup

Sir Ben tells Desert Island Discs his friend would want him to carry on



Champion sailor Sir Ben Ainslie came close to quitting the sport after the death of a friend and fellow British Olympian.

Sir Ben, 36, tells today’s Desert Island Discs that he considered retiring when Andrew ‘Bart’ Simpson was killed in May last year during a practice run for last year’s America’s Cup in San Francisco Bay.

‘For a while I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go back to San Francisco and keep training for The America’s Cup,’ Ainsley, who has won four Olympic golds, tells host Kirsty Young.

Simpson, 35, who won gold for Britain at the 2008 Olympics, was killed when his catamaran capsized.

Sir Ben, who was a member of the rival American team that later sailed to victory, said he came to terms with his grief when he realised that his friend would have wanted him to carry on.

Sir Ben’s song choices include Coldplay’s Fix You, Sir Elton John’s I’m Still Standing and Carly Simon’s Coming Around Again.
