That selection process for 2016 opens up November 1st.\n\nTwo companies -- both under the Aetna company umbrella -- are pulling out. They are Coventry Health & Life Insurance Co. and Coventry Health Care of Kansas, Inc.\n\nThis impacts those who purchased health insurance from Coventry through the Kansas exchange marketplace. The Kansas Insurance Department estimates more than 51,000 Kansas family members are covered by the two Coventry health insurance companies.\n\nCoventry pulling out comes as a surprise to the Kansas Insurance Department says Clark Shultz, the department's director of government affairs.\n\nShultz says, \"We would have preferred this didn't happen, of course, because it reduces the number of choices that the consumer has. But anybody who purchased this on the health insurance exchange in a prior year will now be able to go back and purchase from a different company on the exchange.\"\n\nAetna Insurance Company spokesman Rohan Hutchings says, \"After reviewing our national foot print, the competitive landscape, market conditions and the portfolio plan that we offer, we reluctantly came to the decision that we could no longer meet the needs of our individual on exchange members in Kansas.\"\n\nShultz says, \"We don't have a lot of specific information from them about their decision making process.\"\n\nShultz says, \"The federal dollars that they were planning on are not going to be at the level they had thought.\" He says Coventry doesn't believe it can be profitable with the premiums it now charges without those subsidies.\n\nThose with Coventry will still have coverage for the remainder of the year, Hutchings says.\n\nShultz says Coventry is working on getting notification to its customers soon.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Aetna Insurance is pulling two of its Coventry Insurance companies from Kansas coverage.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "Aetna Insurance is pulling two of its Coventry Insurance companies from Kansas coverage.", "title": "Kansans losing two insurance companies for Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/coveringkakeland/headlines/Kansans-losing-two-insurance-companies-for-Affordable-Care-Act-334839641.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/82D/91C/82D91CDA476643F59C5C39D338BFEEA8", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/71F/654/71F6542EB91F4080BE0C99969A0E8C3C.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Aetna Insurance is pulling two of its Coventry Insurance companies from Kansas coverage.", "title": "Kansans losing two insurance companies for Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/coveringkakeland/headlines/Kansans-losing-two-insurance-companies-for-Affordable-Care-Act-334839641.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/health+care.mgn.JPG", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Kansans losing two insurance companies for Affordable Care Act", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kansans losing two insurance companies"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce700\"", "article_summary": "The Kansas Insurance Department estimates more than 51,000 Kansas family members are covered by the two Coventry health insurance companies.\nKansans will have two fewer choices when selecting health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\nThey are Coventry Health & Life Insurance Co. and Coventry Health Care of Kansas, Inc.\nThis impacts those who purchased health insurance from Coventry through the Kansas exchange marketplace.\nCoventry pulling out comes as a surprise to the Kansas Insurance Department says Clark Shultz, the department's director of government affairs."}
