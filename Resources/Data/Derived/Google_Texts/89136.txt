If Republican legislators simply ran out the clock, they could’ve shrunk the Highway Trust fund and restored a decentralized approach to transportation funding.

That’s according to Dr. Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, who joined Ben on today’s episode of the Federalist Radio Hour. Instead, he says politicians opted “to send money to Washington in leaky buckets, before sending it back to the states in more leaky buckets.”

Later in the program, author and blogger, Lenore Skenazy, discusses the Free-Range Kids movement. Like most parents, she remembers the days when kids played outside on their own. Now the author chronicles cases of overreach from Police and Child Protective Services.

She explains that liberals today tend “to overestimate dangers while underestimating the families of children.”
