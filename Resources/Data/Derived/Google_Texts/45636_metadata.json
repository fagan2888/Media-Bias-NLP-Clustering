Advanced Endoscopy Devices launched Endoscopy Superstore, an online portal where hospitals can purchase endoscopy products directly from the manufacturer.\n\nWith increased patient visits and shrinking reimbursements, hospitals can no longer afford to be complacent in any area of operation. In order to survive, they need to adopt a culture of transparency to better compete for patients and increased reimbursements as they transition to accountable care organizations.\n\nMedical device manufacturers, like Advanced Endoscopy Devices, are changing their sales strategies to become more transparent and meet hospitals\u2019 needs.\n\nNot too long ago, price transparency was just a buzzword. Now, it\u2019s a survival strategy for hospitals of all sizes.\n\nHow do hospitals implement price transparency? They can start by moving away from reliance on GPO contracts. Hospital purchasing managers have become complacent and relied on GPO contracts to do their jobs. They purchase what is on the contract, trusting that the GPOs have their best interests and profit margins in mind when they negotiate vendor contracts on their behalf.\n\nFor example, a 2002 pilot study by the Government Accountability Office found that hospitals that went through GPOs paid more for safety needles and pacemakers than those that negotiated prices on their own. For some pacemakers, the median gap was as wide as 39 percent.\n\nToday, makers of the costliest devices and equipment tend to be secretive about pricing and generally require buyers to sign gag clauses promising not to disclose what they\u2019ve paid, which makes it even more difficult for hospitals to comparison shop. (In fact, this is one reason GPOs maintain their services are necessary.)\n\nBut, by using technology to streamline the sales process, manufacturers like AED can use e-commerce models to reduce overhead costs and pass these savings directly to the customer. This is why AED has launched Endoscopy Superstore, an online endoscopy shopping cart.\n\nWith Endoscopy Superstore's launch, hospitals can instantly compare prices of endoscopy instruments from notable manufacturers as well as AED and purchase them directly. With a guaranteed savings of 30 to 60 percent, Endoscopy Superstore can help hospitals meet their budgetary needs in light of the Affordable Care Act. And now that endoscopic surgery is mainstream, hospitals no longer need sales reps to show surgeons and perioperative staff how to assemble and use these instruments. Endoscopy Superstore and AED take it to the next level by providing online tutorials on instrument assembly/disassembly and inservices.\n\nABOUT AED\n\nAt the forefront of minimally invasive surgery since 1985, Advanced Endoscopy Devices is doing our part to help hospitals achieve their Affordable Care Act goals and meet their budgetary requirements.
