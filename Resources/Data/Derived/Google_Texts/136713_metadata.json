Bernie Sanders of Vermont, before New York\u2019s April 19 primary.\n\nClinton, the former secretary of state who also served as New York\u2019s U.S. senator for eight years, leads Sanders 54 percent to 42 percent among statewide voters, according to a Quinnipiac Poll released last Thursday.\n\nBut Sanders has narrowed the polling gap over the past month. A Siena College poll released March 7 had Clinton ahead by 21 points and an Emerson College poll released March 16 had her leading by 48 points.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nAt the churches, Clinton acknowledged the endorsement of Nicole Bell, whose fianc\u00e9 Sean Bell was shot to death in 2006 by plainclothes police officers on the morning of his wedding, as he left a Queens strip club where he had been celebrating his bachelor party.\n\nUndercover NYPD officers shot into Bell\u2019s car 50 times, wounding two of his friends, saying at the time they believed the men were carrying weapons, when in fact the men were unarmed. The city later paid a $7 million settlement to Bell\u2019s family and his friends.\n\n\u201cI remember as your senator being heartsick about this event,\u201d Clinton told the audience at the Christian Cultural Center, saying she would build on the advocacy work of Bell\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and other anti gun-violence activists to improve community policing policies and gun laws.\n\nAt Brown Memorial Baptist Church, before some 100 congregants, Clinton emphasized her local ties, saying she had the \u201cNew York know-how\u201d to deliver on her campaign promises.\n\nShe \u201chumbly\u201d asked for the support of more than 100 churchgoers at Mount Pisgah, saying she would \u201ctackle systemic racism\u201d and continue President Barack Obama\u2019s push for affordable health care coverage.\n\nOn Monday, Clinton is scheduled to appear with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in Manhattan for a rally to celebrate last week\u2019s passage of a state minimum wage hike. Clinton will also headline the Suffolk Democrats\u2019 $300-a-head spring dinner on April 11.\n\nBill Clinton will campaign on behalf of his wife in Elmont on Tuesday, with an 11a.m. appearance at The Vault, according to a campaign news release.\n\nWith Rick Brand", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sun, 03 Apr 2016 18:42:14 -0400", "sailthru.author": "Laura Figueroa", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned in Brooklyn yesterday, telling congregants at three predominantly black churches that she would fight to reduce gun violence and", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11648300.1459723333!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned in Brooklyn yesterday, telling congregants at three predominantly black churches that she would fight to reduce gun violence and", "title": "Clinton vows to curb gun violence in Brooklyn", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/clinton-campaigns-in-brooklyn-vows-to-curb-gun-violence-1.11648140", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11648300.1459723333!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned in Brooklyn yesterday, telling congregants at three predominantly black churches that she would fight to reduce gun violence and", "title": "Clinton vows to curb gun violence in Brooklyn", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11648300.1459723333!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "sailthru.title": "Clinton vows to curb gun violence in Brooklyn", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "NEWSDAY", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "NEWSDAY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Clinton also appeared at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Clinton Hill and Mount Pisgah Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where she pledged to end racial profiling among law enforcement agencies.\nA Siena College poll released March 7 had Clinton ahead by 21 points and an Emerson College poll released March 16 had her leading by 48 points.\nBill Clinton will campaign on behalf of his wife in Elmont on Tuesday, with an 11a.m.\nAt Brown Memorial Baptist Church, before some 100 congregants, Clinton emphasized her local ties, saying she had the \u201cNew York know-how\u201d to deliver on her campaign promises.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned in Brooklyn yesterday, telling congregants at three predominantly black churches that she would fight to reduce gun violence and \u201cincrease trust\u201d between police departments and the communities they serve."}
