Understanding the difficulty of this situation, Holzer officials said that they are committed to the support of employees through this difficult career transition. Separation pay and outplacement services, including job placement assistance and career support will be provided to all of the dedicated and loyal employees affected.\n\n\u201cHolzer Health System remains committed to the health and wellbeing of the residents of southern Ohio and western West Virginia,\u201d Holzer Health System CEO Christopher T. Meyer, D.O. said. \u201cIt is the hope of all involved in this difficult decision that the community hospital that provided for the healthcare needs of the region since 1910 will continue its legacy of excellent patient-centered care for future generations.\u201d\n\nIn their release, officials stated that the delivery of high quality, patient-centered care remains its top priority. \u201cThe organization will continue to meet or exceed national safety standards for staff-patient ratios as it manages this difficult transition,\u201d Holzer claimed.\n\nHolzer claims that when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in March of 2010 it resulted in a dramatic change in healthcare service delivery models. \u201cInpatient volumes continue to shrink while outpatient volumes are rising. Reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements further complicate the issue. Approximately 65 percent of Holzer\u2019s patients are covered by government insurance. The shift in service delivery and funding cuts are realities for hospitals across the United States. The situation is uniquely more challenging for health systems in rural communities,\u201d Holzer said in their release.\n\n\u201cOur entire staff works tirelessly to reduce operational costs and to streamline operations, while continuing to provide excellent care to our patients,\u201d said Meyer. \u201cWhile these efforts helped us to maintain our not-for-profit community hospital system, unfortunately, it has not been enough to address the sweeping changes in the healthcare environment. This national situation placed us in a regrettable position. We must now take additional action to ensure the long-term financial health and stability of Holzer so that we may continue providing the excellent health care our patients deserve for many years to come.\u201d\n\nHolzer Health System said that they have been actively reducing operational expenditures, eliminating duplication of services resulting from a merger in 2012, divesting excess property holdings, and renegotiating supply contracts. \u201cAs is being experienced by health systems throughout the country, inpatient service volumes decreased nearly 15 percent while reimbursement for services continues to decline, and cost of care delivery continues to rise. Operational expenses in the most recent fiscal year exceeded revenues by more than $1.2 million resulting in the unmanageable decline in revenue necessitating a reduction in force,\u201d Holzer explained in their release.\n\nHolzer Health System said that they demonstrate excellence and exceed national standards despite the challenging economic environment. During the most recent year, the system received the following national awards and recognitions:\n\n\u2022 Nationally Recognized among Top 5% in the Nation for Joint Replacement \u2013 Healthgrades\n\n\u2022 Named one of Healthgrades America\u2019s 100 Best Hospitals for Joint ReplacementTM in 2015.\n\n\u2022 National Quality Award \u2013 American Health Care Association National Center for Assisted Living\n\nA not-for-profit entity, Holzer Health System is a regional health system consisting of two hospital locations in Gallipolis and Jackson.
