AUVSI\u2019s economic impact study found that, in the first decade following integration, the UAS industry will create more than 100,000 jobs and $82 billion in economic impact. However, each day that integration is delayed will lead to $27 million in lost economic impact.\"The November 2013 release of the UAS Integration Roadmap, the December 2013 announcement of six federally designated UAS test sites, and the first commercial flight of a UAS in the U.S. Arctic were all important milestones on the path toward unlocking the potential of unmanned aircraft,\" Toscano continued. \"However, until the FAA writes the rules for small unmanned aircraft, the commercial UAS industry will remain grounded.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Drone makers are encouraging the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to allow unmanned aircraft to fly over rural areas before a broader integration with commercial airplanes is completed.
