That\u2019s up 4,586 people from May according to information released by the state Department of Human Services on Monday.\n\nThe total average cost per person also declined by almost a dollar, from $485.83 in May to $484.94 in June. That sits well under the federally approved cap of $500.08 per person. The cap set by the Centers for Medicaid Services is a condition of the waiver that allows Arkansas to use federal money, intended to expand the federally-run Medicaid program, to instead purchase private insurance for low-income residents.\n\nThe average premium cost per person also declined from May to June ($350.96-$350.28). June\u2019s average cost is below every other month this year with the exception of January, when the average premium per person was $349.90.\n\nThe private option is the Arkansas's adaptation of an Affordable Care Act provision that allows states to opt-in to a higher federal reimbursement rate for Medicaid and expand coverage to those earning 138 percent of the poverty line.\n\nA legislative task force is currently assessing the future of the state's Medicaid program with recommendations expected by the end of the year. The private option is set to expire by 2017.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "The number of Arkansans deemed eligible for health care coverage through the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid \u2013 known as the private option \u2013 continues to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/arkansas-medicaid-expansion-enrollment-costs-down", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201507/po_june_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The number of Arkansans deemed eligible for health care coverage through the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid \u2013 known as the private option \u2013 continues to", "title": "Arkansas Medicaid Expansion Enrollment Up, Costs Down"}, "story_id": 426892775, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarkauffman"}, "author": "Jacob Kauffman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Arkansas Medicaid Expansion Enrollment Up, Costs Down"}, "nid": 45176, "datePublished": "2015-07-27", "keywords": "Arkansas Politics, Arkansas Healthcare", "wordCount": 250, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc7c\"", "article_summary": "A legislative task force is currently assessing the future of the state's Medicaid program with recommendations expected by the end of the year.\nThe total average cost per person also declined by almost a dollar, from $485.83 in May to $484.94 in June.\nThe number of Arkansans deemed eligible for health care coverage through the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid \u2013 known as the private option \u2013 continues to tick up, rising to 259,335 in June.\nThe cap set by the Centers for Medicaid Services is a condition of the waiver that allows Arkansas to use federal money, intended to expand the federally-run Medicaid program, to instead purchase private insurance for low-income residents.\nJune\u2019s average cost is below every other month this year with the exception of January, when the average premium per person was $349.90."}
