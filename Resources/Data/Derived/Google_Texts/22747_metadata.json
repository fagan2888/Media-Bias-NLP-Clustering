More health plans are adopting narrow provider networks and closed drug formularies as a way to hold down costs, while aspects of the market have become less competitive on the whole.\n\nThe elephant in the room is how much the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to blame for these trends. The truth is that before implementation of the ACA, American health care was hardly a low-cost, high-quality, free-market utopia. So however one decides to parse blame for our current challenges\u2014and I have admittedly been a critic of the ACA since its inception\u2014my goal today is not to revisit that legislation\u2019s pros or cons. Instead I want to briefly consider some of the current trends that we are observing and offer market-based reforms that I believe are universal. They could make the market for coverage more competitive and affordable, whether the ACA remains in force or we adopt a different framework for health care reform.\n\nToward these ends, today I want to do two things. First, I want to make some brief observations about trends in the insurance market that are occurring both inside and outside the exchanges. These are developments that I believe impede the common goals we seek of fostering a market of high-quality and more affordable coverage options. Second, I want to offer some ideas for reforms that I believe can help reverse some of these trends and make the market for health insurance more robust, competitive, and high value.\n\nRead the PDF.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Gottlieb offers some ideas for reforms with the potential to help reverse some of the less desirable trends brought about by the ACA and make the market for health insurance more robust, competitive, and high-value.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Dr. Gottlieb offers some ideas for reforms with the potential to help reverse some of the less desirable trends brought about by the ACA and make the market for health insurance more robust, competitive, and high-value.", "title": "Testimony: Health care solutions to increasing patient choice and plan innovation - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/testimony-health-care-changes-to-improve-patient-choices.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/testimony-health-care-solutions-to-increasing-patient-choice-and-plan-innovation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Introduction:Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman, I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Committee today.In recent years we have seen health insurance costs continue to incr", "creator": "@AEI", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/testimony-health-care-changes-to-improve-patient-choices.jpg", "title": "Testimony: Health care solutions to increasing patient choice and plan innovation", "site": "@AEI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=953539392", "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Affordable Care Act (Obamacare),patient choice"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "In recent years we have seen health insurance costs continue to increase, while the commercial health insurance options available to consumers have shrunken.\nThe truth is that before implementation of the ACA, American health care was hardly a low-cost, high-quality, free-market utopia.\nThe elephant in the room is how much the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to blame for these trends.\nFirst, I want to make some brief observations about trends in the insurance market that are occurring both inside and outside the exchanges.\nThey could make the market for coverage more competitive and affordable, whether the ACA remains in force or we adopt a different framework for health care reform."}
