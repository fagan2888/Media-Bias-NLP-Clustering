But here\u2019s one: Give poor people money.\n\nThat\u2019s a highly controversial idea here in the United States, where so many social programs are focused on helping people find work, rather than offering them services or sending them checks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut elsewhere around the world, things work differently. Virtually every developed nation has a lower poverty rate than the US. That\u2019s not because all their citizens have jobs and earn a decent living. It\u2019s because they provide direct assistance to those at risk, in the form of cash, housing subsidies, pensions, and child benefits.\n\nHow do other countries fight poverty?\n\nBy collecting taxes and distributing the money to people who need it. And it really does seem to work.\n\nOne way to see the central role tax-and-transfer programs play is by looking at what would happen if they didn\u2019t exist. In other words, how many people would be living in poverty if they had to survive on their paychecks alone?\n\nIt turns out that even in famously egalitarian European nations, lots of people would be left with poverty-level earnings if it weren\u2019t for government support. One in every three people in France and Germany would be living in poverty, one in four in Sweden and Denmark. And by this measure, the United States fits right in, with a poverty rate of 28 percent.\n\nNo one, in other words, has been able to tackle poverty by building an economy that works for all involved. Yes, European countries tend to have higher unionization rates, tighter business regulations, and other mechanisms to ensure that workers get a meaningful share of the profit pie. But what the above chart shows is that if people had to rely on salary alone, poverty would be a massive social problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, look at what happens when you count government programs. Suddenly, the United States becomes an outlier, with a poverty rate 50 percent higher than the UK and Canada, twice as high as Germany, and three times that in Denmark. Tax and transfer programs in the United States just don\u2019t have the same anti-poverty bite.\n\nDoesn\u2019t giving people money reduce their incentive to work?\n\nThere are certainly times when welfare programs interfere with work. Take the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), which made it easier for people to get their own insurance coverage. With the act in place, people don\u2019t need to have a job just to get health insurance, and consequently fewer people choose to work.\n\nYet, most people in poverty don\u2019t really face this trade-off. Matt Bruenig, a poverty researcher at the liberal research center Demos, pored over the numbers and found that the majority are either kids, the elderly, or those with disabilities.\n\nOf the rest, another big chunk are students. And it\u2019s not clear that pushing kids, students, the elderly, and the disabled into the workforce \u2014 under penalty of poverty \u2014 would be good for them, or for the economy.\n\nBut you can\u2019t give kids money, can you?\n\nWhen it comes to addressing poverty among the elderly, the US takes the direct approach of just sending people money. It\u2019s called Social Security, and it\u2019s the most powerful anti-poverty program that we have, helping millions of seniors each year and driving the elderly poverty rate down from 35 percent, in 1960 to around 10 percent today. (In case you\u2019re wondering, social security is very much an anti-poverty program, not just a forced savings vehicle. For years, most retirees have gotten more than they paid in, though future retirees may not be so lucky.)\n\nKids in poverty require a whole different approach. You can\u2019t just deposit money in their bank accounts. Often, you have to route it through their parents, which makes things more complicated.\n\nHow, for instance, to ensure that the money is used to help kids, and not siphoned off for the pleasure of parents? This is one reason many states \u2014 including Massachusetts \u2014 place restrictions on how welfare benefits can be used: no spending on alcohol, tobacco, or lottery tickets, for instance.\n\nBut a study came out last month suggesting that some of these concerns may be overblown. It looked at poor, Native American families in North Carolina, who started receiving checks after the opening of a casino. The results were clear and positive. Parents drank less and spent more time with their kids \u2014 some were able to move to better neighborhoods. The kids, too, saw real benefits, including a large reduction in behavioral problems.\n\nCan education help reduce poverty?\n\nEducation gives people valuable skills, which makes them more productive at their jobs. And having lots of productive, highly-skilled workers should help boost the economy and generate more money for everyone, including those at risk of falling into poverty.\n\nHaving said that, we\u2019ve done a lot to improve education over the last 50 years. Three times as many adults hold a college degree, today, compared to the mid-1970s. Yet the market poverty rate \u2014 leaving out government programs \u2014 has actually gone up.\n\nIs it really possible to tame poverty?\n\nOver the last few decades, the United States has been experimenting with new kinds of anti-poverty measures, with an eye on helping people find work. We\u2019ve expanded programs like the earned income tax credit, which go to working families, and changed our welfare system to encourage job-hunting.\n\nThese sorts of programs have their benefits \u2014 the earned income tax credit helps millions of Americans. Still, most countries take a different approach, and get better results. Judging from the rest of the world \u2014 and the effectiveness of Social Security \u2014 sometimes the best anti-poverty programs are the ones that provide direct support.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.964779038", "eomportal-id": 134277, "description": "Virtually every developed nation has a lower poverty rate than the US, because they provide direct assistance to those at risk.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Virtually every developed nation has a lower poverty rate than the US, because they provide direct assistance to those at risk.", "title": "A proven way to reduce poverty - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/10/29/proven-way-reduce-poverty/KSMVN9DUaOILiA2I7TTOXO/story.html", "image": "http://www.bostonglobe.com/rw/Boston/Library/Staff/Caricatures/horowitz_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 04:55:00 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Evan Horowitz,Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "30a095ea-7e58-11e5-a402-9825e4b1fa57", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Evan Horowitz,Twitter"}, "article_summary": "And by this measure, the United States fits right in, with a poverty rate of 28 percent.\nVirtually every developed nation has a lower poverty rate than the US.\nPoverty is such a longstanding, deeply-rooted problem that it\u2019s hard to believe there could be a relatively straightforward way to address it.\nYet the market poverty rate \u2014 leaving out government programs \u2014 has actually gone up.\nSuddenly, the United States becomes an outlier, with a poverty rate 50 percent higher than the UK and Canada, twice as high as Germany, and three times that in Denmark."}
