Solitary confinement is considered a form of torture by the U.N., and in recent years, has been outlawed and scaled back in the United States. In Nebraska, however, children are being forced into isolation for offenses as minor as having too many books or passing notes.\n\nAccording to the Center for Constitutional Rights, in the early 19th century, the United States pioneered solitary confinement as a form of punishment. After its damaging psychological effects became apparent, however, it was discontinued. Though the practice recently regained popularity, it has once again been skewered as excessive and dangerous.\n\nThe United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Mendez, concluded in 2011 that \u201ceven 15 days in solitary confinement constitutes torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 15 days is the limit after which irreversible harmful psychological effects can occur.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cConsidering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause,\u201d Mendez said, \u201cit can amount to torture\u2026when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.\u201d Mendez, an Argentinian human rights activist and attorney who was personally tortured by the military in his native country in the 1970s, urged an \u201cabsolute prohibition\u201d on solitary confinement for juveniles and those with mental illness.\n\nExperts stress that because children are not developmentally mature, the effects of torture may be more pronounced. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatrists opposes the practice altogether, though Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative recommends it be used for no more than four hours \u2014 a guideline Nebraska facilities routinely violate.\n\nReports from recent years indicate many states are taking efforts to reduce the extent of the practice, including many of Nebraska\u2019s neighboring states.\n\nEven New York\u2019s Rikers Island, notorious for its abuse of prisoners, moved last year to discontinue the use of solitary confinement for inmates under the age of 21. A successful class action suit filed in 2015 on behalf of California inmates at the Pelican Bay State Prison had sweeping effects on the state\u2019s solitary confinement system.\n\nNebraska, however, has not followed this trend, in spite of the psychological consequences and multiple violations of constitutional rights that come along with it.\n\nConcerned by previous findings on the state\u2019s use of solitary confinement on children, the Nebraska branch of the ACLU examined written policies from different facilities on the practice. It also issued open records requests to obtain logs detailing the implementation of the punishment.\n\nThe ACLU found, \u201cA young Nebraskan\u2019s experience with solitary confinement is completely arbitrary and dependent upon the facility in which he or she is placed.\u201d\n\nFor example, two facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services, located in Geneva and Kearney, had individual stays in solitary that lasted at most 5 and 5.1 days, respectively. Both institutions have policies limiting confinement to five days, though this duration is still longer than experts recommend. A county facility located in Sarpy had relatively low numbers; its longest stay was less than half a day. Interestingly, it does not have a policy dictating limits on the practice.\n\nThe longest stay at the state\u2019s Nebraska Correctional Youth Facility, located in Douglas County, was 90 days \u2014 75 days longer than the maximum recommended for adults. That facility\u2019s shortest stay was a full day, also longer than the recommended duration for children. A county facility located in Madison County, the Northeast Nebraska Juvenile Services Center, had at least one solitary sentence lasting 52 days. Its shortest, like the Douglas facility, was one full day.\n\nThe length of the average stay often exceeded the recommended length of time at each facility (four hours), as well. Kearney and Geneva averaged confinement durations of 20.8 and 50.24 hours, respectively. Others were slightly lower, as in the case of a county facility in Lancaster, which averaged 14.15 hour stays. However, employees at Lancaster likely sentenced a higher volume of children to confinement, considering the total number of days spent in solitary at the facility was 455.85; though the stays were relatively short, they were distributed across a high number of students and were still longer than recommended. The ACLU noted Lancaster\u2019s solitary logs \u201cdemonstrate the seemingly often arbitrary and subjective use of solitary confinement as a form of punishment.\u201d\n\nThe Nebraska Correctional Youth Facility in Douglas County, which ranked highest for its longest individual stay \u2014 90 days \u2014 ranked second highest in the average length of punishment: 187.66 hours, or nearly eight days. Children spent 2,021.04 total days in solitary confinement. Further, Madison County\u2019s state-run Northeast NE Juvenile Services Center had the longest average stay: 189.16 hours. The total days spent in solitary by all juvenile inmates was 1,064.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, this problem disproportionately affects minorities. Though only 20% of youth in Nebraska are \u201cof color,\u201d the ACLU reports, they make up 55% of the juvenile detention population in the state.\n\nRegardless of race, the ACLU suggested the overuse of the punishment occurs because \u201cThe lack of statewide standards leaves facilities with far too much discretion, often resulting in the use of solitary confinement for improper or unnecessary purposes.\u201d While some facilities allow students to attend educational activities while in solitary, others enforce complete isolation. The inciting activities of students are equally arbitrary.\n\nCiting official logs detailing children sentenced to the punishment, the Nebraska ACLU noted one student was sent for rummaging through garbage to look for cookies, failing to stop when asked. Another was doing pull ups on a window ledge. One passed a note in class, yet another was caught talking in the hallway, and one deviant had a thread from a sock in their mouth . Most egregiously, two instances of solitary confinement were prompted after children were determined to have an \u201cexcessive\u201d number of books. Often, the punishment excludes the child from attending educational classes or so much as socializing with other children, further limiting their ability to learn.\n\nJacob Rusher was held at the Douglas Correctional Youth Facility from the age of 15 to 17. He told the ACLU he was placed in solitary confinement for three months on multiple occasions. First, it was for his own protection after he broke his ankle. Then, he says he was placed in solitary after being attacked by older detainees: \u201cIt was 23 hours a day alone, no TV or radio,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were in there with one book, a blanket, a mat, and a toothbrush. No art materials, no hobby items \u2014 everything was considered contraband.\u201d\n\nSolitary confinement can have staggering consequences. As the ACLU report detailed:\n\n\u201cFor adults, the effects can be persistent mental health problems, or worse, suicide. And for children, who are still developing and more vulnerable to irreparable harm, the risks of solitary are magnified \u2013 protracted isolation and solitary confinement can be permanently damaging, especially for those with mental illness.\u201d\n\nYet in one case study, the ACLU found a female inmate who threatened self-harm was subsequently placed in solitary confinement. Lisa, now an adult, recalled her experience. \u201cIronically (because I was in solitary for self harm), I survived my time alone by just falling back on hurting myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d bite my own cheeks and tongue, banging my head on the wall.\u201d\n\nThough it seems the world is evolving past this form of cruel and unusual punishment, Nebraska\u2019s practices demonstrate there is still work to be done. The ACLU offered several recommendations to scale back and standardize solitary confinement, including using it as a last resort, ensuring due process \u2014 such as letting the inmate know why they are subjected to it \u2014 and mandating staff members be educated in youth development, mental health, and de-escalation techniques.\n\nAs Lisa observed:\n\n\u201cWhat are the facilities trying to accomplish? If it is to manage somebody\u2019s behavior so they don\u2019t harm themselves or someone else, it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it just creates more isolation, anger and separation and hopelessness. We need to be cognizant of how many traumatic and difficult, violating experiences these youths have already had. Solitary just re-traumatizes them. Much of what was done to me was out of ignorance, not evil, but I want people to recognize that we can change things for the better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cConsidering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture\u2026when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.\u201d , Juvenile, Nebrasaka, solitary confinement,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Carey Wedler | AntiMedia", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\u201cConsidering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture\u2026when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.\u201d , Juvenile, Nebrasaka, solitary confinement,", "title": "Nebraska Is Torturing Incarcerated Youth For Having Too Many Books, Passing Notes", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/nebraska-is-torturing-incarcerated-youth-for-having-too-many-books-passing-notes/212614/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/solitary-confinement.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T18:11:02-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cConsidering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture\u2026when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.\u201d , Juvenile, Nebrasaka, solitary confinement,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/solitary-confinement.jpg", "title": "Nebraska Is Torturing Incarcerated Youth For Having Too Many Books, Passing Notes", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "solitary confinement", "published_time": "2016-01-09T05:00:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T18:11:02-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "In Nebraska, however, children are being forced into isolation for offenses as minor as having too many books or passing notes.\nMost egregiously, two instances of solitary confinement were prompted after children were determined to have an \u201cexcessive\u201d number of books.\nA successful class action suit filed in 2015 on behalf of California inmates at the Pelican Bay State Prison had sweeping effects on the state\u2019s solitary confinement system.\nThe longest stay at the state\u2019s Nebraska Correctional Youth Facility, located in Douglas County, was 90 days \u2014 75 days longer than the maximum recommended for adults.\nEven New York\u2019s Rikers Island, notorious for its abuse of prisoners, moved last year to discontinue the use of solitary confinement for inmates under the age of 21."}
