In 2013, her work was named one of the RESA\u2019s Top 10 Best Occupied Stagings - North America. Cindy\u2019s work was also recognized in the Tulsa Parade of Homes winning Best Interior Decor ($500-$699K category) and Second Place Overall ($400-$500K category).\n\nLast year, Cindy was hired to outfit the housing for the cast of the recently released movie August: Osage County.

It is really a testament to my proactive Realtors and savvy sellers who recognize the value and return on their investment in professional home staging. We work as a team to create buyer-friendly spaces to sell houses for the best price in the shortest amount of time \u201c said Cindy Gasior.\n\n\u201cWe would like to thank everyone for their participation in the awards process; without the support of our membership we would not be able to recognize so many well-deserving professionals in our industry.
