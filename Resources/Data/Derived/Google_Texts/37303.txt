Seattle, Wash. – Proliance Surgeons, Inc., P.S., a physician-owned medical group that owns and operates 19 ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) throughout the Puget Sound region including the Lakewood Surgery Center at 7308 Bridgeport Way W., in Lakewood, recently hosted a visit from Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson. Ferguson’s visit included a tour and briefing with administrators, physicians and other healthcare professionals at Seattle Surgery Center, a Proliance Surgeons’ facility. Proliance Surgeons conducted a similar tour for U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) in October.

ASCs are free-standing healthcare facilities that provide same-day surgical, diagnostic and preventive procedures. Designed specifically to deliver better quality care at a lower cost, ASCs are leaders in federal and state healthcare reform. When compared to hospitals, patients have a lower rate of infection at ASCs, receive more personalized care, experience shorter wait times and report greater satisfaction with their care.

“Proliance Surgeons is making a strong effort to meet personally with elected officials and educate them on the unique role surgery centers play in alleviating cost pressures on hospitals and other providers under the Affordable Care Act,” says David G. Fitzgerald, chief executive officer of Proliance Surgeons. “We are honored and grateful that Attorney General Ferguson took the time to visit us, ask questions and learn the issues facing our industry.”

As the state’s chief legal officer, Ferguson is committed to protecting the people of Washington and on standing up for consumers in all commercial arenas, including healthcare. “All healthcare providers are regulated by the state,” Fitzgerald says, “so it’s important that elected officials understand how state and federal regulations impact our ability to deliver high quality care at an affordable cost.”
