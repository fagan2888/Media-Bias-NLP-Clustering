They dress up and feel special.\u201d\n\nBut the luxurious getaway has angered society members.\n\n\u201cThis is just a very bad look for an organisation that purports to have the needs of the poor and destitute front of mind,\u2019\u2019 one said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t launch a Christmas appeal asking the public to donate to help the homeless and so on and then take this lot off to a Tattersall\u2019s for a nosh-up. You won\u2019t be seeing any poor homeless bugger there, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nThe 149-year-old Tattersall\u2019s Club \u2014 whose $1000-a-year members include business and political leaders \u2014 says it offers \u201cthe ultimate atmosphere, style and service\u2019\u2019.\n\nSix council members will stay in the club\u2019s \u201cspacious suites\u2019\u2019 with king-size beds and access to facilities including a 25m pool, health centre and billiards room \u2014 at a cost of $1200.\n\nFlights for four members will add nearly $1700.\n\nThe event, including last night\u2019s Christmas dinner for 33 people, cost $2817. Mr Maher said it was cheaper than going to a restaurant and as a Tattersall\u2019s member \u2014 \u201cwhich I fund personally\u201d \u2014 he got a good deal on meeting room hire.\n\nHe admitted that using such a luxurious venue could create an image problem but said: \u201cIt would be a shame if some people judged Vinnies on the event rather than the $25 million worth of assistance they provided to people in need each year.\u201d\n\nThe charity recently launched its annual Christmas appeal \u201cto support the people that will suffer in silence and will be doing it tough over the Christmas period\u2019\u2019.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "BOSSES of one of Queenslands biggest charities are on an all-expenses-paid retreat at an exclusive private club this weekend \u2014 while the organisation runs a Christmas appeal for the disadvantaged.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/st-vincent-de-paul-society-board-on-luxury-getaway-at-tattersalls-club-brisbane/news-story/9df722a8fd9d7ca6bc255a85c36e2f3d", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c9fefb997ee8bc8dec61a1034adcdf76", "type": "article", "description": "BOSSES of one of Queensland\u2019s biggest charities are on an all-expenses-paid retreat at an exclusive private club this weekend \u2014 while the organisation runs a Christmas appeal for the disadvantaged.", "title": "Charity board laps up luxury"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c9fefb997ee8bc8dec61a1034adcdf76", "description": "BOSSES of one of Queensland\u2019s biggest charities are on an all-expenses-paid retreat at an exclusive private club this weekend \u2014 while the organisation runs a Christmas appeal for the disadvantaged.", "site": "@couriermail", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Charity board laps up luxury"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/9df722a8fd9d7ca6bc255a85c36e2f3d?domain=couriermail.com.au"}, "articleid": "9df722a8fd9d7ca6bc255a85c36e2f3d", "keywords": "charity, luxury getaway, Tattersall's Club, Vinnies, St Vincent de Paul, council members, private membership club, homeless bugger, day in-day, image problem, perception issue, church hall, health centre, billiards room, senior staff, premier private membership, quarterly meeting, Queensland, Australia, Vincent de Paul Society, Ozcare board, Peter Maher", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-29T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-29T10:25:17.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc337\"", "article_summary": "St Vincent de Paul Society state council members and partners, senior staff and guests are spending the weekend at the Tattersall\u2019s Club.\nSt Vincent de Paul Society state council members and partners, senior staff and guests have been enjoying the salubrious surroundings of the Tattersall\u2019s Club, which promotes itself as \u201cBrisbane\u2019s premier private membership club\u2019\u2019.\nThe 149-year-old Tattersall\u2019s Club \u2014 whose $1000-a-year members include business and political leaders \u2014 says it offers \u201cthe ultimate atmosphere, style and service\u2019\u2019.\nThey dress up and feel special.\u201dBut the luxurious getaway has angered society members.\nBOSSES of one of Queensland\u2019s biggest charities are on an all-expenses-paid retreat at an exclusive private club this weekend \u2014 while the organisation runs a Christmas appeal for the disadvantaged."}
