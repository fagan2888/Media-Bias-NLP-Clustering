ASPEN, Colo.—Federal water managers have increased water releases from Ruedi Reservoir to make way for runoff from deep mountain snows.

The Aspen Times reports ( http://tinyurl.com/n4tploe) the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation increased the reservoir flow into the Frying Pan River to about 168 cubic feet per second from 25 cubic feet per second.

Only five times in the past 35 years have releases have topped 160 cubic feet per second.

The reservoir is about 10 miles north of Aspen.

The stepped-up releases have reduced the reservoir to about 76 percent full, down from 78 percent.

A massive snowstorm Jan. 31 through Feb. 3 increased the snowpack in the upper Fryingpan Valley from about average to 133 percent of average.
