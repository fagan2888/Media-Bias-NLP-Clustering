The Government Accountability Office estimates that each plane cost $412 million.\n\n\"The committee also understands there has been interest within the Department of the Air Force, Department of Defense, and Congress in potentially restarting production of the F-22 aircraft,\" the subcommittee writes.\n\n\"In light of growing threats to U.S. air superiority as a result of adversaries closing the technology gap and increasing demand from allies and partners for high-performance, multirole aircraft to meet evolving and worsening global security threats, the committee believes that such proposals are worthy of further exploration,\u201d the bill states, with a nod to advances made by Russia and China in recent years.\n\nTherefore, \u201cthe committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to conduct a comprehensive assessment and study of the costs associated with resuming production of F-22 aircraft and provide a report\u201d back by January 1, 2017.\n\nRelated: 5 Attack Planes That Could Replace the A-10 Warthog\n\nLockheed delivered the last F-22 in 2011 and then took apart its assembly lines in Georgia and Texas. The Pentagon has labored in the last two years to put the effort\u2019s troubled past behind it, deploying the jet against ISIS and sending it on training assignments to Europe in a move aimed at calming allies worried by Russia\u2019s increasingly aggressive behavior.\n\nAside from the staggering price tag of buying 194 new aircraft at $412 million apiece \u2013 which back-of-the-envelope math shows would cost U.S. taxpayers roughly $80 billion \u2013 there are other substantial costs associated with getting the F-22 line back online.\n\nFor example, in 2010 a service-commissioned RAND study found that the cost to restart the F-22 production line just to buy an additional 75 aircraft to be $17 billion in fiscal year 2008 dollars. That figure has in all likelihood increased over the last six years as the cost of parts and technology has risen.\n\nStill, that isn\u2019t stopping lawmakers from at least asking the Air Force to study the idea.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the New, Secret Warplane Everyone Will Soon Be Talking About\n\nSpecifically, wants the report to address \"anticipated future air superiority capacity and capability requirements, based on anticipated near-term and mid-term threat projections\" and \" estimated end-of-service timelines for existing\u201d F-22s.\n\nCongress also wants to know the cost to buy the additional 194 aircraft and to detail opportunities for potential exports. Unlike the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, current law forbids the Raptor from being sold to allies, leaving the U.S. on the hook for all of the F-22\u2019s costs.\n\nThe House Armed Services subpanel will mark up its portion of the fiscal 2017 national defense authorization act on Wednesday and the full committee will take up the measure on April 27.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An influential House panel wants the U.S. Air Force to weigh whether the service should restart its long-dormant F-22 Raptor production line and potentially buy 194 more of the expensive fighter jet.", "title": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu for the F-22?
