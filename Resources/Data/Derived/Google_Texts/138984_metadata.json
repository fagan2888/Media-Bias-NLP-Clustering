The force of the impact split the vehicle apart and left power lines dangling.\n\nAll the occupants of the destroyed car wound up trapped in the wreckage, said Bill Kogerman, a battalion chief with the Oceanside Fire Department. It took emergency crews more than an hour to free them, Kogerman said.\n\nThe driver, a 19-year-old man, died at the scene, as did a male and a female passenger, Bettencourt said. The victims' names were withheld pending family notification.\n\nMedics took the survivors, two women and three men, to Palomar Medical Center in Escondido.\n\nThe eight victims ranged in age from 18 to 22, the CHP reported. All of them had just started classes at Palomar College this week as part of a program that offers education to students from abroad, school spokeswoman Laura Gropen said.\n\nRobert Deegan, superintendent of the college, extended \"heartfelt condolences\" to the victims' families and friends.\n\n\"We are offering counseling services to our students, faculty and staff who may be affected by this tragedy,\" Deegan said.\n\nThe cause of the accident was under investigation, Bettencourt said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All eight people in the car, ranging in age from 18 to 22, had just started classes at Palomar College this week as part of a program that offers education to students from abroad.", "author": "City News Service", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "All eight people in the car, ranging in age from 18 to 22, had just started classes at Palomar College this week as part of a program that offers education to students from abroad.", "title": "CHP Looking For Cause Of Palomar College Students' Triple-Fatal Crash", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/aug/22/3-dead-5-injured-single-vehicle-crash-sr-78-oceans/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2014/08/22/oceanside_crash.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "142366 %##% CHP Looking For Cause Of Palomar College Students' Triple-Fatal Crash", "keywords": "CNS, Public Safety, Region, North County, Oceanside, Transportation", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a94\"", "article_summary": "Authorities sought Friday to determine the cause of a North County freeway crash that killed three young adults and injured five others, all of them Japanese citizens attending Palomar College as part of an international-studies program.\nAll of them had just started classes at Palomar College this week as part of a program that offers education to students from abroad, school spokeswoman Laura Gropen said.\nThe sedan careened down an embankment near College Boulevard and struck a San Diego Gas & Electric power pole, CHP public-affairs Officer Jim Bettencourt said.\n\"We are offering counseling services to our students, faculty and staff who may be affected by this tragedy,\" Deegan said.\nMedics took the survivors, two women and three men, to Palomar Medical Center in Escondido."}
