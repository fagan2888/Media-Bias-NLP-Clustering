A pressurized tank manufacturing company in Garden City is laying off 80 workers because of lower oil prices.

The layoffs at Palmer Manufacturing and Tank, a subsidiary of Ohio-based Worthington Industries, are part of 245 jobs the company is eliminating in three states. The company also is closing a plant in Florence, South Carolina.

Spokeswoman Cathy Lyttle says customer orders have dropped because of low oil prices and fewer new wells starting in the country.

The Garden City plant manufactures steel and fiberglass tanks and processing equipment for the oil and gas industry. It also makes custom manufactured fiberglass tanks for agricultural, chemical and general industrial applications.
