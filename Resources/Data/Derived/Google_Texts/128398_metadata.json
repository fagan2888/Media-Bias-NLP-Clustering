Here are 3 big take aways.\n\nCongressman: Despite what his critics may say, the president leads, even when he's alone.\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2015, in Washington. (Photo: Mandel Ngan/AP)\n\nThe State of the Union is about presenting a vision, something at which President Obama excels.\n\nThis president has governed through crisis after crisis \u2014 successfully, I might add \u2014 despite unrelenting attacks from a Republican Party that has grown dramatically more radical during his six years in office.\n\nRELATED: Obama stresses middle class in speech\n\nMORE: Obama largely avoids immigration\n\nHe has preached cooperation in an era of division.\n\nHe has encouraged investment amid calls for austerity.\n\nAnd he has consistently aimed for big objectives even when forced to go it alone.\n\nThe president remains one of the few leaders in this country who can effectively articulate a vision for America and how we can get there. Despite his opponents' efforts, that vision is what will leave a lasting legacy.\n\nOUR VIEW: Once again, Obama wastes our time\n\nMORE: 5 goals from 2014 State of the Union\n\nThere was a lot in the State of the Union for progressives to cheer. Middle-class tax cuts, free community college, immigration reform, extended sick leave for working families and infrastructure investments are all ambitious and just goals.\n\nThe president can rightfully claim credit for a successful recovery from the Great Recession. The Affordable Care Act is also a success and growing in popularity. Those facts alone are affirmation of his agenda and the tough choices he has made.\n\nBut for progressives watching the president's speech on Tuesday, there was also a longing for what we haven't been able to accomplish in the Obama era. For all the Republican gripes, this is a president who presented a clear progressive vision in two national campaigns and won both, handily.\n\nIt's true that campaigning and governing are wholly different exercises, but I don't believe the president is good at one at the expense of the other. The president has an impressive laundry list of accomplishments that will stand up well to the test of history.\n\nInstead, I think progressives feel there has been so much movement in this country that we wish the federal government's policies could keep up.\n\nDespite a vocal minority, public opinion on marriage equality is on our side and victory is increasingly within reach.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform has bipartisan support by a wide margin, and fewer families are suffering due to unnecessary deportations.\n\nMost Americans are in favor of a woman's right to choose and oppose efforts to limit health-care choices.\n\nThere is populist energy on both sides demanding reform from the financial sector.\n\nAnd, as the president noted in his speech, an increase to the minimum wage was approved by voters in four states in November.\n\nWe still have work to do to make sure everyone enjoys the benefits of this economic recovery. But it's telling that even Mitt Romney is talking about running for president as an anti-poverty advocate.\n\nPresident Obama cited his own 2004 convention speech during this State of the Union as a reminder of how far we've come as a country. The president promised change for America, and he has delivered.\n\nRuben Gallego (Photo: Michael Schennum / The Republic)\n\nAs the president said repeatedly during his State of the Union, we as Americans are turning a page. We're turning a page from the problems and partisan divisions the president inherited. We're also starting to accept the changes brought by the Obama era as the new normal.\n\nThis time next year, the country will be in yet another campaign over competing visions for America. But before moving onto that campaign, the president provided a strong reminder of why Americans chose his vision for our country.\n\nU.S. Rep.
