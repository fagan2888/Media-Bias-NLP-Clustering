Johnson delivers his first address to Congress, Nov. 27, 1963\n\nLyndon B. Johnson, addressed a joint session of Congress as the nation\u2019s 36th president on this day in 1963, even as Americans mourned John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated five days before.\n\nIn his 24-minute speech, Johnson called on Congress for \u201cthe earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights bill and a tax cut as the best way of honoring\u201d the memory of slain president. Johnson, who had served in the House and as Senate majority leader before joining the Democratic ticket in 1960, remained a popular figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAll I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today,\u201d Johnson began. \u201cThe greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time. Today, John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind. He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind. He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo words are sad enough to express our sense of loss,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.\u201d\n\n\u201cI profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship, making us one people in our hour of sorrow,\u201d Johnson concluded.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported that Johnson received \u201ca two-minute ovation\u201d and \u201cwas interrupted 32 times by varying bursts of applause\u201d in the House chamber.\n\nRep. Carlton Sickles (D-Md.) said, \u201cPresident Johnson has given us just the reassurance the nation and the world needed. He is going to be a great president. But he can\u2019t do it alone. It is now our turn in Congress to rise to the occasion and pass the legislation essential to our economy and to our well-being.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF HISTORY AND PRESERVATION, CLERK OF THE U.S. HOUSE\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "On this day in 1963, Lyndon B.
