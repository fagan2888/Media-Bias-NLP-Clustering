Fortunately, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is paving the way to change those outcomes.\n\nSince the first open enrollment period, over 1.7 million African Americans have enrolled in the ACA, lowering the uninsured rate by 6.8 percent. The ACA has increased access to preventive health care services at no cost \u2013 including annual wellness exams and contraception \u2013 and eliminated discrimination against those with a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d like being HIV-positive, having breast cancer or being a victim of domestic violence.\n\nThe history of the reproductive rights movement is as complicated as the nation\u2019s. There\u2019s a saying -- \u201cIt takes a village\u201d -- that recognizes the importance of collective effort in order to advance the community. Throughout our history, Planned Parenthood and the African-American community have worked together to break down barriers to health care access posed by poverty, racism and politics.\n\nWe take this opportunity during Black History Month to not only educate people on the advancements in our nation\u2019s health care system, but to also remind ourselves that this work is only successful if we continue to develop partnerships with the communities we serve.\n\nThis united work will not only improve health care outcomes for all, but create fair opportunities to succeed in all areas of life.\n\nKafi Rouse is the director of public relations and marketing for Planned Parenthood of Southern New England.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Washington, Affordable Care Act, Black History Month, Planned Parenthood of Southern New England", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/02/op-ed-access-to-health-care-education-services-still-unequal/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Far too many people in the black community face unequal access to proper health care and education services.", "title": "Op-Ed: Access to health care, education services, still unequal", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/02/op-ed-access-to-health-care-education-services-still-unequal/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/01/logo-thumb.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/02/op-ed-access-to-health-care-education-services-still-unequal/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcded5\"", "article_summary": "Far too many people in the black community face unequal access to proper health care and education servicesAs we celebrate Black History Month, we recognize that far too many African Americans continue to face unequal access to proper health care and education services.\nThis united work will not only improve health care outcomes for all, but create fair opportunities to succeed in all areas of life.\nThroughout our history, Planned Parenthood and the African-American community have worked together to break down barriers to health care access posed by poverty, racism and politics.\nAs long as there are barriers to economic and educational opportunities, as well as social and political equity, obstacles will also remain in the way of full health care.\nFortunately, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is paving the way to change those outcomes."}
