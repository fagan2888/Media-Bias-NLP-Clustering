BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- It's a new day for health insurance companies. As the Affordable Care Act forces an industry shift towards consumerism, individuals are becoming more involved in their own health care decisions and insurers are becoming more involved in their members' lives.

So how does a health insurance company transform from payer to a partner in health care? How can a health plan bring its brand alive, to interact and engage with those who entrust them with not only their health-care dollar but their quality of life?

That is what BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York is doing with the Blue Box – a first of its kind, loyalty package featuring a unique Two For One discount program that saves members money and guides them toward healthy food and activities.

The boxes are being mailed to more than 220,000 households in Western New York and include 100 local offers at cultural outlets and restaurants through two card decks (one lifestyle, one dining).

"This program allows us to bring our brand to life," noted Gretchen Fierle, senior vice president, marketing and communications, BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York. "In the virtual era we live in, we wanted to create something tangible that our members and their families could enjoy. With 22 million cards pushed out in the community, there are 22 million opportunities for our members to eat better, live better, get out and enjoy the community we live in."

BlueCross BlueShield partnered with local businesses to create attractive deals that encourage a healthier lifestyle and stronger ties to the community, all while supporting the local economy. BlueCross BlueShield members simply present a discount card to enjoy everything from a free ski lesson or admission to a world-class art gallery to a healthy meal or low-fat latte.

The boxes are the result of a collaboration between, BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York, the region's longest-standing health plan and two local marketing firms - Eric Mower + Associates, the health plan's brand agency of record, and City Dining Cards, a customer loyalty marketing company led by a 27-year-old CEO.

"Traditionally, no health insurer in the country would entrust their marketing strategy to a 27 year old," added Fierle. "But this required very non-traditional thinking. This program will allow us to bring additional value to our members and become an active part of their day-to-day lives."

The engagement component doesn't end once the member receives the box in the mail. Members are encouraged to share their experiences with the cards by using #Blue2for1 on social media.

Reflecting the idea of engagement, BlueCross BlueShield President and CEO Dave Anderson, joined by a team of Blue associates, ventured out in the community Jan. 30 to hand deliver the first Blue Boxes to members new and old.

The deliveries ranged from a small-business owner who enrolled in an individual plan through the New York State of Health Marketplace to the health plan's longest member employer group, Mentholatum Company, which joined in 1936.

The boxes will be arriving at members' doorsteps within the coming month. For more information on the Two For One program please visit www.twoforonewny.com.
