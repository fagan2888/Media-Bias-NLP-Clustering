According to Courthouse News, \u201cAn estimated 104,900 people, or more than a quarter of the population, [live] below the poverty line\u201d in New Orleans. Half of all adult black men in the city are unemployed and receive no unemployment compensation.\n\nIn one case, officers in tactical gear allegedly stormed a family\u2019s home to collect court debt:\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn another case, plaintiff Reynaud Variste claims his family\u2019s home was stormed by officers armed with assault rifles and military gear because he failed to pay $1,600 court fees. Variste says he was asleep at the time of the raid and was awakened by the commotion. However, he says, he was told not to worry too much about the raid because it was just over unpaid fees.\n\nCollections Department officials at the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court have \u201cadmitted under oath that they have been issuing arrest warrants for unpaid debts by signing themselves the signatures of judges without first presenting any information to the judge or even notifying the judge.\u201d If an individual is arrested and imprisoned for failing to pay their court debts, they are automatically assessed for a pre-trial bond of $20,000.\n\nResearch shows that families most often shoulder the financial costs of criminal justice debts, and the situation is no different in New Orleans, where relatives are forced to \u201cborrow money at high interest rates, divert money from food for their children, and cash their family members\u2019 disability checks in a desperate attempt to pay the Collections Department to avoid infinite confinement.\u201d\n\nThe combination of mounting debt and an inability to work due to incarceration \u201cdevastates families who have to make hard choices about debt payments or food, inhibits mental health care, and makes it harder for people to obtain housing and employment.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges every person in the courtroom has a financial stake in collecting the bond and other fees levied against an individual, from the jailer to the court-appointed defense attorney to the prosecutor and the judge, because each takes a percentage of the money to fund their own budgets. For this reason, the lawsuit argues, officials advocate for high bonds and fees \u201cwithout meaningful inquiry into a person\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d\n\nThe judges, in particular, are said to be making over $1 million from bond fees alone. The lawsuit states that the money goes into a \u201cjudicial expense fund\u201d that helps pay the court\u2019s operating budget, even though such funds have been declared unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe judges of the court manage the fund and court operations in an administrative capacity but refused for many years to disclose the financial details of the account or to permit public auditing,\u201d the lawsuit states. Plaintiffs also stated judges used some of these funds to pay for private insurance benefits for themselves and their spouses that are not provided by the state.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nIn New Hampshire, poor residents who come before the court for unpaid fines are jailed without being informed of their rights or provided an attorney, according to a new report [PDF] by the state\u2019s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Approximately 111,500 people in New Hampshire live in poverty, and the state has the fastest growing rate of inequality in the nation.\n\nThe ACLU-NH joined the University of New Hampshire School of Law to conduct a year long study revealing that, despite established state and federal law outlawing the practice of jailing people over debts, the practice is ongoing in the state, and \u201cis not limited to a rogue judge or court, but is occurring throughout the state.\u201d\n\nAs has been reported in other states where the use of debtors prisons has been alleged, judges in New Hampshire do not assess the individual\u2019s ability to pay court fines and fees. In 2013, researchers found that in 148 cases (51.2% of those studied), judges jailed people who were unable to pay fines without first providing a \u201cmeaningful ability-to-pay hearing.\u201d In 18% of cases, judges gave individuals the \u201cchoice\u201d of jail or payment. In each case, people went to jail without representation of counsel.\n\nIn one example from 2014 cited in the study, \u201ca judge went so far as to reject a defendant\u2019s request for appointment of counsel even when a lawyer was available to represent her.\u201d\n\nIn another, the court moved to imprison an individual who was without an attorney and unable to pay a $100 fine plus penalty assessment, in less than ninety seconds:\n\nResearchers found that \u201cfor those struggling to get by, [a] fine can upend one\u2019s life and begin a long, drawn-out, and unavoidable process with the courts culminating in illegal incarceration.\u201d\n\nJailing people for their debts \u201cattacks the social and economic fabric of their lives and the lives of their families,\u201d researchers wrote, in part because it can \u201ccounterproductively lead to termination of an individual\u2019s new employment, impede ongoing efforts of that individual to gain employment, and prevent struggling parents from caring for their infant children.\u201d\n\nJailing people who can\u2019t pay fines \u201cneedlessly places an extra financial burden on counties by requiring them to house poor individuals who are no danger to society,\u201d they wrote, citing a different study that found New Hampshire jails spend about $110 per day to hold one inmate.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s recommendations are common sense and amount to telling the courts to follow the law. The organization suggests judges, whenever possible, not fine individuals they know cannot pay. It also recommends following state and federal law by appointing legal counsel to those who cannot afford it on their own. Finally, the ACLU urges the Circuit Court to codify the recommendations into their administrative rules to force an end to this system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plaintiffs stated judges used some of these funds to pay for private insurance benefits for themselves and their spouses that are not provided by the state., ACLU, debtors\u2019 prisons, Louisiana, New Hampshire,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Brian Sonenstein | Shadowproof", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Plaintiffs stated judges used some of these funds to pay for private insurance benefits for themselves and their spouses that are not provided by the state., ACLU, debtors\u2019 prisons, Louisiana, New Hampshire,", "title": "More Reports Of Debtors Prisons Surface In Louisiana And New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/more-reports-of-debtors-prisons-surface-in-louisiana-and-new-hampshire/209864/", "image": "http://shadowproof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-24-at-3.30.27-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-09-28T07:27:17-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Plaintiffs stated judges used some of these funds to pay for private insurance benefits for themselves and their spouses that are not provided by the state., ACLU, debtors\u2019 prisons, Louisiana, New Hampshire,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/17923102596_ceb00bb025_k-750x563.jpg", "title": "More Reports Of Debtors Prisons Surface In Louisiana And New Hampshire", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "National", "tag": "New Hampshire", "published_time": "2015-09-26T05:00:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T07:27:17-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfeb\"", "article_summary": "More Reports Of Debtors Prisons Surface In Louisiana And New HampshirePlaintiffs stated judges used some of these funds to pay for private insurance benefits for themselves and their spouses that are not provided by the state.\nApproximately 111,500 people in New Hampshire live in poverty, and the state has the fastest growing rate of inequality in the nation.\nIt also recommends following state and federal law by appointing legal counsel to those who cannot afford it on their own.\nFinally, the ACLU urges the Circuit Court to codify the recommendations into their administrative rules to force an end to this system.\nThe organization suggests judges, whenever possible, not fine individuals they know cannot pay."}
