In fact, Chonalyn was just one of 100 babies who received a symbolic designation of \"100,000,000th baby\" in various state hospitals on Sunday, and this imprecise extravagance is suggestive of the nation\u2019s joy and dilemma. Despite ongoing economic concerns in this Southeast Asia nation, health and population commission officials showered Chonalyn with cake, infant clothes, and other gifts.\n\n\"We are faced with the challenge of providing for all 100 million Filipinos,\" Juan Antonio Perez III, executive director of the Commission on Population, the Philippines Department of Health, told The Associated Press. Currently, about 25 percent of Filipinos are living in poverty. A growing population means a larger workforce, Perez explained to AFP, but it also means more dependents. To address this, the Philippine government is seeking to lower the average number of children each fertile woman bears in her lifetime. From the current average of three children per woman, \u201cwe\u2019d like to push the fertility rate down to two children per (woman\u2019s) lifetime,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe Philippines has one of Asia's fastest-growing populations and is already the world's 12th most populous country. To stem the tide, President Benigno Aquino III signed a 2012 law allowing government-run health centers to provide free contraceptives to everyone and particularly the poor. Due to opposition from the Roman Catholic church, enactment was delayed yet in April, the nation's Supreme Court declared the law to be constitutional, thereby granting the government the necessary right to enforce it.\n\nIn light of recent events, many see this milestone of 100 million citizens as a challenge yet also an opportunity for the Philippines. \u201cGovernments that are serious about eradicating poverty should also be serious about providing the services, supplies, information that women, men and young people need to exercise their reproductive rights,\u201d Klaus Beck, the United Nations Population Fund\u2019s Philippines representative, told AFP.\n\nIn 2050, global population may run as high as 11.1 billion, the United Nations estimates, or as low as 8.3 billion. Whether it turns out to be the high number or the low number depends on how individual governments respond to the challenge of stabilizing populations. Too many people will stretch natural resources to their limits, according to Population Connection \u2014 formerly Zero Population Growth, the American grassroots organization \u2014 and the current growth rate of over 80 million people a year added to the globe's total population intensifies food and water shortages, deforestation, and climate change. \u201cElevating the status of women worldwide is vital to lowering fertility rates and ultimately, stabilizing global population,\u201d the organization states on its website.\n\nWorld Population Map Courtesy of Population Connection", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "philippines, birth, 100 million citizens, populations, united nations", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Philippines welcomed its 100 millionth citizen on Sunday, a baby girl born shortly after midnight in a hospital in Manila.", "title": "Philippines Greets Its 100-Millionth Citizen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/philippines-greets-its-100-millionth-citizen-while-hoping-lower-fertility-rates-295556", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/reuters.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Philippines welcomed its 100 millionth citizen on Sunday, a baby girl born shortly after midnight in a hospital in Manila.", "title": "Philippines Greets Its 100-Millionth Citizen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/philippines-greets-its-100-millionth-citizen-while-hoping-lower-fertility-rates-295556", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/reuters.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/reuters.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-29T17:11:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T17:11:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Philippines welcomed its 100 millionth citizen on Sunday, a baby girl born shortly after midnight in a hospital in Manila."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f71\"", "article_summary": "In light of recent events, many see this milestone of 100 million citizens as a challenge yet also an opportunity for the Philippines.\nThe Philippines welcomed its 100 millionth citizen on Sunday, a baby girl named Chonalyn, born shortly after midnight in a hospital in Manila.\nTo address this, the Philippine government is seeking to lower the average number of children each fertile woman bears in her lifetime.\n\"We are faced with the challenge of providing for all 100 million Filipinos,\" Juan Antonio Perez III, executive director of the Commission on Population, the Philippines Department of Health, told The Associated Press.\n\u201cElevating the status of women worldwide is vital to lowering fertility rates and ultimately, stabilizing global population,\u201d the organization states on its website."}
