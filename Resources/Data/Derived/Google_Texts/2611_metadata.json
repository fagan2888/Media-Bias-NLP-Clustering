You go to refill one of your regular prescriptions at the pharmacy and the copay has gone up \u2014 a lot.\n\nThat\u2019s a nasty little surprise that\u2019s happened to 1 in 3 Americans in the last 12 months, according to a new Consumer Reports survey of more than 1,000 adults taking prescription meds. Those hit with sticker shock said they paid an average $39 above the usual cost for their prescription, with 1 in 10 paying $100 or more out of pocket.\n\nDrug prices have been rising \u2014 sometimes dramatically \u2014 in the past few years. A recent AARP report found the cost for 280 generic prescription medications most commonly used by those 50-plus fell by the smallest percentage since 2006, with 1 in 4 rising in price.\n\nAs Consumer Reports noted, these drug price increases often occur with no warning. Shortages or cutbacks in supply can trigger sudden price changes, which can then cause the insurance company to reduce coverage of the drug.\n\nIn the survey, most people (81 percent) simply paid the higher price, although some tried to negotiate a better deal: One in 4 said they called their insurance company to see if it would cover a greater percentage of the cost, or asked their doctor or pharmacist to switch their prescription to a lower-cost medication. Only 17 percent said they tried calling around at other pharmacies for a cheaper price.\n\nMany said the price increase caused them to skip medical care or put off paying other bills to save money. A third of adults age 55 and older reported they cut back on groceries.\n\nPart of the problem is that most people don\u2019t realize their drug price has gone up until they get to the pharmacy. To avoid that unpleasant surprise, consumers \u201cneed to have a conversation about cost with their doctor before going to pharmacy,\u201d said Lisa Gill, prescription drugs editor at Consumer Reports.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether your insurance will cover it, \u201cthe doctor can look it up,\u201d she said. Yes, \u201cit\u2019s a pain and doctors don\u2019t really want to,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut consumers have to advocate for themselves and doctors have to think about these things.\u201d After all, whether patients can afford their medications is an important consideration in helping them do what\u2019s best for their health, she said.\n\nHere are some other ways to find the lowest drug prices:\n\n\u2022 Ask your doctor to review your medications. Some may be no longer needed, which could save you money. You also might be able to switch some to a generic or other less expensive alternative.\n\n\u2022 Shop around. Call other drugstores, both chains and independents, in your area. It\u2019s amazing how much prices can vary. For example, Consumer Reports found prices for generic diabetes drug pioglitazone (Actos) ranged from $328 for a month\u2019s supply to $20 in the Des Moines, Iowa, area. If you live in an urban area, check pharmacy prices in suburban or rural areas, where they sometimes can be lower.\n\n\u2022 Ask for the lowest price. Don\u2019t assume the first price quoted is the lowest. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re paying out of pocket. A Target pharmacy in Des Moines first quoted Consumer Reports secret shoppers $191 for a drug, then came down to $160. However, an independent pharmacy seven miles away said its price for the same drug was just $7.50.\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\n\u2022 Make sure your prescribed drug is covered by your insurance. If it\u2019s not, ask your doctor to prescribe a different drug that is on your plan\u2019s list of covered drugs. If that\u2019s not possible or your doctor says it\u2019s not a good idea, ask him or her to petition your insurance company to cover the drug. If your health plan denies your request, you can file an appeal.\n\n\u2022 Consider other medications if the price is too high. Ask the pharmacist or your doctor if there is a more affordable drug in the same class of medications or if there\u2019s an acceptable alternative. Ask for a generic version if you\u2019ve been taking a brand-name drug.\n\n\u2022 Use your insurance company\u2019s mail-order service. For certain medications, using mail order may help you save money.\n\n\u2022 Try getting your prescription from Costco. The warehouse club fills prescriptions for nonmembers, and Consumer Reports has found it usually has the lowest retail prices on medications.\n\nPhoto: ziquiu/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Has this happened to you lately?
