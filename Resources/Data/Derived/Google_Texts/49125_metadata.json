The Affordable Care Act was supposed to relieve some of that strain by helping pay for coverage for millions of Americans and expanding Medicaid in some states to cover the poor.\n\nYet while millions of people have gained coverage since Obamacare became law in 2010, there\u2019s also been an increase in insurance that comes with high deductibles and cost-sharing. Under those plans, the first few thousand dollars of annual medical expenses come out of patients\u2019 wallets. That\u2019s money that hospitals like Childress Regional Medical Center in the Texas Panhandle region are unlikely to collect.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a sucker punch,\u201d said John Henderson, the nonprofit hospital\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen someone has a really high deductible, effectively they\u2019re still uninsured, and most people in Childress don\u2019t have $5,000 lying around to pay their bills.\u201d\n\nThe rate of uninsurance in the U.S. has fallen to 9.1 percent from 15.7 percent in 2009. Yet in the first nine months of 2015, about 36 percent of the U.S. insured were covered by high-deductible or consumer-directed health plans that can require considerable out-of-pocket payments, compared with about 25 percent in 2010, according to a CDC survey.\n\nFor-Profit Hospitals\n\nHospitals are feeling the pressure from those patients. Community Health Systems Inc. operates 195 hospitals in 29 states and is the U.S.\u2019s second-biggest for-profit U.S. hospital chain. This month, it revised its fourth-quarter 2015 provision for bad debt up by $169 million -- and said that 40 percent, or about $68 million of that amount, was from patients being unable to pay deductibles and co-payments. Patient bankruptcies also contributed, the company said. A Community Health spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised it\u2019s not bigger,\u201d Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with Mizuho Securities USA who rates the stock underperform, said of Community\u2019s bad-debt figure. \u201cThey need to fill the beds and collect the cash.\u201d\n\nHCA Holdings Inc., the biggest U.S. hospital company, also reported increasing rates of bad debt in the second and third quarters of 2015, although the chain attributed the trend to dropped insurance coverage, rather than unpaid bills from insured patients. Another major chain, Tenet Healthcare Corp., reported fourth-quarter results Monday. Stocks of all three companies have struggled in the last year.\n\nWhile higher out-of-pocket charges can lower what insurance costs up front, it means more costs for patients on the back end. Under individual Obamacare mid-level \u201csilver\u201d plans, the annual deductible was $2,556, and under less expensive, low- level \u201cbronze\u201d plans it was $5,328 in 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nOutside of Obamacare, deductibles are becoming more common, as well. Last year, 81 percent of coverage people got through work came with a deductible, up from 70 percent in 2010, according to Kaiser. The average deductible in a high- deductible, individual plan gained through work was $2,099 last year.\n\nFinancial Threshold\n\nPatients are unlikely to pay medical bills that are greater than 5 percent of household income, according to the Advisory Board, a consulting firm to hospitals. Median household income in the U.S. is at about $53,000, suggesting that when out-of- pocket charges exceed $2,600 hospitals can forget about collecting, said Spencer Perlman, an analyst with Height Securities in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major issue,\u201d said Chip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, an industry group of for- profit chains. Patients expect to get care when they show up at the emergency room -- and they do -- yet consumers still need education in how to control their medical costs, Kahn said. Member companies have discussed solutions, including pushing for insurers to collect the payments, he said.\n\nFocusing on deductibles alone gives a misleading picture of patients\u2019 total out-of-pocket costs, and the share of health spending that consumers paid out-of-pocket reached its lowest level on record in 2014 at 10.9 percent, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department said in an e-mail. The agency is working on the issue and trying to educate consumers about how much to expect to pay for plans that provide needed services, the agency said.\n\nAcquisition Risk\n\nCommunity Health\u2019s unpaid bills from patients may add to burdens the company has taken on to do deals, especially following its acquisition of Health Management Associates Inc. for about $3.9 billion in 2014, Mizuho\u2019s Skolnick said.\n\nCommunity\u2019s net-debt-to-Ebitda ratio, a measure of how much the company owes from corporate borrowings compared to its cash flow, was 6.7 in the fourth quarter, more than three times the ratio on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, or 2.1. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nRural hospitals have been hit particularly hard. Minnesota has long had high rates of care coverage, and many employers have switched to high deductible offerings, according to Joe Schindler, vice president of finance for the Minnesota Hospital Association. Last year, bad debt rose by 20 percent to $425 million at the association\u2019s 140 member hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe have 39 hospitals that have negative margins and the majority of them are rural,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey have less of a financial cushion to absorb the losses of bad debt.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hospitals, bad, debt, obamacare", "pubdate": "2016-02-23T14:15:45", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A type of pain that hospitals thought they had relieved has come back with a vengeance: it's called bad debt.Hospitals have long struggled to collect bills when patients aren't covered by insurance -- creating delinquent accounts.
