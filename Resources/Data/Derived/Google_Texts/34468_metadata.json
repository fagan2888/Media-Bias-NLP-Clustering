Howard in his latest book, The Rule of Nobody. Dead people \u201callocate most of the annual budgets and micromanage public choices. It\u2019s not surprising that Washington works so badly. Imagine if you had to run a business by following every idea that any former manager ever had.\u201d\n\nThe founder of Common Good, a reform activist group, Howard has made a career of trying to fix broken government, but he\u2019s not just a voice in the wilderness. He has the ear of at least one person who may be poised to make changes in the future. Jeb Bush, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, cited Howard\u2019s book, The Rule of Nobody, in a commencement address this year at Grove City College in Pennsylvania:\n\n\u201cHe [Howard] compellingly talks about the confusing and complicated nature now of rulemaking at every level of government,\u201d said Bush. \u201cHe argues that government itself is making America more inept. I agree. It seems to me that it\u2019s time now for us to be bolder, to sunset the obsolete rules that exist so that the next generation can truly rise up.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tipping Point \u2013 America\u2019s Government Is Now Broken\n\nBut does being bold really work? What changes are truly possible in today\u2019s environment? The Fiscal Times spoke to Howard:\n\nMaureen Mackey (MM): Why do you say government is making America inept?\n\nPhilip Howard (PH): Law is supposed to be the foundation of freedom. In a crowded, anonymous world, I believe we need more government oversight to make people feel free and to enhance society. We put our loved ones in the care of people we don't know at nursing homes and day care centers and other places every day \u2013 even the air we breathe is at risk. The market can\u2019t solve everything by itself.\n\nBut the way we\u2019ve created government suffocates freedom. It doesn\u2019t let people adapt to meet legitimate public goals while also advancing their goals. Our legal system has become a version of central planning, telling people exactly what to do, when to do it, how to do it. Life has changed, but we use the same rigid requirements year after year, decade after decade. It\u2019s why the U.S. ranks 20th in the world for starting a business.\n\nMM: One of your solutions is to create a new coordinating agency to help citizens get permits to start a business. Is this not just one more layer?\n\nPH: A citizen should not have to go to a dozen different agencies to start a business. Other countries have what they call one-stop shops. It\u2019s basically the gold standard now in government regulation. The one-stop shop doesn\u2019t add regulatory burdens. It\u2019s designed to free us from having to go to the other dozen agencies. Its job is coordinating with a dozen others. In Germany, for example, if you get permission from the coordinating agency for an infrastructure project \u2013 you have permission.\n\nRelated: Congress Uses Accounting Gimmicks to Fund Highway Bill\n\nMM: You say all of our government agencies and systems are broken. Isn\u2019t this a terrible statement about America?\n\nPH: No, it\u2019s a terrible statement about a system of government that never adapts. There is not one program that isn\u2019t broken. The question is whether it\u2019s broken by 25 percent or 95 percent. Our system has a micro-management approach to regulating, where we try to tell people how to have a nice nursing home with a thousand rules, instead of doing what Australia did, which was create 31 general principles. You know, have a home-like setting. It\u2019s much more effective. Then people can think for themselves. They don't go around with their noses in the rulebooks all day long.\n\nMM: What does House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s suit against President Obama say to you \u2013 how does it fit in here?\n\nPH: The polarization in Washington is not because of the paralysis \u2013 it\u2019s a symptom of the paralysis. Nobody thinks they can get anything done in Washington. Sure, every once in a while they pass a new law \u2013 usually in a crisis \u2013 or once in a while, they\u2019re able to do something like Obamacare. But they almost never get rid of an old law because of special interest groups. So there\u2019s cynicism. You\u2019ve given up on trying to change things, so you make the other side look bad no matter what. You point fingers. It\u2019s true of both sides.\n\nThere\u2019s also a tendency to take very rigid positions and turn them into philosophy. A classic example would be of Grover Norquist, who says we should never raise taxes. I understand the argument about not raising taxes. But why don't we make government efficient first, and then if we really need to raise taxes, raise taxes? Not raising the highway trust fund gas tax after all these years \u2013 that\u2019s absurd. That\u2019s how we paid for our roads. I\u2019d rather have smooth roads and bridges that don't fall down.\n\nRelated: 10 States with the Worst Highway Spending Woes\n\n\n\nMM: Who\u2019s at fault?\n\nPH: The villain today is this big bureaucratic blob that everybody\u2019s feeding from. Who in Washington is responsible for any of this? Who\u2019s responsible for the budget deficit? Who\u2019s responsible for our crumbling infrastructure? Nobody. In Washington, you make a certain amount of money; you have a very privileged life; and you pretend to be important. You have no responsibility.\n\nWe should demand that every member of Congress resign. Get new people in there. The culture has evolved to the point where many good people can't do anything because the system is too partisan and the rules too rigid. The Speaker can stop anything from going to the floor, such as immigration reform, for example. It\u2019s structurally and culturally paralyzed \u2013 whereas the president can make some decisions. The problem is that the executive branch takes too much authority when it comes to lawmaking, but doesn\u2019t have enough authority when it comes to implementation.\n\nMM: You\u2019re not a fan of Obamacare. You say it\u2019s a lousy program. How would you fix it?\n\nPH: When you\u2019ve got a 2700-page statute and seven feet and counting of regulations, there\u2019s no way you can implement it effectively. Anything that detailed might as well be designed for failure. I would scrap it and create a voucher system for people who need it \u2013 not for everybody. For people with preexisting conditions, I\u2019d have a separate bureaucracy and have the government implement it. But I wouldn\u2019t have this huge, one-size-fits-all bureaucratic structure. I would decide the income cutoff and have a voucher system that\u2019s redeemable and accountable. That would get rid of the fee-for-service arrangement. Obamacare fails in efficiency, coherence and adaptability. It doesn\u2019t necessarily fail in providing health care to people who didn\u2019t have it. But it\u2019s a horrible law, not in purpose but in implementation \u2013 like most government programs.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "American democracy in 2014 is \u201cbasically run by dead people \u2013 by past generations of l", "title": "The Bureaucratic Blob That Is Ruining America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/14/Bureaucratic-Blob-Ruining-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/14/Bureaucratic-Blob-Ruining-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "American democracy in 2014 is \u201cbasically run by dead people \u2013 by past generations of l", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe89\"", "article_summary": "The Fiscal Times spoke to Howard:Maureen Mackey (MM): Why do you say government is making America inept?\nPH: The villain today is this big bureaucratic blob that everybody\u2019s feeding from.\nBut why don't we make government efficient first, and then if we really need to raise taxes, raise taxes?\nPhilip Howard (PH): Law is supposed to be the foundation of freedom.\nRelated: Congress Uses Accounting Gimmicks to Fund Highway BillMM: You say all of our government agencies and systems are broken."}
