In the video, as on the album cover, Windy wears a feather headdress. The song's lyrics are mainly about smoking marijuana (unsurprising, given the album's title), which he conflates with the idea of the Native American \"peace pipe.\" The idea of a \"peace pipe\" itself is a vast oversimplification that dates to early contact with Europeans -- American Indians from all over Turtle Island smoked pipes on various ceremonial occasions.\n\nRELATED: 13 Rock Stars Who've Worn Native Headdresses (and Probably Shouldn't Have)\n\nBut that is likely beside the point -- although there are some shots of what looks like a pipe in the video, Windy is more likely referring to a vape pen -- akin to an e-cigarette but used to inhale vapor infused with concentrated marijuana oil. Windy actively promotes a line of flavorings called \"Mr. Good Vape\"; the company's logo can be seen at the start of the video, and bottles of flavorings such as \"Melon Head\" are on display in some shots.\n\nThe video also contains footage of powwow dancers, as well as shots of Monument Valley, on the Navajo Nation. Here it is:\n\nVideo of Emerson Windy - Peace Pipe [Pearl Harbor Ent. Submitted]\n\nThe track's chorus goes \"Pass that mothafuckin' Peace Pipe, CHIEF / Blow a bag with me,\" and in one section Windy riffs on \"Arapahoe\":\n\nThey call me CHIEF up in this bitch, ho\n\nWindy know a rap-a-ho (heya heya)\n\nWindy Boy a rap-a-ho (mic checka)\n\nI'm a certified trap-a-ho\n\nGotta sell my dope, bitch I gotta go\n\nAnother manifestation of Windy's Native fetish is the name he uses for his followers and fans: \"Windyians.\"\n\nThe American Indian Movement of Indiana and Kentucky has launched an online petition (which at the time of this posting has 631 of its target 1000 signatures) demanding that Windy remove the video from YouTube and apologize. Their statement reads, in part:\n\nThis song and video are disrespectful and demeaning towards Indigenous people of this land. We are also calling on Mr. Emerson Windy to MAN UP and remove the offensive video and send out a letter apologizing for his blatant disrespect and his insensitivity of the struggles of Native people of this land.\n\nLINK: \"Petitioning Emerson Windy: Remove your video \"Peace Pipe\" and apologize !!!!\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rapper Emerson Windy's \"Peace Pipe\" song and video have drawn demands for an apology from the American Indian Movement.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/15/dopey-rapper-emerson-windys-native-american-shtick-sparks-outrage-154893", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/emerson-windy-herojuana-peace-pipe.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Dopey: Rapper Emerson Windy's Native American Shtick Sparks Outrage"}, "abstract": "Rapper Emerson Windy's \"Peace Pipe\" song and video have drawn demands for an apology from the American Indian Movement.", "dc": {"title": "Dopey: Rapper Emerson Windy's Native American Shtick Sparks Outrage"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/15/dopey-rapper-emerson-windys-native-american-shtick-sparks-outrage-154893", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Emerson Windy, Cultural Appropriation, Hipster Headdress, Marijuana, Offensive, Offensive Video, Offensive song", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 9}, "dcterms.date": "2014-05-15T16:35-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Dopey: Rapper Emerson Windy's Native American Shtick Sparks Outrage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf755\"", "article_summary": "The song's lyrics are mainly about smoking marijuana (unsurprising, given the album's title), which he conflates with the idea of the Native American \"peace pipe.\"\nLINK: \"Petitioning Emerson Windy: Remove your video \"Peace Pipe\" and apologize !!!!\"\nHere it is:Video of Emerson Windy - Peace Pipe [Pearl Harbor Ent.\nHip hop artist and \"vaping\" advocate Emerson Windy has gone all in with a faux-American Indian look and attitude, and Natives are asking him to cease and apologize.\nWindy's latest video is for a track called \"Peace Pipe\" off his album Herojuana."}
