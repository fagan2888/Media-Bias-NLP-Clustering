Burwell, the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs argue that four words in the health care law prevent Americans who have purchased health care on federal \"exchanges,\" or online marketplaces, from receiving subsidies to alleviate the cost. Thirty-seven states rely on healthcare.gov, meaning an estimated 8 million people could lose their health coverage if the judges side with the plaintiffs.\n\nDavid Catron at the American Spectator believes that government overreach, specifically by President Barack Obama, is at the heart of King v. Burwell. \u201cObama obviously believes the law is what he says it is, a delusion evidently shared by his party and the press,\u201d he wrote. The challenge \u201chas nothing [to] do with any \u2018plot to kill health care,\u2019 as the New York Times recently put it,\u201d nor an attack on Obamacare, he wrote. \u201cIt is rather an attempt to prevent the President from doing further violence to the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\n\u201cThis blatant disregard for the law has put millions on the hook,\u201d argued Republican Reps. John Kline of Minnesota, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Fred Upton of Michigan, \u201cbecause if you received a subsidy and lose it because of the administration\u2019s illegal actions, you\u2019ll face big insurance bills you can\u2019t afford.\u201d Writing in the Wall Street Journal, the lawmakers expressed support for the plaintiffs and proposed an Obamacare \"off-ramp,\u201d which they said will return choice and affordability to consumers and lift \u201cburdensome\u201d mandates. \u201cUnder ObamaCare, government controls your choices,\u201d they wrote. \u201cUnder our proposal, you will.\u201d\n\nJackie Bodnar accused the IRS of \u201cenforcing a version of Obamacare that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d by extending tax credits to Americans using the federal exchange. \u201cI guess in the Obama White House, if you like your health care law, you can keep it,\u201d wrote Bodnar for U.S. News & World Report. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, just have the IRS enforce something different and hope nobody will notice.\u201d Keeping the law intact, she wrote, would send the message that \u201cit\u2019s okay to illegally legislate from the executive branch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe strongest part of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that four-word phrase,\u201d acknowledged David Leonhardt at The New York Times. \u201cThe weakest part of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is everything else about the law.\u201d Leonhardt agreed that, read alone, the phrasing at issue supports the plaintiffs' view \u2013 only state-established exchanges can provide subsidies \u2013 but the rest of the law discounts that entirely. The reversal of such a large social safety net program, for which there is no true precedent, could further polarize the Supreme Court in an already partisan nation, he warned.\n\n\n\n[VOTE: Should the Supreme Court Strike Down Obamacare Subsidies in King v.
