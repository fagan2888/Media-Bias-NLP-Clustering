BIRMINGHAM, Alabama â€“ A majority of employers believe the Affordable Care Act has had a negative effect on their businesses, and most think the biggest negative impact is yet to come, a new survey found.

The fifth in a series of surveys conducted by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that nearly 90 percent of employers expect their health care costs to rise this year. Many reported plans to pass those increases along in the form of higher premiums and higher deductibles

The survey found that most large companies have not laid off employees because of the ACA, but many smaller companies have had ACA-related layoffs, even though they're exempt from the law.

"We are seeing firsthand how the Affordable Care Act has had major implications on employers and their employees," Michael Wilson, CEO of the International Foundation, said in a prepared statement. "Employers are taking a variety of actions to mitigate costs and in most cases are sharing the cost impact with their work force."

Among the survey's findings:

Nearly one-third of employers have increased employees' out-of-pocket limits.

More than 20 percent have increased co-payments.

More than 40 percent of employers expect to see the greatest cost increases due to ACA in 2015.

Nearly one in six businesses with 50 or fewer employees has reduced their work force.

More than 10 percent of small businesses have reduced hours, frozen pay or limited hiring.

The foundation also reported that most companies that offer health benefits but are not required to do so intend to continue offering their employees insurance.

The survey was conducted on April 17, among 691 human resources and benefits professionals, and industry experts.
