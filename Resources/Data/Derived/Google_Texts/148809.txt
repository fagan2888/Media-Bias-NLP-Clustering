A Virginia homeowner has outraged his community after flying a Nazi flag outside of his home in protest of President Obama’s executive action on immigration reform.

Dr. William Wheeler, who lives in the Ghent District of Norfolk, said he meant to offend his neighbors the same way he is offended by bumper stickers supporting the president, Raw Story reported.

“I am not a Nazi. I am half-Jewish,” he told a local ABC affiliate. “I hung the flag after watching President Obama (Thursday) night. Obama usurped his oath of office. I wanted people to be shocked, because I am offended.”

Mr. Wheeler would not agree to speak to the station on-camera. He reportedly removed the flag from the front of his home after repeated complaints.

Beth Brooker, Mr. Wheeler’s neighbor, said he and another woman hurled insults at her when she confronted them over the flag on Friday.

“It’s amazing how somebody can have so much hate in them and feel it’s OK to express themselves,” she told the station. “Granted, there’s freedom of speech. He can do and say whatever he wants to, but I think you need to have some respect for people in this country — and that flag represents nothing but hate.”

“As offensive as I may find it and other people, he has a right to say what he wants,” said another neighbor, Vicki Wolfson. “It’s just unfortunately it had to be in such a nasty way.”
