The fact-checkers at PolitiFact gave this stale, already debunked charge a big old fat \u201cFalse\u201d today.\n\nBear with me for a minute, because you\u2019ll need to once again get out your right wing conspiracy chalkboards for this one. Now imagine a world in which a false charge made against President Obama is then used to demonize former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for no reason. Yes, yes, you\u2019re getting closer to the Republican World View now.\n\nSo it is that Carly Fiorina, who was fired by the Hewlett-Packard board and has been deployed by the clever boys running the Republican Party to freely attack Hillary Clinton without worries of being called \u201csexist\u201d (because, lol, she\u2019s a woman and women can\u2019t be sexist, see Sarah Palin), leveled this moldy, debunked false charge at President Obama in order to smear Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cIt is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman president when every single policy she espouses and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstratively bad for women. Ninety-two percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama\u2019s first term belonged to women.\u201d\n\nOh? So somehow Hillary Clinton is the same as Barack Obama. No need for distinctions here. We might as well go around accusing every Republican of messing things up with those weapons of mass destruction and how about that Katrina response.\n\nIf Fiorina were a Democrat, we\u2019d parse out her hyperbolic claim that every single policy of Obama\u2019s has been bad for women, but we haven\u2019t the time to go over all of history here and we have the Other Lie to focus on. Suffice it to say, President Obama has overseen record setting private sector job growth, signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and passed Obamacare.\n\nPolitiFact pointed out how stale Fiorina\u2019s already debunked claim is, \u201cHer 92-percent claim dates back to the 2012 presidential race when it was used by the Republican National Committee and GOP nominee Mitt Romney. At the time, March 2012, the claim had some numerical validity but was also cherry-picked and flawed. We rated it Mostly False.\u201d\n\nThose Republicans sure know how to keep things hip. Why not dig through the dirty, failed laundry of 2012 in order to hit Hillary Clinton? I mean, the Benghazi probes aren\u2019t working. Why not go Mitt.\n\nPolitiFact broke it down:\n\nThe government data show an increase of 416,000 working women between January 2009 and January 2013. Total employment also rose by 1.3 million. So more women actually were working at the end of Obama\u2019s first term compared with the day he first took office.\n\nWe used the January 2009 to January 2013 timeframe to be consistent with the original Republican framing of the critique of Obama\u2019s economic policies.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFiorina said 92 percent of the jobs lost during Obama\u2019s first term belonged to women. By January 2013, the jobs numbers don\u2019t back it up at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nI\u2019m going to go ahead here and give this a double false because Fiorina was trying to hit Hillary Clinton with this bomb and instead she fizzled out like a Romney, and didn\u2019t even hit President Obama.\n\nTalk about a fail.\n\nJust remember, ladies, from the party who brought you Sarah Palin as aspirational, former Senator Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite because Carly Fiorina lied about President Barack Obama\u2019s record. This totally makes sense if you were using your right wing chalkboards as instructed.\n\nPlease don\u2019t look under the hood or you will be troubled to see that Carly Fiorina was blaming Obama for something that happened under George W Bush, whose brother Jeb Bush is struggling enough to fool y\u2019all right now and doesn\u2019t need this.\n\nThe stage was set for Fiorina to do her duty as female attack dog to go after Hillary Clinton last night and all she could come up with was a years old, already-debunked, stale Mitt Romney lie aimed at President Barack Obama.\n\nThe takeaway here is that the only position any Republican on stage was clear about last night is that they hate Hillary Clinton, and they will do or say pretty much anything in hopes of bringing her down. Maybe if they could keep the lies to things that she might have done herself, it would help their aim. Also, if it helps Republicans, Hillary Clinton is not Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women,\" Carly Fiorina charged last night during the third Republican presidential debate.
