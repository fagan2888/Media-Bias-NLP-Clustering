Alastair “Al” Fitzpayne, a top Treasury Department aide with extensive contacts on Capitol Hill, will be the next chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, working with secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.

In selecting Mr. Fitzpayne, Ms. Burwell tapped a well-connected administration aide who has worked on some of the most high-stakes fiscal battles in recent years but has relatively little health care experience.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew called Mr. Fitzpayne “an indispensible member” of Treasury’s top brass and said he “played a critical role in moving forward some of our biggest policy priorities.”

Mr. Fitzpayne joined Treasury in January 2009 as deputy chief of staff, and later became assistant secretary for legislative affairs. That essentially made Mr. Fitzpayne the Treasury Department’s top liaison to Congress, where he often had to interact with congressional aides and lawmakers over a range of contentious issues, from the debt ceiling to tax proposals.

He often plays a behind-the-scenes role, seen seated behind Mr. Lew or other top officials at congressional hearings. His profile could elevate, however, at HHS, particularly if Republicans win control of the Senate in next week’s elections. Some Republicans are expected to try and advance numerous health care proposals, potentially even a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, Ms. Burwell is still working on implementing key parts of the health care law and Mr. Fitzpayne would be involved in both administrative and political decisions.

Perhaps benefiting him in his new role, Mr. Fitzpayne has worked extensively with the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee, panels that he would likely be interacting with often in his new role.

He is expected to join HHS sometime in November.
