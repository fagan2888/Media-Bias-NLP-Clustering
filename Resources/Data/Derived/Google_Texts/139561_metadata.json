She presented the check July 21 to Mark Nelson, the children\u2019s home\u2019s vice president of development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re feeling a lot less sad about closing because we\u2019re helping another program that also spreads the word of Christ (to children),\u201d she said. \u201cWe love it that we\u2019re giving back.\u201d\n\nNelson said the Methodist children\u2019s home may use the money at a more than 300-acre campus it is opening in early August in rural North Florida.\n\n\u201cWe are very blessed and feel so grateful that they made such a generous donation to us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe children\u2019s home is based in Enterprise in Volusia County. About 100 to 110 children are in its care, plus another 300 in foster programs affiliated with the facility, Nelson said.\n\nSteppin\u2019 Stone Farm is shutting down after four decades of turning around the lives of troubled teenage girls. The last four girls left the rural farm south of Plant City on Saturday.\n\nThe Steppin\u2019 Stone board is donating the 86-acre farm to the Florida Baptist Children\u2019s Home. That organization hasn\u2019t yet announced what it will do with the rural property when it takes ownership. Staff members from the Baptist children\u2019s home will live on site during and after the transition period so the property won\u2019t be vacant.\n\nChurchill said the $100,000 was left over in Steppin\u2019 Stone\u2019s bank account after all the bills were paid. She said she wanted to help the Methodists because she sung in the youth choir at First United Methodist Church of Plant City as a teenager and received her under graduate degree from Florida Southern College, a Lakeland school affiliated with the denomination.\n\nSteppin\u2019 Stone originally intended for the Florida Baptist Children\u2019s Home to make a $100,000 donation to the Methodist\u2019s home as a condition of receiving the farm, which includes several buildings including homes, a chapel and school. But Churchill said enough was left over in the Steppin\u2019 Stone\u2019s coffers to make the donation.\n\nChurchill and the board of directors decided to close the farm earlier this year because she said fewer and fewer parents were willing to support her tough-love approach. Over the years, 900 girls ages 13 to 17 turned away from self-destructive behavior such as drug abuse through Churchill\u2019s program that included biblical training, education and hard work on a working farm.\n\nTwitter: @dnicholsonTBO\n\ndnicholson@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 394-5103", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 06:53:00 -0400", "Description": "PLANT CITY \u2013 Steppin\u2019 Stone Farm donated $100,000 to the Florida United Methodist Children\u2019s Home as the refuge for troubled teenage girls prepares to shut down for good.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "PLANT CITY \u2013 Steppin\u2019 Stone Farm donated $100,000 to the Florida United Methodist Children\u2019s Home as the refuge for troubled teenage girls prepares to shut down for good.", "title": "Soon-to-close haven for troubled girls gives $100,000 to Methodist children\u2019s home", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/plant-city/soon-to-close-haven-for-troubled-girls-gives-100000-to-methodist-childrens-home-20140727/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140727/ARTICLE/140729602/EP/1/1/EP-140729602.jpg", "height": 2000}, "updated_time": "2014-07-29T14:17:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "PLANT CITY \u2013 Steppin\u2019 Stone Farm donated $100,000 to the Florida United Methodist Children\u2019s Home as the refuge for troubled teenage girls prepares to shut down for good.", "title": "Soon-to-close haven for troubled girls gives $100,000 to Methodist children\u2019s home", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140727/ARTICLE/140729602/AR/0/AR-140729602.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-07-27T06:53:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T14:17:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde25d\"", "article_summary": "PLANT CITY \u2013 Steppin\u2019 Stone Farm donated $100,000 to the Florida United Methodist Children\u2019s Home as the refuge for troubled teenage girls prepares to shut down for good.\nSteppin\u2019 Stone Farm is shutting down after four decades of turning around the lives of troubled teenage girls.\nThe last four girls left the rural farm south of Plant City on Saturday.\nSteppin\u2019 Stone Famr Executive Director Cindy Churchill said she feels like the money was in good hands \u2013 and will continue the overall mission of helping children.\nThe Steppin\u2019 Stone board is donating the 86-acre farm to the Florida Baptist Children\u2019s Home."}
