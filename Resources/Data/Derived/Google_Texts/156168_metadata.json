Other plans will increase by 14 percent to 39 percent for the other four insurance companies in the state exchange, the Star-Tribune reported.\n\nOnly about 6 percent of the state\u2019s residents \u2013 or 300,000 people \u2013 are insured on the marketplace, where they are eligible for tax credits to buy insurance. The Minnesota Commerce Department approved the rate hikes.\n\n\u201cEven though Minnesota rates remain among the nation\u2019s lowest, the rate increases by the insurance companies are unacceptably high,\u201d Minnesota Department of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman said, according to WCCO-TV.\n\nEvery health insurance company in Minnesota asked for a rate increase of at least 10 percent, the Star-Tribune reported. Blue Cross and Blue Shield asked for an increase in the mid-50s.\n\n\u201cWhen Blue Cross and Blue Shield filed higher rate increases in the mid-50 percent range, it made all the other insurers want to change and increase their rates, too,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cThis effectively tied our hands, in some respects.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield said in a statement that the hikes will \u201cmitigate\u201d the cost to the company, but added, \u201cEven with these increases, Blue Cross is likely to experience continued significant financial losses through 2016.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, said that, if companies make insurance unaffordable, he will demand \u201cthat they be removed as the providers of health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt said that, instead of adding another bureaucracy, the state should have joined the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time now that we take real action, before one or two more years of huge rate increases that Minnesotans can\u2019t afford,\u201d Daudt told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe time for action is now.\u201d\n\nMNsure\u2019s interim chief executive, Allison O\u2019Toole, said in a statement that the hikes didn\u2019t reflect so well on the Obamacare law as a whole, not just MNsure.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that today\u2019s news would be the same regardless of whether Minnesotans use MNsure or healthcare.gov,\u201d O\u2019Toole said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "In the latest case of soaring health care rates since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Minnesotans will pay up to nearly 50 percent more for the health insurance plans they buy on the state\u2019s Obamacare insurance exchange.
