As a result, average levels of gamma-tocopherol in blood plasma samples taken from Americans rose to four or more times higher than counterparts in European countries. Attendant with that rise, asthma rates had risen in the U.S. by 2010 to 8.4 percent, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cThe blood plasma showed how much they had acquired in their tissues,\" Cook-Mills said. \"You get vitamin E from your diet or supplements.\"\n\nIn the study, Cooks-Mills and her colleagues analyzed data from more than 4,500 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. She compared lung functioning tests taken at four intervals over a 20-year period to levels of gamma-tocopherol measured in blood plasma at three intervals over a period of 15 years. Similar to results seen in an animal model, higher levels of gamma-tocopherol were linked to a 10 to 17 percent decrease in lung functioning.\n\n\"A 10 percent reduction in lung function is like an asthmatic condition,\" Cook-Mills said. \"People have more trouble breathing. They take in less air, and it's harder to expel. Their lungs have reduced capacity.\"\n\nYet the dichotomy between good and bad Vitamin E may now be explained by empirical observation, without recourse to mythology. A couple of years ago, Cooks-Mills identified the protein kinase C-alpha as the mechanism causing the health schism between the two types. As the protein binds to both types of Vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol inhibits its action while gamma-tocopherol once again goes the other way.\n\nSource: Cooks-Mills, Joan M., Marchese, Michelle E., Kumar, Rajesh.
