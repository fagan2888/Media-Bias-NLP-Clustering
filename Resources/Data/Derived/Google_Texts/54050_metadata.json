Mitch McConnell, facing a tough re-election battle next year, emailed supporters this week with a Christmas-themed audio announcement that takes a few pot shots at his challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nThe one-minute recording, titled \u201c\u2018Twas the Night Before Christmas\u201d features McConnell reciting, in sing-song fashion, a rhyming poem about the shortcomings of Democrats, President Obama and Grimes.\n\n\u201c\u2018Twas the night before Christmas, four years ago. Liberals wanted Obamacare, but Kentucky said no,'\u201d McConnell says in the announcement.\n\n\u201c\u2018If you like your plan, you can keep it,' they said with a twinkle in their eye. Newspapers now say that was the year's biggest lie. Higher taxes, more spending, sky-high record debt. Obama's war on coal \u2014 had enough, yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Obama wondered: Who's my Kentucky candidate for these times? And guess who it goes to?

Easley/ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn his southern monotone baritone, the 71-year-old Minority Leader goes on to recite: \u201cThe differences are stark and your choice will be clear, you\u2019ll make your decision in November next year.\u201d\n\nThe holiday-themed declaration follows the McConnell campaign\u2019s successful \u201cWhat rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes\u201d YouTube video, from July, which went viral and had politicos across the country singing the short\u2019s catchy hook.\n\nMcConnell faces a tight race against Grimes, the 35-year-old Kentucky Secretary of State, to hold on to his seat. A PPP poll released last week shows him up only one percentage point \u2014 43% to 42% \u2014 over Grimes.\n\nOn a mobile device?
