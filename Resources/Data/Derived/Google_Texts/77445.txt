Brat said, “I think our party is scared of its shadow when it comes to the 2016 election. And so, we think there’s this demographic problem, right? With the African-American vote and Hispanic vote. Instead of, we are proud of the Judeo-Christian tradition. All of my African-American and Hispanic friends are a part of that tradition.

Our big crony capitalists want cheap labor.”
