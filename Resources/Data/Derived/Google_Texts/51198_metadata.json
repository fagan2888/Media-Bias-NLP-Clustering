Funding for the NIH \u2013 which became a major issue during the sequestration cuts \u2013 was revived in Congress last fall as Ebola appeared a greater threat.\n\nDurbin\u2019s bill comes one day after Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a nearly 400-page to-do list for the medical industry in 2015. The massive document quickly drew fire from Democrats who said the bill ignored the NIH\u2019s funding needs.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) slammed the proposal for lacking \u201cany real dollars to fund additional basic research at the National Institutes of Health\u201d despite lengthy conversations from both parties last year.\n\nA Democratic aide for the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the wishlist was largely drafted without Democratic consent and NIH funding would be a major sticking point in future negotiations.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Top Democrat calls for big boost in NIH funding", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Top Democrat calls for big boost in NIH funding", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231051-top-democrat-calls-for-big-boost-in-nih-funding", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231051-top-democrat-calls-for-big-boost-in-nih-funding", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-28T17:11-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Dick Durbin,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-28T17:11:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231051-top-democrat-calls-for-big-boost-in-nih-funding", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Top Democrat calls for big boost in NIH funding"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd74d\"", "article_summary": "A Democratic aide for the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the wishlist was largely drafted without Democratic consent and NIH funding would be a major sticking point in future negotiations.\nFunding for the NIH \u2013 which became a major issue during the sequestration cuts \u2013 was revived in Congress last fall as Ebola appeared a greater threat.\nThe bill, the American Cures Act, would create a mandatory funding stream to support research by the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies.\nDurbin\u2019s bill comes one day after Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a nearly 400-page to-do list for the medical industry in 2015.\nThe massive document quickly drew fire from Democrats who said the bill ignored the NIH\u2019s funding needs."}
