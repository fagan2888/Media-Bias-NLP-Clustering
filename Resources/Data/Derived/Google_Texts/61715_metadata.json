Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and(R-Fla.) introduced legislation Wednesday to make risk corridors budget-neutral. A similar bill from Cassidy was included in the federal spending package passed in December, though the requirement would only apply for one year.The introduction of the latest bill signals Cassidy's hope of becoming a leading voice on healthcare issues in the upper chamber.

The program is set to expire in 2016.Rubio, who originated the attack that risk corridors are a \"bailout,\" repeated that the program should not involve taxpayer dollars.\"We should pass a measure like this one to take this option entirely off the table forever,\" he said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "New legislation would make the program budget-neutral for its duration.", "description": "New legislation would make the program budget-neutral for its duration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "New legislation would make the program budget-neutral for its duration.", "title": "GOP bill hits ObamaCare risk corridors", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231856-gop-bill-hits-obamacare-risk-corridors", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231856-gop-bill-hits-obamacare-risk-corridors", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-05T11:28-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elise Viebeck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Marco Rubio,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-05T11:28:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/231856-gop-bill-hits-obamacare-risk-corridors", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "New legislation would make the program budget-neutral for its duration.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP bill hits ObamaCare risk corridors"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP bill hits ObamaCare risk corridors"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd02b\"", "article_summary": "Republicans are seeking to ensure that no federal dollars go to health insurance companies under ObamaCare's risk corridors, a program the GOP attacks as an industry \"bailout.\"\nand(R-Fla.) introduced legislation Wednesday to make risk corridors budget-neutral.\nBill Cassidy (R-La.)\nThe program is set to expire in 2016.Rubio, who originated the attack that risk corridors are a \"bailout,\" repeated that the program should not involve taxpayer dollars.\n\"We should pass a measure like this one to take this option entirely off the table forever,\" he said in a statement."}
