The patient just died. Gov. Rick Perry has established a task force to address the Ebola threat.\n\nNot a bad idea but still a feeble response coming from a governor who refused to expand Medicaid in his state, leaving millions of his people outside the health care system. About 6 million Texans are now walking around without health insurance. That\u2019s almost 1 in 4 residents \u2014 the highest rate of uninsured in the country.\n\nOf course, those without health coverage are least likely to have a relationship with a health care professional, someone they could contact about worrisome symptoms. And because vomiting and other signs of Ebola could indicate something far less serious, these mostly low-income people might put off going to a hospital until it\u2019s too late.\n\nBut Perry was among the large group of so-called conservative governors deeming it was more important to stick it to President Obama than to broaden health coverage in their states. Not surprisingly, the sharpest drops in the rates of the uninsured are in states that went along with the expansion. The rates remain nearly unchanged in the 23 nonparticipating states.\n\nThere was always a humanitarian reason for supporting the Affordable Care Act. Now we are seeing the self-interested reasons, which have been missing in most of the Obamacare debate. Covering all is essential to public health. Even the rich don\u2019t enjoy divine protection from deadly infectious diseases. That the federal government is covering nearly the entire cost of the Medicaid expansion makes the excuses for not joining the program especially ugly.\n\nAnd this is not just about Ebola. The flu is a communicable disease that typically kills 30,000 Americans a year, mainly the very old, the very young and the frail. Universal coverage can help contain that, as well.\n\nThe Ebola scare has overshadowed another frightening virus that has been diagnosed in hundreds of children since August \u2014 and that has just claimed the life of a 4-year-old in New Jersey. Enterovirus-68 has been found in 48 states, with significant numbers reported in Colorado, Illinois and Missouri. This respiratory illness, which has been associated with partial paralysis, spreads the same way colds do, through saliva and other bodily fluids.\n\nControlling these diseases requires early quarantine of those infected, and how are you going to find people who would test positive if they don\u2019t go to a medical facility? Politicians who irresponsibly passed up an opportunity to bring such health services to their people are currently grasping at useless proposals.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal thinks the answer is to \u201cstop accepting flights from countries that are Ebola stricken.\u201d But what about the two nurses in Madrid who tested positive for the virus after treating a Spanish priest? The priest and one of the nurses have already died of the disease.\n\nDo we stop accepting flights from Spain, which has a pretty good health care system, of course covering everyone? Not unexpectedly, the Texas governor opposes the flight ban idea.\n\nJindal was inexplicably proud to decline $6 billion in federal money to expand Medicaid coverage in his state. Nearly 900,000 Louisianans currently lack health insurance.\n\n\u201cExpansion would result in 41 percent of Louisiana\u2019s population being enrolled in Medicaid,\u201d Jindal explained at the time. \u201cWe should measure success by reducing the number of people on public assistance.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways of measuring success in a society, widespread health coverage being one. Instead, we see a political failure that has left Americans more vulnerable to a deadly disease than they had to be. It\u2019s really something.\n\nFroma Harrop is a columnist for Creators Syndicate Inc.
