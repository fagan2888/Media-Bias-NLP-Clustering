Three Denver-area hospitals are shedding the “Exempla” name.

The names of St. Joseph Hospital, Lutheran Medical Center and Good Samaritan Medical Center will stand alone.

The change comes three years after the faith-based, nonprofit Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health Systems merged with Exempla Healthcare. The Sisters of Charity system will now do business as SCL Health as part of the rebranding.

SCL Health relocated its corporate headquarters from Leavenworth, Kan., to the Denver area in 2012.

“We have become one system, with one mission and one set of values,” said Chris Woolsey, SCL senior vice president. “We wanted to unify everything under one brand.”

SCL Health, a $2.3 billion system, operates five other hospitals, including St. Mary’s Medical Center in Grand Junction and others in Kansas and Montana.

Most practices in the Exempla Physician Network, which has 200 doctors and 45 clinics, will be known as SCL Physicians.

SCL Health and St. Joseph Hospital also recently announced they have teamed up with National Jewish Health to collaborate on clinical operations.

The sisters opened their first hospital in 1864.
