According to The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, there are currently 60 political prisoners jailed in the communist country and 11 people under some form of parole.\n\nThis number represents a sizable decrease from the 102 prisoners (12 people on parole) that were noted by the human rights group last year.\n\nAs reported by the Associated Press, in January, Cuban authorities released 53 political prisoners at the request of the United States, after the two nations' announcement that they were taking steps to ease relations on December 17.\n\nElizardo Sanchez, the head of the non-governmental commission, stated, \"There was a big reduction from last year because the government in Washington became involved in those 53 cases.\"\n\nA Reuters report, listing the political crimes tied to the 60 prisoners informs that the group includes armed anti-government infiltrators, hijackers, as well as people who have been accused of violence or of spying, states that there are at least two dozen additional prisoners behind bars right now for charges tied to peaceful political protests.\n\n\"The great majority are prisoners because of their political position, for their views, for their convictions,\" maintains Sanchez.\n\nDescribing the current state of Human Rights abuses in Cuba, Sanchez adds, \"It's true that there are no longer 15,000 political prisoners as there were 40 or 50 years ago. Before, the repression was built on long prison sentences. Now it's based on many more short-term detentions, a few days or hours. The form has changed.\"\n\nSince 2010, the Cuban government has released dozens of political prisoners on the condition of exile.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch's 2014 report, \u201cThe Cuban government continues to repress individuals and groups who criticize the government or call for basic human rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "According to the The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, there are currently 60 political prisoners jailed  in the communist country and 11 people under some form of parole", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "According to the The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, there are currently 60 political prisoners jailed  in the communist country and 11 people under some form of parole", "title": "US-Cuba Relations News: Cuban Human Rights Group Says 60 Political Prisoners Are Still Behind Bars", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/61008/20150620/us-cuba-relations-news-cuban-human-rights-group-says-60-political-prisoners-are-still-behind-bars.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/50294/cuba-flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "According to the The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, there are currently 60 political prisoners jailed  in the communist country and 11 people under some form of parole", "title": "US-Cuba Relations News: Cuban Human Rights Group Says 60 Political Prisoners Are Still Behind Bars", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/61008/20150620/us-cuba-relations-news-cuban-human-rights-group-says-60-political-prisoners-are-still-behind-bars.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/50294/cuba-flag.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/61008/20150620/us-cuba-relations-news-cuban-human-rights-group-says-60-political-prisoners-are-still-behind-bars.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-20"}, "news_keywords": "us, cuba, relations, news, cuban, human, rights, group, says, 60, political, prisoners, are, still, behind, bars", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c95\"", "article_summary": "According to Human Rights Watch's 2014 report, \u201cThe Cuban government continues to repress individuals and groups who criticize the government or call for basic human rights.\u201d\nAccording to The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, there are currently 60 political prisoners jailed in the communist country and 11 people under some form of parole.\nThis number represents a sizable decrease from the 102 prisoners (12 people on parole) that were noted by the human rights group last year.\nThe number of political prisoners in Cuba is going down.\nSince 2010, the Cuban government has released dozens of political prisoners on the condition of exile."}
