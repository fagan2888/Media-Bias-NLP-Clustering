Country singer Charlie Daniels is no fan of President Obama, but he just might be in a big fan of comedian Jeff Foxworthy. Foxworthy helped build a career on a comic riff that starts with “You just might be a redneck if …” In a series of tweets, Daniels does some comic riffing of his own, on President Obama’s oft-repeated lie that anyone who liked their pre-Obamacare health plan would be able to keep their health plan under the new regime. Here, compliments of Twitchy.com, are some of Daniels’ “you can keep your doctor if …” scenarios.

You can keep your doctor if he is a fully accredited veterinarian who only treats large animals. — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) December 10, 2013

You can keep your doctor if you’re a vegan who operates a hog farm and raises aardvarks that are also vegans. — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) December 10, 2013

Or for the birth-control minded …

You can keep your insurance plan if it covers a vasectomy for everybody in your immediate neighborhood. — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) December 10, 2013

You can keep your doctor if you’re a good friend of Sandra Fluke — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) December 10, 2013

It’s not just doctors Daniels takes on.

And did you know Obamacare covers dental?

It’s just got one tiny snag, Daniels found.

You can keep your own teeth but your gums will have to come out. — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) December 10, 2013

Biting irony, or just American life under liberal logic?

In case you missed it: Texas defies feds; we shut the border down ourselves, said Lt. gov.
