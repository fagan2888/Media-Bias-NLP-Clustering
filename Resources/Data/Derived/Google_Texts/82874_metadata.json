Ryle High School in Northern Kentucky.\n\nEdwards, 18, and his fellow Students for Life club displayed posters during freshman orientation for fall semester.\n\nConcerned students \u201cwere being forced into the conversation\u201d by pro-life language in the group\u2019s posters, Principal Matthew Turner proceeded to require the group to submit posters for his approval.\n\nPosters the group was allowed to hang on campus were restricted from having a pro-life message.\n\n\u201cWe were basically being censored,\u201d Edwards told Fox19 Now.\n\nPrincipal Turner banned the group from hanging six of seven posters the group submitted for approval.\n\n\u201cSigns are to communicate information about meetings, not to promote or persuade,\u201d reads a sticky note placed on the posters denied for approval.\n\nOne posted that was not allowed to be hung at Ryle High School reads:\n\nSave the Baby Humans Ryle Students for Life Meeting Every Friday, Mrs. Edmonds\u2019 Room 218 Pizza, Drinks, & Cupcakes\n\n\u201cOther student clubs and students have been allowed to post flyers taking various positions and I was specifically told my flyers could not be posted because the issue was too controversial,\u201d said Edwards in a Students for Life release.\n\nOn Tuesday, Edwards\u2019 attorneys sent a demand letter to the principal for violation of the high school senior\u2019s right under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment and the Equal Access Act (which requires equal treatment for extracurricular activities at federally funded secondary schools).\n\nThe demand letter states that the principal \u201cdid not want a pregnant mother or pro-choice student to feel discriminated against\u201d as a reason for his censorship. The letter requests that the principal reconsider his decision and allow the Students for Life group to hang its posters.\n\nEdwards said in the release that he would like \u201cto be able to share positive pro-life messages\u201d with his peers, \u201cespecially with students who may be facing an unplanned pregnancy or know someone who is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur aim is never to discriminate but to lovingly present the pro-life message and make a positive impact on our school community,\u201d he continued.\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America (the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization), calls the situation \u201coutright discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe school has no right to censor a message because they deem it to be controversial, as is the case with Mr. Turner at Ryle High School,\u201d Hawkins said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately the school administration has failed to uphold the free speech rights of Patrick and we had to seek legal assistance to make sure that his rights are upheld.\u201d\n\nEdwards met twice with the principal to discuss the situation. He tried to resolve the issue with an email on Oct. 7 before Alliance Defending Freedom affiliates and attorneys at Hemmer DeFrank Wessels were brought on to assist.\n\n\u201cThe law does not permit a principal to ban speech simply because, in his subjective opinion, the speech is too controversial,\u201d one of Edwards\u2019 attorneys, Kyle Winslow, stated. \u201cRyle High School\u2019s censorship of Patrick clearly violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and must end.\u201d\n\nPrincipal Turner provided the following comment to The Daily Signal:\n\nThe letter of concern was just recently received and is being reviewed by legal counsel. We believe that our school\u2019s procedures are in full compliance with the law and we do not discriminate against students or student groups on the basis of gender, race, religion, marital status, or disability. We have been threatened with litigation and therefore cannot comment any further on this issue.\n\nThe demand letter requests a written response from the principal by 5 p.m. on Oct. 20. If the club is not given permission to hang pro-life posters, the attorneys \u201cwill move forward with litigation to protect the fundamental rights of students at Ryle High School.\u201d\n\nEdwards wrote a status update on his Facebook page Wednesday: \u201cHopefully the school will allow our club to exercise our First Amendment rights and the whole situation can be resolved in a peaceful and timely manner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Kentucky high school pro-life student organization has been denied the right to hang posters.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Kentucky high school pro-life student organization has been denied the right to hang posters.", "title": "After Principal Censors Pro-Life Posters, Student Seeks Legal Action", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151014_NKYstudent_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-15T21:05:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1G6Go5F"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Kentucky high school pro-life student organization has been denied the right to hang posters.", "title": "After Principal Censors Pro-Life Posters, Student Seeks Legal Action", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151014_NKYstudent_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-10-15T19:01:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T21:05:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kentucky, Students for Life, Ryle High School, pro-life"}, "article_summary": "A Kentucky high school pro-life student organization has been denied the right to hang posters.\nPatrick Edwards, president of the club \u201cStudents for Life,\u201d is ready to take legal action against his principal at Larry A.
