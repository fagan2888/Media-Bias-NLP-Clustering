The electoral law must still be approved by lawmakers and an emergency session was scheduled for Monday after the senate failed to achieve quorum Sunday night. The government feels it now has the support needed to win the vote.\n\nMartelly, who took power in May 2011 and is due to leave next year, will rule by decree if political leaders don\u2019t resolve Haiti\u2019s crisis by authorizing the law by Monday\u2019s close.\n\nSenate President Simon Desras told The Associated Press he was hopeful that the political gridlock could be resolved in the next 24 hours. He said he expected participation of at least three but possibly four members of a group of six senators who have used parliamentary procedure to prevent a vote authorizing the elections. They accuse Martelly of trying to undermine the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Haiti leader, opposition forge deal to possibly end impasse", "title": "Haiti leader, opposition forge deal to possibly end impasse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Haiti leader, opposition forge deal to possibly end impasse", "title": "Haiti leader, opposition forge deal to possibly end impasse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/12/haiti_leader_opposition_forge_deal_to_possibly_end_impasse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/haiti-protest.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Haiti leader, opposition forge deal to possibly end impasse", "title": "Haiti leader, opposition forge deal to possibly end impasse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/haiti-protest.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "DAVID McFADDEN", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After days of fruitless negotiations with lawmakers, Martelly on Sunday finally achieved consensus to try and end the impasse.\nSenate President Simon Desras told The Associated Press he was hopeful that the political gridlock could be resolved in the next 24 hours.\nMartelly, who took power in May 2011 and is due to leave next year, will rule by decree if political leaders don\u2019t resolve Haiti\u2019s crisis by authorizing the law by Monday\u2019s close.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) \u2014 Haiti\u2019s president said Sunday he has forged a last-minute accord with leaders of four opposition parties after days of closed-door negotiations, possibly creating a viable path to ending a political standoff stalling long-delayed elections.\nThe electoral law must still be approved by lawmakers and an emergency session was scheduled for Monday after the senate failed to achieve quorum Sunday night."}
