HHS' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) continues its mission to improve health care delivery in the United States through evidence-based research by launching its EvidenceNOW: Advancing Heart Health in Primary Care(www.ahrq.gov) grant initiative, which aims to empower small primary care practices to improve the heart health of nearly 8 million patients.

On May 26, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced an award of $112 million to establish seven regional cooperatives composed of multidisciplinary teams of experts that will provide quality improvement services. Those services will include on-site coaching, consultation on health care delivery improvement, sharing best practices and electronic health records support for as many as 300 small primary care practices in 12 states.

According to an HHS news release,(www.hhs.gov) the initiative will help small primary care practices in urban and rural settings incorporate the most recent evidence on how best to deliver the so-called ABCS of cardiovascular prevention into their patients' care:

• Aspirin use by high-risk individuals,

• Blood pressure control,

• Cholesterol management and

• Smoking cessation.

"By targeting smaller practices, we have a unique opportunity to reduce cardiovascular risk factors for hundreds of thousands of patients and learn what kind of support results in better patient outcomes," Burwell said in the news release.

The program will reach Native Americans in Oklahoma; Hispanics in Colorado and New Mexico; medically underserved communities in New York City and the Chicago Tri-State region; and rural communities in North Carolina, the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, according to the website. It's estimated the initiative will work with more than 5,000 primary care health professionals in total.
