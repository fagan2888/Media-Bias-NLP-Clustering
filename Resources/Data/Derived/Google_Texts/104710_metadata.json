Ted Cruz is steaming mad about this week\u2019s Supreme Court decisions on Obamacare and gay marriage, and he\u2019s not shy about letting everyone know it \u2014 or about proposing a solution.\n\nThe 2016 Republican presidential hopeful called the rulings \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history\u201d during an appearance on \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show,\u201d and proposed a constitutional amendment to rectify the problem of activist judges.\n\n\u201cYesterday and today were both naked and shameless judicial activism,\u201d he told host Sean Hannity. \u201cNeither decision\u2013 the decision yesterday rewriting Obamacare \u2026 for the second time. Six justices joined the Obama administration, you now have Barack Obama, Kathleen Sebelius, and six justices responsible for forcing this failed disaster of a law on millions of Americans, and simply rewriting the law in a way that is fundamentally contrary to their judicial oath.\u201d\n\nHe told Hannity the decision to strike down the marriage laws of individual states had no basis in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThey are simply making it up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is lawless, and in doing so they have undermined the fundamental legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nCruz also wrote an op-ed for National Review in which he called the decisions \u201cjudicial activism, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nHe wrote that the answer is to have judicial retention elections to hold judges accountable for their decisions, a move that would require an amendment to the Constitution.\n\n\u201cJudicial retention elections have worked in states across America; they will work for America. In order to provide the people themselves with a constitutional remedy to the problem of judicial activism and the means for throwing off judicial tyrants, I am proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution that would subject the justices of the Supreme Court to periodic judicial-retention elections,\u201d he wrote.\u201dEvery justice, beginning with the second national election after his or her appointment, will answer to the American people and the states in a retention election every eight years. Those justices deemed unfit for retention by both a majority of the American people as a whole and by majorities of the electorates in at least half of the 50 states will be removed from office and disqualified from future service on the Court,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Constitution currently gives Supreme Court justices lifetime appointments. The idea of the founders was to appoint them for life so they wouldn\u2019t be affected by politics.\n\nMany people say recent decisions suggest judges are making decisions based on political ideology.\n\nThe Twitterverse showed support for Cruz\u2019s idea of a Constitutional amendment.\n\nWe must not submit our constitutional freedoms, and the promise of our nation, to judicial tyranny http://t.co/ZInyN6JfLR #SCOTUS \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) June 26, 2015\n\n@hotzgeor @tedcruz You can say that again!
