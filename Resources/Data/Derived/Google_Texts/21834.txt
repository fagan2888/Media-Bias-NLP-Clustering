The first Democratic primary debate of the 2016 race is happening on Tuesday, Oct. 13, and The Huffington Post will be broadcasting live, before and after, with commentary and reporting from Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, Nevada, and Des Moines, Iowa.

Join Zach Carter, Jason Linkins and their guests on Tuesday night, starting at 7:30 p.m. EDT for updates and analysis on the candidates, and the best and worst moments from the CNN debate. We'll be going live at least until 12:30 a.m., and will be cutting in during commercial breaks for snap analysis, so keep us up on one of your screens. (We promise to mute when the debate comes back on.)
