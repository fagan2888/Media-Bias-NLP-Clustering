You can\u2019t even compare the functionality.\u201d\n\nMs. Kuh said that as of Wednesday, VHA has submitted applications for 188 Islanders and 62 are enrolled in a health plan. She said that the vastly improved website, while not totally bug-free, has helped the VHA staff serve Islanders more efficiently. \u201cWe can sit down with people and complete an application and 75 to 80 percent of the time, we can get them through the entire process, and enrolling them in a health plan, in one sitting,\u201d she said, adding that the application process usually takes about an hour and a half.\n\nPaul Munafo of Vineyard Haven had a consultation at VHA two weeks ago. In a conversation with The Times, he was effusive in his praise for the VHA staff. \u201cLast year when we tried to sign up on the website, it was a disaster. I was on a transplant list and I needed insurance for expenses that were perhaps going to come. We got such a runaround we had to get our own insurance through HSA. We ended paying $1,300 a month. This year was like we\u2019ve landed in Oz. It was flawless. We\u2019re saving approximately $500 a month now. For us, that\u2019s huge. Mary Leddy [a staff member at VHA] is awesome; I can\u2019t say enough about her. She knows more about insurance than anybody I\u2019ve ever met. We\u2019re very lucky to have Vineyard Healthcare Access.\u201d\n\nIsland navigators\n\nEarlier this year, VHA applied for a grant to fund the specialized training needed to qualify as a \u201cnavigator\u201d for MHC for Dukes County. In August, VHA was selected as one of five new navigators in the state \u2014 there are 15 navigators statewide. All four of the VHA client services staff, Ms. Kuh, Ms. Leddy, Maria Mouzinho, and Vani Pessoni are Certified Massachusetts Navigators. They can advise the insured and the uninsured, small businesses owners, the self-employed, and seasonal workers. The multilingual staff can assist all Island residents.\n\nThe current lead time for a consultation at the VHA is four to six weeks. \u201cPeople who receive no subsidies \u2014 meaning they have private insurance through the Health Connector \u2014 have a December 23 deadline,\u201d Ms. Kuh said, but she stressed that accommodations can still be made for people with that deadline. \u201cWe do have ways of squeezing people in as needed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been training a new staff member who should be certified by next week. That will open up availability as well.\u201d\n\nMost people have a deadline of January 23, 2015, according to Ms. Kuh.\n\n\u201cFor people who are clearly over income for any subsidies or tax credits, they don\u2019t have to go through the Health Connector, they can go to a broker. That\u2019s usually pretty efficient.\u201d\n\nEligibility\n\nPeople who make under 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) are potentially eligible for health care subsidies. The poverty line for an individual is $11,670, so an individual making under $46,680 may qualify, as could two people making under $62,920; families of three or four have limits of $79,160 and $95,400, respectively.\n\nApplicants must bring last year\u2019s tax returns and the last two or three pay stubs and any other income information, such as Social Security payments. For seasonal workers, the last pay stub of the season is required.\n\n\u201cThere are instances where proof of residency is required, which can be satisfied by a utility bill,\u201d Ms. Kuh said. \u201cIf proof of income or proof of residency is required, applicants will have 90 days to submit that information. When people are not U.S. citizens born in the U.S. \u2014 if they\u2019re either naturalized citizens or have a different immigration status \u2014 we need their green card and certificate of naturalization.\u201d\n\nFederal I.D. proofing, a major bugaboo in last year\u2019s open enrollment, has been fixed, according to Ms. Kuh. \u201cThis is part of what wasn\u2019t working in the old system but is working now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people put in their information, like their Social Security number, this system matches that to certain federal information. When that fails, then the online application can\u2019t continue, then people do have to verify their identity. This requires another appointment to complete the application, but it doesn\u2019t happen often.\u201d\n\nCheck yourself\n\nThe three-month enrollment period ends February 15, but different subgroups have different deadlines, so Ms. Kuh advises Islanders to confirm their deadline as early as possible. She also recommends that people try the Health Connector website on their own. \u201cObviously we want to be available for everybody who wants our help, but it\u2019s worth the try to do it own their own because the website is working this time.\u201d\n\nJoanne Metayer Lambert, a pre-school teacher from Oak Bluffs, has followed Ms. Kuh\u2019s advice. \u201cWe have an appointment with Mary Leddy on December 15,\u201d she told The Times. \u201cI\u2019m working on the [Health Connector] website now to begin our new application, and it\u2019s very user friendly. We\u2019ll go to Mary to finalize it and make sure all the t\u2019s are crossed. Mary has been a huge help in the past. Thank goodness we have that office.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Martha's Vineyard Times", "description": "State website overhaul and advanced training for Vineyard Healthcare Access staff show positive early results.", "title": "Health Connector connecting with Islanders - Martha's Vineyard Times", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.mvtimes.com/mvt/uploads/2014/12/BNFR0214.jpg", "height": 960}, "updated_time": "2014-12-03T17:01:42-04:00", "url": "http://www.mvtimes.com/2014/12/03/health-connector-connecting-islanders/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "published_time": "2014-12-03T17:01:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T17:01:42-04:00"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Barry Stringfellow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdebd\"", "article_summary": "As the open enrollment period for the Massachusetts Health Connector (MHC) rolls into its third week, health insurance advisors at the Vineyard Healthcare Access program (VHA) are reporting that, contrary to the mayhem of last year\u2019s open enrollment, the new and improved Massachusetts Health Connector is performing as advertised.\nShe also recommends that people try the Health Connector website on their own.\n\u201cI\u2019m working on the [Health Connector] website now to begin our new application, and it\u2019s very user friendly.\n\u201cFor people who are clearly over income for any subsidies or tax credits, they don\u2019t have to go through the Health Connector, they can go to a broker.\nAll four of the VHA client services staff, Ms. Kuh, Ms. Leddy, Maria Mouzinho, and Vani Pessoni are Certified Massachusetts Navigators."}
