A sampling of stars who pumped iron there include Major League Baseball\u2019s Danny Tartabull, Daryl Strawberry, Joe Carter, and Dave Magadan; from the National Football League, Freddie Solomon, Roger Craig and Vinny Testaverde; and professional wrestlers Ric Flair, Andre the Giant, \u201cSuperstar\u201d Billy Graham and Rocky \u201cSoul Man\u201d Johnson.\n\nThe famous gym once located in the Horizon Park Shopping Center on Hillsborough Avenue closed its doors in 2005 but owner Al Rosen still draws celebrities each year through the Tri-Fitness Challenge competitions he started in 1998 \u2014 grueling obstacle courses and contests of strength that test will as much as athleticism.\n\nThe next challenge is Nov. 16 at Alonso High School, 8302 Montague St. Tri-Fitness alum also are packed with celebrity names, many of whom used the events as a springboard to success.\n\n\u201cI attribute my experience with Al and the entire gang as something that tremendously propelled me into more amazing opportunities,\u201d said Torrie Wilson, who became a WWE superstar and Playboy cover model in the years following her first Tri-Fitness challenge.\n\nRosen said that more than 50 other Tri-Fitness participants appeared on the cover of magazines following the competition, including Kim Lyons, later a trainer for NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Biggest Loser.\u201d\n\nThe star power belies the ordinary surroundings at Alonso High, but Rosen was never one to mix fitness and fashion.\n\nHe\u2019s old school, just like The Boddy Shoppe.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky if he turned the air conditioning on,\u201d quipped Aaron Brown, former Buccaneer and longtime Boddy Shoppe member. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t need it. We wanted to sweat.\u201d\n\nHow about the elliptical machines and treadmills that cover the floors of modern gyms?\n\nNot allowed.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted cardio, you ran sprints out back in the heat,\u201d said Rosen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the type of place I wish existed today \u2014 no air condition, no frills, no pristine machines, and for the love of all that\u2019s holy in the world of fitness, no pastel colors on the wall,\u201d Dwayne Johnson said. \u201cJust iron, sweat and joyful grunting, and the men were even louder.\u201d\n\nSteve Henderson of Tampa, long-time former hitting coach with the Philadelphia Phillies, said this mantra to simplicity made The Body Shoppe a popular spot for celebrity athletes.\n\n\u201cThe draw was that people went there to work out, not get autographs. Al and Bruce were great guys. They would never have allowed it. Pro athletes were treated the same as everyone else.\u201d\n\nSome of The Boddy Shoppe\u2019s visitors would come to the city for short stays when their team played here or when the professional wrestling tour visited.\n\nWWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair has worked out at many gyms while touring the world and calls The Boddy Shoppe one of his all-time favorites, comparing it to the Gold\u2019s Gym of the late-1970s in Venice Beach, Calif., made famous in the movie \u201cPumping Iron.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that it was as big in size as Gold\u2019s, but because it was where everyone wanted to work out,\u201d Flair said. \u201cThe Boddy Shoppe was the place to be in Tampa.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was truly an electric atmosphere with all those characters coming in and out,\u201d said former professional wrestler Joe Gomez. \u201cI could tell stories about it for hours.\u201d\n\nPressed for details, Gomez laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat happened at The Boddy Shoppe, stayed at The Boddy Shoppe.\u201d\n\nRosen stayed tight-lipped, too.\n\n\u201cOur members included athletes, preachers, attorneys, judges and the Mafia. So you can imagine what happened when all those colorful personalities got together. Everyone got along, but it was crazy.\u201d\n\nBut it was also a respectful group. Rosen wouldn\u2019t have allowed his family to work out there otherwise, he said.\n\nRosen\u2019s family used the gym as a springboard for their own successful athletic careers.\n\nHis niece Jacquelyn was a No. 1 ranked junior tennis player. His nephew Milton built the muscle at The Boddy Shoppe that turned him into a Special Olympics champion. His daughters \u2013 Stephanie, Jennifer and Lindsey \u2014 each became all-state and all-nation athletes in high school gymnastics and karate.\n\nFollowing high school, though, Rosen\u2019s daughters found few competitive opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt was just marathons and body building for women back then,\u201d said Rosen. \u201cI thought women needed a more well-rounded competition. So I started Tri-Fitness.\u201d\n\nThat first event was for women only and featured an obstacle course, gymnastic floor routine and body-building posing competition. In 1999, Rosen added a male component. The three competitive events differ from year to year but in their entirety, Rosen said, they always prove who the most well-rounded athlete is in terms of strength, agility, fitness, willpower and physique.\n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s, Tri-Fitness was boasting more than 200 participants from around the world. In 2005, Rosen closed the Boddy Shoppe so he could dedicate all his time to Tri-Fitness competitions. They had grown too large to remain a side project.\n\nThe Nov. 16 event will feature two obstacle courses \u2014 a 160-yard agility course with 15-foot climb wall, incline/decline monkey bars, a balance beam, a grid-run, hurdles and more; and a 230-yard course that boasts 13 different strength obstacles, such as a kettle ball swing, tire flip, and farmer\u2019s carry. The third competition tests fitness skills through a box jump, shuttle run and bench press contest.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who wins or loses and it\u2019s not about becoming a big name celebrity,\u201d said Rosen. \u201cJust competing gives you a sense of accomplishment. You compete at Tri-Fitness and you will push yourself to your limit. I promise.\u201d\n\npguzzo@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7606", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 10 Nov 2013 21:01:42 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Mark Consuelos and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson sculpted the physiques that made them famous actors at the same Tampa gym.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Mark Consuelos and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson sculpted the physiques that made them famous actors at the same Tampa gym.", "title": "Celeb-driven Tampa gym lives on with fitness competition", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/celeb-driven-tampa-gym-lives-on-with-fitness-competition-20131110/", "image": {"width": 2796, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131110/ARTICLE/131119922/EP/1/1/EP-131119922.jpg", "height": 2368}, "updated_time": "2013-11-11T07:42:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Mark Consuelos and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson sculpted the physiques that made them famous actors at the same Tampa gym.", "title": "Celeb-driven Tampa gym lives on with fitness competition", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131110/ARTICLE/131119922/AR/0/AR-131119922.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-10T21:01:42Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T07:42:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "wrestling"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb298\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe were lucky if he turned the air conditioning on,\u201d quipped Aaron Brown, former Buccaneer and longtime Boddy Shoppe member.\nHis nephew Milton built the muscle at The Boddy Shoppe that turned him into a Special Olympics champion.\n\u201cWhat happened at The Boddy Shoppe, stayed at The Boddy Shoppe.\u201dRosen stayed tight-lipped, too.\nTAMPA \u2014 Mark Consuelos and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson sculpted the physiques that made them famous actors at the same Tampa gym.\nThe third competition tests fitness skills through a box jump, shuttle run and bench press contest."}
