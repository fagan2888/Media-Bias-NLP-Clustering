Original writeup is below:\n\nElectronic cigarettes are creating a frenzy among politicians, health experts, and the media. Local banson using e-cigarettes indoors are popping up all over the country, and many interest groups are clamoring for top-down FDA regulations, which are expected to be released in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cE-Cigarettes currently exist in a complete no-man\u2019s land,\u201d says Heather Wipfli, associate director for the USC Institute for Global Health. Skeptics such as Wipfli worry about the lack of long-term data available because the product is so new.\n\nBut according to the Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association\u2019s Greg Conley, calls for regulation are \"a perverse interpretation of the precautionary principle.\u201d The precautionary principle holds that until all possible risks are assessed, new technologies shouldn't be allowed to move forward.\n\nConley points to preliminary studies, like this one from Drexel University, which confirm these smokeless, tobacco-less, tar-less products are not a cause for concern - or at least not a cause for the same concerns that accompany traditional cigarettes and second-hand smoke.\n\n\u201cThat [Drexel University] professor concluded that there was absolutely no worry about risks to bystanders from e-cigarette vapor,\u201d says Conley.\n\nThe ingredients of e-cigarettes certainly have very little in common with tobacco cigarettes. Nicotine, the only ingredient found in both products, is mainly used to wean smokers off traditional cigarettes and is not one of the harm-inducing ingredients associated with lung cancer in smokers. The other ingredients in the \u201ce-juice\u201d at the core of e-cigarettes are propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and food flavorings\u2014 all of which are used in other food products.\n\n\u201cAll we are doing is steaming up food ingredients to create a vapor,\u201d says Ed Refuerzo, co-owner of The Vape Studio in West Los Angeles. The Vape Studio is one of the many boutique e-cigarette shops popping up that might be significantly affected or even shut down by both local legislation and FDA regulations.\n\nConley says it's the currently unregulated customizability of the e-juice that allows these small businesses to thrive. \u201cThe availability of liquids is what is allowing a lot of these small stores to open and prosper because they are able to mix their own liquid and sell it to consumers without having to go through a big manufacturing process,\u201d says Conley.\n\nThe higher costs of complying with regulations would most likely be passed on to consumers, which would impact people who are looking towards e-cigarettes as an effective way to quit smoking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using technology, and that\u2019s what we do in America, we use technology to solve really complicated problems,\u201d says Craig Weiss, president and CEO of NJOY. NJOY is a leading manufacturer of electronic cigarettes - and a donor to Reason Foundation, the nonprofit that publishes Reason TV. Weiss says that despite regulations, the potential of the industry is only just starting to be realized.\n\n\u201cThe electronic industry is growing at quite a dramatic pace. It\u2019s more than doubled each of the last four or five years,\" says Weiss. \"This piece of technology could have such an potential impact on the world.\u201d\n\nAbout 6 minutes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/09/reason-tv-replaye-cigarettes-second-hand", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "On Tuesday, the Los Angeles city council joined a growing list of city governments that have banned e-cigarette use in parks, restaurants, and most workplaces.", "title": "E-Cigarettes: Second-Hand Smoke, Vaping, and the Price of FDA Regulations"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday, the Los Angeles city council joined a growing list\nof city governments that have banned e-cigarette use in parks,\nrestaurants, and most workplaces.\nThe decision came after a heated debate at the \nCity Council that highlighted the backlash smokeless cigarettes\nhave generated as their popularity grows.
