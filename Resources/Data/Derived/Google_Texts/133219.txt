Chest pain? Your heart knows who to call



MANCHESTER - Nashua resident Robert Pelletier's ailing heart is a mere cell phone call away from his cardiac physician.



Pelletier, who suffers from congestive heart failure, was among the first residents in northern New England to have a wireless sensor installed in his heart's pulmonary artery.



The sensor is part of an early warning system that allows Pelletier's physician, sitting half a county away in Manchester, to adjust medication levels based upon sensor readings.

..

Catholic Medical Center and Pelletier hope the sensor will keep him healthy and out of the hospital.



"It's just absolutely a dream. I love it," said Pelletier, who is 48 and comes from a family with a history of heart problems. He had his first heart attack at 29.

..

Earlier this month, CMC announced that its New England Heart and Vascular Institute installed CardioMEMS HF Systems in two patients on March 5. CMC was the first hospital in northern New England to do so, the hospital said.

..

Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the CardioMEMS System, which was developed by St. Jude Medical Inc. Medicare allows a maximum charge of $8,875 for the sensor system.



The sensor system also benefits CMC. Under the Obamacare health law, hospitals are penalized when heart patients are readmitted.

..

The two-device system involves installation of a paperclip-sized wireless sensor in a the heart's pulmonary artery.



There, increased blood pressure is an early warning sign of complications such as swelling, weight gain and gasping for air that can lead to a hospitalization, said Dr. Robert Capodilupo, who directs the Institute's Heart Failure Program.

..

He said ideal candidates for the sensor have recurring symptoms and hospitalizations.



Daily, Pelletier transmits readings from the sensor to his a doctor, who can adjust medication to address the fluid build-up that causes the symptoms. Ideally, the additional medication will prevent a hospitalization.

..

Pelletier said he is hospitalized about once every five weeks, when his body builds up fluids and his heart cannot circulate them. Hospital stays last about four days, and Pelletier is on a strong, intravenous diuretic.

..

"Right off the bat in the hospital, I get too wound up," Pelletier said, who adds he can end up acting like a jerk.



"At that point, you're behind the eight ball," Capodilupo said about hospitalizations. "We're trying to get ahead of the eight ball."

..

Doctors needed 30 minutes to implant the sensor in one patient; an hour in the other, Capodilupo said. The procedure takes place in the CMC catheter lab.



A surgeon makes a small incision in a leg vein and guides the device into place with an X-ray.

..

The sensor itself doesn't transmit data to cardiac physicians. Patients lie on a special pillow that is connected to a transmitter, which relays the data through a cellular signal.



The system is approved for the approximately 1.4 million U.S. residents with Level III designation of congestive heart failure, the second most severe designation.

..

Such patients face about a 30 percent mortality rate within a year, and they are often subject to frequent trips to the hospital, Capodilupo said.



In clinical trials, hospital admissions fell 37 percent.
