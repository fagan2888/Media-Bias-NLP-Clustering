Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service officer Sean Smith, and security officers Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty\n\nWednesday marks the 12-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks\u2014and the first anniversary of the Benghazi, Libya, terror attack that left four Americans dead, including ambassador Christopher Stevens. It's a tragedy that partisans have exploited ever since, trying to create an explosive Obama scandal (\"Watergate and Iran-Contra together and multiply it times maybe 10 or so,\" as GOP Rep. Steve King described it) that quite frankly just isn't there.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Heritage Foundation, one of DC's conservative think tanks, hosted an event marking the anniversary of Benghazi-gate. Allen West\u2014the former congressman and one-term tea party hero who plays fast and loose with facts\u2014delivered the keynote. He discussed the supposed cover-up perpetrated by high-ranking officials (a claim hyped loudly by GOP lawmakers, Fox News, and other right-wing news outlets), as well as the \"unintended consequences\" of intervening in Libya\u2014as well as Syria. \"You cannot talk about Syria unless you talk about what occurred in Libya,\" West said.\n\n\"I find it very hypocritical that at this moment in time the American people are being told that they have a moral obligation to go into Syria because of the chemical gas attacks, yet I never heard the same type of indignation coming from the president, nor this administration, when our national security interests were attacked\" in Benghazi, he added toward the end of his address. \"If there was a time to commit the United States forces to do something, that would've been the time. I guarantee you, you would've had old retirees like me saying, 'I'll suit up, I'll go.'\"", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Republicans are eager to link the 2012 Libya attack to the debate over whether we attack Assad.", "title": "Latest GOP Meme: Obama Can't Be Trusted On Syria Because\u2026#Benghazi", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/09/benghazi-syria-allen-west-conservative-talking-point", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/benghazi-transfer-ceremony-wide.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/09/benghazi-syria-allen-west-conservative-talking-point", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/benghazi-transfer-ceremony-wide.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/benghazi-transfer-ceremony-wide.jpg"}, "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Latest GOP Meme: Obama Can't Be Trusted On Syria Because\u2026#Benghazi"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress,Foreign+Policy,International,Media,The+Right,Top+Stories", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda81f\"", "article_summary": "\"You cannot talk about Syria unless you talk about what occurred in Libya,\" West said.\nI guarantee you, you would've had old retirees like me saying, 'I'll suit up, I'll go.'\"\nOn Tuesday, the Heritage Foundation, one of DC's conservative think tanks, hosted an event marking the anniversary of Benghazi-gate.\n\"If there was a time to commit the United States forces to do something, that would've been the time.\nAllen West\u2014the former congressman and one-term tea party hero who plays fast and loose with facts\u2014delivered the keynote."}
