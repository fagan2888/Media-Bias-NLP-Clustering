As I explained at the time:\n\nHere\u2019s my favorite Eric Cantor story. At the Republican Convention in 2008, I approached Cantor after an event, introduced myself as a constituent, and told him where I lived. It\u2019s a tiny place, more of a wide spot in the road than an actual town, so this was partly a test to see how well Cantor knew his own district. I turns out that he did recognize the town, and to prove it, he started to tell me about how he had worked on getting us an earmark for a local Civil War battlefield park. An earmark, mind you, just after Republicans had officially renounced earmarks in an attempt to appease small-government types. Cantor suddenly realized this and literally stopped himself in mid-sentence. Then he hastily added: \u201cBut we don\u2019t do that any more.\u201d\n\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, was Eric Cantor: the soul of an establishment machine politician, with the \u201cmessaging\u201d of the small-government conservatives grafted uneasily on top of it.\n\nSo yes, you can now tear up all those articles pronouncing the death of the Tea Party movement, because this is the essence of what the Tea Party is about: letting the establishment know that they have to do more than offer lip service to a small-government agenda, that we expect them to actually mean it.\n\nSo this was an indication that the swing to the right was so strong it could even take down insufficiently committed Republicans.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t just a vague, anti-establishment, throw-the-bums-out sentiment. It was directed much more strongly against Democrats and particularly against the president.\n\nThis is the year when the public began to give up on President Obama and concluded that he has been a failure as president. In September, I noted some revealing poll results.\n\nA poll released last week had some pretty bad news for congressional Democrats heading into the midterm elections. But buried in the poll numbers was a figure that just might constitute an even more important turning point.\n\nRespondents were asked: \u201cOn balance, do you feel that Obama\u2019s presidency so far has been more of a success or more of a failure?\u201d More than half, 52%, said \u201cfailure.\u201d Only 42% said \u201csuccess.\u201d And it gets worse. Only 22% were \u201cstrongly\u201d convinced Obama is a success, while 39% are strongly convinced he\u2019s a failure. And the American people have pretty much made up their minds on this; only 6% of respondents had no clear opinion\u2026.\n\nOn behalf of long-time critics of Obama, let me say to the American people: welcome to our world.\n\nI went on to count down all the valid reasons for marking Obama down as a failed president. Morning again in America this ain\u2019t.\n\nThe loss of confidence in the president and his party is right on schedule. It tends to happen in an administration\u2019s sixth year, as with George W. Bush. But Bush\u2019s \u201cshellacking\u201d in the 2006 midterms also, ironically, contained the seeds of this year\u2019s blowout, because Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid built their majority on inherently unstable foundations. I discussed how that strategy had its inevitable denouement this year.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember how Democrats bounced back in 2006, after my premature report of their demise: Nancy Pelosi went out and recruited a bunch of conservative Southern Democrats to run for seats in the House. You can see why that strategy ultimately failed. When they got to Washington, the role of these \u201cconservative Democrats\u201d was not to stand for the centrist policies they had campaigned on. Their role was to be foot soldiers for Pelosi and Ted Kennedy and Barney Frank and the rest of the far-left Democratic leadership. Their job was to lay down their political lives in order to cast partisan votes on legislation like ObamaCare.\n\nThe result was that most of these recruits got wiped out in 2010, and the last of them were mopped up this year.\n\nThere was a lot of crowing by Democrats in the past few election cycles that the Republicans were becoming a mere \u201cregional party\u201d that could only win majorities in the South. But the actual truth is that Democrats are being shut out of whole regions. This midterm election saw the defeat of the last white Southern Democrat in the House of Representatives. If Mary Landrieu loses her run-off in Louisiana [update: she lost], they will be extinct in the Senate, too.\n\nWhat makes this all the more hopeful is the other electoral trend this year.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Republicans have a new crop of talented young politicians. It\u2019s the fact that so many of them are from the three demographic groups on which Democrats have staked their future: blacks, Hispanic voters, and younger women.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so delicious to see Jon Stewart melting down over the new crop of Republican winners, who give the lie to the caricature of the Republicans as the party of old white men.\n\nThis gets us closer to the day I\u2019ve been working toward, when questions about free markets and the welfare state are finally de-racialized, and the Democratic Party loses its death grip on these voting blocs.\n\nBut the rise of black and Hispanic Republicans is more of a future promise at this point. What is much more certain is the implications of the enormous Republican wave on the state level.\n\nRepublicans now hold both the governorship and legislative majorities in 23 states, 24 if Parnell pulls through in Alaska, which means that they have the ability to write their own agenda in nearly half the states in the union. Democrats can do the same in only seven states.\n\nRCP\u2019s David Byler puts that in perspective, showing how it reverses Democratic dominance at the state level through most of the 20th century, including up through the 1980s\u2026.\n\nThis has a big long-term impact because state and local governments are where rising young politicians gain experience, learn how to win elections and build a constituency, and establish the credentials they will use to rise to higher office. If Bill Clinton hadn\u2019t been able to get elected as governor of Arkansas, for example, he would have had no basis to run for president. So just think how many young Democrats are now being shut out of the first steps of their political careers.\n\nThis election produced a whole roster of rising stars for the Republicans: Mia Love, Tim Scott, Joni Ernst, Tom Cotton, Elise Stefanik, and so on. Meanwhile, the Democrats had pinned their hopes on Wendy Davis\u2019s campaign for governor of Texas. Instead, she went down to an ignominious defeat in one of the worst-run campaigns in the country, and Davis\u2019s state Senate seat was taken by a Tea Party activist as Republicans continue their march toward a supermajority in the Texas legislature\u2026.\n\nThat leaves the Democrats with basically no younger generation of leaders emerging, while the party\u2019s fate is increasingly dependent on a bunch of septuagenarians.\n\nWhile some on the left are just now starting to realize how big a disaster this is, I went so far as to re-institute my Democratic Party Death Watch.\n\nI am aware of the checkered history of predictions of a \u201cpermanent majority,\u201d and I acknowledge that the two major parties\u2019 fortunes could quickly change, as they have done quite recently, from a big Republican victory in 2004, to huge Republican defeats, and back to big Republican victories again.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Democratic Party is really going to die quite yet. That\u2019s partly because its collectivist, big-government ideology still enjoys so many reserves of support in the universities, in the media, and in the entertainment industry. It\u2019s also because political parties have a tendency to eventually adapt and change the way they present themselves to voters (as Bill Clinton briefly did for Democrats in the 1990s).\n\nAs for those reserves of support in big institutions, I suspect that the left has achieved such a high degree of saturation, particularly in Hollywood and the universities, that they have reached the point of diminishing returns. Any reversion to the mean\u2014the current situation is by no means normal by historical standards\u2014and the left risks losing these commanding heights of the culture.\n\nAs for the Democrats adapting their message to appeal to the voters\u2014I think that is the most devastating implication of the Democratic wipeout on the state level. There have been a lot of calls recently to bring back the Truman Democrats. But where are you going to find them these days? They\u2019ve all been voted out of office\u2014or they chose to go into the Republican Party, instead.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot harder to tack back to the center when all of your politicians represent urban, coastal districts with far-left constituents. Inside this far-left bubble, your rising political stars are rewarded for taking positions that antagonize the rest of the country while pandering to the sensibilities of the far left.\n\nPresident Obama is one of those stars, and this is precisely how he has reacted to the electoral defeat\u2014not by seeking to moderate his positions and find common ground with the new Republican Congress, but by immediately announcing a gift to his base, his unilateral, de facto amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s recent rapprochement with the Castros\u2019 Cuba, in which he is pushing for an end to our embargo, is another example. There is certainly an argument to be made that the embargo is ineffective, that Cuba no longer poses the urgent threat it did during the Cold War, and so on. But politically, there was only one faction that was agitating for this move: the far left, which still perversely treats Cuba like it\u2019s some kind of workers\u2019 paradise.\n\nAs for the rest of the country, the move rubs a lot of us the wrong way. As the joke goes, there\u2019s an old Vulcan proverb: Only Nixon can go to China. Nixon could seek a rapprochement with Mao\u2019s China (and use them as a counterbalance against the Russians) because he had a reputation as a fierce anti-Communist. Well, if only Nixon could go to Cuba, Barack Obama is no Nixon. As I observed last year, the essence of his foreign policy is the premise that America has all the wrong allies. So he has set out to downgrade our alliances with countries like Britain, Poland, and Israel, while seeking out friendly relations with Russia, Iran, and now Cuba. This is the worst context in which to pursue a loosening of the embargo.\n\nWhile their top leader is devoting all of his effort making appeals to the base, Democrats are also getting a lot of terrible advice to abandon the South altogether.\n\nThis recently led Walter Russell Mead to describe Democrats as living in a cocoon: \u201cWithin the magic circle, liberal ideas have never been more firmly entrenched and less contested. Increasingly, liberals live in a world in which certain ideas are becoming ever more axiomatic and unquestioned even if, outside the walls, those same ideas often seem outlandish.\u201d The same thing is happening politically. The Democrats have more and more leaders who can rest assured of perpetual re-election in safe left-leaning districts\u2014but who regard rural areas and the South as alien territory.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t realize yet is that giving up on the South will affect them even within their own \u201cbubble.\u201d Writing off rural Southerners and making no effort to speak to them in a language that appeals to them will further alienate people in left-leaning \u201cblue states\u201d who sympathize with traditional values and ideals like self-reliance. This is similar to my observation about the \u201cReverse Southern Strategy.\u201d By making race-baiting the centerpiece of their electoral strategy, the Democrats hope to keep their death grip on the minority vote\u2014yet this is offset by an accelerating exodus of blue-collar whites to the Republicans. Similarly, by doubling down on contempt for the South and for traditional American values, Democrats accelerate the exodus of their old blue-collar base in the cities.\n\nConsider, for example, the current predicament of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. A lifelong advocate for the far left, de Blasio responded to street protests over the police killing of Eric Garner by expressing sympathy for the protests and seeming to take their side against the police. Then a black Muslim career criminal decided to take revenge for Garner\u2014and act on the protesters\u2019 most inflammatory rhetoric\u2014by ambushing and killing two New York City police. The police are now practically in revolt against the mayor and it is possible he will be forced to resign.\n\nSo far, though, the Democrats seem to be heedless of the costs of betting everything on the far-left base while driving away their own blue-collar and middle class constituents. This is a big story to look for in the next year, and especially in 2016.\n\nThe Democratic Party Death Watch is definitely back on.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 07:58:47 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "What the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t realize yet is that alienating the South will hurt them even in their \"blue state\" bubble.
