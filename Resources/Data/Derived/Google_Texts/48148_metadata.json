Roberts, Jr., was sworn in as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. So the current Term of the U.S. Supreme Court, October Term 2015, marks ten years of the Roberts Court.\n\nIt\u2019s customary to mark SCOTUS time by chief justices \u2014 e.g., the Warren Court, the Rehnquist Court \u2014 but there\u2019s a good case to be made that we\u2019re really dealing with the Kennedy Court, due to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s status as the most influential member of SCOTUS. This was one among many subjects tackled in a fascinating and fun discussion at the Federalist Society\u2019s 2015 National Lawyers Convention, featuring the following impressive panelists:\n\nJudge Carlos T. Bea (moderator), U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit;\n\n(moderator), U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; Michael A. Carvin , partner, Jones Day;\n\n, partner, Jones Day; Jan Crawford , political correspondent and chief legal correspondent, CBS News;\n\n, political correspondent and chief legal correspondent, CBS News; Steven J. Duffield , former chief counsel, Senator Jon Kyl; and\n\n, former chief counsel, Senator Jon Kyl; and Professor Michael S. Paulsen, University of St. Thomas School of Law.\n\nThe discussion began with talk of what the public expected from John Roberts as a justice. Steven Duffield, who worked for Senator Kyl when Roberts was nominated, pointed out that Republicans had just 55 votes in the Senate at the time. There were concerns among Republicans on Capitol Hill of a possible filibuster. But in the end, after Roberts turned in an excellent performance at his confirmation hearings, he was comfortably confirmed by a vote of 78-22.\n\nJan Crawford covered the Roberts nomination as a journalist (and wrote about it in her excellent book, Supreme Conflict (affiliate link)). When Roberts was nominated, she felt confident that he would be a strong judicial conservative \u2014 unlike, say, Justice David H. Souter.\n\n(Crawford quipped that Souter \u201clooked conservative \u2014 he wore three-piece suits and was really polite \u2014 but he had no real philosophy.\u201d She also emphasized a point she has made time and time again regarding Justice Clarence Thomas, namely, that he has a strong and distinctive conservative jurisprudence and is far from a follower of Justice Antonin Scalia. She declared \u2014 to applause from the Fed Soc crowd \u2014 that Justice Thomas is \u201cthe most egregiously mischaracterized legal figure\u201d of our generation, and that the treatment he receives in the media is \u201coutrageous.\u201d)\n\nBack in 2005, some of her fellow journalists disagreed with Crawford\u2019s evaluation of John Roberts as a solid conservative. He was so nice to reporters \u2014 he was friendly and charming when he called them on their cell phones \u2014 that they couldn\u2019t believe he was a true conservative. After some of his snarky memos from the Reagan White House got released, Crawford told her colleagues, \u201cSee, I told you so! He\u2019s really conservative.\u201d\n\nBut ten years into his tenure, can we say Chief Justice Roberts is a solid conservative? That\u2019s not clear; the Chief Justice \u201cdefies labels\u201d and it\u2019s too early to evaluate his legacy, according to Crawford. The real \u201chome run\u201d for conservatives among George W. Bush nominees was not Chief Justice Roberts, she said, but Justice Samuel A. Alito. Crawford praised Justice Alito for his \u201cbeautifully written\u201d opinions and his \u201cpenetrating,\u201d \u201cdifferent and unexpected\u201d questions at oral argument. (I happen to agree with her; for my money, the best questioners at oral argument are Justice Alito and Justice Elena Kagan.)\n\nIn contrast to Jan Crawford, who seemed to hedge a bit on the Chief, Michael Carvin of Jones Day had no problem offering a decisive evaluation of Chief Justice Roberts. Suffice it to say that Carvin\u2019s not a huge fan. Prior to 2005, according to Carvin, we were dealing with the \u201cKennedy/O\u2019Connor Court,\u201d with Justice Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor casting the decisive swing votes (although AMK doesn\u2019t like it when people call him a swing voter). Today it\u2019s the \u201cKennedy Court\u201d \u2014 but Carvin fears it could become the \u201cKennedy/Roberts Court\u201d if Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s Affordable Care Act jurisprudence spreads to other areas. (Recall that Carvin argued against the ACA aka Obamacare in both NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell, where the Chief voted against his client both times.)\n\nLike Crawford, Mike Carvin had plenty of good things to say about Justice Alito. When Justice Alito replaced Justice O\u2019Connor, \u201ca principled conservative replaced a suburban Republican state legislator.\u201d To the extent that in the past decade the Supreme Court has made what Carvin called \u201cbaby steps towards the return to the rule of law,\u201d Justice Alito deserves much of the credit. But, cautioned Carvin, \u201cif the election goes wrong next year, none of that will matter, and we will all descend into a hellish existence from which we will never emerge.\u201d\n\nCarvin\u2019s co-panelists agreed on the importance of the 2016 presidential election for the composition of the Supreme Court. Professor Michael Paulsen, who concurred on the significance of the Alito/O\u2019Connor switch, pointed out that on Inauguration Day in 2017, three justices will be in their eighties \u2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (83), Justice Scalia (80), and Justice Kennedy (80) \u2014 and a fourth, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, will be in his late 70s (78, to be specific).\n\nSo the next president, whoever he (or she!) might be, \u201ccould well get two, three, possibly four appointments\u201d to the Supreme Court, according to Jan Crawford.\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts has been frustrating for many conservatives,\u201d Crawford acknowledged. But if a certain someone wins the White House, Chief Justice Roberts \u201cmay well be writing a lot more dissents on the other side.\u201d\n\n( Disclosure : I sometimes speak to Federalist Society chapters, but I did not participate in the National Lawyers Convention as a speaker.)\n\nTen Years of the Roberts Court [Federalist Society via YouTube]\n\n2015 National Lawyers Convention Schedule [Federalist Society for Law & Public Policy Studies]\n\nHillary Clinton, if president, could appoint 4 Supreme Court justices [Washington Times]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Should conservatives and libertarians be delighted or disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court at this milestone?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "Author": "David Lat", "og": {"site_name": "Above the Law", "description": "Should conservatives and libertarians be delighted or disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court at this milestone?", "title": "Ten Years Of The Roberts Court", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCOTUS-Supreme-Court-photo-by-David-Lat.jpg", "url": "http://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/ten-years-of-the-roberts-court/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCOTUS-Supreme-Court-photo-by-David-Lat.jpg", "description": "Should conservatives and libertarians be delighted or disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court at this milestone?", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669, "pages": 42029395601}, "keywords": "2015 National Lawyers Convention, Anthony Kennedy, Anthony M.
