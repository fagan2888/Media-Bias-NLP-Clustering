(Photo: File)\n\nThis week, the U.S. Senate's Finance Committee held a hearing on tax reform \u2014 with \"corporate inversions\" at the center of their agenda.\n\n\"Corporate tax-dodging\" would be a more appropriate term. A corporate inversion is when a corporation moves its headquarters to a \"low-tax haven\" country while continuing business as usual in the country where it reaps most of its profits.\n\nSenator Grassley, who sits on the Finance Committee, said in 2002 that this gimmick equates to a corporation setting up a filing cabinet and mailbox overseas.\n\nFast forward 12 years and a Great Recession, and our country has yet to rein in these corporate tax-dodgers. Walgreens, Iowa's largest drugstore chain, is considering such a move to Switzerland in the coming weeks.\n\nWalgreens, which profits handsomely from Medicaid and Medicare, will be able to dodge more than $4 billion in taxes over five years should it decide to set up a mailbox and filing cabinet overseas.\n\nEnough is enough. Everyday Iowans and the American people are upset by this hypocrisy. And our elected officials are starting to take notice.\n\nSenator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced the \"Stop Corporate Tax Inversions Act of 2014\". Senator Grassley, who in 2002 said that \"these expatriations aren't illegal\u2026 but they're sure immoral\", should sign on as a co-sponsor to Levin's bill immediately.\n\nCorporate inversions are immoral, unpatriotic, and straining our public services and basic government functions. It's time for Senator Grassley, the Senate Finance Committee and the rest of Congress to put an end to them now.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nHugh Espey is executive director of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1rBcRbB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The U.S. Senate's Finance Committee held a hearing on tax reform \u2014 with \"corporate inversions\" at the center of their agenda.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The U.S. Senate's Finance Committee held a hearing on tax reform \u2014 with \"corporate inversions\" at the center of their agenda.", "title": "Why would Walgreens move its headquarters to Switzerland?", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/abetteriowa/2014/07/23/why-would-walgreens-want-to-move-its-headquarters-to-switzerland/13040651/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Senate's Finance Committee held a hearing on tax reform \u2014 with \"corporate inversions\" at the center of their agenda.", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a32cd2d332dee4b15a4932b0702ecb472569bdf/r=x643&c=640x640/http/assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/fbd42ae8d5d0ce75e8d70139599bf4e69650eebe/c=133-0-666-533/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg", "title": "Why would Walgreens move its headquarters to Switzerland?", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Senate", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Senate", "title": "Why would Walgreens move its headquarters to Switzerland?", "author": "Hugh Espey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/abetteriowa", "image-3-4": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/2168e8156a293f86bdda353166e7c8c71c4e6e4b/c=136-0-536-533/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/fbd42ae8d5d0ce75e8d70139599bf4e69650eebe/c=133-0-666-533/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/6b6a64a97a42a6747830a8f5ddb57ae69ae7f23c/c=42-0-750-533/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/78e13c4d25b51143781572f7873d63f3fa38723d/r=x633&c=1200x630/http/assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/9a6c51d16fd9ba067bd88984d421b8d5cc9b0ec4/c=0-0-800-451/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-30T18:34:53.590000-05:00", "shorthed": "Why would Walgreens want to move its headquarters to Switzerland?", "articleid": 13040651, "image-16-9": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/9a6c51d16fd9ba067bd88984d421b8d5cc9b0ec4/c=0-0-800-451/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://assets.gannettdigital.com/-mm-/8e87bbb01bac9b52df4c8acfbdec42d8f4c2eb4b/c=221-0-518-533/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/01/12/espey.hugh.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1059\"", "article_summary": "It's time for Senator Grassley, the Senate Finance Committee and the rest of Congress to put an end to them now.\nWalgreens, Iowa's largest drugstore chain, is considering such a move to Switzerland in the coming weeks.\n(Photo: File)This week, the U.S. Senate's Finance Committee held a hearing on tax reform \u2014 with \"corporate inversions\" at the center of their agenda.\nCorporate inversions are immoral, unpatriotic, and straining our public services and basic government functions.\nSenator Grassley, who in 2002 said that \"these expatriations aren't illegal\u2026 but they're sure immoral\", should sign on as a co-sponsor to Levin's bill immediately."}
