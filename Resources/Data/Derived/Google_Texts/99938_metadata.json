While his 10 steals lead the team and his 10.5 points a game ranks fourth, he leads the team in turnovers with 25.\n\n\u201cThe more games I play, I know I have to get the turnovers down,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m a positive team player, a good defender, and I try to create shots for the other guys on the team by getting as many assists as I can.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019 path to UNC crossed some obstacles. When he came out of Canyon Spring High School in Las Vegas, Davis experienced the recruiting rush when his scoring average of 23.1 points per game ranked second among high school players in Nevada. He originally made a commitment to Eastern Washington, but he changed his mind.\n\n\u201cI felt I was rushed and there was a lot of miscommunication in the recruiting process,\u201d Davis said. \u201cMy older brother Gerad Davis got involved and there was talk about a package deal.\u201d\n\nJordan Davis walked away.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take my time and find a coaching staff and a school that allowed me to feel comfortable,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI have no regrets.\u201d\n\nDavis says he plays with a chip on his shoulder, maybe a reflection of where he grew up.\n\n\u201cI lived in a rough area,\u201d he said, \u201cand basketball was my outlet.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or @irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Northern Colorado freshman guard Jordan Davis playing with a chip on his shoulder", "title": "Northern Colorado freshman guard Jordan Davis playing with a chip on his shoulder", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/northern-colorado-freshman-guard-jordan-davis-playing-with-a-chip-on-his-shoulder/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__bec384c79bed2635890f6a7067004d5ap1.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__bec384c79bed2635890f6a7067004d5ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T14:37:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:47:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Bears are off to a 2-6 start, but over the past four games, Davis has shown signs that he\u2019s making a quick transition from high school to college.\n\u201cI have no regrets.\u201dDavis says he plays with a chip on his shoulder, maybe a reflection of where he grew up.\nWhile his 10 steals lead the team and his 10.5 points a game ranks fourth, he leads the team in turnovers with 25.\nWhen he came out of Canyon Spring High School in Las Vegas, Davis experienced the recruiting rush when his scoring average of 23.1 points per game ranked second among high school players in Nevada.\n\u201cMy older brother Gerad Davis got involved and there was talk about a package deal.\u201dJordan Davis walked away."}
