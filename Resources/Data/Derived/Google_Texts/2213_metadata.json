This one, in far west\u00adern Ken\u00adtucky, is one of them.\n\nThe in\u00adcum\u00adbent Demo\u00adcrat, Rep. Will Cour\u00adsey, has been hampered by a law\u00adsuit al\u00adleging sexu\u00adally in\u00adap\u00adpro\u00adpri\u00adate be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador. He denies the al\u00adleg\u00ada\u00adtions and blames Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans for en\u00adga\u00adging in tac\u00adtics that are \u201cfe\u00adces of the spe\u00adcies of poultry.\u201d His GOP op\u00adpon\u00adent, Keith Trav\u00adis, says he\u2019s try\u00ading to turn Mar\u00adshall County red at the state\u00adhouse for the first time since the mid-1800s. \u201cI just felt like, after 172 years, we ought to at least make that op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity avail\u00adable,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s small-town Amer\u00adic\u00adan polit\u00adics with big-time na\u00adtion\u00adal con\u00adsequences for a top 2016 pro\u00adspect: Rand Paul. This race, along with a hand\u00adful of oth\u00aders across Ken\u00adtucky, could de\u00adterm\u00adine wheth\u00ader or not Paul is al\u00adlowed to run for pres\u00adid\u00adent and for Sen\u00adate at the same time, something he\u2019s in\u00addic\u00adated he\u2019s de\u00adterm\u00adined to do.\n\nUn\u00adder cur\u00adrent Ken\u00adtucky law, Paul must choose to be on the bal\u00adlot for one or the oth\u00ader. His Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan al\u00adlies in the Ken\u00adtucky state Sen\u00adate have already pushed through a meas\u00adure to let him run for both, but it has lan\u00adguished in the state\u2019s Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic-con\u00adtrolled House.\n\n\u201cOur po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion is that a man who can\u2019t de\u00adcide which of\u00adfice to run for isn\u2019t fit for either of\u00adfice,\u201d said Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Ken\u00adtucky House Speak\u00ader Greg Stumbo. \u201cI don\u2019t think that bill will ever see the light of day as long as I hold the gavel.\u201d\n\nAnd so Paul and his fel\u00adlow Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are try\u00ading to pry it from Stumbo\u2019s hands. That\u2019s where the Mar\u00adshall County show\u00addown comes in. It\u2019s one of the top tar\u00adgets for Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans as they try to take con\u00adtrol of what is the last re\u00admain\u00ading Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic-held le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive body in the South.\n\n\u201cThis is the Battle of Hast\u00adings in Ken\u00adtucky,\u201d said Adam Edelen, the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic state aud\u00adit\u00ador. \u201cAnd Rand Paul is ex\u00adtraordin\u00adary in\u00advolved. Not be\u00adcause I think he\u2019s par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly per\u00adson\u00adally in\u00adves\u00adted in any policy agenda but be\u00adcause of his own na\u00adtion\u00adal am\u00adbi\u00adtions.\u201d\n\nAlready, Paul has starred in a liv\u00ading-room fun\u00addraiser for one can\u00addid\u00adate and co\u00adhos\u00adted a Ju\u00adly fun\u00addraiser in Wash\u00ading\u00adton for the party\u2019s state\u00adhouse ef\u00adforts, and he has five fun\u00addraisers for can\u00addid\u00adates sched\u00aduled between Au\u00adgust and early Septem\u00adber. Paul\u2019s ad\u00advisers say he\u2019s also likely to dip in\u00adto his $3 mil\u00adlion cam\u00adpaign treas\u00adury (as he did in 2012) to fund a hand\u00adful of top GOP can\u00addid\u00adates.\n\nAny money he gives will go far in such low-dol\u00adlar le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive con\u00adtests. In one top-tier west\u00adern Ken\u00adtucky race, Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Rep. Ger\u00adald Watkins, had amassed a mere $26,000 as of mid-Ju\u00adly and doesn\u2019t even have a web\u00adsite. In\u00adstead, ger\u00adald\u00adwatkins.com re\u00addir\u00adects to the site of his chal\u00adlenger, where Randy Bridges says he\u2019ll need to buy some suits if the voters send him to the state\u00adhouse. As of mid-Ju\u00adly, Bridges had banked about $13,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re try\u00ading to help raise money for the can\u00addid\u00adates and cam\u00adpaign for the can\u00addid\u00adates and draw as much at\u00adten\u00adtion as we can,\u201d Paul told Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal, after keynot\u00ading a re\u00adcent din\u00adner in Mar\u00adshall County that be\u00adnefited loc\u00adal GOP ef\u00adforts. Flip\u00adping the House is \u201creally im\u00adport\u00adant,\u201d he said, not just for him but Ken\u00adtucky\u2019s flag\u00adging eco\u00adnomy.\n\nAs for the bill that would al\u00adlow run\u00adning for mul\u00adtiple of\u00adfices, Paul ad\u00added, \u201cI won\u2019t say that it\u2019s not a con\u00adsid\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion.\u201d\n\nPaul would hardly be the first can\u00addid\u00adate to seek reelec\u00adtion and na\u00adtion\u00adal of\u00adfice at the same time; Paul Ry\u00adan did so in 2012, as did Joe Biden in 2008. But neither Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin nor Delaware law barred the prac\u00adtice, un\u00adlike Ken\u00adtucky. The closest ana\u00adlog may be Sen. Lyn\u00addon John\u00adson, who, in 1960, had Texas law changed so he could be on the na\u00adtion\u00adal tick\u00adet and also stand for reelec\u00adtion.\n\nPaul\u2019s polit\u00adic\u00adal team has in\u00addic\u00adated that he\u2019s will\u00ading to go to court to over\u00adturn the cur\u00adrent law, though it\u2019s un\u00adclear he would pre\u00advail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an open-and-shut case,\u201d said Daniel Tokaji, an elec\u00adtion-law ex\u00adpert and law pro\u00adfess\u00ador at Ohio State Uni\u00adversity. \u201cHe could win but I wouldn\u2019t bet money on it.\u201d\n\nRe\u00adgard\u00adless, su\u00ading for the right to seek two of\u00adfices sim\u00adul\u00adtan\u00adeously is an un\u00adap\u00adpeal\u00ading op\u00adtion for a politi\u00adcian with an out\u00adsider brand and who first ran for Sen\u00adate bash\u00ading ca\u00adreer politi\u00adcians. Paul\u2019s polit\u00adic\u00adal team sees oth\u00ader ways around the cur\u00adrent law, po\u00adten\u00adtially fil\u00ading for both races any\u00adway and for\u00adcing the sec\u00adret\u00adary of state to not let him ap\u00adpear twice, or not ap\u00adpear\u00ading on the pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial primary bal\u00adlot in Ken\u00adtucky but every\u00adwhere else.\n\nSen. Marco Ru\u00adbio faces a sim\u00adil\u00adar pre\u00addic\u00ada\u00adment as Flor\u00adida law bars be\u00ading on the bal\u00adlot twice and he is up for reelec\u00adtion in 2016 and con\u00adsidered a pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial con\u00adtender. Ru\u00adbio might have made it even harder for Paul when the sen\u00adat\u00ador from Flor\u00adida sug\u00adges\u00adted this spring that he likely wouldn\u2019t run for both. \u201cI think by and large when you choose to do something as big as that you\u2019ve really got to be fo\u00adcused on that, and not have an exit strategy,\u201d Ru\u00adbio told con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive ra\u00addio host Hugh He\u00adwitt.\n\nThe best op\u00adtion for Paul, then, is to help Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans seize the Ken\u00adtucky House, where Demo\u00adcrats cur\u00adrently oc\u00adcupy 54 of the 100 seats. With new dis\u00adtrict lines and a hand\u00adful of open seats, Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans hope to cap\u00adit\u00adal\u00adize on Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama\u2019s wild un\u00adpop\u00adular\u00adity in the more rur\u00adal and coal-pro\u00addu\u00adcing re\u00adgions of the state.\n\nTwo of the GOP\u2019s must-take seats in far west\u00adern Ken\u00adtucky be\u00adlong to Watkins and Cour\u00adsey, who said that Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans won\u2019t be able to na\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adize his race, no mat\u00adter how much they spend. \u201cThey Obama\u2019d and Pelosi\u2019d me\u201d in 2012 to no avail, he said, mo\u00adments after brag\u00adging about his \u201cA+\u201d Na\u00adtion\u00adal Rifle As\u00adso\u00adci\u00adation rat\u00ading. \u201cWe\u2019re Ken\u00adtucky Demo\u00adcrats and that\u2019s a dif\u00adfer\u00adent crit\u00adter al\u00adto\u00adgeth\u00ader.\u201d\n\nStumbo, too, in\u00adsisted he isn\u2019t scared about Paul\u2019s grow\u00ading in\u00advolve\u00adment, not\u00ading he re\u00adcently trav\u00adelled to Wash\u00ading\u00adton and se\u00adcured $1 mil\u00adlion in pledges to help keep the ma\u00adjor\u00adity. \u201cRand Paul\u2019s got friends in Wash\u00ading\u00adton. Guess what, so do we,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about money. It\u2019s kind of like snow\u2014once it gets above your knees, who cares how deep it gets?\u201d\n\nWhatever the out\u00adcome of these races, Ken\u00adtucky still has a Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic gov\u00adernor, Steve Be\u00ads\u00adhear, but state law lets a simple ma\u00adjor\u00adity of the Le\u00adgis\u00adlature over\u00adride any gubernat\u00adori\u00adal veto, so Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans real\u00adist\u00adic\u00adally only need a ma\u00adjor\u00adity of both cham\u00adbers to pass the Paul le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Sen\u00adat\u00ador Paul com\u00adment pub\u00adlicly that one of his in\u00adten\u00adtions is to flip the House,\u201d Be\u00ads\u00adhear said. \u201cMy in\u00adten\u00adtion is to make sure he\u2019s un\u00adsuc\u00adcess\u00adful.\u201d\n\nAs the last re\u00admain\u00ading Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic-con\u00adtrolled cham\u00adber in the South (not in\u00adclud\u00ading West Vir\u00adgin\u00adia), the Ken\u00adtucky House con\u00adtests are ex\u00adpec\u00adted to re\u00adceive an in\u00adfu\u00adsion of na\u00adtion\u00adal money, as well. \u201cThis is our top tar\u00adget in that re\u00adgion,\u201d said Justin Richards, polit\u00adic\u00adal dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan State Lead\u00ader\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adtee, which spends money on state le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive races.\n\nThis is ac\u00adtu\u00adally the third straight cycle Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have eyed con\u00adtrol of the lower Ken\u00adtucky cham\u00adber, gain\u00ading ground the last two cycles while still fall\u00ading short of the ma\u00adjor\u00adity. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s go\u00ading to get flipped is they\u2019re go\u00ading to get flipped off by Ken\u00adtucky voters,\u201d Stumbo said of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans. \u201cAs they did in \u201812 and as they did in \u201810.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "At stake in the statehouse races is Paul\u2019s ability to run both for president and Senate reelection in 2016.", "title": "The Obscure Kentucky Contests That Could Alter Rand Paul\u2019s 2016 Plans", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/41882/obscure-kentucky-contests-that-could-alter-rand-pauls-2016-plans", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/static/images/placeholder_square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/static/images/placeholder_square.jpg"}, "title": "The Obscure Kentucky Contests That Could Alter Rand Paul\u2019s 2016 Plans", "description": "At stake in the statehouse races is Paul\u2019s ability to run both for president and Senate reelection in 2016.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nationaljournal"}, "description": "At stake in the statehouse races is Paul\u2019s ability to run both for president and Senate reelection in 2016.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Un\u00adder cur\u00adrent Ken\u00adtucky law, Paul must choose to be on the bal\u00adlot for one or the oth\u00ader.\nIt\u2019s one of the top tar\u00adgets for Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans as they try to take con\u00adtrol of what is the last re\u00admain\u00ading Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic-held le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive body in the South.\n\u201cOur po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion is that a man who can\u2019t de\u00adcide which of\u00adfice to run for isn\u2019t fit for either of\u00adfice,\u201d said Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Ken\u00adtucky House Speak\u00ader Greg Stumbo.\nThe best op\u00adtion for Paul, then, is to help Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans seize the Ken\u00adtucky House, where Demo\u00adcrats cur\u00adrently oc\u00adcupy 54 of the 100 seats.\nIt\u2019s small-town Amer\u00adic\u00adan polit\u00adics with big-time na\u00adtion\u00adal con\u00adsequences for a top 2016 pro\u00adspect: Rand Paul."}
