These programs were designed to ease the expansion of Medicaid by providing insurance to low-income adults who were not eligible for Medi-Cal at that point but would be when the health law\u2019s expansion went into effect earlier this year. The researchers divided the group into four categories, based on the researchers\u2019 assessment of each group\u2019s pent-up demand for health care.\n\n\n\n[DEBATE CLUB: Is Medicaid Expansion Good for the States?]\n\nIn July 2011, after being enrolled in California\u2019s Low Income Health Program, the so-called \u201cbridge to reform,\u201d the group with the highest pent-up demand had a rate of costly emergency room visits triple \u2014 or more \u2014 that of the other groups. But from 2011 to 2013, that high rate dropped by more than two-thirds and has remained \u201crelatively constant,\u201d according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that this would be the case,\u201d said lead author Jerry Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, \u201cbecause we think that that\u2019s what access to care does for low-income individuals \u2026 that there\u2019s an additional increase in demand for services and that that demand, or utilization, drops off pretty rapidly.\u201d\n\nRates of hospitalization for the \u201chighest pent-up demand\u201d group also started high and dropped by almost 80 percent over the two-year period. Curiously, if ER and hospitalization rates were dropping, it\u2019s reasonable that outpatient visits might rise. But that wasn\u2019t the case; the rate of outpatient visits was largely unchanged during the two-year period.\n\nKominski said that one of the fears of the Medicaid expansion was the potential high cost of low-income patients. He argued that this analysis should ease those fears: \u201cWhat our findings say to the country is (that) concerns about Medicaid expansion being financially unsustainable into the future are unfounded.\u201d Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government provides 100 percent of the cost of the newly eligible under the Medicaid expansion, but in 2017 that contribution will phase down until it reaches 90 percent in 2020.\n\nTwenty-seven states and the District of Columbia are implementing the Medicaid expansion; 21 have not, and in two states, Indiana and Utah, the question of expansion is an \u201copen discussion,\u201d according to a tally from the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of KFF.)\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said the study was \u201ccertainly consistent with what we hope to do\u201d by expanding health insurance access. He said insurance is \u201cjust the first step, the next step is health care homes so that the individual can actually get better care.\u201d\n\nOne factor in helping drive down the higher rates of use, Kominski said, is better efforts at coordination for Medi-Cal beneficiaries. For example, virtually all Medi-Cal beneficiaries are now enrolled into a Medi-Cal managed care plan. \u201cTo the extent that other states don\u2019t have adequate coordinated care mechanisms in place for their Medicaid populations, then the kinds of drop off that we observed in California may not occur there,\u201d Kominski said.\n\nThe UCLA analysis makes explicit reference to \u2014 and rebuts \u2014 a similar study, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. In Oregon in 2008, 10,000 residents literally won Medicaid coverage in a lottery, creating a true randomized controlled trial opportunity for researchers who compared those who won coverage with those who didn\u2019t, rarely possible to do in social policy research. Researchers later reported a 40 percent increase in ER visits in the 18 months after that expansion.\n\nKate Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health, was one of the researchers in the Oregon experiment. She said they did not find \u201cany evidence of utilization tailing off over that 18-month window\u201d and stands by her results.\n\nStill, Baicker said that an increase in use of health care services, such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations, \u201cdoes not mean that Medicaid should not be expanded. Part of the goal is to increase access to health care.\u201d\n\nThe UCLA study was funded by the California Department of Health Care Services and Blue Shield of California Foundation, (which helps fund KHN\u2019s coverage of California health care issues).", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Will Obamacare's Medicaid Expansion Bring More ER Visits?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Spike in ER, hospitalization use short-lived after Medicaid expansion", "title": "Will Obamacare's Medicaid Expansion Bring More ER Visits?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/10/23/will-obamacares-medicaid-expansion-bring-more-er-visits", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1e/ee/1495c0de4322b218f13c03106123/141003edumedicalstudents-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Spike in ER, hospitalization use short-lived after Medicaid expansion<br>", "card": "summary", "title": "Will Obamacare's Medicaid Expansion Bring More ER Visits?"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kaiser Health News,Affordable Care Act,Medicaid,hospitals,health care,health,health care reform,DatamineHealthcare,Pulse,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Spike in ER, hospitalization use short-lived after Medicaid expansion"}, "article_summary": "Kominski said that one of the fears of the Medicaid expansion was the potential high cost of low-income patients.\n[DEBATE CLUB: Is Medicaid Expansion Good for the States?]\nResearchers later reported a 40 percent increase in ER visits in the 18 months after that expansion.\nThe researchers divided the group into four categories, based on the researchers\u2019 assessment of each group\u2019s pent-up demand for health care.\nStill, Baicker said that an increase in use of health care services, such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations, \u201cdoes not mean that Medicaid should not be expanded."}
