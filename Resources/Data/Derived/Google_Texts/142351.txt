CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - Dozens of people will lose their jobs when an Indiana-based medical products company closes its longtime North Charleston location.

The Post and Courier of Charleston reports (http://bit.ly/1Dfi5kz ) that Hill-Rom Holdings’ mid-September closing will affect 70 jobs.

Spokesman Larry Bauman said the closing is part of the company’s consolidation efforts.

Bauman says most job losses are in a customer call center being moved to Hill-Rom’s hometown of Batesville, Indiana. Eligible workers can transfer, but he didn’t know how many would take the offer.

Roughly two dozen employees who work in engineering, technology and other specialties will remain in the Charleston region.

Hill-Rom first came to the area in 1985. In 2008, the company had about 400 workers in North Charleston, but its payroll has shrunk since.
