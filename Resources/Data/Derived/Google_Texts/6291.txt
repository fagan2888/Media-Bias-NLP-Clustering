Health-care costs appear to be on the rise again.

In October, the price of medical care jumped a seasonally adjusted 0.7% to mark the biggest gain in five months, according to the consumer price index. And over the past year, medical care has risen at an unadjusted 3% annual rate. That’s the fastest advance in a year and a half.

What’s gotten more expensive is treatment in hospitals. The price of hospital-related care has climbed 5.3% in the past 12 months, the highest rate since mid-2014, the government reported Tuesday.

Analyst Omar Sharif at SG Americas Security said the increase in October might reflect problems with the process of calculating monthly changes. Prices of medical care rose slower than usual during the summer and they might be catching up now as government gets a better handle on actual costs. The same pattern emerged early in the year.

Health insurance is also on track to post the biggest annual increase in three years. The cost of insurance has climbed at a 3% pace in the past 12 months.

Higher health-care expenses in October were largely driven by a jump in prices in the West, though the reasons are unclear.

The price of subscription drugs, meanwhile, has slowed to a 3.7% annual pace from a 13-year high of 6.4% in the fall of 2014. But that’s still an above-average increase.

The cost of getting treated by a doctor at an office hasn’t risen very much, though: just 1.9% in the past year.

Health care is a volatile category that’s shown sharp swings, especially during the recovery. The advent of the law popularly known as Obamacare has also clouded the picture.

Whether the upward trend in costs persists remains to be seen, but rising health expenses clearly are a drain on U.S. households.
