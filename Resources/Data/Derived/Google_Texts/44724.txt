First Lady Michelle Obama turns 50 on Friday, but President Obama is saving the big celebration for Saturday night.

A White House official tells ABC News the president is throwing the first lady a dance party Saturday evening, a private gathering for family and friends.

The White House is keeping a tight lid on the other details, but some information for the private event has trickled out in news reports.

Friends and family have been invited to the White House on Saturday night for an evening of "Snacks & Sips & Dancing & Dessert." Guests have been told to wear comfortable shoes and eat before they head over to the White House, where a lot of dancing will be on the agenda.

And who will join the president in feting the first lady? Over the past year, reports have speculated that singer Adele could perform and maybe even close friend Beyonce, who sang "At Last" as Barack Obama and Michelle Obama danced for the first time as president and first lady at the 2009 Inaugural ball, may belt a song or two for the birthday girl.

While the White House has been quiet about the plans, it's clear the first lady's birthday is on the president's mind. At a White House event Thursday, President Obama reminded the crowd that the first lady's 50 th birthday was quickly approaching.

"It's her birthday tomorrow so I want everybody to just keep that in mind," the president said Thursday.

Mrs. Obama herself offered a clue about what dance move she might choose to use to celebrate her 50 th birthday.

"I'm going to be 50. Yes, 50. Fifty. Fifty and fabulous," she said at a children's hospital last month. "I'm not exactly sure yet what I'm going to do, but it might involve some dancing. A little Dougie."
