Under the most recently accepted construct, a trio of reconciliation bills may be created under a budget resolution: one each on revenues, debt and outlays, as Richard Arenberg, a longtime Democratic staffer now at Brown University, explained last November . Arenberg also wrote a book about the Senate's rules and the filibuster with former Parliamentarian Robert Dove.\n\n\"The reconciliation process with its potential for abuse threatens the Senate\u2019s unique balance of majority rights and minority protections. Critical decisions about what can and cannot be included in reconciliation will fall into the lap of Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough,\" Arenberg wrote in his opinion piece. \"This is a prospect that no Senate parliamentarian relishes. While these decisions may seem obscure, they could well have huge public policy impacts.\"\n\nThune's comments Tuesday signal that the debate suggested by Arenberg may be coming closer to reality.\n\nOf course, a reconciliation bill undercutting Obamacare would face a certain veto, but a tax code overhaul that provided for significant infrastructure spending might be an entirely different matter, especially if crafted with Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the White House. Both the highway bill and the Affordable Care Act are revenue bills.\n\nThune, the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, one of several authorizing committees with a slice of the transportation bill, said the current law would still need an extension, even under his expedited process proposal.\n\n\"Using the budget reconciliation process ... from a timing standpoint enables us I think to address what are a couple of really big priorities, and that is reforming our business tax code, lowering the rates, making our country more competitive with those around the world, and dealing with what we know is going to be a crisis come May 31, and that's funding highways,\" he said.\n\nThe 114th: CQ Roll Call's Guide to the New Congress Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A top Senate Republican is floating the idea of using the budget reconciliation process to solve the highway bill funding puzzle.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "A top Senate Republican is floating the idea of using the budget reconciliation process to solve the highway bill funding puzzle.", "title": "Thune Floats Highway Bill as Reconciliation Candidate", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/thune-floats-highway-bill-as-reconciliation-candidate", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/7/2015/01/luncheons019_010715-445x296.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-01-13T23:43:10Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "A top Senate Republican is floating the idea of using the budget reconciliation process to solve the highway bill funding puzzle.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,RC-Tags,CQToday Topic,policy,budget reconciliation,highway bill,John Thune,tran", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-01-13T23:43:10Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-13T23:43:10Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "A top Senate Republican is floating the idea of using the budget reconciliation process to solve the highway bill funding puzzle.", "title": "Thune Floats Highway Bill as Reconciliation Candidate", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/thune-floats-highway-bill-as-reconciliation-candidate", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/7/2015/01/luncheons019_010715-445x296.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A top Senate Republican is floating the idea of using the budget reconciliation process to solve the highway bill funding puzzle.\n\"The reconciliation process with its potential for abuse threatens the Senate\u2019s unique balance of majority rights and minority protections.\nOf course, Republicans have other ideas for the reconciliation silver bullet \u2014 like largely rolling back the 2010 health care law .\nCritical decisions about what can and cannot be included in reconciliation will fall into the lap of Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough,\" Arenberg wrote in his opinion piece.\nThe Budget Act places limits on the ability of lawmakers to use the fast-track budget process, but even that has proven to be fungible from time to time, with parliamentary rulings coming in conflict over the years."}
