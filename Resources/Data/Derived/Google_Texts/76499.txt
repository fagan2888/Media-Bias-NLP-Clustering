According to the White House Council of Economic Advisors, “one of the ACA’s key goals was to root out serious inefficiencies in the United States health care system that increase costs…” Yet Dominic Quagliozzi, an artist and an advocate for cystic fibrosis patients, says the Obamacare health insurance exchange in California has sent him 11 versions of the exact same enrollment notice.

Ladies and Gentlemen we have entered the Iron Cage of bureaucracy. #coveredcalifornia #healthinsurance #bureaucracy #cysticfibrosis #medicalindustrialcomplex A photo posted by Dominic Quagliozzi (@artistdominic) on Mar 20, 2015 at 6:28pm PDT

Quagliozzi apparently isn’t alone. One of his Instagram commenters says the same thing happened to her: “multiple letters on the same day and for weeks after. I swear I got a dozen of them.”
