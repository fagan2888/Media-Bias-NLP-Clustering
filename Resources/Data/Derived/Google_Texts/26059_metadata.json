Last year, the Avs would have found a way to get that big tying goal in the third period, with the goalie pulled, and they probably go on to win the game in OT or a shootout. All the kinds of games the Avs won last year, they\u2019re losing this year.\n\nThe Avs fell to 4-7-5 (hut hut) by losing 4-3 here. A huge third-period rally fell short, with John Mitchell\u2019s tying bid in the final few seconds blocked by a Flyers D-man, and that was that.\n\nThe turning point of the game was the Nathan MacKinnon 5-minute major on Luke Schenn in the first period. The Flyers got two PP goals out of it, and the Avs kind of were in disarray the rest of the second period, allowing two more goals \u2013 including a 5-on-3 one by Claude Giroux.\n\nPatrick Roy blew a gasket after the call on MacKinnon, and I expected him to rip the call more after the game. To everyone\u2019s surprise, though, he said he had \u201cno problem with the call.\u201d His reason for yelling so much, he said, was because he thought a linesman made the call on the major, not a referee.\n\nAnyway, looking at the replays more after the game, I think it was the correct call. I mean, MacKinnon barely pushed Schenn, and Schenn losing an edge with his left skate contributed to the play. But MacKinnon did push him, however slight, and it was a dangerous place to push him. Schenn being injured on the play was a factor, I think too. If he pops right back up, that\u2019s probably a two-minute minor call. Fact is, when a player stays down, it puts more pressure on the refs to call something.\n\nMacKinnon said it was a \u201cdumb\u201d play by him.\n\nOther thoughts on the game:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Claude Giroux,Jarome Iginla,John Mitchell,Matt Duchene,Patrick Roy,Reto Berra,Ryan O'Reilly,Semyon Varlamov,Zach Redmond", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Avs fall to 4-7-5", "title": "Avalanche lose to Flyers in Philadelphia", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/08/postgame-avalanche-flyers-analysis-nathan-mackinnon-penalty-spells-doom/20012/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/11/Iggy-495x392.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Avs fall to 4-7-5", "creator": "@adater", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/08/postgame-avalanche-flyers-analysis-nathan-mackinnon-penalty-spells-doom/20012/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/11/Iggy-495x392.jpg", "title": "Postgame Avalanche-Flyers analysis: Nathan MacKinnon penalty spells doom", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Late rally comes up short by the Avs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1f1\"", "article_summary": "I mean, MacKinnon barely pushed Schenn, and Schenn losing an edge with his left skate contributed to the play.\nA huge third-period rally fell short, with John Mitchell\u2019s tying bid in the final few seconds blocked by a Flyers D-man, and that was that.\nThe turning point of the game was the Nathan MacKinnon 5-minute major on Luke Schenn in the first period.\nBut MacKinnon did push him, however slight, and it was a dangerous place to push him.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Last year, that puck goes in the net in the final minute."}
