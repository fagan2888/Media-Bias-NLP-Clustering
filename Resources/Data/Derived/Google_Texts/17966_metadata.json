However, this obstacle is only adding to the previous doubts many have had about SoulCycle\u2019s IPO. According to Fortune, it\u2019s always risky investing in a fitness company, because exercising trends are constantly changing. Add a lawsuit on top of that, and the offer may be even less appealing.\n\nThe case has been filed by California customer Rachel Cody, who accuses the company of a \u201crelentless effort to maximize profits,\u201d by charging customers $30 for a certificate that can be used for a future class. But with short expiration dates, says Cody, her certificate expired before she was able to use it.\n\nOf course, SoulCycle gives you the option of buying certificates in more pricey packages, and those certificates have more lengthy expiration dates. But for those who have purchased one certificate at a time, they often have no choice but to take the loss.\n\nCody is not the only one finding these certificates problematic. With SoulCycle\u2019s increasing popularity, many complain that securing a bike during peak times becomes very difficult. The more difficult it is to get into a class, the less likely you are to use your certificate, making wasted money a not-so rare occurrence.\n\nCody is also accusing SoulCycle\u2019s certificate expiration date of violating the Credit Card Accountability and Disclosure Act, which states that businesses are required to \u201cestablish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan.\u201d\n\nThe potential lawsuit states that by calling these class vouchers \u201ccertificates\u201d means they must follow the rules of gift certificates, which, according to this law, are not allowed to have expiration dates shorter than five years.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, customers are also taking to Yelp to complain about this company policy. One New York City customer wrote, \u201cIf you pre-purchase a single class or a series of classes, they will expire (single class expires within 30 days, series of five within 45 days). At $30 a class, I feel like there should be more of a notice before the classes expire, since we're all busy people who have to juggle various deadlines.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s aim is to refund all customers who have lost money from certificates that expired before they could use them. Business Insider also said that SoulCycle declined to comment on the suit in an effort to maintain the quiet period before their IPO. As for the $100 million they hope to raise in their upcoming IPO, time can only tell if this lawsuit will hinder growth of the new cult-like fad.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "soulcycle, hit, potential, lawsuit, over, robbing, customers, ipo", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Customers are angry about SoulCycle's certificate policy, and they may take to the courts.", "title": "SoulCycle Potentially Facing Lawsuit Over 'Robbing Customers'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/soulcycle-hit-potential-lawsuit-over-robbing-customers-ipo-350654", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/soulcycle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Customers are angry about SoulCycle's certificate policy, and they may take to the courts.", "title": "SoulCycle Potentially Facing Lawsuit Over 'Robbing Customers'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/soulcycle-hit-potential-lawsuit-over-robbing-customers-ipo-350654", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/soulcycle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/soulcycle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-01T14:59:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-01T14:59:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Customers are angry about SoulCycle's certificate policy, and they may take to the courts."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca599\"", "article_summary": "However, this obstacle is only adding to the previous doubts many have had about SoulCycle\u2019s IPO.\nBusiness Insider also said that SoulCycle declined to comment on the suit in an effort to maintain the quiet period before their IPO.\nOf course, SoulCycle gives you the option of buying certificates in more pricey packages, and those certificates have more lengthy expiration dates.\nAs for the $100 million they hope to raise in their upcoming IPO, time can only tell if this lawsuit will hinder growth of the new cult-like fad.\nAccording to Business Insider, customers are also taking to Yelp to complain about this company policy."}
