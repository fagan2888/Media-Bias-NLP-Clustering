AUSTIN — Denials caused by immigration status are holding down nationwide enrollment in Obamacare’s online health insurance marketplaces — and very well may be doing the same in Texas.

Nationally, through June, just over 9.9 million people selected a plan and paid at least the first month’s premium, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a release Tuesday.

The “effectuated” or paid enrollment was down by about 238,000 consumers from the 10.2 million announced for the previous quarter.

In Texas, about 966,000 consumers picked a plan and paid a month’s premium as of March 31. But by June 30, the number was down by about 23,000, to just more than 943,000, according to the federal agency’s June and September factsheets.

Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the decline. “Big factor is 306k terminations due to immigration verification,” he tweeted, referring to a statement deep in the latest federal factsheet:

“During the time period from April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015, enrollment in coverage through the Federally-facilitated Marketplaces was terminated for about 306,000 consumers with citizenship or immigration status data matching issues who failed to produce sufficient documentation of their citizenship or immigration status,” it read.

CMS has not broken down the 306,000 figure by state.

Charles Gaba, a Michigan website developer who keeps close tabs on Obamacare enrollment data, said in a post Tuesday he had been expecting, nationally, between 10.3 million and 10.4 million paying customers for private coverage made possible by the Affordable Care Act.

Gaba said there had been “mass cancellations” because some enrollees couldn’t provide proof of legal residence, with about 112,000 dropped in September 2014 and another 90,000 last February.

In Texas, some health care providers who watch the data more casually than does Gaba have told me they expected a slight increase in Texas enrollment over the spring and summer months.

As the federal agency said in a release last month, about 944,000 Americans picked plans through HealthCare.gov between Feb. 23 and June 30. They qualified for “special enrollment periods” because they had lost employment-related coverage, been denied Medicaid or CHIP coverage, faced a tax penalty for not having coverage or underwent a big life change such as marriage or childbirth.
