Harrisburg, SD

160 South Dakota Army National Guard soldiers prepare to leave their families for a yearlong deployment today. The Harrisburg High School gym was standing room only as friends and families say goodbye.

The 1742nd Transportation Company will be flying out of Sioux Falls tomorrow to Fort Hood, Texas before being deployed to Afghanistan.

The Ceremony included speeches from Governor Dennis Daugaard, Representative Krisit Noem, and Senator John Thune. Misty Weisenbach's husband is heading overseas for the third time in the military. While she doesn't enjoy watching him leave, she likes the support the military receives from the community.

“The ceremonies are always nice. It's very nice to see the Governor be here, and our Representatives and our Senators. It means a lot to the soldiers,” Weisenback said.

The mission of the 1742nd is to provide transportation of numerous materials, including bulk water and fuel products.
