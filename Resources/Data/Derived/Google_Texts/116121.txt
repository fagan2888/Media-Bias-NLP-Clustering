President Obama spread the word about HealthCare.gov to “young people” and got in some quality kills on “Call of Duty: Ghosts” at the same time.

Obama has already proven he has what it takes to “pwn” in GTA: V. In this new spoof created by Machinima, he steps up his game and decides to use Xbox Live as a platform to reach the youth of America and directly influence them to sign up at HealthCare.gov, according to the video posted to YouTube.

Obama tries his best to get these incorrigible “young people” to sign up for Obamacare, but they seem more preoccupied with all things “whacking.” In the end, the President wins out and makes a convert.
