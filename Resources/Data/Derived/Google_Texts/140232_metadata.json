Livio/The Star-Ledger\n\nTRENTON \u2014 A bill that had been speeding through the state Legislature before hitting a wall in the state Senate could result in higher insurance premiums for older workers and higher profits for New Jersey's most influential Democrat, according to several left-leaning groups who protested it today.\n\n\n\nIn a conference call this morning joined by Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, the groups claimed the bill \u2014 which went largely unnoticed when it passed the Assembly 77-0 last month \u2014 would seek to expand insurance arrangements that can be used by companies, and allow them to charge much higher rates for older workers than they\u2019re currently allowed to.\n\nThe bipartisan bill (A3421) would give incentives for employers to band together to offer health insurance through self-funded or partially self-funded Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements.\n\nThe self-insurance companies would no longer be subject to limitations on what people generally deemed a higher insurance risk, such as senior citizens, women of child-bearing years, may be charged for coverage.\n\nCurrently, companies in the arrangements are allowed to charge more based on workers\u2019 age and gender \u2014 but no more than twice as much as their cheapest plans.\n\nThe advocates said that would result in cheap plans to young, healthy, male workers, but prohibitively expensive ones for women, as well as older workers who are more likely to get sick.\n\n\u201cThey would be able to charge unlimited premiums for older workers. They would also be able to charge more based on gender \u2014 something that the (federal Affordable Care Act) has eliminated,\u201d said Maura Collinsgru, health policy advocate for New Jersey Citizen Action.\n\nThe bill would also benefit insurance brokers and third-party administrators, allowing them to manage the pools and front them money in exchange for profits.\n\nAccording to The Record, the bill was pushed by Joseph Buckalew, a former Ocean County Republican chairman who is the business partner of Democratic power broker George Norcross. The two are the top executives at Conner Strong and Buckalew, an insurance brokerage firm that could benefit from the change in law.\n\n\u201cI think we all know that bills don\u2019t typically move that fast, particularly when it\u2019s not a budget bill or bills over overwhelming importance,\u201d said Dudley Burdge, a staff representative for the Communications Workers of American Local 1032. \u201cThis seems like the kind of business that Conner Strong would be interested in.\u201d\n\nDaniel Fee, a spokesman for Conner Strong, defended the merits of the bill, though he did not say that Conner Strong supported it.\n\n\"The modernization of Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements has broad-based support from Gov. Christie\u2019s former insurance commissioner to businesses across the state. Conner Strong has always monitored and considered for support legislation that would improve options for consumers. And I think it\u2019s important to point out that this is a voluntary program.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe (Buckelew) has a long, distinguished record and has always made himself available to answer questions. And that is what happened in this case,\" Fee added.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Assemblyman Ron Dancer (R-Ocean), said the bill \u201cprovides another option post-Affordable Care Act to have greater competition and choice. So I think that\u2019s good for the consumer.\u201d\n\nDancer also said there are protections written into the bill, such as requiring investors in the plans to wait at least two years before reaping any gains.\n\n\u201cWe try to put safeguards in here but try to provide an incentive for the private sector,\u201d Dancer said.\n\nFulop said the bill could exploit loopholes in the federal health care law, which is meant to make sure insurance is not denied to those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cProbably over the next several months and years as the (Affordable Care Act) takes its final form, you\u2019re going to have a lot of special interests looking to undermine it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that our state Senators and Assembly people recognize that and recognize the nature of the significant change that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAdvocates said they had expected the bill to be voted on today by the state Senate, but that it was taken off the agenda.\n\nState Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), chairman of the Senate health committee, said he asked Senate leaders to hold off posting the bill for a vote last month because he maintains it lacks consumer protections that would keep rate increases in check.\n\n\"\u200eI don't object to creating additional competition,\" Vitale said. \"I do object to creating an unlevel playing field and without the right consumer protections\u2026Insurance is about sharing risk and sharing the burden together. This raises costs for older New Jerseyans.\u2019 \"\n\nThe proposed bill also would allow investors who form the insurance arrangement to share in the profits, but would not require they share in the losses, Vitale said. \"The employer and employees are responsible for the debt. Not a bad deal, huh?\"\n\n\n\nVitale said he was also troubled the bill deletes an explanation about the financial risks of embarking on this form of company-funded insurance coverage.\n\nThese funds will not pay your claims or protect your assets if a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement becomes insolvent and is unable to make payments as promised,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "george-norcross, nj-assembly, nj-senate, news", "title": "Controversial N.J. insurance bill hits wall in Senate", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A bill that had been  speeding through the state Legislature before hitting a wall in the state Senate could result in higher insurance premiums for older workers and higher profits for New Jersey's most influential Democrat, according to several left-leaning groups who protested it today", "title": "Controversial N.J. insurance bill hits wall in Senate", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/07/controversial_insurance_bill_hits_wall_in_senate.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/new_jersey_opinion/photo/14810016-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bill that had been  speeding through the state Legislature before hitting a wall in the state Senate could result in higher insurance premiums for older workers and higher profits for New Jersey's most influential Democrat, according to several left-leaning groups who protested it today", "creator": "@MattFriedmanSL", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/new_jersey_opinion/photo/14810016-standard.jpg", "title": "Controversial N.J. insurance bill hits wall in Senate", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, July 10, 2014,  8:25 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, July 10, 2014,  3:36 PM", "article_author": "Matt Friedman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "A bill that had been  speeding through the state Legislature before hitting a wall in the state Senate could result in higher insurance premiums for older workers and higher profits for New Jersey's most influential Democrat, according to several left-leaning groups who protested it today"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis seems like the kind of business that Conner Strong would be interested in.\u201dDaniel Fee, a spokesman for Conner Strong, defended the merits of the bill, though he did not say that Conner Strong supported it.\nThe bipartisan bill (A3421) would give incentives for employers to band together to offer health insurance through self-funded or partially self-funded Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements.\nConner Strong has always monitored and considered for support legislation that would improve options for consumers.\nThe two are the top executives at Conner Strong and Buckalew, an insurance brokerage firm that could benefit from the change in law.\nThe self-insurance companies would no longer be subject to limitations on what people generally deemed a higher insurance risk, such as senior citizens, women of child-bearing years, may be charged for coverage."}
