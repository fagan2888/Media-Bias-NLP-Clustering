The driver also did not have a valid medical waiver, the report says.\n\nDuring the same inspection, the Gaines bus was cited for \u201cno or improper break-away or emergency braking.\u201d\n\nAs recently as March 7, the company was cited for having \u201cno or defective automatic trailer brake,\u201d and \u201cno or improper safety chains or cables for full trailer.\u201d\n\nJohn Crawford, the driver of the bus, was seriously injured when the bus slammed into a tractor-trailer as heavy rain and snow was falling, according to the Colorado State Patrol. Eleven others aboard that bus had minor to moderate injuries and were taken to Aurora hospitals.\n\nNo charges or citations have been issued, Trooper Josh Lewis of the Colorado State Patrol said on Saturday. However, criminal charges are anticipated, Lewis said.\n\nHe said he does not know Crawford\u2019s current condition.\n\nThe Aurora crash set off a chain reaction that involved another tour bus carrying the crew of a second band \u2014 country western duo Thompson Square \u2014 and a second tractor-trailer.\n\nTwin Shadow is a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based artist who had concerts scheduled for the Bluebird Theater in Denver on Friday and Saturday night.
