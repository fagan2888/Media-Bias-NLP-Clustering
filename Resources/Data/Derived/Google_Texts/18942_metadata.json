Where those four guys went on stage and looked like you and then they played Beatles songs and\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I heard about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was AWESOME.\u201d\n\nI often think of the Farley Model when watching the media \u201cinterview\u201d a Democrat. Especially, sickeningly so when it\u2019s Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut with the eternally overreaching Obama Administration, I am starting to feel more and more like the Anti-Farley.\n\nThis Administration issues executive fiat after executive fiat \u2013 piling the power grabs skyward.\n\nAnd again and again, the allegedly opposition Republican Party \u2013 emplaced by We the People in control of the Legislative Branch \u2013 acts outraged and issues stern press releases. But does nothing to actually rein them in.\n\nThe President keeps encroaching on Congress\u2019 lawmaking turf \u2013 and the lawmakers keep ceding the field.\n\nLeaving us Less Government types to turn to one another and ask \u201cRemember when it was Congress that made law? And defended their Constitutional prerogative to do so? That was AWESOME.\u201d\n\nObama: \u2018I Have a Pen and I Have a Phone\u2019\n\nObama\u2019s One-Man Rule Amounts To A \u2018Gradual, Quiet Coup\u2019\n\nPresident Obama and every one of his Departments, Agencies, Commissions and Boards are working non-stop as stealth, unelected, unaccountable \u201claw\u201dmakers.\n\nBy Unilaterally Changing ObamaCare, Obama Is Making A Mockery Of The Constitution\n\nObama EPA Climate Decrees Will Further Damage U.S. Economy\n\nObama\u2019s Objective: Nationalize California\u2019s Government-Made Water Disaster\n\nObama Proposes Massive Gun Ban by Regulation Fiat\n\nObama to Order Expansion of Overtime Pay for Millions of Workers\n\nLikely the biggest Obama Administration power grabs have come from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Because they have so much more of the still-private sector to grab.\n\nBecause the FCC has set its sites on the Internet. Which \u2013 unlike just about every other economic sector \u2013 didn\u2019t really have an agency (or eight) assigned to crush regulate it.\n\nBack at the Internet\u2019s dawn \u2013 during the Bill Clinton Administration \u2013 two unbelievably unleashing government decisions were made. The World Wide Web was privatized \u2013 and deemed to be basically regulation-free.\n\nAs always happens when the government doesn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d \u2013 the Web has exploded. Becoming an always-evolving, ever-expanding, free-speech-free-market Xanadu.\n\nPresident Obama could not let that stand. So he sicced on the Internet the FCC. Which is supposed to an independent agency \u2013 free from political arm-twisting.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s FCC happily obliged. And unilaterally declared the Internet subject to 1934 law. Written for\u2026land line telephones \u2013 and railroads. Seems eminently applicable, yes?\n\nThis is Network Neutrality \u2013 on century-old steroids. It is a HUGE power grab. Which will hopefully (yet again) be dumped by the courts.\n\nOf course the FCC has by no means stopped there. Behold their abuse of the merger approval process.\n\nWhen any two or more companies want to become one \u2013 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department both have to give their approval. If those companies have anything to do with anything communications \u2013 the FCC piles in and piles on.\n\nAs does the FTC and Justice \u2013 when the FCC goes into merger-approval-mode, they grab their \u201claw\u201d-writing pens. And impose countless a la carte regulations they could never get through Congress. All three agencies take their licks \u2013 but the FCC usually hits the hardest.\n\nThese are called merger \u201cconditions\u201d or \u201cconcessions.\u201d But that\u2019s like saying I conceded my wallet to the guy with the gun and the mask. The merging companies are government hostages \u2013 to get out they have to give in. These are merger capitulations.\n\nRent Seeking in the FCC\u2019s Approval of the AT&T/DirecTV Merger\n\n(T)he FCC is largely free to ask firms for an almost unlimited range of concessions in exchange for favorable outcomes in matters before the commission. Such rent-seeking is business as usual.\n\nIn the merger context, the only practical limit on what the commission can request is however much the parties are willing to give up before walking away from the deal.\n\nThe FCC almost always takes full advantage.\n\nFCC Approves AT&T, DirecTV Merger \u2018With Conditions\u2019\n\nThe soon-to-be single entity must expand high speed fiber Internet access to at least 12.5 million customer locations, E-rate eligible schools and libraries within the next four years.\n\nAT&T must offer broadband access to low-income consumers at discounted rates. AT&T responded it will start with plans of 3Mbps service at $5 per month and 10Mbps for $10 per month.\n\nThese two capitulations will cost a LOT of money. These exorbitant costs will of course be passed along to AT&T and DirecTV customers \u2013 in the form of much higher monthly rates. Because \u201cpro-consumer\u201d \u2013 or something.\n\nAT&T cannot write its own rules on data caps and providing access to online video, circling back into the tangled web that is net neutrality.\n\nThe FCC mandated a la carte Net Neutrality \u2013 in case the courts dump the whole-hog-grab. Something the Commission also did in the Comcast-NBC merger.\n\nAnd remember this?\n\n(FCC Chairman) Tom Wheeler Tweaks Net Neutrality Plan After Google Push\n\nWhen the FCC Chair turned his law-writing pen into a waiter\u2019s order-taking pen. Allowing huge President-Obama-and-Democrat-donating Google to order customized a la carte changes to the grab.\n\nFellow bandwidth-uber-hog Netflix is also in Waiter Wheeler\u2019s section. And also gets to order way off the menu.\n\nNetflix to Support Charter Acquisition of Time Warner Cable\n\nSo \u2013 merging companies now have to get Obama\u2019s cronies\u2019 approval, too. Which they will grant \u2013 in exchange for self-tailored capitulations, of course.\n\nNetflix Inc. will support Charter Communications Inc.\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. in exchange for free access to Charter\u2019s customers\u2026.\n\nTo quote another Saturday Night Live skit: \u201cWell isn\u2019t that special.\u201d\n\nSo in the Age of Obama \u2013 the unelected regulatory agencies get to write \u201claws.\u201d Their Crony Socialist donors get to write \u201claws.\u201d\n\nThe only people who don\u2019t get to write (actual) laws \u2013 are the Representatives elected and Constitutionally-mandated to do so.\n\nAll of which is anything but awesome.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca70c\"", "article_summary": "Leaving us Less Government types to turn to one another and ask \u201cRemember when it was Congress that made law?\nBut with the eternally overreaching Obama Administration, I am starting to feel more and more like the Anti-Farley.\nRemember that recurring Saturday Night Live skit where the late Chris Farley was the ultimate fanboy \u2013 interviewing those for whom he was the ultimate fanboy?\nBehold their abuse of the merger approval process.\nThe President keeps encroaching on Congress\u2019 lawmaking turf \u2013 and the lawmakers keep ceding the field."}
