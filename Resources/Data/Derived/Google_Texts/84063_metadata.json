After offering a series of clues to ITK readers, Bonjean welcomed Wendt, known as Norm on the hit 1980\u2019s comedy, to his packed soiree on Saturday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe low-key Wendt appeared to do his best Santa Claus-at-the-mall impression, as he took his place on a chair and guests lined up for a snapshot with him. \u201cNo one has sat on my lap yet though,\u201d Wendt, \u2014 also known for starring in the famed Chicago superfan (lover of \u201cDa Bears\u201d) sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 said after a partygoer likened him to Saint Nick.\n\nBonjean donned an eye-popping, floral-patterned metallic green jacket that he had custom-made at a local fabric store. Costumed characters, including Abraham Lincoln, Darth Vader from \u201cStar Wars,\u201d (who was following around Singer Bonjean Strategies partner Brian Walsh as part of a recurring party gag) and a pair of Las Vegas-style showgirls roamed the shindig, chatting up some of D.C.\u2019s power players as Danish music blasted from Bonjean\u2019s iPod into a sound system.\n\nAmong those eyed in the eclectic scene: Republican consultant (and official celeb guest greeter) Doug Heye; Rep. John Boehner's (R-Ohio) spokesman Michael Steel and wife Mary Kathryn; CNN\u2019s Sam Feist, Matt Dornic, Alexandra Jaffe, Brianna Keilar, Brooke Baldwin, and Mark Preston; Sen.
