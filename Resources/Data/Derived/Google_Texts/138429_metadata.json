But public health guidelines currently only recommend gay men and people with HIV be regularly tested \u201cgiven the high burden of sexually transmitted infections in this at-risk population.\u201d And at that, genital tests are the standard tests recommended to sexually active men and women. Extragenital tests, which check areas like the throat and rectum, occur less, perhaps due to their higher cost.\n\nYet, after researchers analyzed healthy records from more than 10,000 people (4,402 women, 5,218 heterosexual men and 769 gay men), they found the occurrence of gonorrhea and chlamydia in extragenital areas are significant in younger women. The respective rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia found in young women were 2.4 percent and 3.7 percent, while these respective rates in gay men were 18.9 percent and 11.8 percent.\n\nIf these men and women had simply received the standard genital tests, \u201cnearly 14 percent of chlamydia infections and more than 30 percent of gonorrhea infections would have been missed,\u201d Dr. Khalil Ghanem, study author and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins, said in a press release.\n\n\"\u2026 when these infections occur in extragenital areas, they are typically asymptomatic,\" added Joshua Trebach, a third-year med student at Johns Hopkins. \"These types of infections pose a large and hidden public health threat, because they can be transmitted to unwitting sexual partners and form an active infection.\"\n\nWhile gonorrhea and chlamydia are both treatable, they can cause long-term health problems if they go undetected. Both infections are prevalent among men and women between the ages 15 and 24, with genital and extragenital symptoms not always being obvious. If women with chlamydia don\u2019t receive treatment, it may cause difficulty getting pregnant in the future.\n\n\"Cost-effectiveness analysis is an area we should definitely pursue,\" Ghanem said. \"Young women in particular might benefit, as our analysis found that women who were 18 or younger had nearly fourfold increased odds of being diagnosed with an extragenital infection.\"\n\nThe CDC cited a 2014 study that found one-third of adolescents don\u2019t talk about sexual health issues with their physicians during their annual visits \u2014 at all. Being honest with your health care provider is a way to ensure sexually active men and women of any age receive timely, appropriate tests in order to prevent any long-term health problems.\n\nSource: Sexually Transmitted Diseases. 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "extragenital, std, testing, shows, gonorrhea, chlamydia, prevalent, among, younger, women", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Johns Hopkins research suggests standard tests aren't enough to keep sexually active men and women healthy.", "title": "Standard Tests Miss Common STDs In Younger Women", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/extragenital-std-testing-shows-gonorrhea-chlamydia-prevalent-among-younger-women-331336", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/29/std-testing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johns Hopkins research suggests standard tests aren't enough to keep sexually active men and women healthy.", "title": "Standard Tests Miss Common STDs In Younger Women", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/extragenital-std-testing-shows-gonorrhea-chlamydia-prevalent-among-younger-women-331336", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/29/std-testing.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/29/std-testing.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-29T17:20:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T17:20:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Johns Hopkins research suggests standard tests aren't enough to keep sexually active men and women healthy."}, "article_summary": "Extragenital tests, which check areas like the throat and rectum, occur less, perhaps due to their higher cost.\nAs STD awareness month comes to a close, a forthcoming study from Johns Hopkins Medicine suggests women, gay men, and people with HIV should be regularly screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia \u2014 not just gay men and people with HIV.\nYet, after researchers analyzed healthy records from more than 10,000 people (4,402 women, 5,218 heterosexual men and 769 gay men), they found the occurrence of gonorrhea and chlamydia in extragenital areas are significant in younger women.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocates \u201cSTD testing is a basic part of staying healthy,\u201d with gonorrhea and chlamydia both being treatable infections.\nBoth infections are prevalent among men and women between the ages 15 and 24, with genital and extragenital symptoms not always being obvious."}
