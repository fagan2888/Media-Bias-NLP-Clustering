He was pretty darned good last time but this time he went the extra mile (at least in my mind) by specifically calling out Fox\u2019s bias and agenda.\n\nKelly was snippy right off the bat as she interrupted Emanuel and said shrilly, \u201cLet\u2019s have a question and answer. The interview works better that way.\u201d Then she proceeded to pepper him with questions and interrupt his answers.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d have to say Emanuel gave as good as he got. For example, when he disputed Kelly\u2019s claim that 5 million people have had their insurance canceled as a result of the Affordable Care Act, he said, \u201cOnly on Fox is it 5 million,\u201d he told her.\n\nAt another point, after Kelly started shouting at him, Emanuel said, \u201cMaybe if you would stop yelling at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know or didn\u2019t you?\u201d Kelly demanded petulantly. She was referring to whether or not it had been foreseen that so many people would lose their health insurance coverage in the wake of ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see that before ObamaCare those kind of cancellations happened all the time,\u201d Emanuel replied. Then he took it the extra step by pointing out, \u201cYou never covered them. They were very common.\u201d\n\nWhen she interrupted again, he said, \u201cYou keep interrupting. Isn\u2019t there any manners here?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, it\u2019s a back and forth,\u201d Kelly snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not just going to give you the platform for a soliloquy.\u201d That is, no platform so long as it\u2019s a liberal doing the talking. Because when it came to her next guest, Tea Party Senator Ted Cruz, she let him talk as much as he wanted to without interruption. That video is the second video below, there for your comparison. There's a world of difference.\n\nBut here was my favorite part: Emanuel pointed out that when the exchanges were set up, it was \u201cnot an environment which was hospitable to setting (them) up.\u201d As Kelly once again tried to interrupt, he added, \u201cYou and your colleagues were constantly criticizing, trying to underfund it and trying to make sure it didn\u2019t work. \u2026It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. \u2018We\u2019re gonna try to do everything we can to make it fail and then when it fails, we\u2019re gonna say, \u2018Oh, why did it fail?\u2019\u201d\n\nKelly protested, saying that Fox News had nothing to do with setting up the healthcare.gov website.\n\nBut Emanuel shot back, \u201cYou were constantly attacking the law and you were trying to make it underfunded.\u201d\n\nAnd you know Kelly knew he had a point because she let it go by sneering she\u2019d \u201cgive\u201d him that for argument\u2019s sake.\n\nAnd she concluded by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re fun to talk to. Thanks for being here.\u201d\n\nKelly said in an interview shortly before The Kelly File premiered that she was not going to be a female version of Bill O\u2019Reilly. Maybe not, but she sure seems to be doing her best to try sometimes. She even announced, at about 2:55, \u201cThat\u2019s spin!\u201d However, I suspect that in real life she\u2019s much less of a conservative firebrand. Her respect for Emanuel confirmed that in my mind. But is playing a conservative mouthpiece on TV, while pretending otherwise, better or worse actually being one?\n\nI report, you decide.\n\nMeanwhile, I think we can definitively classify Emanuel as our latest Top Dog.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "yOOBnXhuN3dQih8vP0PC9i4BhShqBVhHEzt2KJv2DoE=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/ezekiel_emanuel_calls_out_megyn_kelly_s_obamacare_bias_and_b_s_11132013", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Ezekiel Emanuel Calls Out Megyn Kelly\u2019s ObamaCare Bias And B.S."}, "Title": "Ezekiel Emanuel Calls Out Megyn Kelly\u2019s ObamaCare Bias And B.S."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a66\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel revisited The Kelly File tonight where he did even better than in his last appearance.\nKelly was snippy right off the bat as she interrupted Emanuel and said shrilly, \u201cLet\u2019s have a question and answer.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see that before ObamaCare those kind of cancellations happened all the time,\u201d Emanuel replied.\nThe interview works better that way.\u201d Then she proceeded to pepper him with questions and interrupt his answers.\nAt another point, after Kelly started shouting at him, Emanuel said, \u201cMaybe if you would stop yelling at me?\u201d\u201cDid you know or didn\u2019t you?\u201d Kelly demanded petulantly."}
