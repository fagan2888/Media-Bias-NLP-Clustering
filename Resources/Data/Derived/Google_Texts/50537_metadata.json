Photo: Georgina Lomax Photography\n\nBlack Caviar, Australia's fastest racehorse in a generation, might have been a little slower at giving birth, but has taken to motherhood quickly after foaling a filly in the Hunter Valley on Friday night.\n\nThe bay filly, with a small white marking on her forehead and a couple of white socks, is the first foal out of the champion racemare, which was undefeated in 25 starts in Australia and Royal Ascot in Britain.\n\n\"Black Caviar was the people's horse and we are looking forward to sharing this filly's journey with the people of Australia,\" said Black Caviar's managing part-owner Neil Werrett said after rushing from Sydney on Friday night to make it five minutes before the birth started.\n\nProud godparents: Black Caviar's managing part-owner Neil Werrett and partner Lena Attebo with her new foal.

We're incredibly proud that she's given birth to a filly and equally delighted that both Black Caviar and her foal are healthy and doing well.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Caviar's followers had been expecting the royal birth for weeks, but it was only on Friday night that the eight-year-old showed signs she was ready to deliver off the track.\n\nHer owners have dismissed the idea of putting the Exceed And Excel filly through a sales ring, once famously comparing it to like \"selling your children\".\n\nThe filly is the first foal out of the champion mare. Photo: Georgina Lomax Photography\n\nWerrett said Black Caviar had quickly recovered from the birth and was back into her tucker.\n\n\"She's great and she's loving it,\" Werrett said. \"She just stands still in the corner as still as she's ever been. The first thing she wanted to do after she had the baby was she wanted to eat. She sat up and started eating. It was amazing. She hasn't lost her [zest for] tucker\".\n\nBlack Caviar won 15 group 1s, including the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2012.\n\nShe won three Lightning Stakes, a race that carries her name, two VRC Classics, two William Reid Stakes and two T.J. Smiths, which was her farewell to the racetrack last year.\n\nHer brother All Too Hard also proved a top-class galloper and his first foals are hitting the ground this season.\n\nA decision on a sire for Black Caviar this season is yet to be made.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Horseracing", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Black Caviar, Australia's fastest racehorse in a generation, might have been a little slower at giving birth, but has taken to motherhood quickly after foaling a filly in the Hunter Valley on Friday night.", "title": "Champion mare Black Caviar and filly foal well after birth in Hunter Valley", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/horseracing/champion-mare-black-caviar-and-filly-foal-well-after-birth-in-hunter-valley-20140912-10gdk5.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/f/l/h/j/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.10gdk5.png/1411183345793.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/f/l/h/j/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.10gdk5.png/1411183345793.jpg"}, "title": "Champion mare Black Caviar and filly foal well after birth in Hunter Valley", "description": "Black Caviar, Australia's fastest racehorse in a generation, might have been a little slower at giving birth, but has taken to motherhood quickly after foaling a filly in the Hunter Valley on Friday night.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Black Caviar, Australia's fastest racehorse in a generation, might have been a little slower at giving birth, but has taken to motherhood quickly after foaling ..."}, "article_summary": "A decision on a sire for Black Caviar this season is yet to be made.\nWe're incredibly proud that she's given birth to a filly and equally delighted that both Black Caviar and her foal are healthy and doing well.\"\nPhoto: Georgina Lomax PhotographyWerrett said Black Caviar had quickly recovered from the birth and was back into her tucker.\nHappy familes: Black Caviar with her new addition.\nBlack Caviar won 15 group 1s, including the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2012."}
