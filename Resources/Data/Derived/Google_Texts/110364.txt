Denver Water crews plan to work through the night Saturday and morning Sunday to repair a broken water main that caused the Colorado Rockies to postpone their match against the Cincinnati Red on Saturday evening.

“It is not an ideal situation, but our folks will work as hard and as fast as they can to get it repaired,”said Stacy Chesney, a spokeswoman for Denver Water.

Chesney said a 12-inch water main that served Coors Field exclusively broke near 21st and Blake streets around 5:30 p.m.

Water from the rupture poured into the street and caused manhole covers to pop out. The break also deprived Coors Field of water pressure, knocking the restrooms and concessions facilities out of action.

Initially a 30-minute delay was announced for the 6:10 p.m. game as Denver Water workers attempted to resolve the problem. The Denver Office of Emergency Management eventually asked the game be postponed, and Denver Water crews began moving in heavy equipment to start digging up the pipe.

Coors Field opened in 1995 and much of the infrastructure surrounding it is new. But the failed pipe dates back to the early 1900s, Chesney said.

The Colorado Rockies rescheduled the game against the Reds to 7:10 p.m. Sunday, making it the second act in a split double-header.

Fans with a ticket for the Saturday evening game can use their tickets for the game Sunday evening, but not for the afternoon game at 2:10 p.m.

They can also exchange the ticket for another comparable seats at another game during what is left of the season. No cash refunds will be provided, the team said.

On Sunday the Rockies planned to retire Todd Helton’s number 17, adding even more pressure to get the water pressure back in time.
