Rangers rescued a severely injured 31-year-old man early Saturday morning by lowering him 500 feet by rope from a steep slope on Gabletop Mountain to an area near Loomis Lake.

Nick Creadon of Golden had called for help after taking a bad tumble while “glissading” on Friday, according to Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for Rocky Mountain National Park.

Despite his serious injuries, Creadon was able to move down a steep band of rock, then down a steep snow field toward rangers, she said.

Rangers reached Creadon, who had life-threatening injuries, just after midnight by climbing rugged terrain to reach him, Patterson said.

A paramedic on the park’s rescue team “provided advanced life support” throughout the incident, she said in a news release.

At about 8:30 a.m. Creadon was flown to Upper Beaver Meadows Road where he was then taken by Flight for Life to St. Anthony’s Hospital for further treatment, she said.

“Park rescue team members feel this was truly a life saving mission,” Patterson said in a news release. “Creadon was extremely fortunate to have cell phone coverage in this remote location with very limited coverage.”

Creadon was hurt while glissading, or sliding on his buttocks, down the mountain, she said.

U.S. Forest Service rangers, flying in the same helicopter that had been used to recover a body found on Longs Peak earlier in the day, flew to Gabletop Mountain Friday evening and spotted Creadon above Loomis Lake.

Rangers also tracked his location using cell phone GPS coordinates.

Four park rangers were flown through severe thunderstorms late Friday night to Loomis Lake and they kept in contact by phone with Creadon through the night.

“The man is located in a remote high alpine environment in a steep cirque above Loomis Lake approximately 11,300 feet,” Patterson said in a news release late Friday night.
