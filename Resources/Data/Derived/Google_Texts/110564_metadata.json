In three instances, this year\u2019s Black Friday sale prices are higher than the 2014 Black Friday prices, NerdWallet found.\n\n\u201cThis is the fourth year we\u2019ve conducted this analysis, and we\u2019re still seeing repetitive deals every year,\u201d said NerdWallet shopping manager Katrina Chan in a statement. \u201cJust because a retailer promotes a certain product as a \u2018deal,\u2019 consumers shouldn\u2019t take that at face value. Shoppers still have to do their homework early.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Black Friday Will Be a Bust This Year\n\nFor example, GameStop is advertising the PlayStation Gold Wireless Headset for $69.99 this year just like in 2014, according to NerdWallet. GameStop spokesman Joey Mooring confirmed the repeat deal.\n\n\u201cIt is in high demand and has been one of our best-selling accessories during the holidays,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cwhich is why we are offering such a great deal once again on it this year.\u201d\n\nJCPenney spokeswoman Kate Coultas offered a similar explanation about the retailer\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu bargain on the Cooks Microwave, which it\u2019s selling for $49.99 on Black Friday, just like last year. Coultas said it was one of several Black Friday deals the retailer is rerunning from past years.\n\n\u201cAfter several years of Black Friday sales, we know the key items and price points customers will respond to and the kind of deals they will expect from JCPenney each year,\u201d Coultas said in an email.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Day That\u2019s Better for Deals than Black Friday\n\nThat probably explains why Macy\u2019s is offering 60 bargains it ran last year, while Belk, another department store, is promoting 80 duplicate deals, according to NerdWallet\u2019s analysis.\n\nApart from repeat deals, NerdWallet also found that retailers went to different lengths to make discounts seem more valuable.\n\nFor example, Macy\u2019s is listing a Samsonite Luggage carry-on bag in its Black Friday circular for $99.99, touted as more than half off its regular price tag of $260. But the same bag was available at Macy\u2019s earlier in November for $116.99, and on sale for Veteran\u2019s Day for $99.44, according to NerdWallet.\n\nSome retailers are using so-called \u201ccomp prices\u201d rather than their regular prices to make a discount look larger. And in a few cases, shoppers would have gotten a better discount last year or even a few weeks ago for the same item.\n\nFor instance, Staples sold the Brother HL-L2320d Mono Laser Printer last year for $49.99 during Black Friday. This year, the Black Friday price is $79.99. Only weeks ago, it was selling for $59.99.\n\nRelated: The Most (and Least) Popular Gift Cards for 2015\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for shoppers to ignore the Black Friday percent-off claims, as it\u2019s very likely that the advertised amount of the discounts may be inflated,\u201d NerdWallet's Chan said in a statement. \u201cInstead, shoppers should look at the sale price of the item and determine if it\u2019s a price they\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You might want to think twice before bolting from your family Thanksgiving meal to sna", "title": "The Surprising Truth Behind Those Black Friday \u2018Deals\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Surprising-Truth-Behind-Those-Black-Friday-Deals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11262012_blackfriday_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Surprising-Truth-Behind-Those-Black-Friday-Deals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11262012_blackfriday_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "You might want to think twice before bolting from your family Thanksgiving meal to sna", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In three instances, this year\u2019s Black Friday sale prices are higher than the 2014 Black Friday prices, NerdWallet found.\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Day That\u2019s Better for Deals than Black FridayThat probably explains why Macy\u2019s is offering 60 bargains it ran last year, while Belk, another department store, is promoting 80 duplicate deals, according to NerdWallet\u2019s analysis.\nCoultas said it was one of several Black Friday deals the retailer is rerunning from past years.\nApart from repeat deals, NerdWallet also found that retailers went to different lengths to make discounts seem more valuable.\n\u201cInstead, shoppers should look at the sale price of the item and determine if it\u2019s a price they\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d"}
