Yes, as you look at the data on the nonemployed, you come away thinking that unemployment insurance is not a major driver of the trend. Only 4 percent of nonworking men in the poll, and 2 percent of nonworking women, said that they are receiving unemployment benefits. Each state determines how many months of benefits are available, but in general, people who have been out of work for more than six months are not eligible. (The government offered extended benefits for several years after the recession, ending in December 2013.)\n\nThere is more debate to have, however, about whether the full patchwork of benefits for people out of work \u2014 including disability and food stamps \u2014 does in fact play a role in the rise of nonwork. Binyamin Appelbaum and Robert Gebeloff\u2019s 2012 story, \u201cEven Critics of Safety Net Increasingly Depend on It,\u201d covered some of this issue. So did Eli Saslow\u2019s 2013 Washington Post series on food stamps, as well as Damian Paletta\u2019s coverage of disability in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nQ. I\u2019m surprised the role of health insurance in the increasing unemployment of older workers is not mentioned. Employees\u2019 ages and age distribution is a major determinant of an organization\u2019s health insurance costs. This has resulted in older workers being \u201cpreferred\u201d targets of layoffs, not just their higher wages from longer work experience and higher rank. Health care reform failed to address this insidious effect. \u2014 mdieri, via Facebook\n\nA. No doubt that the cost of health care can keep some older workers from getting or keeping a job. Yet it\u2019s worth noting \u2014 as Amanda Cox\u2019s animated chart makes clear \u2014 that the number of workers above 65 has increased significantly in recent years. The decline in work is concentrated among people younger than 55.\n\nQ. Great article! But haven\u2019t similar issues affected African-American men for years? Why don\u2019t you address race here? \u2014 Deborah Gambs, via Twitter\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA. There\u2019s no question that these issues are particularly deep in minority communities. African-American men are much less likely to have jobs than other Americans. They are less likely to have college degrees, less likely to live in households with dependents and more likely to live in areas where jobs are hard to find.\n\nOur poll doesn\u2019t include enough African-American respondents to analyze racial patterns \u2014 we wanted to take a broad look at the subject \u2014 but it\u2019s worth noting that 7 percent of respondents cited racial discrimination as a reason they\u2019re not working.\n\nOther reader comments\n\n\u25a0 I hear a lot in these comments that the plight of men is because we have paid too much attention to women. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. If you read the article, you see single men reluctant to suffer the humiliation of working retail or fast food and able to make that choice because they do not have to provide for a family. Single mothers don\u2019t get that choice. You will do almost anything to keep your kids fed. You take the humiliating retail job at $8.25 an hour, and you hustle because you are terrified of losing it. The employment differences between working-class men and women are because women work in the growing-but-horrible low-wage service industries, not because women stole all of the machinist jobs from men. \u2014 Clem, via Facebook\n\n\u25a0 Another factor to consider as well: men\u2019s educational attainment has stagnated in recent decades, growing much more slowly than that of women. At a time when the pay gap between college graduates and everyone else has reached a record level, that stagnation is one reason for men\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u25a0 In 1995 our family business, after nearly 100 years in apparel/retail, closed its last store. At our peak in 1971, we operated 9 factories, employed 400 workers and produced today\u2019s equivalent of $35 million annually. Our retail operations ceased, too. At age 49, with a son at the University of PA and daughter still in high school, I had to reinvent myself. For almost 30 years, I worked in the factories and retail stores. I immediately took any jobs I could find. Selling cars, changing oil, shredding paper, driving at an auto-auction and dusting shelves. Anything. At night I would attend graduate school. For 19 months, I worked all day and then went to class and the library all night. I worked weekends, and when not working I was in the library. In the meantime I lost my home, marriage, but not hope. I received two master\u2019s degrees. I qualified for a Civil Service job in Information Technology through the Governor\u2019s Office of Administration management program. Now, almost 19 years later, I\u2019m retired and comfortable. The price I paid for the loss of my career is immeasurable. I managed to make it, but I truly understand why many can\u2019t. Building a life from scratch at age 49 is next to impossible. I would come home exhausted at 11 p.m. and then be up again at 5 a.m. to start over. I couldn\u2019t do that today at age 67. And truthfully I don\u2019t know how I did it at 49. \u2014 ay, via Facebook\n\n\u25a0 America has been underfunding infrastructure by around 1% of G.D.P. for decades. Most infrastructure jobs pay well and are in male-dominated fields. We would have to increase infrastructure spending by around 2% of G.D.P. for over a decade to get our infrastructure in good shape. So there are millions of good-paying male-oriented jobs in America. We just don\u2019t have the political will to fund them. \u2014 Robert Salzberg, via Facebook\n\n\u25a0 There is so much about this report that is troubling: the costs to these employed individuals, both real and psychological; the impact on our economy of increasingly more unemployment benefits and no health care; and the prospects for our children in an economy that provides two career choices: low-wage, part-time service industry jobs, or opportunities in finance, law, medicine and the like, for the children of the elite who can afford to send their children to colleges costing over $50K per year. But does the elite care (and by \u201celite\u201d, I am including members of Congress)? Do they feel any moral obligation to support an economy which benefits anyone besides themselves? As so many have pointed out recently, it appears we\u2019re in new Gilded Age. \u2014 OakParkers, via Facebook\n\n\u25a0 What many people are missing here is that entry-level jobs, as distasteful as they may seem, lead to better jobs. Our daughter took two jobs after completing college that were well below what one might expect for a college grad. Both led to rapid promotions as her capabilities and good work ethic were discovered. She currently has a terrific job as a real estate development professional. A big part of this problem is simply getting back in the game, any game. \u2014 Steve Struck, via Facebook\n\n\u25a0 In the economy of life, isn\u2019t the whole idea to get the most return for the least investment? So, the ultimate goal should be working as little as possible for the greatest reward, no? To put it another way, who is better off: an unemployed man living off disability checks and maybe family support, but who is readily meeting all his needs and maybe a few of his wants; or a wage slave with a big salary and 401K but with bigger appetites and obligations because he is obsessed more with status than survival, and is always rushing just to keep from falling further behind (i.e., someone who is living the American Dream)? \u2014 The Curmudgeon, via Facebook", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141212151833, "twitter": {"description": "Our series on the decline of work, particularly among men, generated much reader discussion.", "title": "Reader Questions and Responses: The Decline of Work", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/upshot/reader-questions-and-responses-the-decline-of-work.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003301356"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/17/upshot/13UP-Readers/13UP-Readers-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/upshot/reader-questions-and-responses-the-decline-of-work.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003301356", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/upshot/reader-questions-and-responses-the-decline-of-work.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 12, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Labor and Jobs,Unemployment,Unemployment Insurance,Blacks", "news_keywords": "Unemployment,Blacks African-Americans", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Upshot Staff", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/17/upshot/13UP-Readers/13UP-Readers-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "THE UPSHOT STAFF", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Our series on the decline of work, particularly among men, generated much reader discussion.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/17/upshot/13UP-Readers/13UP-Readers-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Our series on the decline of work, particularly among men, generated much reader discussion.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 12, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-12-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Blacks", "published": "2014-12-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "13up-readers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141214024450, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/upshot/reader-questions-and-responses-the-decline-of-work.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/17/upshot/13UP-Readers/13UP-Readers-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Our series on the decline of work, particularly among men, generated much reader discussion.", "title": "Reader Questions and Responses: The Decline of Work"}, "pdate": 20141212, "des": "Blacks", "articleid": 100000003301356, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Reader Questions and Responses: The Decline of Work", "col": "Nonemployed", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfd7\"", "article_summary": "The employment differences between working-class men and women are because women work in the growing-but-horrible low-wage service industries, not because women stole all of the machinist jobs from men.\nThis has resulted in older workers being \u201cpreferred\u201d targets of layoffs, not just their higher wages from longer work experience and higher rank.\nThe decline in work is concentrated among people younger than 55.\nNo doubt that the cost of health care can keep some older workers from getting or keeping a job.\nQ.
