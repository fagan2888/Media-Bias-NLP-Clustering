Muniz has used a similar technique throughout his career, \u201cdrawing\u201d portraits of sugar cane workers out of sugar, reproducing an image of action painter Jackson Pollack out of chocolate syrup and recreating Caravaggio\u2019s Medusa in spaghetti and tomato sauce. But soccer balls presented their own challenges, he said.\n\nFirst, the 52-year-old Muniz had to create his own ball, bone white on one side and pitch black on the other, to act as a sort of pixel. But the real difficulty was to decide what to draw with the balls, and the movie chronicles Muniz\u2019s struggle to find a soccer-related image that didn\u2019t feel like the logo of a sportswear label.\n\nAlthough soccer has a global following, Muniz said, it\u2019s all but absent in fine art \u2014 begging the question, \u201cWhy are we artists missing out on a subject that\u2019s so rich and complex?\u201d\n\nIn a bid to answer the question, Muniz delves into the history of not only the ball, but the sphere itself, interviewing astronomers from Harvard University and New York City\u2019s Hayden Planetarium about the great round clouds of gas that formed after the Big Bang. He also talks to the head of M.I.T.\u2019s self-assembly lab about the spherical shapes of viruses, bacteria and carbon atoms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazilian artist Muniz examines the soccer ball", "author": "Jenny Barchfield", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brazilian artist Muniz examines the soccer ball", "title": "Brazilian artist Muniz examines the soccer ball", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/brazilian_artist_muniz_examines_the_soccer_ball/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-wcup-soccer-film.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brazilian artist Muniz examines the soccer ball", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-wcup-soccer-film.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Brazilian artist Muniz examines the soccer ball", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Brazilian artist Muniz examines the soccer ball", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17e7\"", "article_summary": "But soccer balls presented their own challenges, he said.\n\u201cI am not an athlete \u2014 I\u2019m terribly inept at sport, which is probably why I became an artist,\u201d Muniz said at his Rio de Janeiro studio.\nThe idea behind the project was to place 10,000 soccer balls on the pitch of Mexico City\u2019s Azteca Stadium in such a way that when photographed from air they\u2019d form a recognizable image.\nFirst, the 52-year-old Muniz had to create his own ball, bone white on one side and pitch black on the other, to act as a sort of pixel.\nHe also talks to the head of M.I.T.\u2019s self-assembly lab about the spherical shapes of viruses, bacteria and carbon atoms."}
