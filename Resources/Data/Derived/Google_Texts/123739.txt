Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, who has led the Louisville Department of Public Health and Wellness since 2011, Monday was named health director for Washington, D.C.

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Nesbitt had made a significant impact on Louisville, from the creation of the Healthy Louisville 2020 plan to creating voluntary smoke-free policies at playgrounds and spraygrounds in city parks. Fischer said a search will begin immediately for a new leader.

"Dr. Nesbitt has been an incredible asset to our city and has worked tirelessly to improve the health of our residents," Fischer said. "She has also managed the health department with a constant focus on quality and performance improvement."

Nesbitt is returning to Washington, D.C., where she was worked in leadership positions in the health department before being tapped by Fischer in the first year of his administration.

In addition to her metro government role, Nesbitt also served on the faculty at the University of Louisville.

"As an academic, we are accustomed to viewing the departure of colleagues as a successful outcome," said Dr. Craig Blakely, dean of the university's School of Public Health and Information Sciences. "And while this is just another illustration of a colleague maturing and moving on to bigger and better opportunities, this loss is particularly hard to take."

Nesbitt's accomplishments in Louisville include:

•Created Healthy Louisville 2020, a communitywide plan to improve the health of Louisville residents by the year 2020.

•Launched healthylouisvillemetro.org an online tool to track community goals for improving Louisville's health.

•Served on the Board of Health ACA Steering Committee to facilitate implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through a communitywide effort to increase enrollment by overcoming barriers to success, educating the public on the appropriate uses of the health care system, assessing and anticipating workforce needs to care for those enrolled and evaluating outcomes.
