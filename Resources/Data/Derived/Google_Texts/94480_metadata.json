And some thought the senator\u2019s response was a game-changer.\n\n\u201c@JebBush\u2019s attack on @marcorubio was both a tactical and strategic failure. His campaign is cooked\u201d https://t.co/sI2qtTIq66 #CNBCGOPDebate \u2014 The Weekly Standard (@weeklystandard) October 29, 2015\n\nHere was predictable Jeb attack on Rubio. Backfired as Rubio calls him out for exactly what he\u2019s doing and double standard. #CNBCGOPDebate \u2014 AG (@AG_Conservative) October 29, 2015\n\nDuuuude. Rubio just ripped off Jeb\u2019s head and spat down his neck. #CNBCGOPDebate \u2014 Leon Wolf (@LeonHWolf) October 29, 2015\n\nIf Jeb\u2019s last jab sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it echoes a Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial hit piece on Tuesday. The Sentinel accused Rubio of \u201chating his job\u201d, and asking for his resignation was the mantra.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you hate your job, senator, follow the honorable lead of House Speaker John Boehner and resign it,\u201d the editorial stated.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are paid $174,000 per year to represent us, to fight for us, to solve our problems. Plus you take a $10,000 federal subsidy \u2014 declined by some in the Senate \u2014 to participate in one of the Obamacare health plans, though you are a big critic of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe editorial simply concludes, \u201cEither do your job, Sen. Rubio, or resign it.\u201d\n\nRubio, was clearly prepared for Jeb\u2019s attack and turned the tables on him, quickly pointing out how Bush is proudly modeling his campaign after John McCain \u2013 another senator who missed votes while on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only reason you\u2019re doing it now is because we\u2019re running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,\u201d Rubio said. The audience didn\u2019t miss a beat and let out a collective chuckle at the truth behind the statement.\n\nRubio\u2019s voting record was also a hot topic on social media where senior advisor to President Obama, Dan Pfeiffer, went so far to accuse Rubio of \u201cquitting.\u201d\n\n@michaelscherer Probably not, but most of the field in 08 was senators. Also difference between missing votes and quitting, which Rubio did \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) October 28, 2015\n\nOf course, McCain and Rubio are not the only Senators to miss votes as they worked towards their presidential aspirations. President Obama leads the charge in that position.\n\nComparing missed Senate votes: Obama 2007: 38% Hillary 2007: 23% Rubio 2015: 34% Cruz 2015: 24% (h/t @LPDonovan) #CNBCGOPDebate \u2014 AG (@AG_Conservative) October 29, 2015\n\nEven Pfeiffer had to backtrack his earlier tweet:\n\n@JRubinBlogger @michaelscherer I don\u2019t think it is a big deal, but harder to navigate for Rubio than Obama/Clinton \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) October 28, 2015\n\nRubio seems to be \u201cnavigating\u201d just fine.\n\nWritten by Nicole Haas and Frieda Powers.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Attacking presidential candidate Marco Rubio for missing Senate votes as become modus operandi for his opponents on both sides of the aisle, but after Rubio\u2019s impressive debate performance, that may well change.
