(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)\n\nIn 1994, when Republicans won the House for the first time in four decades, a band of fiscally conservative Democrats had a simple explanation: Their party had moved too far to the left.\n\nIn 2014, when Republicans shrunk Democratic numbers to their lowest since the end of World War II, a similar faction of fiscally conservative House Democrats came to a similar conclusion: The party\u2019s progressives weren\u2019t speaking to moderate voters. The current political environment, with its ongoing debate over how Democrats can win elections and ugly fights over the \u201csoul\u201d of the party, makes for interesting parallels to what was going on 20 years ago, when the Blue Dog Coalition was born.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned the same lesson \u2014 at least some of us have learned the same lesson,\u201d said Blue Dog Chairman Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. \u201cYou can\u2019t continue to ignore big chunks of the American voter because you have certain ideological ideas.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years, the Blue Dogs insist their mission is the same \u2014 they're just trying to save the Democratic Party from itself.\n\nSecret Origins Blue Dogs knew from the beginning they were doing something their leadership probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate.\n\nRep. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, a founding member who\u2019s also the longtime top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said the group started meeting secretly in 1994.\n\n\u201cWe could see the party was gonna drive us into a ditch,\u201d Peterson recalled.\n\nFiercely protective of its ideological purity and committed to preserving trust within the ranks, the Blue Dogs enforced a strict quota for membership and specific guidelines for admittance, even after going public in 1995.\n\nMembers were predominantly from the South \u2014 so much so that aspiring Blue Dogs from elsewhere seemed circumspect.\n\n\u201cIt was the Southerners, they thought anybody from Minnesota had to be a raving liberal. I had a couple buddies who helped get me in,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThe way the rules worked, people were invited one at a time. But any member could blackball you.\u201d\n\nFifteen years later, Schrader faced similar skepticism. The Oregonian applied for membership in 2010, at the plateau of Blue Dog prominence, and struggled to make his case at a time when, according to rules, the group couldn\u2019t exceed a quarter of the caucus.\n\nSchrader said he finally earned a spot when he revealed his nickname as Budget chairman in the Oregon Legislature: \u201cDarth Schrader.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, the Blue Dogs started with 23 members and quickly established themselves as players, putting forth welfare overhaul legislation and a budget resolution that won plaudits from Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo.\n\nIn 2006, Democrats won back the House; two years later, President Barack Obama won by a landslide. Democrats felt invincible, and in early 2010, Blue Dog membership topped 50 \u2014 a formidable bloc. Members were courted heavily to shore up votes for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s big-ticket items, most significantly the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat support would prove costly: In 2010, 26 Blue Dogs lost seats as Republicans reclaimed the House.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were all about the right message, we had a mandate, the Republicans are gonna be irrelevant again,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cOnly to find out the vote [that put Democrats back in power] was mostly against George [W.] Bush, not for Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nLimbo Years Every Democrat was demoralized after 2010, but Blue Dogs were incensed.\n\nAlong with other moderates in the caucus, remaining coalition members led a revolt. Forty-three Democrats voted against Pelosi for leader in a closed-door meeting that fall; the following January, 19 Democrats voted for someone other than the progressive California lawmaker, many for Rep. Heath Shuler, D-N.C.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful insurrection, the coalition\u2019s clout faded. Between 2010 and 2014, the Blue Dog ranks slimmed further as members retired. By 2013, membership had dropped below 20.\n\nWith smaller numbers, they endured greater criticism from progressives for frequently voting with Republicans.\n\n\u201cMy biggest frustration \u2026 was pure lack of understanding and appreciation for what it\u2019s like to run as a Democrat in some of these districts,\u201d said Jennifer Walsh, now the director of public affairs at Foley and Lardner who was a longtime chief of staff for Rep. Dennis Cardoza, D-Calif., a Blue Dog who retired in 2012.\n\nIn the last Congress, Blue Dogs stopped paying dues to fund a designated staff member and relaxed the application process. That attracted new members such as then-Rep. Nick J. Rahall II, D-W.Va., who faced a tough re-election bid.\n\n\u201cHe really joined ... I think for political reasons,\u201d recalled Blue Dog Co-Chairman Jim Costa, D-Calif. \u201cBut after six months, he saw he had more in common here. I don\u2019t know if he expected it, but he truly enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nRahall lost anyway, as did a Blue Dog stalwart, Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga.\n\n\u201cThe last white Southern Blue Dog,\u201d said Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., another current co-chairman. \u201cIt means the Democratic Party has a lot of work today in the South to reclaim our traditional territory.\u201d\n\nBlue Dogs Today One criticism of House Democratic leadership after last year's losses was a lack of self-reflection about what went wrong. But if anything was a warning sign for the party, Blue Dogs and moderates say it was Barrow\u2019s defeat.\n\n\u201cWhen Democrats do well and pick up seats it\u2019s because they\u2019re winning in these moderate, Blue Dog districts,\u201d said Walsh, who still has connections with the group across town. \u201cWhen we lose seats, it\u2019s because they\u2019re losing in those moderate Blue Dog districts. You can trace the size of the caucus with the size of the coalition.\u201d\n\nSchrader said there\u2019s growing recognition that Blue Dogs need to have a greater presence in campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re recruiting some candidates, we\u2019ve gone out of our way \u2026 to reach out to the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee], play a role a little bit in the recruitment, and play a little role \u2014 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re paying attention, to be dead honest \u2014 in the messaging,\u201d said Schrader, though a Blue Dog member.\n\n\u201cI get a sense from Ben Ray [Luj\u00e1n] \u2026 they know the difficult seats that are out there and the best kind of candidate for those swing seats, those difficult seats, are folks that would align themselves more as Blue Dogs,\u201d Costa said of the New Mexico Democrat who is the DCCC chairman.\n\nAnxiety over what went wrong in 2014 has led to a more vocal moderate presence in the House Democratic Caucus overall. In addition to the Blue Dogs, the more mainstream New Democrat Coalition has been more aggressive.\n\nThere are a number of Blue Dogs who also count themselves as New Democrats, a sign the group once dominated by white male Southerners is becoming, like the larger caucus itself, more diverse.\n\nOf the 15 current Blue Dogs, four are women, three are Latino and two are African-American. Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema is bisexual.\n\nThe group has resumed funding a designated staffer and revived the tradition of bringing speakers to weekly meetings.\n\nThere are still grumblings. Schrader said he has told Democratic leaders, \u201cI\u2019m going to encourage my members, unless I see some changes in the Democrat message, to vote against Democrats as often as we can to show not all Democrats are one big monolithic group.\u201d\n\nAnd Cooper still believes Blue Dog numbers would be greater if moderates weren\u2019t afraid of retribution: \u201cCommittee assignments, permissions to do lots of things that are in the discretion of party leadership \u2026 fundraising ability, lots of things are withheld from members who are not perfectly loyal.\u201d\n\nSchrader, however, holds out hope for change.\n\n\u201cThis is [the] beginning of a second chapter in Blue Dog history,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Centrist New Democrats Want Bigger Role in Party\u2019s Message Blue Dogs Add Four Members Most Blue Dogs Voted for Budget Deal \u2014 But Not a Key Leader The 114th: CQ Roll Call's Guide to the New Congress Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1994, when Republicans won\u00a0the House for the first time in four decades, a band of fiscally conservative Democrats had a simple explanation: Their party had moved too far to the left.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "In 1994, when Republicans won\u00a0the House for the first time in four decades, a band of fiscally conservative Democrats had a simple explanation: Their party had moved too far to the left.", "title": "20 Years In, Blue Dogs Not Ready to Roll Over", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/blue-dogs", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/05/schrader_200_032515-445x297.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-05-12T09:00:44Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "In 1994, when Republicans won\u00a0the House for the first time in four decades, a band of fiscally conservative Democrats had a simple explanation: Their party had moved too far to the left.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,author,category,CQToday Topic,democrats,uncategorized,icnw", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-05-12T09:00:44Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T09:00:44Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 1994, when Republicans won\u00a0the House for the first time in four decades, a band of fiscally conservative Democrats had a simple explanation: Their party had moved too far to the left.", "title": "20 Years In, Blue Dogs Not Ready to Roll Over", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/blue-dogs", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/05/schrader_200_032515-445x297.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8aa\"", "article_summary": "But if anything was a warning sign for the party, Blue Dogs and moderates say it was Barrow\u2019s defeat.\nI don\u2019t know if he expected it, but he truly enjoyed it.\u201dRahall lost anyway, as did a Blue Dog stalwart, Rep.
