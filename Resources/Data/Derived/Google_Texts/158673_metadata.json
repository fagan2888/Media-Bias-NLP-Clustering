(NTI) and the Canadian government have settled a nine-year-old, $1 billion lawsuit brought over alleged failures to implement key components of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA) reached in 1993.\n\nThe $255.5 million agreement, reached on March 5, was signed on May 4 as a way of ending the lawsuit, moving forward and compensating Inuit in Nunavut for the breaches, according to the Nunatsiaq News. The lawsuit was first filed in 2006.\n\nEmployment training for Inuit will take up $175 million of the funds, with NTI investing the other $80.5 million, the Nunatsiaq News said. The settlement was reached just before a March trial would have started.\n\n\u201cThis is an historic moment for Inuit,\u201d said NTI President Cathy Towtongie in a statement at the signing. \u201cNTI and Inuit now have prospects for a restored and more productive partnership. NTI hopes that this settlement agreement will open a new chapter in our relationship with the Government of Canada and the GN, and that Inuit will be able to further take advantage of the promises contained in the NLCA.\u201d\n\nMinister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Bernard Valcourt admitted the government had \u201cdropped the ball\u201d in 2003 in failing to renew a 10-year implementation contract for the agreement, the Nunatsiaq News said.\n\nThe lawsuit had centered around the section of the NLCA pertaining to Article 23, which mandates affirmative action programs and other measures to enable Inuit to work in government, the Nunatsiaq News explained. This was to be in effect until the proportion of Inuit working in government was the same\u201485 percent\u2014as that in the general Nunavut population. Though money had been spent to that end from 1993 to 1999, NTI claimed that once Nunavut Territory was officially created on April 1, 1999, the money stopped flowing.\n\nAmong other changes, the settlement creates a new type of dispute resolution process, NTI said in a statement, as well as new contracting measures that will enable the hiring of more Inuit in government roles. In addition, Ottawa will spend $50 million above and beyond the $255.5 million settlement amount to pay for training programs for Inuit over the next eight years, the Nunatsiaq News said. That includes conducting a labor force analysis.\n\n\u201cOur government remains focused on jobs, growth and economic prosperity for all Canadians,\u201d said Valcourt in the NTI statement. \u201cToday\u2019s signing ceremony is a clear demonstration of our government\u2019s commitment to moving forward and working with our partners to implement the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement so that ultimately, we can unlock new economic opportunities and create jobs for Nunavummiut.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are pleased the settlement has been finalized, and are committed to working with NTI in advancing initiatives that further support training of Inuit within the GN Public Service, as outlined in Article 23 of the NLCA,\u201d said Nunavut Premier Peter Taptuna, who signed the agreement along with Towtongie and Valcourt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the land claims organization of the Inuit, has settled a decade-old lawsuit with Ottawa over land claims for $255.5 million.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/25/nunavut-inuit-group-settles-ottawa-lawsuit-2555-million-160482", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/inuit_settlement_signing-nunavut_tunngavick.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Nunavut Inuit Group Settles Ottawa Lawsuit for $255.5 Million"}, "abstract": "Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the land claims organization of the Inuit, has settled a decade-old lawsuit with Ottawa over land claims for $255.5 million.", "dc": {"title": "Nunavut Inuit Group Settles Ottawa Lawsuit for $255.5 Million"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/25/nunavut-inuit-group-settles-ottawa-lawsuit-2555-million-160482", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik, Inuit, Canadian Inuit, Land Claims Settlement, Canadian Land Claims, Economic Development, Employment", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-25T17:45-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Nunavut Inuit Group Settles Ottawa Lawsuit for $255.5 Million"}, "article_summary": "In addition, Ottawa will spend $50 million above and beyond the $255.5 million settlement amount to pay for training programs for Inuit over the next eight years, the Nunatsiaq News said.\nEmployment training for Inuit will take up $175 million of the funds, with NTI investing the other $80.5 million, the Nunatsiaq News said.\nThis was to be in effect until the proportion of Inuit working in government was the same\u201485 percent\u2014as that in the general Nunavut population.\nThe $255.5 million agreement, reached on March 5, was signed on May 4 as a way of ending the lawsuit, moving forward and compensating Inuit in Nunavut for the breaches, according to the Nunatsiaq News.\n\u201cThis is an historic moment for Inuit,\u201d said NTI President Cathy Towtongie in a statement at the signing."}
