Accenture Plc’s U.S.-government contracting arm plans to buy Agilex Technologies Inc. to expand in cloud-computing services for the country’s federal authorities.

The purchase of closely held Agilex by Accenture Federal Services will also add to the consulting firm’s digital analytics and mobility operations for government agencies, the Dublin-based company said in a statement. Terms of the takeover aren’t being disclosed, it said.

“We see digital technologies fundamentally changing the way that government organizations operate and interact with citizens, patients, employees, suppliers, partners and other stakeholders,” Mike Sutcliff, head of Accenture’s digital division, said in the statement.

Agilex, based in Chantilly, Virginia, has a workforce of about 900 people whose clients include the U.S. departments of defense, homeland security, justice and veterans affairs as well as the U.S. Postal Service and the Amtrak railway, according to its website. Accenture Federal Services’ contracts include an early 2014 agreement to take over management of the U.S. government’s healthcare.gov Obamacare enrollment website.
