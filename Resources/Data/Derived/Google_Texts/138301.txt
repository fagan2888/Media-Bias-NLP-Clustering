Memorial Day holds a special place in the hearts of many. It's a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country. The grounds of the Mississippi Veterans Cemetery in Newton was full of families, friends, and servicemen who were there to do just that, honor each and every life.

"Doing these ceremonies for the family members and the veterans that are still here, you can't put words into it," said Cemetery Director Timothy Lockey. " I just can't say what the meaning is in my heart for this. When the army was playing the taps, of course I had to cry, that was just really heartfelt."

As many in attendance touched the memorials of those who died serving their country, tears filled their eyes, but the sacrifice they made for the freedom of many doesn't go unnoticed.

"It makes us all appreciate anew, what these men and women have gone through to make sure that we still have the opportunity to live in a country as free as the United States," said Major General Augustus Collins. " United States is different from any other country on the face of this Earth, but it's different because we have the freedoms that's been guaranteed to us because of the blood and the lives that have been laid down on the battlefields."

Several Gold Star Mothers were on hand to lay a memorial wreath during the ceremony in honor of those who fought the fight, friends and family members say they may be gone, but their legacy will always live on. Several groups of women even attend many events to do just that, remember their legacy.

"They will never be forgotten," said Ladies Auxiliary President Vanessa Duett. " That's why we come out to attend all events, memorials, because we don't want people to forget."
