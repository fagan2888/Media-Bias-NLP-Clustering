Up until recently, 33-year-old Amanda Meyer was a case manager for Oklahoma County’s Drug Court.

“I love seeing them improve their lives and get reunited with their children,” she said Saturday afternoon.

Meyer learned on Easter she was pregnant. She and her husband Ryan had wanted children for some time. However, a month later that joy turned into something entirely different.

Severe abdomen pain led Meyer her to a local emergency room in May.

Doctors performed two surgeries on a blockage in Meyer’s colon. She says they were surprised the baby lived through both surgeries.

However, doctors also discovered Meyer has stage IV colon cancer. Stage IV is the most advanced kind.

Meyer is about to start a third round of chemotherapy at Integris’ Cancer Institute in Oklahoma City.

Because she has been able to carry her baby daughter, she and her husband have named Ahna Marie Lynn for 23 weeks now.

Meyers said even if her daughter is born several weeks early, Ahna Marie Lynn still has a chance.

Meyer was comforted by an ultra-sound a few weeks ago of her baby in her womb.

“She looks like she’s smiling like she’s saying it’s going to be okay Mom and Dad,” Meyer said.

As for Meyer’s future, she says doctors give her maybe two years to live.

“I’m going to be one of those miracle stories, and talk about our miracle baby, and live to tell our story,” she said

She also urges everyone to get screened for colorectal cancer.

“I’m 33 and this is not genetic. And people will tell you, doctors will tell you you’re too young and the screening age isn’t until age 50, and I really didn’t have any symptoms, and here I am, stage IV," Meyer said.
