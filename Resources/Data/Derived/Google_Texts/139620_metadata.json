He went after self proclaimed tea party activist and writer Larry Klayman with help from MSNBC contributor Dr. James Peterson in a typical, badgering, interruptive, \u201cjust say racist\u201d style attack from the liberal media.\n\nIn an Oct. 18 interview, Klayman, who spoke at the recent veteran led rally attended by Ted Cruz, and Sarah Palin among others, was attacked for his book and his comments on Barack Obama who he sees as putting Muslims ahead of Americans and as a man who cares little about his people.\n\nBashir not only asserted Klayman is a racist without anything to suggest it, but he went so far as to call Klayman\u2019s anti-Obama opinions \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201ca form of psychiatric pathology, an illness?\u201d\n\nKlayman\u2019s book \u201cWhores: Why and How I came to Fight the Establishment\u201d was also a topic of contention. In it, he calls \u201cthose who sell out their nation for money, power and fame,\u201d whores. Not shy about his claim, he told Bashir that both parties currently fit the bill.\n\n\u201cWho is the whore in your opinion. Is it Ted Cruz or Mitch McConnell?\u201d Bashir asked in an effort to put words in Klayman\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell has sold out the American people. So I would characterize him in that group because he does not represent the interests of the conservative movement, the libertarian movement, or for that matter, any other movement,\u201d Klayman said, fighting to get a word in.\n\nBashir ran a clip of Klayman\u2019s remarks at the recent rally during which Klayman said Obama \u201cbows down to Allah,\u201d and asked for the president \u201cto put the Quran down, to get off his knees and to figuratively come out with his hands up.\u201d\n\nBashir called those remarks \u201crepugnant smears and slurs\u201d and \u201cthe acts of a \u201crabble rouser.\u201d He then asked Klayman \u201cwho\u2019s the whore now?\u201d\n\nThis despite the fact that Klayman explained that his remarks were metaphorical in nature and that the \u201cclip was clipped,\u201d so that his sentence was cut short.\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n[poll id=\u201d128\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "That British moralist and MSNBC anchor Martin Bashir is up to his mainstream rhetoric again.
