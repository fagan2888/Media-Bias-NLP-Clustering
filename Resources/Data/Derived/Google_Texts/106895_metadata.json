But Koster contended that increasing the state\u2019s tobacco tax made sense and could attract public support, if it\u2019s for the right reason.\n\nSince 2002, Missouri voters have rejected three different proposals for increasing the state\u2019s tobacco tax \u2013 now 17 cents a pack \u2013 to raise money for various state spending proposals, many of them related to health care.\n\nKoster said he believed that another pitch to the public might be successful if the proposed tobacco-tax increase centered on \u201ca single idea, a single state need.\u201d\n\nKoster told Democrats that the public\u2019s choice, in this case, would then be whether to improve access to higher education or allow Missouri to continue to be a national haven for \u201ccheap cigarettes.\u201d\n\nKoster said he was flexible on how large of a tobacco-tax hike he would support, but he pointed to the 2012 proposal that would have increased the state's tobacco taxes by 73 cents a pack, which would have raised roughly $300 million a year.\n\nHe emphasized that the proposal for hiking the tobacco tax for college scholarships originated with state Treasurer Clint Zweifel, a fellow Democrat who has been concerned for some time about Missouri\u2019s decline in higher-education spending and its impact. Zweifel has proposed college scholarships to state schools for any student with a 3.0 grade average or above. Koster said he and Zweifel are working together to come up with a tobacco-tax proposal.\n\nIn theory, the General Assembly could approve a proposal to put before voters. But Koster believes that legislators are unlikely to do so, and that an initiative-petition drive may be needed to get such a proposal on the ballot.\n\nCalls for more bipartisanship, less rancor\n\nKoster acknowledged in an interview afterward that his embrace of Zweifel\u2019s plan means that the attorney general is revamping his own, earlier call to earmark part of any tobacco-tax hike to help Missouri businesses.\n\nThe attorney general said he still supports those business proposals, but he plans to propose other ways to pay for them in the coming months.\n\nKoster also sought to use his focus on education to illustrate how, lately, Missouri state government has failed.\n\nIn his speech, Koster explained that he has spent the last few months quietly visiting each of the state\u2019s 20 community colleges to meet with top school officials and tour their campuses.\n\nDuring those stops, he said, \u201cI was struck with a sense of amazement that nearly every one of these colleges, billions of dollars in state assets, were constructed in a focused burst of energy in the late 1960s.\u201d\n\nThe catalyst, said Koster, had been education-related legislation approved by the General Assembly in 1961.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struck by the realization that once upon a time, a bipartisan decision made in our state capital created 20 colleges in the matter of a few years,\u201d Koster continued.\n\n\u201cMy wonder comes from knowing that there was once a day when this state legislature, and our state\u2019s political system, actually worked, when our ideals and our ability to act as one came together, and we could achieve big things that benefited all the citizens of our state.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, people know that there\u2019s something wrong in Jefferson City,\u2019\u2019 Koster went on. \u201cThey know the bones of government still exists there on the banks of the Missouri River. But the optimism that constructed those colleges, the confidence that state government is for all of us, and not for a privileged few\u2026often seems a distant memory.\u201d\n\nAt odds with Sinquefield?\n\nKoster reaffirmed his longstanding call for expanding the state's Medicaid program, as sought by the federal Affordable Care Act, saying that the expansion is \"probably the best economic development proposal that has been placed on the table in 25 years.\"\n\nHe cited Kentucky's recent report showing what a boon that Medicaid expansion has been for the state and its economy -- as well as to the business climate.\n\nOverall, Koster's address Saturday was his first substantive policy speech since laying out his business proposals last fall to the St. Louis Regional Chamber.\n\nWhile emphasizing his support for aiding business, Koster indicated that he\u2019s not keen on granting them additional tax cuts \u2013 a stance that appears to put him at odds with wealthy financier Rex Sinquefield, a tax-cut supporter who predicted last week that Koster would cut more taxes if he\u2019s elected governor.\n\nSinquefield had been a major donor to Koster in his campaigns for attorney general, although the financier has switched his allegience to Republican Catherine Hanaway for governor. Sinquefield has donated at least $1 million to her campaign.\n\nKoster said Saturday that while he supported the tax-cut plan approved by the General Assembly last year, he won\u2019t support any additional cuts in the short term.\n\nKoster contended that the Republican-dominated General Assembly first must fully fund the aid program \u2013 called the \u201cfoundation formula\u2019\u2019 \u2013 for kindergarten through high school.\n\nThat program is $500 million underfunded, Koster said, emphasizing that the current formula was crafted by Republicans a decade ago. The GOP\u2019s failure to follow through with its own school-spending program is \u201cshort-sighted,\u2019\u2019 Koster added.\n\nKoster noted that the multi-year tax-cut plan approved in 2014 won\u2019t begin going into effect until 2017. He said it was \u201cway premature\u2019\u2019 to call for more cuts until it\u2019s clear how the already enacted tax cuts affect the state budget and the economy.\n\nIn that context, Koster noted that when the current foundation formula was adopted, he was one of the Republicans who voted for it. In 2007, he switched parties.\n\nDemocrats seek to address rural losses\n\nAlthough Democrats continue to hold most of Missouri\u2019s statewide offices, the General Assembly\u2019s huge Republican majority highlights the rural edge that the GOP continues to enjoy.\n\nSaturday\u2019s traditional morning press conference, featuring rural Democratic legislators, offered a stark illustration of the change.\n\nThe news conference was held as scheduled, but no legislators showed up. That's because northeast Missouri no longer has any Democratic rural legislators. The few remaining holdouts were replaced by Republicans last November.\n\nFormer state Auditor Susan Montee, a Democrat who hails from rural western Missouri, told Saturday's Democrat Days brunch crowd that she hopes to help turn things around. She was introduced this weekend as the chairman of Missouri Democrats' new rural caucus.\n\n\u201cIn rural Missouri, that\u2019s where we\u2019re losing,\u2019\u2019 Montee said bluntly. While some blame the 2011 legislative redistricting, which crafted a number of Republican strongholds, Montee told the crowd that more favorable district maps would still have left Democrats in the minority in the state House and Senate.\n\n\u201cTo take back the majority, we are going to have to get new Democrats,\u201d she said.\n\nState Democratic Party executive director Crystal Brinkley, who\u2019s originally from Milan, Mo., said the party is focused on bolstering Democratic organizations in each of the state\u2019s rural counties and heightening the party\u2019s rural profile.\n\nThe internet and social media will play key roles in that effort, Brinkley said. \u201cWe\u2019re rebuilding from the ground up.\u201d\n\nKoster, who has been playing a major role in revamping state Democratic operations, said the aim also needs to be \u201cbroadening the Democratic message and allowing for more flexibility\u201d \u2013 especially on social issues such as guns and reproductive rights.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "HANNIBAL, Mo. \u2014 Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster is calling for a sharp increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax \u2014 now the nation\u2019s lowest \u2014 to pay for a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/koster-embraces-increase-tobacco-tax-pay-college-scholarships", "image": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/sites/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201411/Ferguson%2C_Stenger%2C_Koster_026.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "HANNIBAL, Mo. \u2014 Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster is calling for a sharp increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax \u2014 now the nation\u2019s lowest \u2014 to pay for a", "title": "Koster embraces increase in tobacco tax to pay for college scholarships"}, "story_id": 391517436, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Koster embraces increase in tobacco tax to pay for college scholarships"}, "nid": 43949, "datePublished": "2015-03-07", "keywords": "Chris Koster, Missouri Democratic Party, St. Louis Regional Chamber", "wordCount": 1522, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cab\"", "article_summary": "But Koster contended that increasing the state\u2019s tobacco tax made sense and could attract public support, if it\u2019s for the right reason.\nMissouri\u2019s educational and economic future is at risk if higher education spending isn\u2019t addressed, he said.\nKoster also sought to use his focus on education to illustrate how, lately, Missouri state government has failed.\n\u2014 Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster is calling for a sharp increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax \u2014 now the nation\u2019s lowest \u2014 to pay for a scholarship program to lower tuition at the state\u2019s colleges and universities.\n\u201cIn rural Missouri, that\u2019s where we\u2019re losing,\u2019\u2019 Montee said bluntly."}
