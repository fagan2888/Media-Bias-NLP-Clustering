His reasons: the growing national debt, ISIS, and the U.S. Senate\u2019s refusal to consider legislation passed by the GOP-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nHost Chris Wallace noted that in light of his potential presidential campaign, Carson\u2019s previous comments were now under a greater spotlight. He noted Carson\u2019s August comment that if the Republicans don\u2019t win a majority in the Senate this year, the 2016 elections might not even be held and asked the retired neurosurgeon if he stood by it:\n\nWALLACE: You said recently that there might not even be elections in 2016 because of widespread anarchy. Do you really believe that? CARSON: I hope that that\u2019s not going to be the case. But certainly there\u2019s the potential because you have to recognize that we have a rapidly increasing national debt, a very unstable financial foundation, and you have all these things going on like the ISIS crisis that could very rapidly change things that are going on in our nation. And unless we begin to deal with these things in a comprehensive way and in a logical way there is no telling what could happen in just a couple of years.\n\nCarson then noted that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has \u201cover three hundred bills sitting on his desk\u201d that he won\u2019t bring to the floor for a vote, \u201cthereby thwarting the will of the people.\u201d He made no mention of the Republican House\u2019s refusal to consider popular Senate-passed bipartisan measures like comprehensive immigration reform and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n\nCarson finished a close second Saturday in a straw poll at the 2014 Values Voters Summit for 2016 presidential preferences.\n\nDespite Carson\u2019s fears, the United States has held presidential elections every four years since 1788, despite a civil war, two world wars, and a great depression. Carson has been no stranger to controversial comments since he became active in politics. In March of 2013, he compared same-sex marriage to bestiality and NAMBLA. That October, he decried the Affordable Care Act as \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d adding that the law \u201cis slavery, in a way.\u201d And earlier this month, Carson defended former Baltimore Raven Ray Rice, saying people should stop \u201cdemonizing\u201d him and suggesting that his wife also shared some of the blame for being attacked, opining that \u201cthey both need some help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Carson is also worried that the nation will devolve into anarchy because Sen.
