Nashville, TN -- The IRS has given $750 million tax dollars to illegal immigrants.

It's all in a report released this month saying the money has been given in the form of Obamacare subsidies though the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

This money has been handed over without any proof of citizenship!

Fox 17 News has reported that billions of dollars in the taxes we pay are going to the wrong people and a new report this month adds illegal immigrants to the list.

Congressman Diane Black (R-TN, 6th District) says, "We're talking about 500,000 individuals who are unverified immigration status that have received this."

The Senate Homeland Security Committee released the report saying the CMS gave about $750 million in Obamacare subsidies.

Then after payment, they failed to prove their citizenship or legal residency status.

Health and Human Services (HHS) has since removed these people from getting Obamacare.

HHS says it's working to get that money back but that's an idea Congressman Black is not buying.

"The law says that the IRS can go and retrieve this money. We know by history.. this money will never be retrieved."

Congressman Black is demanding to know what is being done by HHS to get that money back.

She's also working on a bill that would not allow subsidy payments without verification and trying to get more of her colleagues in support.
