The U.S. is now $18 TRILLION in debt.\n\nIn February of 2014, CNS News reported that \u201cThe debt of the U.S. government has increased $6,666 trillion since President Barack Obama took office on January 20, 2009, according to the latest numbers released by the Treasury Department.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has been responsible for more debt over the course of his two terms to date than all previous U.S. Presidents in the first 227 years combined.\n\nWriting in the Daily Caller, Tracy Miller, an associate professor at Grove City College, noted that \u201cOver the first five years of Obama\u2019s presidency, the U.S. economy grew more slowly than during any five-year period since just after the end of World War II, averaging less than 1.3 percent per year. If we leave out the sharp recession of 1945-46 following World War II, Obama looks even worse, ranking dead last among all Presidents since 1932.\u201d\n\nWhy was this man reelected in 2012? One is inclined to find common ground with ObamaCare \u201carchitect\u201d, Jonathan Gruber, who called voters \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nI prefer to believe, however, that the voters have been subjected to a non-stop campaign in the national media to get the first black American elected President and then to ignore some truly horrible facts about his two terms in office thus far.\n\nThe voters are not stupid, but they have been deliberately misled by the careful exclusion of news about the actual state of the economy.\n\nReality caught up with Obama in the two midterm elections of 2012 and 2014. The voters shifted power in Congress to the Republican Party. In the most recent midterms thirteen of the Senators who had voted for ObamaCare were defeated.\n\nAs December began, CNS News reported that \u201cThe labor force participation rate remained at a 36-year low of 62.8 percent in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u201d\n\nThe BLS measures the percentage of \u201cnon-institutional population\u201d in the labor force, those 16 years or older who were not in the military or working in a governmental job, i.e. the private sector. In September, the rate was the lowest since February 1978!\n\nTo put this in perspective, by November, the number of beneficiaries on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u2014food stamps\u2014had topped 46,000,000 for 36 straight months according to data released by the Department of Agriculture. The Census Bureau reports that there are 115,048,000 households in the nation as of August 2014. That means the number of households on food stamps equaled 19.75% of all the households in the nation; one out of five. Those on this program outnumber the entire populations of nations such as Poland or Argentina.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. On December 3 CNS News reported \u201cThe total number of people in the United States now receiving federal disability benefits hit a record 10,982,920 in November, up from the previous record set in May, according to newly released data from the Social Security Administration.\u201d\n\nHow bad is the U.S. economy? In August, CNS News\u2019 Terence P. Jeffrey reported that \u201c109,631,000 Americans lived in households that received benefits from one or more federally funded \u2018means-tested programs\u2019\u2014also known as welfare\u2014as of the fourth quarter of 2012.\u201d The data came from the Census Bureau. That was the same year Obama was reelected and it represented 35.4% of the entire U.S. population at the time. By the end of 2012, it had increased to 49.5%!\n\nMeans-tested government programs include Social Security, Medicare, railroad retirement, unemployed compensation, worker\u2019s compensation, Veteran\u2019s compensation and Veteran\u2019s educational assistance. The largest of these programs are Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhy does the U.S. have an $18 TRILLION dollar debt?\n\nConsider that, in fiscal year 2013, the federal government paid out more than $2 TRILLION in benefits and entitlements according to data from the Bureau of the Fiscal Services\u2019 Monthly Treasury Statement. You don\u2019t have to be a mathematician to conclude that, if more Americans were working, there would be less need for many of the benefits programs and the largest among them would be more financially sound.\n\nNews of new jobs is always welcome, but it hides the deeper problem of too many unemployed and while Congress continues to debate what to do about Obama\u2019s effort to give work permits to illegal aliens and protect them from deportation, the Center for Immigration Studies announced in June that \u201cSince the year 2000 all of the net increase in the number of working-age (16 to 65) people holding a job has gone to immigrants (legal and illegal).\u201d\n\nShould the U.S. make five million or more illegal aliens eligible to compete for jobs with its native-born and naturalized population?\n\nThe U.S. must pay billions in interest on its debt. The failure of Congress to address the need to reform the tax code, reduce the deluge of regulations negatively affecting the business and industrial sector, and get control over spending has dug the nation a very deep and dangerous hole.\n\nStatistics can be daunting, but we all can feel that something is terribly wrong with the economy despite the news about a vigorous Wall Street. The fact remains that Main Street is in trouble. The nation requires an economy in which new businesses are created and existing ones can afford to expand. That is not happening.\n\nThat is why we are Number Two.\n\nc Alan Caruba\n\nAbout:\n\nAlan Caruba\u2019s commentaries are posted daily at \u201cWarning Signs\u201d his popular blog and thereafter on dozens of other websites and blogs.
