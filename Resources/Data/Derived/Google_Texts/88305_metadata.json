A teenager is dead after being shot in the head late Friday night, and Meridian police have one suspect charged for his murder.\n\n\"We do have one suspect that's been charged in this case,\" Det. Dareall Thompson says. \"Lyndell Pritchard, we've charged him with murder and also two counts of receiving stolen firearms.\"\n\nThe shooting happened close to midnight in a parking lot in the 200 block of 35th Avenue in Meridian. The victim was a 19-year-old boy who has not yet been identified. MPD patrol units responded quickly to the scene. Meridian Police are not yet releasing details on exactly what happened, but a family member tells me off-camera that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, that two individuals were arguing and he got in the way of that gunfire.\n\nThe MPD took Lyndell Pritchard into custody in the 2600 block of Highland Avenue just a few hours after the murder.\n\n\"Based on some witnesses who were able to give a lot of information, we were able to track the suspect down,\" Det. Thompson says. \"At that time the Gang Task Force took him into custody.\"\n\nThe Gang Task Force and Violent Crime Unit took Pritchard in after finding him in possession of stolen guns. There is no bond for his murder charge.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Meridian Police have charged one person for the murder of a teenager on Independence Day.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Meridian Police have charged one person for the murder of a teenager on Independence Day.", "title": "Police Charge Suspect With Murder of Teenager", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/265917281.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/1F2/664/1F2664A73F634AAE931258403279BB51", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0FD/F7A/0FDF7AC037AD4B5BB98D06EB42516D40.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Meridian Police have charged one person for the murder of a teenager on Independence Day.", "title": "Police Charge Suspect With Murder of Teenager", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/265917281.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/arresttttt+(640x577).jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Police Charge Suspect With Murder of Teenager", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Police Charge Suspect With Murder"}, "article_summary": "A teenager is dead after being shot in the head late Friday night, and Meridian police have one suspect charged for his murder.\nThe Gang Task Force and Violent Crime Unit took Pritchard in after finding him in possession of stolen guns.\nThe MPD took Lyndell Pritchard into custody in the 2600 block of Highland Avenue just a few hours after the murder.\n\"Lyndell Pritchard, we've charged him with murder and also two counts of receiving stolen firearms.\"\n\"We do have one suspect that's been charged in this case,\" Det."}
