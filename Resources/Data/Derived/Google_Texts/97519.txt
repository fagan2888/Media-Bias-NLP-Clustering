SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — Officials ordered people in about 30 homes to evacuate Friday evening as a wildfire roared through a canyon in Southern California’s Cleveland National Forest.

The homes were at the bottom of Silverado Canyon, where a fire that erupted earlier in the day had burned through 2 square miles of drought-dried brush in the midst of a heat wave. No residences were immediately threatened, and the evacuation was precautionary, fire officials said.

The fire had been burning uphill and away from the homes all day but there was a chance that a down-canyon wind could spring up after sunset, Orange County fire Capt. Mike Petro said.

“We don’t anticipate any heavy winds. It would be light to moderate if they occur,” he said.

About 300 firefighters, aided by aircraft, battled the flames, which sent up a towering column of smoke that could be seen for miles.
