Below the surface, it is a nightmarish accounting of the moral dilemmas of the scientists at the time, moving us to ask the same profound questions.\n\n\u201cManhattan,\u201d premiering July 27 on WGN, works its magic through a talented cast and a taut script. No zombies, no dragons. Just a well crafted, historically based drama that conveys the anxieties of the U.S. during World War II, the bias against women and minorities in general and female scientists in particular, the super secrecy of the project and the runaway egos at war in an unnatural little village, \u201cHarvard with sand,\u201d in the New Mexico desert.\n\nThe first two episodes left me craving more.\n\nIn the same way that \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d uses science as a backdrop, \u201cManhattan\u201d features scientists in the desert of Los Alamos, N.M., racing to develop the world\u2019s first atomic bomb, while wrestling with themselves about the moral implications of their research.\n\nIn Los Alamos, which didn\u2019t exist on any map, the military kept secrets from the recruits, the husbands and wives kept secrets from each other, the race was purportedly against the Germans and Japanese, but in fact it was also against the other guys in New Mexico, working to develop the bomb first.\n\nThe scientists were treated as genius babies, there to work but not to express opinions. Occasional blasts in the desert were to be ignored.\n\nThis may have been the original \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d where staff was expected to keep up the pretense of a patriotic little town in the middle of nowhere. Credit creator-writer Sam Shaw (\u201cMasters of Sex\u201d) and director Thomas Schlamme (\u201cThe West Wing\u201d) with bringing that world to life in a truly affecting way.\n\nJohn Benjamin Hickey (\u201cThe Big C,\u201d \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d) is magnetic as Frank Winter who, along with his high-IQ team, has been recruited for a project so classified that he can\u2019t know what it is.\n\nOlivia Williams (\u201cRushmore,\u201d \u201cThe Ghost Writer\u201d) is charming as Frank\u2019s wife Liza Winter, a scientist in her own right whose interest in botany will lead to frightening discoveries about the local environment.\n\nThey are the central couple, but others have equally riveting stories.\n\nBattles over status, romance and personal secrets complicate the lives of the super-smart patriots tasked with inventing the recipe that will allow the U.S. to obliterate parts of the world. They labor over formulas on chalk boards, lose sleep over the implications of what they\u2019re doing, test their theories with bombs in the desert and lie to friends and family about what they do all day.\n\nDaniel Stern (\u201cHome Alone,\u201d \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d) plays the more senior boss Glen Babbit, using his connections and experience to mentor the young scientists. (He plays Babbit as particularly ancient.)\n\nAshley Zuckerman plays Charlie Isaacs, a wunderkind who learns the art of deception as he maneuvers the politics of Los Alamos. Rachel Brosnahan (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d) plays his wife Abby, who initially can\u2019t believe she\u2019s landed in this place and wants to bolt; she gains confidence and becomes a leader among the other wives.\n\nKatja Herbers (\u201cDe Storm\u201d) as Helen Prins, one of the few female scientists, is an enigma in early episodes; her colleagues can\u2019t figure her out and, thus far, neither can viewers. Her story has great potential.\n\nThe accomplished supporting cast includes Harry Lloyd (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) as Paul Crosley, Michael Chernus (\u201cThe Big C,\u201d \u201cOrange Is The New Black\u201d) as Louis \u201cFritz\u201d Fedowitz, and Eddie Shin (\u201cMen of a Certain Age\u201d) as Sid Liao.\n\nNevermind the vintage cars, music and WWII-era wardrobe. They add to the charm, but this drama goes well beyond the visual appeal of a period piece.\n\n\u201cManhattan\u201d finds rich drama in its characters\u2019 dilemmas. Along the way it explores the very real fear of losing the world war, examines the price of secrecy within families and on the part of government, weighs the evolution of gender roles and reminds us of the place of science in American history.\n\nSetting up unexpected conflicts, the story roots its fictional characters firmly in historical fact.\n\nIf viewers sense modern relevance in the story\u2019s concerns about government secrecy or the push-pull of science and morality, that is a very intentional coincidence.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cManhattan\u201d on WGN, set in 1940s Los Alamos, is an ambitious drama", "title": "\u201cManhattan\u201d on WGN, set in 1940s Los Alamos, is an ambitious drama", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/17/manhattan-on-wgn-set-in-1940s-los-alamos-is-an-ambitious-drama/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140717__BN20140720_Z00_BNAE20TVOSTROW1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140717__BN20140720_Z00_BNAE20TVOSTROW1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-17T12:05:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:05:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A beautifully executed 1940s period drama about the men and women involved in the top-secret Manhattan Project is at once transporting and provocative.\n\u201cManhattan,\u201d premiering July 27 on WGN, works its magic through a talented cast and a taut script.\nAshley Zuckerman plays Charlie Isaacs, a wunderkind who learns the art of deception as he maneuvers the politics of Los Alamos.\nThey add to the charm, but this drama goes well beyond the visual appeal of a period piece.\nVisually stunning, at first it seems a dreamy trip to the past with a range of engaging characters and a Big Band soundtrack."}
