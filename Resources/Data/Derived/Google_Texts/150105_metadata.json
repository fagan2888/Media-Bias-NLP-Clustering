In actuality, it was lye, an odorless, highly toxic chemical the restaurant uses to degrease deep fryers. Tom Richmond, a professor of chemistry at the University of Utah, told ABC News the chemical is also found in drain cleaners and could dissolve a person\u2019s insides.\n\nHarding sustained esophageal burns from the beverage, and ABC reported doctors are working to see if she also sustained tears to both her esophagus and stomach. The owner of the Dickey's Harding visited released a statement saying that he\u2019s praying for Harding and won\u2019t release the specifics out of respect for her and her family.\n\nThough an isolated incident, the million dollar question is how something like this could happen. Investigators know so far that the chemical was in the food prep area when an employee mistook it for powdered sugar (lye is also available in liquid form). Dickey\u2019s is still open, and there is no word on whether or not said employee still works there.\n\nThese are very particular circumstances, but consumers are more likely to consume toxic tea than they might think. A study conducted by EuroFins, an analytic testing company, found 91 percent of Celestial Seasonings teas contained illegal levels of pesticides.\n\nCollective Evolution ran with the study and looked to see if any other teas frequently sold in-stores are contaminated, too. And of course there are. Tetley, Bigelow, Mighty Leaf, Teavana, Tazo, and David\u2019s Tea were among the worst offenders.\n\nManufacturers get away with this by masking questionable ingredients as \u201cnatural additives\u201d on their nutrition label, including Natural Red #4.\n\nPractice Safe Tea\n\nAgain, investigators report this is an isolated incident. But generally speaking, too much sweet tea, whether it\u2019s from a restaurant or grocery store, can increase your risk for kidney stones as a result of a naturally occurring chemical called high oxalate content, according to Dr. Lee Hammontree, of the Urology Centers of Alabama. It inhibits calcium absorption.\n\nFast food sweet tea nearly contains the same amount of calories and sugar as a regular 12-ounce soda. Unsweetened varieties would be the healthier option.\n\nAnd when navigating store aisles, CE recommends options from trustworthy companies such as Teatulia, Numi and Traditional Medicinals.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sweet tea, iced tea, drano", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The toxic chemical at a Utah restaurant, accidentally mixed into a sweet tea dispenser, can dissolve a person's insides.", "title": "How A Single Glass Of Sweet Tea Landed One Woman In The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-hospitalized-burnt-esophagus-after-drinking-sweet-tea-laced-toxic-chemical-used-298222", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/sweet-iced-tea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The toxic chemical at a Utah restaurant, accidentally mixed into a sweet tea dispenser, can dissolve a person's insides.", "title": "How A Single Glass Of Sweet Tea Landed One Woman In The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-hospitalized-burnt-esophagus-after-drinking-sweet-tea-laced-toxic-chemical-used-298222", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/sweet-iced-tea.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/sweet-iced-tea.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-15T11:31:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T11:31:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The toxic chemical at a Utah restaurant, accidentally mixed into a sweet tea dispenser, can dissolve a person's insides."}, "article_summary": "A 67-year-old woman is in critical condition after drinking toxic tea at a Dickey\u2019s Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, Utah.\nIn actuality, it was lye, an odorless, highly toxic chemical the restaurant uses to degrease deep fryers.\nThese are very particular circumstances, but consumers are more likely to consume toxic tea than they might think.\nFast food sweet tea nearly contains the same amount of calories and sugar as a regular 12-ounce soda.\nJan Harding took a single sip of sweet tea and subsequently spit it out, telling her husband she thought she drank acid."}
