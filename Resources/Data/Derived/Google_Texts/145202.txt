Are free chicken-parm sandwiches enough to fortify fans Sunday afternoon when the Denver Broncos try to recover from their stinging 37-28 loss to the Bengals Monday night?

Nationwide’s willing to give it a go.

The insurance company will hand out free chicken parm sandwiches before the Broncos’ final regular season home game against the hated Oakland Raiders, playing off the “Jingle” campaign that features quarterback Peyton Manning singing “chicken parm you taste so good.”

The free sandwich comes with a price: Fans who visit the Nationwide food truck, outside of gate two at Sports Authority Field, will be asked to sing the “Nationwide is on your side” jingle, or come up with a version of their own.

In addition to a stick-to-your-ribs meal, the first 40,000 fans into the stadium also will receive an extra layer of clothing against the forecast frigid temps (high of 34) — a chicken-parm themed T-shirt.

Nationwide is the presenting sponsor of the Broncos vs. Raiders game.
