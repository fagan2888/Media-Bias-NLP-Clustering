It rides atop underwater torpedo-shaped tubes powered by a pair of 2,000-horsepower gas turbine engines. Gyroscopes keep the ride smooth.\n\nSadly, Ghost is all revved up with no place to go. The brainchild of a wealthy inventor and entrepreneur, Ghost might never be a familiar household name like Humvee, Apache and Abrams - even if it works as advertised - because its creator built a warship the military isn\u2019t convinced it needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a revolutionary program,\u201d said Gregory Sancoff, founder and CEO of Juliet Marine Systems. \u201cNothing like this has ever been built by anybody, not even the Navy.\u201d\n\nHe might be right: The Ghost rides on struts connected to engine assemblies he says take advantage of \u201csupercavitation,\u201d traveling underwater inside a bubble of gas. It\u2019s a new application of technology that Sancoff insists will make Ghost fast - it\u2019s so far hit about 35 mph but Sancoff believes it can approach 60 mph - while staying stable even in rough seas.\n\nBut Sancoff has taken the usual step of sinking $15 million into a prototype that he hopes to sell to the Navy, turning upside down a process in which normally the military identifies a need before soliciting proposals and seeking funding.\n\n\u201cThe Navy is pretty skeptical of what we\u2019ve been working on but they\u2019re starting to take us more seriously,\u201d said Sancoff, whose company operates out of a leased warehouse at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.\n\nSancoff, who as a young man raced hydroplanes, hatched his idea for the 60-foot-long vessel after terrorists using a small boat full of explosives nearly sank the USS Cole in 2000.\n\nHe thinks the Navy needs a fast patrol boat to protect larger and more costly warships when they\u2019re most vulnerable, like when they\u2019re passing through the Strait of Hormuz at the southern end of the Persian Gulf. The Ghost\u2019s smooth ride makes it an ideal platform for weapon systems - and for transporting Navy SEALs, Sancoff said.\n\nSupercavitation has been used to produce high-speed torpedoes but Sancoff said he\u2019s adapted it for the first time to propel a surface warship. Under his design, dual propellers were moved to the front instead of the rear and underwater ailerons control the vessel, which banks like an airplane when it\u2019s turning.\n\nHe was so convinced that he created a company and built it.\n\nThat sort of entrepreneurial spirit used to drive military innovation but it\u2019s no longer the norm in an era of high-tech, costly programs. These days, the Pentagon decides its military requirements and then solicits proposals.\n\nThe Navy currently does not have a requirement for such a patrol boat, said Chris Johnson, spokesman for the Naval Sea Systems Command.\n\nBut Sancoff\u2019s design is at least worth a look, even if it turns out to be unfit for military use, said retired Vice Adm. Pete Daly, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, an independent, nonpartisan organization in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\u201cThe high ground for the U.S. Navy is to take this and evaluate it and learn from it,\u201d Daly said. \u201cThe propulsion system could be valuable in other applications. You\u2019ve got to keep that door open to innovation,\u201d he said.\n\nSancoff insists the military has expressed at least some interest in his company, which counts retired Navy admirals and one former U.S. senator, John Sununu of New Hampshire, as board members.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re building something so different, you\u2019re going to find people that just don\u2019t understand it. You\u2019ve really got to spend some time understanding what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Sancoff said.\n\nIt could be a tough sale.\n\nEven in the best of times, the Navy is predisposed to buy larger, multi-missions ships instead of smaller niche vessels. And the Navy\u2019s current budget struggles pose perhaps the biggest obstacle.\n\nSancoff is also proposing marketing his vessel to other navies and wants to build a new version that\u2019ll be a bit bigger. He believes it will be flexible enough for other tasks, like anti-submarine and mine warfare operations.\n\nLoren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, said the small company faces an uphill battle.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s speedy new littoral combat ships are designed to fulfill the Ghost\u2019s proposed mission, and Thompson is skeptical that the Navy would be willing to go out on a limb for all-new design for a ship that\u2019s too small and light to accommodate heavy armor and bigger weapon systems.\n\nJuliet Marine needs plenty of money, and perhaps a friend or two in Congress, he said, to circumvent an acquisition process that poses obstacles for small startups like Juliet, which has 15 employees.\n\n\u201cI wish them luck,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEntrepreneurship is not always rewarded at the Pentagon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even on land, the Ghost looks futuristic and fast.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Even on land, the Ghost looks futuristic and fast.", "title": "Entrepreneur builds a sleek ship, but will anyone buy it?", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/21/entrepreneur-builds-a-sleek-ship-but-will-anyone-b/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/21/795e20620092de32680f6a7067008798.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/21/795e20620092de32680f6a7067008798.jpg", "description": "Even on land, the Ghost looks futuristic and fast.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Entrepreneur builds a sleek ship, but will anyone buy it?"}, "Author": "DAVID SHARP", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Gregory Sancoff, Navy, Juliet Marine Systems"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf55\"", "article_summary": "Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, said the small company faces an uphill battle.\nEven in the best of times, the Navy is predisposed to buy larger, multi-missions ships instead of smaller niche vessels.\nThe Ghost\u2019s smooth ride makes it an ideal platform for weapon systems - and for transporting Navy SEALs, Sancoff said.\n\u201cThe high ground for the U.S. Navy is to take this and evaluate it and learn from it,\u201d Daly said.\nSancoff is also proposing marketing his vessel to other navies and wants to build a new version that\u2019ll be a bit bigger."}
