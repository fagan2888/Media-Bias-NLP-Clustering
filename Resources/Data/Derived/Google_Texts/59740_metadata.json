A Student Union group has decided that the number one issue on campus is going number two.\n\nThe Queer Student Union at California Polytechnic University recently staged a three day \u201cshit-in\u201d where the group encouraged students to only use gender-neutral washrooms.\n\nAccording to the petition, the university currently has seventeen all-gender washrooms, but out of the seventeen, only five are \u201creasonably accessible, leaving non-cisgender students with a paltry amount of options when it comes to using the bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut yourself in the shoes of a trans*/gender non-conforming student and take the pledge to use only all gender bathrooms,\u201d states the group\u2019s Facebook page, which also features what looks to be feces, as its main banner.\n\nStudents also reportedly created a fake toilet in the middle of campus, which was signed by students and was decorated with several banners. One of the banners read \u201cWe\u2019ve got shit to deal with\u201d\n\nThey certainly do have \u201cshit to deal with,\u201d does ObamaCare cover mental health?\n\nAccording to Campus Reform,\n\nEvent organizers advised non-transgender students to \u201ccheck [their] potty privilege\u201d and carried around signs that declared \u201cgoing to the bathroom shouldn\u2019t be a source of anxiety.\u201d \u201cGendered bathrooms pose a threat to the emotional and physical well-being of this demographic, and often force awkward and uncomfortable encounters for non-cisgender identifying students,\u201d the group\u2019s petition explained.\n\nThe group also handed out flyers asking for the creation of even more all-gender washrooms despite already having seventeen around the campus. Their petition currently has 294 supporters out of 500 required.\n\nAmazingly, this isn\u2019t the first \u201cshit-in\u201d protest, it\u2019s been dung before. QSU co-president Matt Klepfer credits a shit-in hosted by San Diego State University students last year for inspiring them.\n\nThankfully the University still has students that can smell something\u2019s up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe putting a fake toilet in the center of our quad is the best way for my peers to effectuate the change they\u2019re seeking,\u201d Cal Poly senior Domenic Hjerpe told Campus Reform, adding \u201cFor many students, myself included, it\u2019s hard to take something like a \u2018shit-in\u2019 very seriously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "California Polytechnic University\u2019s Queer Student Union hosts a three-day \u2018shit-in.\u2019 Encourages students to use \u201call-gender bathrooms.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "California Polytechnic University\u2019s Queer Student Union hosts a three-day \u2018shit-in.\u2019 Encourages students to use \u201call-gender bathrooms.\u201d", "title": "Poop Equality Is Now A Thing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/corn-poop.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-22T16:07:34+00:00", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/poop-equality-is-now-a-thing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelibrepublic", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/corn-poop.jpg", "description": "California Polytechnic University\u2019s Queer Student Union hosts a three-day \u2018shit-in.\u2019 Encourages students to use \u201call-gender bathrooms.\u201d", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Poop Equality Is Now A Thing"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Free Style", "published_time": "2015-04-22T16:01:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T16:07:34+00:00", "author": "https://m.facebook.com/CarrilloRyan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3c7\"", "article_summary": "A Student Union group has decided that the number one issue on campus is going number two.\nQSU co-president Matt Klepfer credits a shit-in hosted by San Diego State University students last year for inspiring them.\nPoop Equality Is Now A ThingCheck Your Potty PrivilegeBy: Ryan CarrilloThere\u2019s no shortage of mind-numbingly asinine causes and protests but this story has to be among one of the foulest.\nThe Queer Student Union at California Polytechnic University recently staged a three day \u201cshit-in\u201d where the group encouraged students to only use gender-neutral washrooms.\nThe group also handed out flyers asking for the creation of even more all-gender washrooms despite already having seventeen around the campus."}
