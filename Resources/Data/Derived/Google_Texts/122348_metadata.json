Bush first established the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, while the HITECH Act flooded more than $30 billion in stimulus money to speed the digitization of America\u2019s hospitals and physician practices, and since President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark Affordable Care Act put healthcare front and center in the national discourse and ensured that \u2013 whatever your politics \u2013 the push toward value-based care is here to stay.\n\nWith the healthcare industry on the cusp of a transformative new era it is the perfect time for us to bring you a freshly rethought and redesigned website.\n\nLook for more: More breaking news, more thoughtful insight, more actionable information, more best practices, more content aimed at helping you make smart and informed decisions in this fast-changing industry.\n\nLook for more personality in the form of lively interviews with industry leaders, fresh voices joining our luminary bloggers and columnists as we continue building out our stable of regular contributors.\n\nSee all of our HIMSS16 previews\n\nIndeed, the new Healthcare IT News is more than just a pretty facelift. Many months in the making, the crisper and cleaner interface, as easy to navigate on a desktop as on a smartphone, enables us to more efficiently deliver \u2013 and you to more easily consume \u2013 the next wave of healthcare and technology news and insight.\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to unwrap this new design and particularly excited about seeing it put to work as we cover this new era of accountable, connected and patient-centered care.\n\nWe\u2019ll have all the news you need about EHRs, data analytics, cybersecurity, population health, revenue cycle management, telemedicine, mobile apps, medical devices, precision medicine and the the tangled web of government policies and standards that healthcare leaders need to chart a proper course in this increasingly complex environment.\n\nGetting to that new world of healthcare will not be easy. We\u2019ll continue to bring you thought-leading analysis about what the changes and the challenges mean to help you succeed.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new look, and will join us for the ride ahead.\n\nQuestions or suggestions about the new Healthcare IT News?
