Kiara, an eighth-grade student at Bill Reed Middle School, died unexpectedly Wednesday night. ( Jessica Benes / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nHundreds of students showed up to pay their respects to the family of Kiara Murray in an evening vigil by the beach at Lake Loveland on Sunday.\n\nHer parents, Becky and Randy Murray, were met by students and friends at the park. Kiara's loved ones wrote messages on balloons and released them into the air after several students talked about how much they liked or appreciated her.\n\nKiara, an eighth-grade student at Bill Reed Middle School, died unexpectedly Wednesday evening. The cause of death hasn't been officially released. Friends said it wasn't a suicide and her father said they aren't sure what happened. She just went to sleep Wednesday and didn't wake up.\n\nAjahnique Cruz, a freshman at Thompson Valley, was one of several students, including several eighth-grade students at Bill Reed Middle School, who helped organize the vigil on Sunday.\n\n\"I just like how blunt she was and how honest,\" Cruz said. \"She didn't care about what people thought about her. She didn't like it but she pushed it aside and didn't let it affect her.\"\n\nCruz said that Kiara liked to walk around Albertson's and try on perfume. Recently, she convinced Cruz to stroll around Albertson's dressed as boys.\n\n\"She sagged her pants... and put her hair up in a bun under a hat. She didn't care what people thought,\" Cruz laughed.\n\nKiara was also close to eighth-graders Austin Johnson, Kevin Sanchez, Jesus Garcia and Bryan Sanchez, who went to school with her at Bill Reed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I hung out with her 24/7,\" Johnson said, but found it too difficult to say more. He was her next-door neighbor.\n\n\"She had a beautiful smile,\" Garcia said. \"She liked to live it up. She was a really happy person.\"\n\nThe boys said she loved to draw and take photos to make memories.\n\n\"Other people would be down and she'd be there to cheer them up,\" Bryan Sanchez said.\n\nAs everyone gathered in a circle before releasing balloons into the sky, students spoke about Kiara.\n\nThey said how much they missed her and that she was one of the best people to be up in heaven with God.\n\nSeveral students alluded to conflicts over Internet, but said there was a lesson to be learned, to not pay attention to what you hear about someone.\n\n\"I wish I could have hung out with her more. We would have had a lot of fun,\" one student said tearfully.\n\nJessica Benes: 970-669-5050 ext. 530, jbenes@reporter-herald.com, Twitter.com/jessicabenes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_27947872/friends-recall-middle-schooler-who-died", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0419/20150419__20rhavigilw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Hundreds of students showed up to pay their respects to the family of Kiara Murray in an evening vigil by the beach at Lake Loveland on Sunday.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27947872:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-19T19:51:50-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_27947872/friends-recall-middle-schooler-who-died", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0419/20150419__20rhavigilw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds of students showed up to pay their respects to the family of Kiara Murray in an evening vigil by the beach at Lake Loveland on Sunday.", "title": "Friends recall middle-schooler who died"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Hundreds of students showed up to pay their respects to the family of Kiara Murray in an evening vigil by the beach at Lake Loveland on Sunday.", "title": "Friends recall middle-schooler who died", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_27947872/friends-recall-middle-schooler-who-died", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0419/20150419__20rhavigilw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-19T19:51:50-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Friends recall middle-schooler who died", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0419/20150419__20rhavigilw~2.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2015-04-20T14:24:54-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-19T19:51:50-0600", "byline": "By Jessica BenesReporter-Herald", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2015-04-19T19:52:11-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3ea\"", "article_summary": "Kiara, an eighth-grade student at Bill Reed Middle School, died unexpectedly Wednesday evening.\nKiara, an eighth-grade student at Bill Reed Middle School, died unexpectedly Wednesday night.\nHer parents, Becky and Randy Murray, were met by students and friends at the park.\nFriends said it wasn't a suicide and her father said they aren't sure what happened.\n( Jessica Benes / Loveland Reporter-Herald )Hundreds of students showed up to pay their respects to the family of Kiara Murray in an evening vigil by the beach at Lake Loveland on Sunday."}
