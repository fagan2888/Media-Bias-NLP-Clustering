PRESIDENT OBAMA: We're going to continue to make progress on all those fronts and yes, we are going to continue to implement the healthcare law. The product is good, people want it and we should not live in a country where people are going bankrupt because they get sick. Anybody who is going to keep on pushing against that they will meet my resistance because I'm willing to fix any problems that there are but I am not going to abandon people to make sure they have health insurance in this country. That is not something that we're gonna do.
