Blanchett is nominated for Best Actress for her role in Blue Jasmine, a performance which has already bagged her more than 20 trophies including Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA and AACTA awards.

Damon first worked with Blanchett on The Talented Mr Ripley in 1998. The pair reunited last year to shoot George Clooney’s The Monuments Men, which opens on March 13.

AND THE RAZZIES GO TO ... FATHER AND SON

The American star told News Corp Australia that Blanchett is in a class alongside only Meryl Streep.

“There aren’t very many male or female actors in that stratosphere,” Damon said. “It’s a very special thing to see. I remember being 27 years old and seeing it: she walked out after shooting something with us and (director) Anthony Minghella and I just looked at each other, shook our heads and went, ‘What the hell was that?’

“Now, she’s the same actress except with 16 more years of experience. Her range, which I didn’t see an end to back then, has only expanded. She’s a really special person.”

Oscar voting closed last Tuesday, with nominees such as Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, U2 and Lupita Nyong’o hitting every event and TV talk show possible in the final two weeks of campaigning. During this period, Blanchett was the subject of a glowing profile on the US version of 60 Minutes.

While B lue Jasmine’s Oscar chances were given a battering by renewed allegations of abuse targeted at writer-director Woody Allen in early February, Blanchett has just gone on winning.

With her husband Andrew Upton by her side, Blanchett picked up one last pre-Oscar best actress gong at the Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica on Saturday.

Should she prove the pundits right today, the statuette will join her Best Supporting Actress Oscar won for The Aviator in 2005.

Other Australians vying for Academy Awards are Catherine Martin, who is nominated for both Costume and Production Design for The Great Gatsby; Beverley Dunn, who is co-nominee with Martin in the Production Design category; and David Clayton in the Visual Effects category for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.
