Some Blue Cross Blue Shield customers in North Dakota and Minnesota may soon see significant rate increases on their premiums.

Insurance companies submitted the proposed rate increases for individual and small group plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and are awaiting the state's approval.

Valley News Live investigated how much those proposed increases may be and what it might mean for you.

Blue Cross Blue Shield North Dakota (BCBS ND) proposed an 18% increase for their individual plans.

"We have seen a higher than normal usage for those products, so we have to charge a premium that is sufficient for those claims," said BCBS ND Director of Health Policy Luther Stueland.

BCBS ND officials say now that the healthcare reform has been in effect for a year, this is the first time they know the actual cost for providing care on individual plans.

"There are impacts due to the ACA but a large part are using more services more frequently," said Stueland.

Medica Health Plans and Time Insurance Company also proposed rate increases in North Dakota. Medica proposed a 16.5% and Time Insurance proposed a 22%.

Valley News Live wanted to know if the increase on individual plans would translate to higher cost if you purchase insurance through an employer?

"Employer sponsored coverage will have a wide varying degree of increase and decreases based somewhat on your utilizations and then on overall trends and other impacts to those plans," explained Stueland.

Stueland says your rates really depend how much of your plan is used in your company. It can vary for each company.

North Dakota is not the only state seeing premium hikes. On Thursday we reported if you live in Minnesota, eight health plans are looking to increase their rates. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota requested a 54% increase.

Each state approves how much the rates may increase and that is announced in October if you live in Minnesota and November if you live in North Dakota.
