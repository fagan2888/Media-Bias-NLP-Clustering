The NFL season has far fewer games than the other major North American sports - 16 compared to 162 in baseball - which makes every game an event.\n\nBut once the season gets to the Super Bowl, many of the fans don\u2019t get a chance to go. Tickets started around $800 for this year\u2019s and most are snapped up by corporations, creating an American version of the Prawn Sandwich Brigade, those European soccer fans who attend games for the corporate hospitality rather than cheer on the teams.\n\n___\n\nWHERE IT\u2019S PLAYED\n\nCities bid for the right to host the Super Bowl and many use the game as a rallying point to build a new stadium and bring in revenue.\n\nThe game is rotated every year, usually to a warm-weather city or one with a domed stadium.\n\nLast year\u2019s game was played in the stadium the New York Jets and Giants share in East Rutherford, New Jersey - the first outdoor game in a cold-weather city - and future games will be in San Francisco, Houston and Minneapolis.\n\nArizona\u2019s University of Phoenix Stadium, site of this year\u2019s games, has a retractable roof and a field that is wheeled outside so the grass can get sunlight.\n\n___\n\nTELEVISION AUDIENCE\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched events in the world, routinely drawing more than 80 million viewers every year since 1990. The game has eclipsed 100 million viewers each of the past five years, with a record 111.5 million watching Seattle roll over Denver a year ago.\n\nMillions more watch the game around the world.\n\n___\n\nTHE COMMERCIALS\n\nSuper Bowl commercials have become a part of the show, luring in non-sports fans who might not otherwise watch the game.\n\nThe trend of making get-them-talking commercials started in 1984, when Apple created a memorable 1-minute spot based on George Orwell\u2019s 1984. Since then, the commercials have included talking animals and babies, supermodels and Clydesdales, sophomoric humor and tear-jerking moments.\n\nThe rate for this year\u2019s game is $4.5 million for a 30-second spot.\n\n___\n\nGAMBLING\n\nAccording to the American Gaming Association, Americans will place $3.8 billion in illegal bets on the Super Bowl this year. Nevada sports books hauled in a record $19.7 million in legal wagers on last year\u2019s game.\n\nThe Super Bowl also has some of the most exotic proposition bets anywhere.\n\nFor this year\u2019s game, bettors can put money on the what color Gatorade will be dumped on the winning coach, how long Idina Menzel will take to sing the Star-Spangled Banner, whether Patriots coach Bill Belichick will smile on camera during the game and the color of pop star Katy Perry\u2019s hair when she performs during the halftime show.\n\n___\n\nHALFTIME SHOW\n\nThe halftime show has become must-watch TV instead of just a throw-in with the game.\n\nThis year\u2019s halftime show will feature Perry and rock guitarist Lenny Kravitz, extending a long line of big-name performers that has included Bruce Springsteen, The Who, Prince, Madonna and Bruno Mars with the Red Hot Chili Peppers last year.\n\nAnd, of course, everyone remembers Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d while performing with Justin Timberlake in 2004.\n\n___\n\nMEDIA DAY\n\nOriginally set up for media members to have access to every player on both teams, the annual Media Day has become an event in itself, a spectacle filled with sometimes-wacky questions and attention-grabbing stunts.\n\nIn 2008, a reporter from Mexico\u2019s TV Azteca wore a wedding dress and asked New England\u2019s Tom Brady to marry her. Another media day featured a reporter showing up with a puppet of Pittsburgh\u2019s Troy Polamalu, calling it his son.\n\nThousands of media members attend Media Day and fans can buy tickets to watch the festivities for $28.50.\n\n___\n\nTHE PARTIES\n\nOutside of the Oscars or Grammys, there may not be a bigger place for celebrity parties than the Super Bowl.\n\nThe parties before the big game are almost all star-studded and this year\u2019s bashes include DirecTv Saturday Night with Rihanna, Nelly performing at Playboy\u2019s and Drake at Bootsy Bellows\u2019 Pop Up. There also will be live performances in the Phoenix area by Snoop Dogg, Imagine Dragons, Enrique Iglesias with Pitbull and Zac Brown Band.\n\nMillions of fans also gather in households around the country to watch the game together.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Super Bowl, at its most basic level, is a game that determines the NFL championship.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Super Bowl, at its most basic level, is a game that determines the NFL championship.", "title": "AP Explains: What makes the Super Bowl such a big deal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/25/ap-explains-what-makes-the-super-bowl-such-a-big-d/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/25/97b5dea5e1c82f036c0f6a706700cf05.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/25/97b5dea5e1c82f036c0f6a706700cf05.jpg", "description": "The Super Bowl, at its most basic level, is a game that determines the NFL championship.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "AP Explains: What makes the Super Bowl such a big deal"}, "Author": "JOHN MARSHALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, The Super Bowl, Phoenix, NFL"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bae\"", "article_summary": "A rundown of what makes the Super Bowl so special:___FABRIC OF AMERICABaseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but football is woven into the country\u2019s fabric.\n___THE PARTIESOutside of the Oscars or Grammys, there may not be a bigger place for celebrity parties than the Super Bowl.\n___GAMBLINGAccording to the American Gaming Association, Americans will place $3.8 billion in illegal bets on the Super Bowl this year.\nPHOENIX (AP) - The Super Bowl, at its most basic level, is a game that determines the NFL championship.\nBut once the season gets to the Super Bowl, many of the fans don\u2019t get a chance to go."}
