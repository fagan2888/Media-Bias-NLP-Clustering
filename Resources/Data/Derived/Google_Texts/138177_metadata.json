It is the latest salvo in a long-running legal battle between Oracle and Oregon over the failed health exchange. The two sides have blamed each other in multiple lawsuits.\n\nOracle has maintained it was never fully paid for its work on the $300 million project and that the state illegally used Oracle code.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit.\n\nJohn Cooney, an attorney for the company, says the Affordable Care Act requires Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell to investigate allegations of misconduct involving exchanges.\n\nShe has yet to do so in Oregon or six other states with troubled exchanges, despite $1.45 billion in federal grants awarded to those states to build the exchanges, Cooney said.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this action because the extraordinary facts of this case require federal investigation and oversight,\u201d Cooney said.\n\nAmong other things, Cooney claims Oregon officials made false statements to Health and Human Services and gave \u201cunelected political operatives control over ACA implementation.\u201d\n\nThe state then filed litigation against a contractor to attempt to distract attention from its own failure, he said.\n\nOregon pulled the plug on its health exchange in 2014 and switched to the federal portal.\n\nThe state has been seeking to recoup the millions of dollars it paid Oracle to construct the glitch-filled website. It has accused Oracle and its executives of corruption.\n\nKristina Edmunson, spokeswoman for Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, said the lawsuit is a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cOracle filed the very first lawsuit in this case, and the company continues to file additional lawsuits along the way \u2014 this is their fifth \u2014 in a desperate attempt to delay and avoid the true facts,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND \u2014 The main tech contractor on the failed Cover Oregon health insurance exchange says it has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, saying the agency has neglected to investigate misconduct allegations.
