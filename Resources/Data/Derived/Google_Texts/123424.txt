The streets were filled with people running wild, biking, skating and dancing for the 4th annual CycLOUvia on Bardstown Road.

CycLOUvia is Louisville's open streets program promoting healthy lifestyles, alternative transportation, bike/pedestrian safety and economic development.

From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. the city shut down Bardstown Road from it's intersections with Baxter Ave. to Douglas Loop, creating a three-mile open playground for the public.

Local businesses, like Infinite Bliss Yoga and HOME Skateshop, used to the space to create outdoor class rooms and demonstration areas.

"It's a fun event that we get to do," said skateboarder Ryan Tassi, 23, as he and several of his friends did tricks off rails, over parking cones and up ramps. "We don't get to set up random obstacles in the street everyday."

Families also took to the streets. Gracie Plymire, 9, played football with her father in front of QDoba. Sarah and Lane Slabaugh took their children, Slyvie, 1, and Zander, 3, for a stroll.

"We live in the neighborhood and we thought it'd be fun for (Zander) to see Bardstown Road not so busy," Lane Slabaugh said. "He knows he normally has to get off his bike when we get to Bardstown Road, so this is a pretty big deal for him."
