Here are our fivetakeaways from the interview:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one set of rules for us and another set for everybody else\u201d: Bill Clinton argued that there\u2019s a double standard in American politics where there\u2019s so much scrutiny on the Clinton Foundation\u2019s donors (most of whom are disclosed) than the donations to dark-money organizations like, say, the Koch Brothers\u2019 organizations (which aren\u2019t disclosed). \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is the idea that there\u2019s one set of rules for us and another set for everybody else is true,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThe guy that filled out the [990 tax] forms made an error,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that is a bigger problem, according to the press, than the other people running for president willing to take dark money, secret money, secret from beginning to end.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo quid pro quos: Also in the interview, Clinton maintained that Foundation donations or speaker fees haven\u2019t influenced government policy. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that we have never done anything knowingly inappropriate in terms of taking money to influence any kind of American government policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d He also quoted his wife telling him, \u201cNo one has ever tried to influence me by helping you.\u201d (FYI: Conservative outlets will have a field day with Clinton\u2019s \u201cknowingly inappropriate\u201d line.)\n\n\n\nClinton might step down from the Clinton Foundation if Hillary becomes president: Clinton entertained the idea of stepping down from the Clinton Foundation if wife Hillary wins the White House.\n\nMCFADDEN: If your wife is elected president, will you step down from the foundation?\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, I\u2019ll decide. If\u2013 if it\u2019s the right thing to do, I will\u2026\n\nMCFADDEN: I mean, why might you step down if she were elected president?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I might if I were asked to do something in the public interest that I had an obligation to do. Or I might take less of an executive role. I mean, I really\u2013 I work at this. And I\u2019m involved in this as you can see. So I might do that. But we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\n\n\n\nHe will continue to give paid speeches:\n\nMCFADDEN: So she\u2019s now running for president. Will you continue to give speeches?\n\nBILL CLINTON: Oh yeah.\n\nClinton added, \u201cI have turned down a lot of [paid speeches]. If I think there\u2019s something wrong with it, I don\u2019t take it. And I do disclose who gave them to me. So people can make up their own minds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman\u201d: Finally, Clinton said it was \u201claughable\u201d to hear people say that Hillary Clinton can\u2019t relate the middle class. \u201cIt\u2019s OK if you inherit your money, apparently,\u201d Clinton said. He added, I\u2019m grateful for our success. But let me remind you. When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.\u201d\n\n*** NBC/WSJ poll: 96% of Americans expect more racially charged unrest: Want proof that the country has paid close attention to what\u2019s happened in Ferguson, Staten Island, and now Baltimore? Don\u2019t miss this BIG number from our new NBC/WSJ poll: \u201cA whopping 96 percent of Americans say that they expect more racially-charged unrest around the country this summer, similar to the past week\u2019s violence in Baltimore. And more than half \u2014 54 percent \u2014 believe a similar disturbance is likely in the metropolitan area closest to where they live.\u201d More from the poll: \u201cSix-in-10 African-Americans said that the discord in Baltimore is attributable to \u2018people with longstanding frustrations about police mistreatment of African Americans that have not been addressed.\u2019 Twenty-seven percent said that the riots were \u2018caused by people who used the protests about the death of an African-American man in police custody as an excuse to engage in looting and violence.\u2019 Among whites, those results were almost exactly flipped. Just 32 percent cited longstanding frustration about African-Americans\u2019 treatment at the hands of police, while 58 percent said the Baltimore violence was caused by those using Gray\u2019s death as an excuse for looting.\u201d\n\n*** O\u2019Malley: Baltimore would be \u201ccentral\u201d to my campaign: Speaking of Baltimore, potential presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he would make Baltimore \u201ccentral\u201d to his campaign. (O\u2019Malley previously served as Baltimore mayor and Maryland governor.) \u201cI did not dedicate my life to making Baltimore a safer and more just place because it was easy. And I am more inclined and more deeply motivated now to address what\u2019s wrong with our country and what needs to be healed and what needs to be fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should be a wakeup call. What\u2019s happened in Baltimore should be a wakeup call for the entire country. The protests that also happened in New York, in Philadelphia, and other cities. We have deep problems as a country, and we need deeper understanding if we\u2019re going to give our children a better future.\u201d Would he announce his presidential bid in Baltimore? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think of announcing anyplace else.\u201d By the way, also on the \u201cMeet\u201d yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner agreed that the country is in a national crisis when it comes to the relationship between African Americans and law enforcement.\n\n*** Three presidential announcements in the next 24 hours \u2013 Fiorina, Carson, Huckabee: Well, two more candidates are entering the presidential field today, and another one goes tomorrow. Earlier this morning, former Hewlett Packard CEO (and failed 2010 Senate candidate) Carly Fiorina tweeted, \u201cI am running for president.\u201d (Fiorina\u2019s announcement video also shows her watching Hillary Clinton\u2019s announcement.) Meanwhile, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson announces his bid at 10:30 am ET from Detroit, MI. And tomorrow, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is expected to make his presidential candidacy official.\n\n*** NBC/WSJ poll: Republicans are from Mars, Democrats are from Venus: Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t even agree on what they believe is the biggest issue facing the nation, per our new NBC/WSJ poll. When asked in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll which issue should be the top priority for the federal government to address, here were the top first-choice responses among Republicans:\n\nNational security and terrorism (27%)\n\nDeficit and government spending (24%)\n\nJob creation and economic growth (21%)\n\nAmong Democrats:\n\nJob creation and economic growth (37%)\n\nHealth care (17%)\n\nClimate change (15%)\n\nNational security and terrorism (13%)\n\nFYI: The economy dropping to the No. 3 concern among Republican primary voters is a striking departure from March 2012, when it ranked No. 1 (at 36%) \u2014 followed by the deficit/government spending (at 35%) and national security/terrorism (at just 8%).\n\n*** Rest of the NBC/WSJ poll comes out at 6:30 pm ET: Finally, the rest of our NBC/WSJ poll \u2013 on the 2016 race, on President Obama, and on so much else \u2013 comes out at 6:30 pm ET.\n\n\n\nOBAMA AGENDA: Baltimore curfew lifted\n\nThe latest in Baltimore, from the Baltimore Sun: \u201cBaltimore began to move beyond unrest Sunday when Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake lifted a citywide curfew, the Maryland National Guard began withdrawing its forces and shoppers returned to Mondawmin Mall, which had been shuttered after looting.\u201d\n\nToday at Lehman College, Obama will unveil a new nonprofit organization that\u2019s a spinoff of the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative. And NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker reports that he\u2019s expected to address the unrest in Baltimore and the systemic issues faced by low-income communities.\n\nFrom one of us(!) over the weekend: \u201cA whopping 96 percent of Americans say that they expect more racially-charged unrest around the country this summer, similar to the past week\u2019s violence in Baltimore. And more than half \u2014 54 percent \u2014 believe a similar disturbance is likely in the metropolitan area closest to where they live.\u201d\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe Justice Department will start revealing more about the government\u2019s use of secret cellphone tracking devices and has launched a wide-ranging review into how law-enforcement agencies deploy the technology, according to Justice officials.\u201d\n\nBreaking overnight, from Garland, TX: \u201cTwo suspects were killed after they opened fire Sunday in a parking lot outside a provocative contest for cartoon depictions of the prophet Muhammad, authorities said.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. intelligence agencies \u00adbadly misjudged al-Qaeda\u2019s \u00adability to take advantage of political turmoil in the Middle East and regain strength across the region after Osama bin Laden was killed, according to a new book by the CIA\u2019s former deputy director,\u201d writes the Washington Post.\n\nThe New York Times: \u201cA new computer analysis of about 25,000 Supreme Court opinions from 1791 to 2008 identified three trends that have transformed the court\u2019s tone. The justices\u2019 opinions, the study found, have become longer, easier to understand \u2014 and grumpier.\u201d\n\nAlso in the NYT: \u201cAmerican Released by Cuba Plays Role as U.S. Relations With Havana Thaw.\u201d\n\nNot a great lede for Obamacare backers, from the Wall Street Journal: \u201cEmergency-room visits continued to climb in the second year of the Affordable Care Act, contradicting the law\u2019s supporters who had predicted a decline in traffic as more people gained access to doctors and other health-care providers.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO writes that secrecy is costing Obama support
