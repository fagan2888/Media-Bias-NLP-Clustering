In January, Bill Cowher disputed rumors that he plans to coach again. Rumors that, you know, he started himself.

Cowher is now at it again, sending mixed signals about whether he’ll ever return to the game he left nearly seven years ago.

“I had the best job in the NFL,” Cowher tells Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I realize that, that’s why all the talk about me coming back is just that. I had the best job in the league; I didn’t get out of it to get back in it.”

So you’re done, right?

“I would never say that,” Cowher said. “I don’t know how I’ll feel in two years. Never say ‘never’ because then you become a hypocrite. I’ve seen too many other people in my profession say ‘never’ and come back. Always keep doors open in life, that’s the important thing to do.”

How Cowher feels in the future will depend in large part on when Tom Coughlin stops coaching the Giants. Former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, who knew (possibly before Cowher did) that 2006 would be Cowher’s final year in Pittsburgh has said repeatedly that Cowher wants to coach the Giants.

Cowher will get a taste of the stadium in which the Giants play on Sunday, since he’ll be joining the booth at MetLife Stadium to call the Steelers-Jets game.

The way things are going in Pittsburgh, maybe Cowher eventually will get another crack at the best job in the league.
