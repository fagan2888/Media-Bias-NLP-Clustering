CREDIT: New York City's National Organization for Women\n\nCREDIT: New York City\u2019s National Organization for Women\n\nOver the past year, a growing list of colleges have made headlines for creating a \u201chostile environment\u201d on campus for victims of sexual assault. Many of those elite universities want to sweep sexual assault under the rug because being associated with rape isn\u2019t exactly good for their reputations \u2014 so they end up breaking federal law and under-reporting the number of rapes that occur on campus. And even when university officials do correctly tally up the number of rape cases that happened on college grounds, that number doesn\u2019t account for all of the incidences of sexual assault that go unreported.\n\nHow can campuses work to change that dynamic? Some college activists have a solution: Allow students to self-report sexual assaults.\n\nTucker Reed, a student at the University of Southern California who filed two federal complaints against her university after administrators mishandled her rape case, told the Huffington Post that colleges should conduct annual surveys among seniors. The online surveys would be mandatory for each graduating senior, and failing to complete one could jeopardize a student\u2019s ability to receive his or her diploma.\n\n\u201cEvery federally funded college or university should be required to conduct exit surveys of their departing seniors to determine how many were sexually assaulted during their four-year stay, and then these results should be published,\u201d Reed explained. She noted that this type of survey could be written by the U.S. Department of Education, and might also cover other areas of crime outside of sexual violence. It would help universities assess which campus programs they need to strengthen to keep students safe.\n\nThere\u2019s some precedent for what Reed is talking about. Some U.S. military service academies are already required to conduct this type of survey. The University of Montana will also now be required to start doing one, as part of the settlement the school reached with the U.S. Department of Justice following a federal investigation into its sexual assault policies. The U.S. government has indicated that it hopes to use the University of Montana\u2019s settlement as a model for dealing with other colleges that are undergoing similar investigations, so the practice may soon be expanded. And some schools have voluntarily conducted their own campus surveys to determine students\u2019 experiences with sexual assault.\n\nReed pointed out that allowing students to self-report sexual crimes, rather than relying on the data that universities are required to collect for the federal government, would put the control over the issue \u201cdirectly into the hands of the students.\u201d It could also paint a more accurate picture of the atmosphere on campus, because it would account for all the sexual assaults that weren\u2019t formally reported.\n\nAlexa Schwartz, another one of the students who joined the federal complaint against the University of Southern California, told the Huffington Post that more accurate statistics could force students and administrators to \u201cwake up\u201d to the issues of rape and sexual assault on their campuses. Schwartz explained that many people simply don\u2019t believe sexual violence happens as frequently as it does, and a more comprehensive campus survey could help address that knowledge gap.\n\nRecent surveys have found that the issue of sexual violence is often shrouded in silence and stigma. Even though the majority of Americans know someone who\u2019s been a victim of domestic or sexual abuse, most of them haven\u2019t actually addressed those topics with their friends. Efforts to make survivors feel more comfortable sharing their stories \u2014 and ensuring they aren\u2019t simply blamed for the crimes that have been perpetrated against them \u2014 could go a long way toward getting the issue out in the open.\n\nIn addition to encouraging a more accurate portrayal of sexual violence, campus activists are also engaging in creative efforts to try to prevent rape from occurring in the first place. Sexual assault prevention advocates are attempting to raise awareness about consent and healthy relationships on their campuses \u2014 and last week, college students from across the country partnered to raise that conversation to a national level by pulling an elaborate prank on Playboy Magazine that focused on encouraging consensual sexual activity. Across the pond, some universities in the United Kingdom have codified their efforts to prevent rape culture into a formal policy, and recently banned Robin Thicke\u2019s pop hit \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d for violating that policy by making light of nonconsensual sex.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "As colleges attempt to sweep rape under the rug, student activists are looking for ways to make sure people understand how many sexual assaults really take place on their campuses.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "As colleges attempt to sweep rape under the rug, student activists are looking for ways to make sure people understand how many sexual assaults really take place on their campuses.", "title": "Could Mandatory Surveys Help Tackle The Campus Rape Problem?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/24/2670851/campus-activists-student-survey/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rape-culture1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As colleges attempt to sweep rape under the rug, student activists are looking for ways to make sure people understand how many sexual assaults really take place on their campuses.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rape-culture1.jpg", "title": "Could Mandatory Surveys Help Tackle The Campus Rape Problem?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rape-culture1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rape-culture1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-24T11:56:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9af4\"", "article_summary": "Health Could Mandatory Surveys Help Tackle The Campus Rape Problem?\nAnd some schools have voluntarily conducted their own campus surveys to determine students\u2019 experiences with sexual assault.\nIn addition to encouraging a more accurate portrayal of sexual violence, campus activists are also engaging in creative efforts to try to prevent rape from occurring in the first place.\nRecent surveys have found that the issue of sexual violence is often shrouded in silence and stigma.\nSchwartz explained that many people simply don\u2019t believe sexual violence happens as frequently as it does, and a more comprehensive campus survey could help address that knowledge gap."}
