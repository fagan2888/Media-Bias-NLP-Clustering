It is safe to say most Floridians who drive know that texting while driving is dangerous.

It is also safe to say that many Floridians know that a new state law — going into effect on Oct. 1 — makes texting while driving illegal.

And it is probably safe to say that if people don't know texting while driving is dangerous, and if they don't know or don't care that it is illegal, no educational campaign is going to have much of an effect on them.

That's why Gov. Rick Scott was correct to veto $1 million in the state budget that was going to help promote the ban on texting while driving.

Suffice to say, Florida's texting while driving law — which was long overdue — is weak. Florida became the 41st state to ban texting while driving, but the violation will be a secondary offense, meaning drivers must be pulled over for another reason. And it's fine to text if you are idling at a red light.

Still, it is about to become law, which is an improvement over what we had. As for the need for such a law, a study released earlier this year showed about 3,000 teens die in accidents caused by texting every year. The National Safety Council said about 28 percent of traffic accidents — about 1.6 million crashed per year — involve drivers talking on cellphones or texting.

If you have a driver's license, you know that it's dangerous to text. And Florida is finally catching up with the rest of the nation in making it illegal. You will pay $30 plus court costs for a first offense and $60 for a second offense.

For a long time — and particularly earlier this year when the Legislature debated and finally adopted a texting law pushed by state Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach — media outlets of all types throughout the state gave the law loads of free publicity. The same will happen in the coming days as the law goes into effect.
