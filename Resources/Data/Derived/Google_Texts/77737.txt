Democrat Linda Newell stunned Republicans in 2008 when she won a state Senate seat that had long been held by the GOP so the race to succeed her is expected to be a battle royale when she is term limited after 2016.

Republican Arapahoe County Commissioner Nancy Doty just announced she is running for the seat. Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Cherry Hills Village Democrat, earlier announced he is a candidate in Senate District 26.

With Republicans holding the state Senate by a mere 18-17 majority, both parties are expected to spend plenty to see their candidate win Newell’s seat. It was redrawn after the 2010 census so it isn’t nearly as GOP dominant as it used to be when Newell upset former Rep. Lauri Clapp in 2008. Newell, of Littleton, won re-election in 2012.

Doty is well known in Arapahoe County, having served as the clerk and recorder before being elected to the commission. Kagan has proved to be a formidable candidate, holding off tough challenges in his last three elections.
