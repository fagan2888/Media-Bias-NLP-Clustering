REUTERS/Jason Reed/Files\n\n4446026\n\nIn a 2013 special election, anti-gun U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) swept into office after being bankrolled by former New York City Mayor\u2013and current, self-appointed nanny-stater and financier of the gun control movement\u2013Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg\u2019s misleadingly-named Independence USA political action committee contributed $2.1 million to Kelly\u2019s congressional campaign and helped her win the Chicago-area seat previously held by fellow gun control supporter Jesse Jackson, Jr., who is currently serving time in federal prison.\n\nLast summer, Kelly released the Kelly Report, a manifesto identifying a long list of gun control initiatives that Bloomberg and his cronies hope to make the law of the land.\n\nThe report consists of essays by gun control supporters, followed by a long list of gun control legislation and other efforts they support. Anti-gun activist groups represented in the \u201creport\u201d include Bloomberg\u2019s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Bloomberg\u2019s Everytown for Gun Safety, the Brady Campaign, the Educational Fund to End Gun Violence, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and Americans for Responsible Solutions.\n\nNow, \u201cAssault Gun\u201d Kelly has struck again. With Congress recently back in session, Kelly has introduced anti-gun legislation in the form of H.R.224\u2013a bill that would require U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to submit an annual report to Congress on \u201cthe effects of gun violence on public health,\u201d and the status of actions taken to address those effects. In other words, the bill essentially forces an administrative official, who was supposedly appointed for his independent scientific judgment and professional credentials, to reinforce a predetermined, anti-gun conclusion on behalf of an agenda-driven anti-gun U.S. Representative.\n\nNRA opposed Dr. Murthy\u2019s appointment because he has a history of exploiting his status as a medical practitioner to advance a purely political agenda of extreme and unproven gun control measures. And while Murthy insisted during a nomination hearing in 2014 that he does not intend to \u201cuse the surgeon general\u2019s office as a bully pulpit for gun control,\u201d one has to wonder if anti-gun members of Congress are trying to give Murthy cover to say what he\u2019s been yearning to say all along. After all, America\u2019s public health apparatus has long been seen by gun control advocates as a key element to legitimizing that agenda, and Kelly\u2019s bill directly targets America\u2019s top doctor.\n\nThe NRA strongly opposes this misguided bill, which has everything to do with politics and nothing to do with \u201cpublic health.\u201d Please contact your U.S. Representative and ask him or her to OPPOSE H.R.224 by Rep. Robin Kelly.\n\nYou can contact your U.S. Representative by using the \u201cWrite Your Lawmakers\u201d tool at www.NRAILA.org, or by phone at (202) 225-3121.
