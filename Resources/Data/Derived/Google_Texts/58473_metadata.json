Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n2 The Real Reason Neocons Are So Upset About Donald Trump\n\n3 Elizabeth Warren Takes On the \u2018Gig Economy\u2019\n\n4 Benedict Anderson\u2019s View of Nationalism\n\n5 No, Paul Ryan, Austerity Will Not Fix the Starving Puerto Rican Economy\n\nBut that does not place them anywhere near the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum.\n\nCochran is identified as the \u201cestablishment\u201d choice, which means he is favored by the US Chamber of Commerce and the CEOs and Wall Street financiers who support its campaign to elect a Senate that will rubber-stamp a wildly pro-corporate agenda.\n\nMcDaniel is identified as the \u201canti-establishment\u201d Tea Party insurgent, which means that he is favored by the Club for Growth and the CEOs and Wall Street financiers interests who support its campaign to elect a Senate that will rubber-stamp a wildly pro-corporate agenda.\n\nFor the most part, this year\u2019s supposedly significant Senate contests between the establishment and the \u201cTea Party\u201d have explored the range of opinion from what would historically have been understood as the right wing of the Republican Party to what is now understood as the right wing of the Republican Party.\n\nSome very wealthy people take these distinctions very seriously. They have money to burn, and they are burning it up this year on political purity tests that pit those who like their economic and social conservatism straight against those who want it with a twist of Ted Cruz.\n\nThis has already made for an expensive race in Mississippi. Roughly $8 million in outside spending has been lavished on the state\u2019s television stations\u2014in addition to big spending from the Club for Growth, Citizens United and the Tea Party Patriots for McDaniel and big spending from the Chamber and the National Association of Realtors for Cochran. The race has seen $1.1 million spent by \u201cSenate Conservatives Action\u201d for McDaniel and $1.7 million spent by the \u201cMississippi Conservatives\u201d super PAC for Cochran. Ad Policy\n\nConfused? Don\u2019t be.\n\nMcDaniel is a conservative.\n\nAnd so is Cochran.\n\nDespite the theater-of-the-absurd campaign, it is even more absurd to suggest that Cochran is a liberal with a Southern accent. Mississippi is not in the habit of populating the Senate with progressives. The incumbent\u2019s latest US Chamber of Commerce rating is 100 percent, while his National Education Association ranking is zero. Cochran\u2019s latest ACLU rating is zero, while the American Security Council Foundation has got him at 100 percent. Cochran gets 100 percent from the National Rifle Association and he\u2019s at zero with the American Association of University Women. His latest rating from the National Right-to-Life Committee is 100 percent, while NARAL Pro-Choice America has him at zero\u2014as does the latest assessment from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\nIt is true that Cochran has, on rare occasions been a reasonable player. But those are pretty much the same rare occasions when Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, another Tea Party target this year, has chosen not to follow Cruz off whatever deep end the Texan might be approaching. Usually, what passes for reasonableness is a vote to take care of some pressing home-state business\u2014such as, in Cochran\u2019s case, specific support for disaster assistance after hurricanes hit the Mississippi coast and general enthusiasm for military spending that keeps Mississippians employed.\n\nThat may make Cochran insufficiently \u201cpure\u201d for the purists.\n\nBut it is not a distinction that the vast majority of Americans need bother with, unless, of course, they really do imagine that Thad Cochran and Mitch McConnell are liberals.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mcdaniel_cochran_ms_senate_rtr_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "John Nichols", "description": "Near tie in Mississippi forces runoff between a conservative and a conservative who says the conservative isn't conservative enough.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Near tie in Mississippi forces runoff between a conservative and a conservative who says the conservative isn't conservative enough.", "title": "GOP Civil War?
