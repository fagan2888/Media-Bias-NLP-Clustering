The Associated Press\n\nThe Obama administration has less than a month left to achieve its goal of enrolling 9.1 million people in insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but appears to be nearly there. More than 7.1 million consumers have now signed up for coverage, according to this week's release of enrollment numbers from the Department of Health and Human Services.
