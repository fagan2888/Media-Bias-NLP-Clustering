According to the ACA, the employee\u2019s contribution for their health coverage cannot exceed 9.5 percent of their household income. Because a merger can lead to companies paying different wages, businesses need to take the affordability aspect into account when choosing to join with another company.Despite all these new obligations that need to be taken into account, Wright and Kelley still believe Minnesota\u2019s M&A activity forecast is positive.\u201cMinnesota\u2019s corporate climate is better positioned to not experience a slow down compared to other areas,\u201d Wright said. \u201cLargely because Minnesota was already at the forefront of providing good health care. In areas that have seen added costs, they\u2019ve had less of an impact here because our state insurance guidelines already imposed some of those requirements.\u201dWright said Minnesota\u2019s business makeup also bodes well for M&A activity. Because a lot of companies in Minnesota require more skilled labor, the positions are better paid and received fairly good health care coverage already.\u201cNow that isn\u2019t to say we don\u2019t have plenty of restaurants and franchisee groups that have more part-time employees and will need to struggle with it more,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd for some of them it will be quite a shock, because if they haven\u2019t had to offer any coverage in the past, they\u2019ll be going from zero to full turbo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"document-title": "Will Health Care Reform Deter M&A Activity?", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,tcbmag.com", "document-issearchable": "true", "document-description": "Could the Affordable Care Act lead to a decline of mergers and acquisitions in Minnesota or just a more complex vetting process?", "og": {"url": "http://tcbmag.com/News/Recent-News/2013/November/Will-Health-Care-Reform-Deter-M-A-Activity/", "image": "http://tcbmag.com/CMSTemplates/TCB/Images/fb-twin-cities-business.png", "type": "article", "description": "Minnesota\u2019s leading provider of business news, insight, and analysis through a monthly magazine, twice-weekly e-newsletter, daily online news stories, events, and an annual business information guide.", "title": "Will Health Care Reform Deter M&A Activity?"}, "document-image": "06cb5df9-2047-4f94-b431-9a66d6606ec8", "fb": {"app_id": 385902024814671}, "document-date": "11/7/2013 2:20:12 PM"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b8a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLargely because Minnesota was already at the forefront of providing good health care.\n\u201cSo it really ups the ante for how companies need to explain themselves pre-merger.\u201dKelley said businesses also need to keep in mind the health care affordability requirement.\nAccording to the ACA, the employee\u2019s contribution for their health coverage cannot exceed 9.5 percent of their household income.\nIn areas that have seen added costs, they\u2019ve had less of an impact here because our state insurance guidelines already imposed some of those requirements.\u201dWright said Minnesota\u2019s business makeup also bodes well for M&A activity.\nTo receive business news directly in your inbox each Tuesday and Thursday, sign up for our free e-newsletter, Briefcase, and be sure to join the conversation by commenting below."}
