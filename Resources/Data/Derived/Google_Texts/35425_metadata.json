The suspect, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, then killed himself. Brinsley, who had threatened to kill police officers on social media in response to the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, had traveled to New York from Baltimore, where authorities believe he also shot his ex-girlfriend.\n\nMerely by voicing concerns about police treatment of black men like Garner and Brown, many conservatives asserted, figures like Obama, de Blasio, and Attorney General Eric Holder encouraged vigilantism against law enforcement. Appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d this morning, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said, \u201cThey have created an atmosphere of severe, strong, anti-police hatred in certain communities. For that, they should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nSimilar sentiments could be found throughout the conservative Twittersphere, where former New York Gov. George Pataki, who says he\u2019s considering a 2016 run for president, called the shootings a \u201cpredictable outcome\u201d of \u201canti-cop rhetoric\u201d:\n\nSickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of #ericholder & #mayordeblasio. #NYPD \u2014 George E.
