They met in Regmi\u2019s hometown of Phidim, Nepal, where Parsuram worked when not confined to the refugee camp. Both were eventually resettled in San Antonio and now have jobs in the health care industry\u2014Regmi at a home health care agency and her husband at an area hospital.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine how long without electricity?\u201d Regmi asks. \u201cEighteen years [for my husband.]\n\n\u201cI lived with my family, and he [Parsuram] found a job over there [in Phidim]. After we married, I came to camp.\u201d\n\nRegmi\u2019s story is proof that love knows no borders, but neither do injustice and tragedy.\n\nnull\n\nAt one point, a couple decades ago, more than 100,000 Bhutanese\u2014most of Nepali descent and known as the Lhostshampa\u2014were herded into the refugee camps set up along the southeastern border of Nepal, which also shares a border with India. They had been forced out of their homes in southern Bhutan, victims of a government crackdown that basically stripped them of their human rights and declared them \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d based on their ethnicity\u2014even though most Lhostshampas traced their roots in Bhutan back to the 19th century or earlier, when they were encouraged to settle there to farm the land.\n\nThose who protested the Bhutanese government\u2019s increasing repression, which escalated starting in the mid-1980s, were persecuted, many tortured. By the early 1990s, thousands found their citizenship revoked, their homes leveled and the majority of their community forced to flee en masse to squalid border camps set up in Nepal to handle the exodus. The United Nations finally intervened in the late 2000s, and since then has helped to resettle some 80,000 Bhutan refugees in other countries\u2014with more than 66,000 accepted by the United States alone. Nearly 800 have been resettled in San Antonio to date, State Department figures show.\n\nThe story of the Bhutanese refugees, unfortunately, is not unique. The U.N. estimates that as of 2012 there were more than 15 million refugees worldwide\u2014which, in terms of scale, is nearly twice the number of people who live in New York City.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, the United States has resettled in excess of 3 million refugees, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], which, along with the State Department, oversees and funds refugee resettlement programs in this country. Up to 70,000 refugees will be resettled in the U.S. in fiscal year 2014, which ends September 30, President Obama\u2019s Proposed Refugee Admissions report to Congress indicates.\n\nIn fact, since 2004, nearly 5,200 refugees from 28 nations have been resettled in the Alamo City, according to Department of State data, including more than 1,200 from Burma, nearly 1,100 from Iraq and 1,221 from 13 African nations. No precise figures are available on the current size of San Antonio\u2019s refugee community because the information is not tracked systematically, given the refugees \u201care on a path to U.S. citizenship,\u201d Lisa Raffonelli, a spokesperson for HHS\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement, said.\n\nnull\n\nIn general, the Current discovered there is a lack of centralized data on the nation\u2019s refugee community. Federal, state and local agencies all track the information separately and often use differing methodologies, so it\u2019s nearly impossible to compare San Antonio\u2019s refugee-population track record with the performance of other cities.\n\nAs a result, local experts can only estimate the size of the Alamo City\u2019s current refugee community\u2014putting the number at about 10,000 to 12,000, and growing. That takes into account children born to refugee families after they are resettled here and also those who have come to San Antonio outside the State Department-sponsored resettlement process\u2014such as those who become eligible for refugee status under U.S. law once they cross the border, even on their own accord.\n\nIn addition, other factors on the global level could expand the refugee population further in years to come. For example, the thousands of unaccompanied children crossing the U.S. border in recent months\u2014most fleeing violence and poverty in Central America \u2014 are not currently considered refugees and remain subject to deportation. But that policy could be adjusted in the future due to international pressure, allowing more of them to remain in the United States.\n\nThat growth poses both opportunities and challenges for the City of San Antonio. The opportunities exist in the cultural texture and depth the refugee population brings to a city already well known for its tourism and diversity. The challenges, however, are daunting, and are reflected in the harsh economic realities confronting this population.\n\nThe Race to Self-Sufficiency\n\nEmployment data tracked down by the Current paint a grim picture for refugees resettled in San Antonio, who, under existing law, are given a short period\u2014essentially 180 days\u2014to make the transition to self-sufficiency after they land in the United States.\n\n\u201cNobody can become culturally acclimated in six months. It\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Margaret Costantino, founder and executive director of the Center for Refugee Services, a small nonprofit that provides services to the city\u2019s refugee population.\n\nThe big player in the city on that front, though, is Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of San Antonio Inc. It is the lead government contractor locally charged with assisting the 700-plus refugees resettled in the city each year by the Department of State, in coordination with HHS. The goal of Catholic Charities\u2019 Refugee Services department is to ensure the individuals it assists attain self-sufficiency within four to six months of being picked up at the San Antonio airport\u2014again, an objective mandated by federal programs funding those efforts.\n\nThe services provided to refugees by Catholic Charities include assisting \u201cwith housing, food and clothing, employment, language, translation, general adjustments and acculturation,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s 2012 annual report\u2014the latest available online.\n\nPublic records show that in fiscal 2014, Catholic Charities in San Antonio received nearly $1.5 million in federal funding\u2014some passed through the state of Texas\u2014to provide services to refugees resettled in the Alamo City. The money includes a $110,440 Refugee School Impact grant, $432,042 in Refugee Social Services funding and a $946,000 federal matching grant, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission [HHSC].\n\nCatholic Charities is also required, as a condition of some of the government funding, to match a portion of the federal money it receives with its own cash or in-kind contributions.\n\nPaula Walker, refugee services director for Catholic Charities in San Antonio, said the nonprofit also has a $112,000 contract through the state of Texas to provide health screening services to refugees within the first 30 days of their arrival in the city.\n\nIn addition, the Department of State provides Catholic Charities with a $1,925 lump sum per refugee to assist them with meeting expenses during their first three months in the United States. That stipend\u2014$800 of which is for Catholic Charities\u2019 administrative expenses, like staffing and office space\u2014helps the refugees pay for rent, clothing, food and other basic necessities.\n\nWalker said programs like the federal matching grant cover those basic needs for another three months after the initial stipend is exhausted. But after six months, the cash assistance times out\u2014though employment, language and other social services are made available to the refugees for up to five years.\n\nWalker said the refugee population in San Antonio has many needs, and resources are always stretched. But she also stressed that she believes refugees \u201chave a great shot\u201d at having a much better life once in the United States, \u201cespecially knowing where they came from, their plight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of refugees that come to the U.S. is a very low number compared to the displaced persons in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMany get turned away. \u2026 [Those that make it here,] they\u2019re the survivors.\u201d\n\nBut even if the refugees arriving in San Antonio can be considered better off from a global perspective simply because they are no longer living in tents in refugee camps or dodging bullets in war zones, it is clear that a large number of them, by any reasonable U.S. standards, appear to be falling through the cracks on the road to self-sufficiency.\n\nThe employment rate among the 720 San Antonio refugees who participated in state of Texas-sponsored job-services programs in fiscal year 2013 stood at only 57 percent for that year, Texas HHSC data shows. That means 43 percent of the individuals tracked did not find jobs. The good news, according to HHSC spokesperson Linda Edwards Gockel, is that 344, or 84 percent, of those who did find work in fiscal 2013 retained their jobs for 90 days or more\u2014considered a strong retention rate.\n\nHowever, the average wage for the 411 refugees who did find work in the Alamo City in fiscal 2013, according to HHSC data, was a scant $8.46 per hour (compared with a statewide average of $8.93 for refugees). In addition, among those who did find work, only 337 landed jobs that offered health benefits.\n\nnull\n\nThe federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of HHS, also provided the Current with an analysis of local refugees covered under the federally funded \u201cmatching grant\u201d program in fiscal 2013.\n\nMost refugees in Texas are enrolled in the program, HHS\u2019 Raffonelli said, and are provided employment services through it for a maximum of 180 days. At that six-month cut-off in fiscal 2013, HHS figures show, only 77 percent of the 587 San Antonio individuals participating in the matching grant program were deemed \u201cself-sufficient.\u201d\n\nNow, in fed-speak, self-sufficient simply means that at least one person in the family unit had a job and no one in the family was receiving any direct cash assistance from the government\u2014though participation in Medicaid, food stamps or another non-cash programs is allowed in the calculation.\n\nThe disturbing revelation in the HHS analysis is that even with those government-funded benefits included, some 23 percent of the 587 individuals at day 180 still failed to meet the self-sufficiency test.\n\nWalker points out that the employment statistics alone don\u2019t tell the whole story, since refugees \u201cmay not get employed immediately [or at least within the six-month window that guides federal program funding] due to a number of obstacles.\u201d For example, she said there has been a surge in Cuban refugees arriving in San Antonio this year, 127 since February.\n\nMany are arriving outside the State Department-resettlement process. Under federal law, Cubans making it to U.S. soil, such as entering the country on their own from Mexico, can automatically be granted refugee status and become eligible for employment and other social services. However, Walker noted that for Cuban refugees, it takes more than four months to obtain necessary employment authorization cards, potentially skewing employment data conclusions.\n\nIn addition, she said shorter-term employment outcomes for refugees are affected by the lack of affordable child-care options available to refugee families. Consequently, one spouse may have to remain out of the workforce longer until a workable child-care solution is found.\n\nWalker stressed that when viewed over a longer timeframe, past a year, the employment statistics for refugees improve considerably. Though she did not provide specific data, Walker claimed the job-placement rate for the employable refugee population served by her organization was around 69 percent for 16 months between October 1, 2012 and January 31, 2014.\n\nBut even if the 69 percent figure Walker provided is accurate, it still means 31 percent of the refugees, even after being in the country up to 16 months, still remained unemployed in a city where the overall unemployment rate hovers around 5 to 6 percent.\n\n\u201cWe all, as resettlement agencies, feel that refugees do need more time [and funding to become self-sufficient]\u2014easily one year,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBut will the American people like that?\u201d\n\nCulture Shock\n\nSt. Francis Episcopal Church and a number of other local faith communities across multiple denominations have long recognized that the needs of the refugee community outstrip existing resources and, consequently, have been very active in reaching out to bridge the gaps.\n\nSt. Francis, for example, hosts a free refugee health clinic twice a month that is run by students and faculty from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. It also sponsors food and clothing drives, hosts English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, provides land for a community garden and was the site for the annual World Refugee Day celebration held in late June.\n\nRev. Cristopher Robinson, rector of St. Francis, located on the Northwest Side (in the heart of San Antonio\u2019s refugee community), said his first experience working with refugees was actually in Austin, while he was in seminary school.\n\n\u201cI worked getting jobs and apartments for these refugees as they were coming in and saw the [rough] conditions in which these folks had to live on the East and South sides of Austin,\u201d Rev. Robinson said. \u201cAnd I was the one who asked the question: \u2018Why are we bringing people to the states and setting them up for failure?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are putting them in amongst urban poor who are not the same culture that these folks are,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t speak the same language, they [the refugees] don\u2019t have the support system.\n\n\u201cAnd the answer I got,\u201d Rev. Robinson recalled, \u201cwas, \u2018Alive and poor in Austin is better than dead in the Sudan.\u2019 I guess there\u2019s some merit to that but at the same time, what we\u2019re able to do is not enough.\u201d\n\nThe refugee resettlement program is premised on the philosophy that refugees \u201cshould be encouraged and motivated to become self-sufficient as quickly as possible,\u201d explained Daniel Langenkamp, spokesman for the U.S. State Department. If they are not self-sufficient, he added, then the goal is to mainstream them into programs that assist other low-income Americans, such as Medicaid or food stamps.\n\n\u201cMainstreaming is important: There needs to be a lot of motivation and encouragement for people to become self-sufficient,\u201d Langenkamp said.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that many refugees are not even taking advantage of the dwindling social safety-net programs that are available to all \u201clow-income Americans.\u201d Often, Costantino and others said, it\u2019s because they simply don\u2019t understand how the U.S. bureaucracy works nor do they have the language skills or civics knowledge to complete lengthy forms (especially if they are online), schedule appointments or navigate the city\u2019s transit system in order to get to appointments.\n\n\u201cMost of the people doesn\u2019t know, if those papers come from Health and Human Services, they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Nepali refugee Regmi, who added that she and her husband volunteer a lot of time assisting fellow refugees in filling out paperwork or checking newspaper want-ads for them because many can\u2019t read English.\n\n\u201cAnd most of the time, they [other refugees] lose the food stamp or Medicaid, but why? [Because] they doesn\u2019t know when it need to be renewed,\u201d Regmi added. \u201cThey still eligible for Medicaid, but didn\u2019t know how to renew the Medicaid or how to renew the food stamp.\u201d\n\nDr. Robert Ambrosino is a professor in the University of Texas\u2014San Antonio Department of Social Work who has researched the refugee community and made it the focus of past graduate-level studies for his students. He points out that the expectations being placed on newly arrived refugees are extraordinary, given very few of us would succeed in becoming self-sufficient within six months after being transplanted from the United States with no savings and dropped in a foreign land where we don\u2019t know the culture or language.\n\nMany of the refugees being resettled in the United States, Ambrosino claimed, have to endure great \u201cstressors\u201d in their lives due to the over-crowded conditions in the refugee camps and the horrific events they have witnessed in conflict zones. These stressors negatively affect both their physical and mental health, and are amplified by the culture and financial shock experienced once they arrive in the United States.\n\n\u201cFor example, they [the refugees] all have to sign a promissory note with the U.S. government promising to pay back the money spent to fly them to the United States,\u201d Ambrosino said. \u201cIn the case of one father I met, who had a family of 10, he was facing a $15,000 promissory note that he had to pay back, and that was from day one in this country.\u201d\n\nLangenkamp confirmed that the refugees are required to repay the cost of their plane tickets and have up to five years to do so interest-free. He added that failure to repay the note could affect an individual\u2019s credit rating but also said it\u2019s \u201crelatively easy to get an extension\u201d on the repayment terms.\n\nResources Stretched\n\nThe Center for Refugee Services, an all-volunteer grassroots group that punches way above its weight class, also seeks to address the economic and social-services needs of the refugee community.\n\nThe nonprofit offers a range of economic, community and social services from its small office at 8703 Wurzbach Road on the Northwest Side\u2014including English classes, employment assistance, a food pantry, transportation assistance, and health and wellness support. It also plans to open a small craft shop onsite, as well as a community garden.\n\nCRS\u2019 most recently available Form 990 tax filing, shows the nonprofit took in about $35,000 in revenue in 2012, with nearly $13,000 eaten up by rent. CRS\u2019 Costantino concedes the group operates on a shoestring, but she credits the volunteer spirit of its members for having an impact far beyond the meager dollars the organization has at its disposal.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing it with nothing, keeping our utilities and our rent paid,\u201d she said. \u201cVolunteers have passion and resources and can accomplish the most amazing things just because they want to help people.\u201d\n\nCostantino is hopeful by nature and believes the children of the refugees are key to lifting their families out of poverty, if access to education is assured. But she also sees danger signs ahead if the cycle of poverty is not broken.\n\n\u201cAs this [refugee] population grows, and if problems are not addressed, it will become a big problem for the city \u2026\u201d she said.\n\nThe bulk of the refugee families resettled in San Antonio are placed in apartments that too often are in rough shape and located in hardscrabble neighborhoods\u2014such as the Gardendale/Wurzbach Road area near Interstate 10 on the Northwest Side, Costantino points out. That area is served by Northside Independent School District, which, in the 2013-2014 school year, NISD officials confirmed, enrolled a total of 1,069 refugee students.\n\nNoelia Benson, director of bilingual and ESL education for NISD, explains that in addition to providing English-as-a-Second-Language services to refugee students, the school district also \u201cutilizes newcomer schools, where newly arrived immigrant students are provided the opportunity to acclimate to school life in smaller class-size classroom.\u201d According to Benson, NISD offers support in as many native languages as the district can find tutors. They also provide summer enrichment activities and integrated studies so students can consistently practice speaking, listening, reading and writing skills.\n\nNISD Principal Rebecca Barron-Flores, in an article penned for the National Association of Elementary School Principals, also makes clear that language acquisition isn\u2019t the only hurdle some refugee children must overcome\u2014particularly those from impoverished developing countries.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have had to teach many of them how to use a restroom properly, and how to go make choices for the lunch meal and eat in the cafeteria,\u201d Barron-Flores wrote. \u201cInitially, many of them would urinate on the playground and\u2014rather than using the tables and chairs in the cafeteria\u2014they would sit on the floor \u2026 and eat off one another\u2019s plates.\u201d\n\nBut, regardless of the need, there is no free lunch when it comes to providing the enhanced services necessary to assure these refugee children are at least given a chance to succeed after starting out so far behind in the race to self-sufficiency.\n\n\u201cNISD currently spends about $1.8 million [annually] on staffing for refugee students,\u201d Monica Faulkenberry, NISD\u2019s assistant director of communications, said. \u201cThis is above and beyond the regular education staffing.\u201d\n\nEducating a Community\n\nBuddha Nepal is a senior at UTSA who expects to graduate with a degree in mathematics this December. He holds down a job at a local fast-food restaurant, working his way through college and living in an apartment complex that he says challenges his safety daily. But Nepal has faced adversity in his life before and understands what it means to be a survivor.\n\n\u201cI basically lived 15 or 16 years in refugee camp,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cI was three months old at most when I lived in Bhutan and moved to [a refugee camp on the border of] Nepal.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2008, shortly after being resettled with his family in San Antonio, Nepal and half a dozen or so other young refugees, with the assistance of some mentors and legal research, essentially organized a sit-in outside the registrar\u2019s office at NISD\u2019s O\u2019Connor High School. The group refused to leave until they were assured that the young refugees gathered there that day (ages 18 to 21) would be admitted to high school. Until that point, Nepal said refugee students 18 and older (including his sister and uncle, but not Nepal who was 17 at the time), were not being allowed into NISD high schools due to their age.\n\nNepal\u2019s tenacity paid off and the refugee students who assembled at O\u2019Connor that day were enrolled in NISD high schools. \u201cEveryone thought I was [a] troublemaker,\u201d Nepal recalled. \u201c[But] I wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere. I wanted answers.\n\n\u201c\u2026 My parents told me, \u2018Why you doing this? You don\u2019t need [to] get involved in this,\u2019\u201d Nepal added. \u201cI said, well, \u2018No. I\u2019m not going to give up. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nNepal\u2019s act of nonviolent civil disobedience at O\u2019Connor High School in the summer of 2008 appears to have played a key role in shifting NISD policy on admitting refugee students who are ages 18 or older. Today, NISD officials confirmed, students up to the age of 22 are admitted to high schools in the district.\n\n\u201cThe statements you make and attribute to Buddha Nepal are accurate,\u201d NISD Executive Director of Communications Pascual Gonzalez said. \u201cWhen student Nepal\u2019s plight became known to us, it was apparent that we were facing a new phenomenon in NISD.\n\n\u201c\u2026 We needed to put systems in place that would allow our older refugee students to be successful,\u201d Gonzalez added. \u201cBy this time, NISD had become the district of choice for refugee students of all ages (with and without proof of age), from a variety of countries and language backgrounds, and with none to some previous education.\u201d\n\nNepal\u2019s leadership and organizing skills are an example of how the refugee community itself has the power to find and pursue solutions to some of the issues they face.\n\nBut other problems are so intractable and complex that solutions seem certain to remain elusive absent a far broader coordinated approach involving a coalition of players citywide.\n\n\u201cThe main issue I see, is the jobs,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cBecause they [refugees] have no education [and limited or no English], they are working hard-labor jobs, so education is very important.\n\n\u201c[But] the students [refugee children] lose interest in education \u2026 or they have to go to work,\u201d Nepal added. \u201cFamily members have to contribute to rent and utilities and other stuff, and they usually have no benefits, and most do not know how to apply for Medicaid and food stamps. And if they do apply, usually they are turned down.\u201d\n\nConsequently, he added, many refugees end up getting locked into low-paying, backbreaking, benefit-less, dead-end jobs at an early age. And because Texas did not expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), most refugees\u2014like working poor with minimum-wage jobs\u2014 fall into a salary band in which they aren\u2019t eligible for health-care subsidies nor do they qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe statistics from NISD are not promising either. For the 2012-2013 school year, 38 refugee students graduated from high school, while 11 dropped out\u2014a 77.5 percent graduation rate. By comparison, NISD\u2019s overall graduation rate for 2013 was 92.4 percent.\n\nThe two figures aren\u2019t comparable apples-to-apples, given the former is an annual average and the latter based on a four-year running average, but clearly the graduation-data snapshot for the NISD refugee students isn\u2019t entirely positive.\n\nEven with Nepal\u2019s victory in getting NISD to raise the age cap on students admitted to high school, Costantino of CRS said some students continue to \u201cage out,\u201d because if they start high school as freshmen at age 19 or older, they have three years or less to finish a four-year program before turning 22.\n\nCostantino said CRS has a program in place with a local private school to help some of those students graduate with a high-school diploma, but more resources are needed.\n\nGonzalez said many of the refugees arriving in San Antonio from \u201call points all over the world\u201d have no educational records, formal schooling or even birth records. So, he said, \u201cwhen in doubt,\u201d the older children are placed as freshmen in high school, and \u201csome could well be 19-years-old.\u201d He stressed that NISD does all it can to make up the deficits\u2014which can be \u201cmassive\u201d and can include a lack of basic arithmetic and English literacy.\n\n\u201cCatholic Charities provides them with six months [of economic] support. Obviously that is not enough for many of these families,\u201d Gonzalez added. \u201cMost of the refugees who leave NISD high schools leave because they have to go to work to support their families. While GEDs are an option, even these are quite challenging for them.\n\n\u201cAging-out may be a contributor to the drop-out issue among refugees. But the main reason is economic. Until this is addressed, the problem will continue.\u201d\n\nOvercoming Inertia\n\nThough the issues plaguing San Antonio\u2019s refugee community may be legion, and in many cases inseparable from the woes affecting the city\u2019s low-income population in general, for any positive change to take hold, the first steps must be taken, local experts argue.\n\nRoseann Vivanco, a Health Science Center clinical instructor and nursing director for the San Antonio Refugee Health Clinic, stressed that \u201cthere needs to be better coordination and trust among the people already working hard to meet the needs of this population.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Refugee Health Clinic is a model for that cooperation because it brings together health-care students and faculty from three different disciplines\u2014nursing, medicine and dentistry\u2014to provide free care to refugee families in a culturally friendly setting twice a month (with plans to expand to once weekly), via assistance from St. Francis Episcopal Church, which hosts the clinic. The free clinic is funded by the Center for Medical Humanities & Ethics at the Health Science Center.\n\nVivanco said the clinic\u2019s staff had 153 patient encounters in 2013 and, as of June 3 of this year, that number was at 72 and rising. Those patients are getting access to affordable health care early, in their neighborhood and through a collaborative model that benefits both the refugees and the Health Science Center students, Vivanco stressed.\n\nWith the right space and funding mix, some argue, that model could be expanded to encompass other services for the refugee community.\n\nDr. Andrew Muck, also a Health Science Center clinical instructor and the Refugee Health Clinic\u2019s medical director, explained that creating a care environment that is culturally sensitive and easy to access for refugees is key to catching problems early, before they become life threatening and treatment gets more expensive. Muck noted one case he encountered recently in which a refugee delayed seeing a doctor due to cost concerns, resulting in a simple urinary track infection becoming a systemic one that required hospitalization and ended with a $48,000 bill.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I think about with health care issues specifically, what you learn from a clinic like this, is with culturally sensitive and language-specific care, you can do a lot fairly inexpensively, with some forethought, with some motivated, caring individuals, which San Antonio is known for,\u201d Muck said.\n\nOver the past year, councilman Ron Nirenberg, who represents the Northwest Side\u2019s District 8, where many of the refugees live, has been convening what he calls \u201crefugee summit\u201d meetings at City Hall with key stakeholders that serve the refugee community in San Antonio\u2014such as NISD, VIA Metropolitan Transit and Catholic Charities, among others.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to get all of these service providers communicating and hopefully collaborating,\u201d Nirenberg said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve asked city staff to do, which they have done, is to assemble a matrix of services that are out there for refugees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what our end game is in terms of our role as the City, but what I think it is [is] that we help create some kind of collaborating organization that helps keep all these pieces moving in concert, and the resources coming in and working in concert, and making sure we have real trackable outcomes that are positive for the families and their communities.\u201d\n\nNirenberg concedes that \u201cfunds are stretched at every corner of the state and country,\u201d but he says he is optimistic that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of efficiency and efficacy to be found just by coordinating, and we should start there.\u201d\n\nOne thing is clear in Buddha Nepal\u2019s mind, however. San Antonio\u2019s refugee population is growing, \u201cand it will keep growing,\u201d he said. With a potential surge of people applying for refugee status due to sectarian violence in the Middle East and gang brutality in Central America, the time to act is now.\n\n\u201cI think the school district and San Antonio as a city need to look at the situation,\u201d he added. \u201cMost refugee parents right now are just working and do not have an education.\n\n\u201cBut their kids do know the system, more than their parents, and if they go bad, a whole generation could go bad, and it will be too late after that. They need some direction \u2026 to encourage them to do the right things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "The refugee camps are packed with tents, bamboo huts and nationless people.
