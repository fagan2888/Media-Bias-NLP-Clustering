On Wednesday, the fight spilled onto Capitol Hill, causing both sides to ramp up their arguments in the days leading up to the hearings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficials warned senators that investigators are being thwarted \u201cevery day\u201d by encrypted communications and asked for help pressuring companies to comply with court orders seeking the data.\n\n\u201cOur job is to look at a haystack the size of this country for needles that are increasingly invisible to us because of end-to-end encryption,\u201d FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing.\n\n\u201cI can tell you from personal experience it\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s happening every day,\u201d said Sally Yates, deputy attorney general at the Justice Department (DOJ), adding that the agency didn\u2019t have an exact metric to chart these instances.\n\nComey has been leading the charge to alert the public that without some type of government access to encrypted data, criminals and terrorists will be able to operate with impunity. Technologists and privacy advocates have vigorously opposed such privileged access, arguing it would cripple worldwide digital privacy and fail to stop criminals.\n\nSeveral senators, such as Judiciary Committee ranking member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), echoed these concerns Wednesday.\n\n\u201cStrong encryption would still be available from foreign providers,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cSome say that any competent Internet user would be able to download strong encryption technology, or install an app allowing encrypted communications, regardless of restrictions on American businesses. But it would put American companies at a disadvantage in the global marketplace.\u201d\n\nBut numerous other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle sided with Comey and Yates.\n\n\u201cThis is a most serious problem,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Comey is also slated to testify Wednesday. \u201cI think we need to provide a court-ordered process for obtaining that data.\u201d\n\nOpponents allege the administration's plan amounts to \u201cbackdoor\u201d access for governments, a concept anathema to security specialists.\n\nEven if a company, not the government, maintains the key to unlock its its own encryption, that key still exists, allowing efarious hackers to seek it out and use it to pilfer information, they argue.\n\n\u201cIt would be bad for our privacy, it would be bad for national security because if you give the good guys keys, it\u2019s likely the bad guys are going to get keys,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a staunch privacy advocate, told The Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s bad economics because it\u2019ll be hard for our companies to retain the confidence of consumers both here and around the country.\n\nThe stance, he said, is \u201ca loser on all counts.\u201d\n\nYates pushed back against the notion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeking a frontdoor or backdoor or any other kind of door,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeking for the government to have direct access to any of these communications.\u201d\n\nAnd contrary to numerous reports, Yates insisted the administration does not want Congress to step in, although she wouldn\u2019t rule it out down the line.\n\n\u201cOur goal here is not to mandate a legislative solution,\u201d she said. \u201cBut rather to have each provider think about, and work out a way where they will be able to respond to a court order.\u201d\n\n\u201cLead by persuasion is the way I interpret it,\u201d responded Judiciary Committee head Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).\n\nComey painted a disturbing picture of the way the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using encrypted communications to evade investigators.\n\nThe extremist group is communicating with tens of thousands of Americans through Twitter, he explained, pushing them to either join the cause or commit domestic acts of terror.\n\n\u201cThere is a device, almost a devil on their shoulder all day long saying kill, kill, kill, kill,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they find someone, and they have found many of those someones in the United States, that are interested in this, we can see Twitter, we will see them give directions to a mobile messaging app that is end-to-end encrypted, and tell them, 'Contact me here,' \u201d Comey continued. \u201cAnd they disappear.\u201d\n\nThus far, the FBI has been able to follow these cases and thwart potential attacks, he said.\n\n\u201cBut it is incredibly difficult,\u201d Comey added. \u201cI cannot see me stopping these indefinitely.\u201d\n\nMany accuse Comey of using scare tactics to overstate the problem. His opponents cite a DOJ report to the Judiciary Committee that showed its wiretaps were foiled a mere four times out of the 25 instances a wiretap encountered encryption in 2014.\n\nSen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) pressed Yates for specific data.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any real data about how often encryption is thwarting investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you shed any light on that? Is that something that could be studied?\u201d\n\nYates said investigators have stopped even seeking wiretaps for encrypted communications, knowing they will be rebuffed.\n\n\u201cSo being able to give you hard numbers on the number of cases that have been impacted is really impossible for us,\u201d she said.\n\nFranken appeared frustrated by the answer. He asked the DOJ to start tracking \u201cthe number of times you run into technological challenges and therefore don\u2019t seek a warrant for a wiretap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to think about how we think about this,\u201d he said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t come with a solution,\" Comey conceded. \"This is a really hard problem.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Officials warned senators that investigators are being thwarted by encrypted communications.", "description": "Officials warned senators that investigators are being thwarted by encrypted communications.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Officials warned senators that investigators are being thwarted by encrypted communications.", "title": "Administration spars with lawmakers over access to encrypted data", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247228-encryption-battle-reaches-capitol-hill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/comeyjames_090514getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-08T14:30:07-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-08T14:30-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247228-encryption-battle-reaches-capitol-hill", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-08T14:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Encryption, End-to-end encryption,Sally Yates, James Comey,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-08T14:10:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T14:30:07-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/247228-encryption-battle-reaches-capitol-hill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Officials warned senators that investigators are being thwarted by encrypted communications.", "card": "summary", "title": "Administration spars with lawmakers over access to encrypted data"}, "dcterms.title": "Administration spars with lawmakers over access to encrypted data"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe41db\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere is a device, almost a devil on their shoulder all day long saying kill, kill, kill, kill,\u201d he said.\nFor months, the administration has been sparring with technologists, Silicon Valley and many lawmakers over its push to give government access to encrypted data.\nComey has been leading the charge to alert the public that without some type of government access to encrypted data, criminals and terrorists will be able to operate with impunity.\nTechnologists and privacy advocates have vigorously opposed such privileged access, arguing it would cripple worldwide digital privacy and fail to stop criminals.\nADVERTISEMENTOfficials warned senators that investigators are being thwarted \u201cevery day\u201d by encrypted communications and asked for help pressuring companies to comply with court orders seeking the data."}
