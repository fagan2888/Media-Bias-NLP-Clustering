The surgery was traumatic, leaving only 60 percent of her liver behind. She had painful, incapacitating scar tissue that prevented her from bending.\n\n\u201cI was so debilitated; I couldn\u2019t even take milk out of the refrigerator,\u201d says Wight, who used a pair of tongs to pick things up around the house.\n\nAs the agony persisted, affecting all aspects of her life, Wight found herself on a medical treadmill. She had joined the ranks of people who suffer from chronic pain.\n\n\u201cYou are pigeonholed as a particular kind of patient,\u201d she says. \u201cDoctors think they know how to treat you because it\u2019s in your records. Sometimes it seems nothing works, and then finally you find THE doctor. A doctor that has a good referral system is extremely important.\u201d\n\nChronic pain \u2014 pain that lingers six or more months beyond the time it typically takes for an injury or illness to heal \u2014 affects an estimated 100 million Americans, according to the Institute of Medicine.\n\nComorbidities are common too. Fifty percent are clinically depressed. Many have anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, isolation and other problems that peck away at joy and well-being.\n\nTHE PILL PROBLEM\n\nOpioid medication \u2014 oxycodone, hydrocodone, and others \u2014 is the most common and frequently-prescribed treatment for moderate to severe chronic pain, according to a 2013 report by the American Chronic Pain Association. That\u2019s because for most people it works.\n\nBut health care providers, mental health professionals and patients know how relying on pills alone, or taking them for long periods of time, can be a slippery slope.\n\n\u201cOpioids carry a lot of baggage,\u201d says Dr. Rafael Miguel, medical director of the Pain Medicine Program at Sarasota Memorial Hospital\u2019s Institute for Advanced Medicine.\n\nMiguel says painkillers usually come with a lot of unpleasant side effects \u2014 ranging from bothersome, to intolerable and potentially dangerous. Strict laws and increased monitoring of the way opioids are prescribed and dijstributed in Florida have also forced doctors and patients to rethink treatment options.\n\nAnd patients\u2019 dependency on painkillers and fear of withdrawal can keep them tethered to a medication they\u2019d rather not take anymore.\n\n\"There are many things we can do so you don\u2019t have to be attached to a pill. I\u2019m not going to really help you if I just give you the pills and don\u2019t address everything else anyway.\" \u2014 Dr. Myrdalis Diaz-Ramirez, medical director at the Comprehensive Pain Center of Sarasota\n\n\u201cMy experience is that patients don\u2019t want to take a pill \u2014 they want their lives back,\u201d says Dr. Myrdalis Diaz-Ramirez, medical director at the Comprehensive Pain Center of Sarasota. \u201cThere are many things we can do so you don\u2019t have to be attached to a pill. I\u2019m not going to really help you if I just give you the pills and don\u2019t address everything else anyway.\u201d\n\nWight says that because her liver is too vulnerable to metabolize strong painkillers, she has had to find other ways to cope with chronic pain \u2014 including a combination of tools and non-opioid treatments.\n\nWight now enjoys a full, active lifestyle. She also facilitates a monthly chronic pain support group at the Waldemere Medical Plaza, where she and others share experiences and learn to face up to and move beyond the limitations of chronic pain.\n\n\u201cI can do things now \u2014 approaching my 70th birthday \u2014 that I couldn\u2019t do in my 40s,\u201d says Wight.\n\nBEYOND THE MEDS\n\nMiguel and Diaz-Ramirez say many patients, including Wight, are managing chronic pain with less or no opioid medication \u2014 by using analgesic injections, neurostimulation implants, antidepressants, acupuncture, cognitive and behavioral therapy, biofeedback, meditation, hypnosis, exercise, physical therapy, massage, herbs, patches, analgesic creams, supplements and better nutrition.\n\n\u201cWe need to take the whole gamut of what\u2019s available for treating pain,\u201d Miguel says. \u201cThere\u2019s a wide variety of things that can be done.\u201d\n\nFor example, to address arthritic back pain \u2014 a condition Diaz-Ramirez sees all the time \u2014 analgesic injections are providing significant relief for up to 24 months in many of her patients.\n\n\u201cWe can work from the neck all the way down,\u201d Diaz-Rimirez says. \u201cPatients are so happy. Many don\u2019t take any medication with this.\u201d\n\nDiaz-Ramirez also favors spinal cord stimulation, a device that\u2019s surgically placed under the skin (after a trial period to test its efficacy) that sends electrical currents to the spine to mask the sensation of pain.\n\n\u201cThis is very good for nerve pain,\u201d Diaz-Ramirez says. \u201cIt is a fun, fun therapy \u2014 and if it works, many patients don\u2019t have to take medication.\u201d\n\nWight uses a less invasive but similar treatment to ease her own back pain. It\u2019s called a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator \u2014 TENS \u2014 and it enables her to function with less medication. A TENS is a portable device that sends therapeutic, low-voltage electrical currents to the affected area via electrodes placed on the skin.\n\n\u201cTENS works very well. It\u2019s a very useful adjunctive,\u201d Miguel says. \u201cIt\u2019s drug-free; you can use it all day.\u201d\n\nINTERESTED?\n\nThe Chronic Pain Support Group meets the second Wednesday of every month \u2014 including tomorrow \u2014 at 5:30 p.m. in the Cypress Room at Waldemere Medical Plaza, 1921 Waldemere St.\n\nFor more information, call group facilitator Diane Wight at (941) 383-1811 or email cpsg@yahoo.com.\n\nAlso critical, pain specialists say, is achieving a healthful balance in life through stress management and a nutritious, anti-inflammatory diet. Dr. Ernesto Fernandez, a Sarasota doctor of oriental medicine, acupuncture physician and mental health counselor, emphasizes this body-mind connection \u2014 the idea that old traumas, painful thoughts and emotions are stored in the body and manifest as physical illness.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of stuff to treat the symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you only focus on the symptoms, then you are perpetually chasing something \u2014 they never really go away.\u201d\n\nLakewood Ranch resident Joan Mahon, 70, says changing her diet and taking supplements have enabled her to reduce the amount of hydrocodone she normally takes for a painful spinal cord injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in intractable pain for years,\u201d says Mahon, who experienced serious memory lapses from her pain medication.\n\nOn the advice of her doctor, switching to an anti-inflammatory diet \u2014 cutting out sugar, gluten, dairy and other foods \u2014 and adding supplements, including alpha lipoic acid and B-12 shots every other day, improved her situation measurably.\n\n\u201cJust doing that, I was able to cut my dose in half at night and sleep all the way through,\u201d Mahon says. \u201cAnd now when I get up, I don\u2019t feel pain anymore.\u201d\n\nMiguel says taking tricyclic antidepressants can also help to improve nighttime sleep and lessen the burning sensation caused by nerve damage. Over-the-counter and prescription-grade analgesic creams are also useful.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re incredibly well-tolerated \u2014 almost no toxicity or side effects,\u201d says Miguel. \u201cPeople might dismiss them, but there are some very good creams that can be compounded. Prescription creams are extremely effective.\u201d\n\nMoving the body is also essential, say Miguel and Diaz-Ramirez \u2014 even when you don\u2019t want to or think that you can.\n\n\u201cExercise \u2014 you have to do it \u2014 it\u2019s good for chronic pain,\u201d said Diaz-Ramirez. \u201cIf you can only do two repetitions, that\u2019s good. At some point you\u2019re going to do that third repetition.\u201d\n\nWight says physical therapy, yoga and other physical activity have been fundamental to her recovery. So were psychotherapy, acupuncture, biofeedback and joining support groups. Even listening to audio books distracts her from the pain.\n\nMiguel and Ramirez-Diaz say that\u2019s how it should be done, that a comprehensive, multi-treatment approach to managing chronic pain provides the best outcomes.\n\n\u201cI throw anything I\u2019ve got at it,\u201d says Wight. \u201cIt\u2019s either gonna manage you, or you\u2019re gonna manage it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/11/hfpain12.4-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "People in constant pain are finding relief from a new array of therapies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd55d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve been in intractable pain for years,\u201d says Mahon, who experienced serious memory lapses from her pain medication.\nA doctor that has a good referral system is extremely important.\u201dChronic pain \u2014 pain that lingers six or more months beyond the time it typically takes for an injury or illness to heal \u2014 affects an estimated 100 million Americans, according to the Institute of Medicine.\nTHE PILL PROBLEMOpioid medication \u2014 oxycodone, hydrocodone, and others \u2014 is the most common and frequently-prescribed treatment for moderate to severe chronic pain, according to a 2013 report by the American Chronic Pain Association.\nShe also facilitates a monthly chronic pain support group at the Waldemere Medical Plaza, where she and others share experiences and learn to face up to and move beyond the limitations of chronic pain.\nShe had joined the ranks of people who suffer from chronic pain."}
