Tom Cotton, R-Dardanelle, in downtown Fort Smith on Thursday.\n\nCotton, who is challenging incumbent U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., in the Nov. 4 general election, criticized his opponent largely for his support of President Barack Obama\u2019s policies, noting Pryor sides with the president \u201c93 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nCotton criticized the Obama administration for too much government regulation, higher taxes and wasteful spending, and noted that the country needs to get off of that path to restore America.\n\n\u201cAre you better off than you were six years ago?\u201d he asked the crowd of more than 350 people who had gathered at Thursday\u2019s \u201cRiver Valley Political Rally\u201d at the Fort Smith Museum of History. \u201cAre you happy with our current policies? It\u2019s time to retire Pryor.\u201d\n\nErik Dorey, spokesman for the Pryor campaign, described Cotton\u2019s \u201c93 percent\u201d claim as a \u201cfalse statistic.\u201d Cotton\u2019s claim is based on statistics that do not weigh the significance of specific votes, but rather take into account mostly noncontroversial issues, such as nominations, he said.\n\nPryor has strayed from the president on gun control, the Keystone pipeline and burdensome EPA regulations, among other issues, Dorey said.\n\n\u201cIt is false by any measure to say that Mark Pryor is anything but a fiercely independent and bipartisan voice for Arkansans who is never shy about standing up to any president or leaders of either party when their policies are wrong for Arkansas,\u201d Dorey said.\n\nCotton and his wife, Anna, announced Thursday on social media that they were expecting their first child, a boy. Cotton used the opportunity to speak about the moment he learned he was to be a father and how it affected his perspective of the state of future political affairs within the state and the country.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re going to be a dad \u2026 it actually makes things a little bit more concrete about the future of our county and the future of our state,\u201d he said, noting he has stood up for families during his tenure as a congressman and that he wanted to pass on to his son an America that is \u201cjust as strong and prosperous as it has been for the past 230 years.\u201d In order to do that, Cotton said, the country must change its current political path.\n\nCotton also chastised Pryor\u2019s support of the Affordable Care Act and his votes that support \u201creckless spending and foreign policy,\u201d tasking those in attendance to send a message to Washington by encouraging their friends and family to show their support for his campaign.\n\nDorey countered by saying that Cotton has repeatedly voted to give power back to insurance-industry bureaucrats.\n\n\u201cMark has said from the very beginning that this law is far from perfect, but he refused to return to the days where insurance companies regularly denied coverage to Arkansans with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Dorey said.\n\nThose in attendance felt Cotton\u2019s platform made him right for the job.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll do what he says he\u2019s going to do and I think he\u2019s going to help Arkansas,\u201d said Dyer resident Carole Lemieux, adding she hoped Cotton would relieve some of the burdens of being overtaxed. \u201c(Sen. Pryor) has been in office too long and is out of touch with what we need.\u201d\n\nFort Smith resident John Neubauer lauded Cotton\u2019s military experience and \u201cno nonsense\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cHe served in the military and I think he\u2019s learned to be firm and I don\u2019t think the other guy can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a no nonsense guy and I\u2019d like to see a politician get in and do what\u2019s right and I feel like he can do that.\u201d\n\nCotton\u2019s parents, Len and Avis, were pleased with the warm reception and the support shown to their son.\n\nU.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., was on hand to show his support for the Cotton campaign, noting Cotton possesses Arkansas values and a \u201clove of country and honor of the Lord,\u201d tenants he said were needed in Washington.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee also endorsed Cotton\u2019s campaign, telling the audience that electing Cotton was necessary not only to \u201cturn the economy around,\u201d but was to help Republicans gain the majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a candidate Arkansas will be proud of, who will vote for values you send him there to do,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nTimes Record reporter Stacy Ryburn contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A large crowd, including members of the general public as well as local, state and national officials, gathered for a Senate campaign rally in support of U.S. Rep.
