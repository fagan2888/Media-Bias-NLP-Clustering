A Mesa man who found himself in the middle of a violent struggle Thursday afternoon with a wanted man is getting a new, donated motorcycle.

A Kawasaki dealer stepped forward after hearing about the plight of Brandon Jenkins.

Jenkins was on his way home from work when out of nowhere a man later identified as Joshua Marigold, who had been leading police on a chase, tried to rip him off his motorcycle.

The two tangled for a short time before a police officer pulled up alongside and opened fire.

Monigold got in his truck and sped off, running over Jenkins' bike in the process.

His beloved motorcycle was badly damaged.

Jenkins had bought the bike with money earned while deployed with the military for a tour of duty in Afghanistan.

“There was an extremely generous person, organization who has donated a new motorcycle to me,” Jenkins wrote in an update Saturday on his gofundme page.

“I don't make a lot of money, anything can help. I just need to pay the taxes on the new bike,” he wrote.

Jenkins also said he is “way too attached” to his GSXR and he wants it back so he can rebuild it “slowly in the next couple of years.”

He said he plans to eventually give his son his GSXR “once it is safe to ride.”

“Thank you all for your support and please do not forget about the poor gentleman who had his truck stolen as well he needs support, too,” Jenkins added.
