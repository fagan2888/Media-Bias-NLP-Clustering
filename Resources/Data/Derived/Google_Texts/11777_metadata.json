SPLC still thinks Carson has plenty of extreme views. But Bill O\u2019Reilly dismissed SPLC\u2019s remaining concerns and took full credit for what he seemed to think was a complete acquittal of Carson. Oh, and while he was at it, O\u2019Reilly accused SPLC of supporting polygamy.\n\nCarson was named an extremist by the SPLC back in October. But conservatives didn\u2019t notice until last weekend. They threw a hissy fit and now SPLC has walked back its findings. In a statement yesterday:\n\nThis week, as we\u2019ve come under intense criticism for doing so, we\u2019ve reviewed our profile and have concluded that it did not meet our standards, so we have taken it down and apologize to Dr. Carson for having posted it. We\u2019ve also come to the conclusion that the question of whether a better-researched profile of Dr. Carson should or should not be included in our \u201cExtremist Files\u201d is taking attention from the fact that Dr. Carson has, in fact, made a number of statements that express views that we believe most people would conclude are extreme. They are described below. We laud Dr. Carson for his many contributions to medicine and his philanthropic work, and we, like so many others, are inspired by his personal story. Nevertheless, particularly because Dr. Carson is such a prominent person, we believe that his views should be closely examined.\n\nThe statement was followed by more than a dozen comments by Carson that would be considered extreme \u2013 including praise for the armed militia supporting the law-breaking rancher Cliven Bundy, accusations that ObamaCare is worse than 9/11 and suggestions that the Obama administration is \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany.\u201d\n\nOn The O\u2019Reilly Factor last night, Bill O\u2019Reilly implied that Carson was labeled \u201cextremist\u201d only for saying, \u201cMarriage is between a man and a woman. It\u2019s a well-established pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Association, a group advocating pedophilia], be they people who believe in bestiality\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter what they are, they don\u2019t get to change the definition.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly left out the quote in which Carson called same-sex marriage a slippery slope that could destroy the country:\n\n[I]f we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman, we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish, which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending, as witnessed in the dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\n\n\u201cAfter we did the story last night, they got heavy heat,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said about SPLC \u2013 without mentioning that the \u201cheavy heat\u201d arrived well before the O\u2019Reilly Factor aired its attack on the SPLC the previous night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a freedom of speech deal and they can\u2019t be doing that,\u201d O\u2019Reilly announced. Not unless they were to pick on Beyonc\u00e9 or an American Sniper critic, that is.\n\nOf course, O'Reilly insinuated that the SPLC is the immoral extremist:\n\nO\u2019REILLY: They don\u2019t believe in traditional marriage. They believe in inclusion: everybody should have the same access to marriage. If you were to say, \u201cWell, we want to marry three or four people, pluralism, they would say, \u201cfine.\u201d I mean, they don\u2019t care.\n\nAnd Carson widened that to make the left is the root of all evil in this country:\n\nCARSON: We need to get back to a place where people feel free to express themselves and not to be intimidated by political correctness. It\u2019s destroying our nation.\n\nWatch it below, from last night\u2019s The O\u2019Reilly Factor.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "oSZrrJXiiI4vBdNB3PFv0ux7EyV5zQwJhKlypX/R9us=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/dr_ben_carson_removed_from_splc_s_extremist_list_bill_o_reilly_takes_credit_021115", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson Removed From SPLC\u2019s Extremist List \u2013 Bill O\u2019Reilly Takes Credit"}, "Title": "Dr. Ben Carson Removed From SPLC\u2019s Extremist List \u2013 Bill O\u2019Reilly Takes Credit"}, "article_summary": "We laud Dr. Carson for his many contributions to medicine and his philanthropic work, and we, like so many others, are inspired by his personal story.\nNevertheless, particularly because Dr. Carson is such a prominent person, we believe that his views should be closely examined.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center no longer has an \u201cExtremist File\u201d on Dr. Ben Carson.\nBut Bill O\u2019Reilly dismissed SPLC\u2019s remaining concerns and took full credit for what he seemed to think was a complete acquittal of Carson.\nWatch it below, from last night\u2019s The O\u2019Reilly Factor."}
