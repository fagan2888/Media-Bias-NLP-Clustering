In the world of fashion and entertainment, there needs to be something about you that helps you stick out from the rest. Take, for example, airline-hostess-turned-model Martina Big. Back in 2012, Big decided to make some drastic changes to her physical appearance. After around $50,000 in plastic surgery expenses, Big was left with a new nose, bigger lips, whiter teeth, and a pair of refillable breast implants that she claims are not dangerous (for the most part).

"The doctor is controlling this very well, and it's obviously an interesting and unusual project, but it's nothing dangerous," Big told Cosmopolitan. "When I am walking around in a skin-tight T-shirt, I have seen people on a bike riding past and then driving into a lamp post."

Big’s doctor fitted her with a special kind of breast implant that she can refill with saline and does not require additional surgery to maintain. Since the initial operation she has had six procedures to add volume to her refillable breast implants. Her breast size has ballooned from a 70D to a 32K. She was even forced to convert to British bra sizes because German sizes only run up to G. Big and her boyfriend/manager Michael definitely aren’t complaining about her new “enhancements.”

"Well, she was always a very beautiful woman, but her nose was bigger, her hips were wider, her breasts were significantly smaller, and the actual incentive for what we have done came from Martina," Michael told Cosmopolitan. "But when she explained her ideas to me, I was excited straight away."
