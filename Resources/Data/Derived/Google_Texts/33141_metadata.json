Comedians often times do well on the sketch comedy show, but Schumer has a history with many current and former SNL cast members who were likely helpful in tips and tricks. One such message of support came from Kevin Heart who sent Schumer a joke text before she started the show:\n\nShe later tweeted his reply to the tweet saying he actually thought he was tweeting Miley Cyrus who appeared on the show last week.\n\nSchumer began her opening monologue talking about the young actress, Devin Fabry, who played Schumer as a child in her latest film Trainwreck. Fabry said that she over heard her agent talking to her mother about how her cheeks are too big to get roles, but that she wouldn\u2019t have gotten the role as a younger Schumer if her cheeks were smaller. Schumer pretended to be defensive, but the comedian isn\u2019t quiet about the ways in which Hollywood treats women. She encouraged Fabry and said she\u2019d work forever.\n\n\u201cWe have to be a role model for these little girls, because who do they have?\u201d Schumer asked. \u201cAll they have, literally, is the Kardashians. She doesn\u2019t have a Malala poster hanging in her room. Is that a great message for little girls? A whole family who take the faces they were born with as a light suggestion?\u201d\n\nShe went on to talk about the women in her life from her 18-month-old niece to meeting Hillary Clinton for the first time and finding out she didn\u2019t like tequila. She made signature self deprecating jokes about her shape and size saying she doesn\u2019t take nude selfies because everything under he dress looks like a lava lamp. But the message of the monologue was clear: from childhood to stardom to middle age and beyond, women are all getting hosed by Hollywood.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amy Schumer just absolutely crushes it VIDEO", "title": "Amy Schumer\u2019s brilliant \u201cSNL\u201d: Devastating gun ad, Kevin McCarthy parody highlights near-perfect show", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Amy Schumer just absolutely crushes it VIDEO", "title": "Amy Schumer\u2019s brilliant \u201cSNL\u201d: Devastating gun ad, Kevin McCarthy parody highlights near-perfect show", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/11/amy_schumers_brilliant_snl_devastating_gun_ad_kevin_mccarthy_parody_highlights_near_perfect_show/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/schumer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amy Schumer just absolutely crushes it VIDEO", "title": "Amy Schumer\u2019s brilliant \u201cSNL\u201d: Devastating gun ad, Kevin McCarthy parody highlights near-perfect show", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/schumer.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Burris", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Schumer, aol_on, Feminism, Hollywood, Kardashians, Sexism, women in hollywood, Women's Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc90\"", "article_summary": "Schumer began her opening monologue talking about the young actress, Devin Fabry, who played Schumer as a child in her latest film Trainwreck.\nTopics: Amy Schumer, aol_on, Feminism, Hollywood, Kardashians, Sexism, women in hollywood, Women's Rights, Social News, Entertainment News, News, Politics NewsAmy Schumer crushed it on Saturday Night Live last night.\nSchumer pretended to be defensive, but the comedian isn\u2019t quiet about the ways in which Hollywood treats women.\nBut the message of the monologue was clear: from childhood to stardom to middle age and beyond, women are all getting hosed by Hollywood.\n\u201cWe have to be a role model for these little girls, because who do they have?\u201d Schumer asked."}
