The exact status of that effort was unclear, however: The Associated Press reported there were no signs of immediate troop movement.\n\nCarter\u2019s contention that America can do little beyond offer training and equipment if the Iraqis won\u2019t defend themselves came as the administration faces renewed pressure at home to put more U.S. troops on the ground.\n\n\u201cGeorge W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and respond with the surge,\u201d said Sen. John McCain on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, referring to the infusion of 30,000 new troops into Iraq in 2007. \u201cI wish, I pray, Barack Obama would do the same thing.\u201d\n\nObama stayed above the fray on Memorial Day, but his remarks at Arlington National Cemetery offered a reminder that he is deeply averse to intensifying U.S. military involvement overseas.\n\n\u201cFor many of us, this Memorial Day is especially meaningful; it is the first since our war in Afghanistan came to an end,\u201d Obama said. \u201cToday is the first Memorial Day in 14 years that the United States is not engaged in a major ground war.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter's comments came days after Iraqi troops lost the city of Ramadi to ISIL.", "title": "White House stands by Carter, but also offers praise for Iraqis", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/ash-carter-iraqi-comment-white-house-reaction-118286.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/26/150526_carter_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,George W.
