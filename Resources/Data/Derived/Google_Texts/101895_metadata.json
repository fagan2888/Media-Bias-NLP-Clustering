The ad ends up being an advertisement for young people GETTING insurance, which is exactly what Obamacare is all about.\n\nFirst, some background. You might recall the previous ad from these folks \u2013 the one where a very scary Uncle Sam figure pops up in some young college student\u2019s gynecological exam. The idea is that somehow, if you sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges, you\u2019ll have \u201cthe government\u201d involved in your health care, or something.\n\nAt the time that ad came out, I did a post noting that I\u2019d rather have Uncle Sam between my legs than John Boehner with a trans-vaginal probe. Of course, I\u2019m still waiting for someone to do an ad about the GOP health care plan, with Lindsey Graham checking your prostate (\u201cturn your head and couch, y\u2019all\u201d).\n\nSo fast forward to their new ad. Another vewy vewy scawy, this time Halloween-themed, ad to convince young people not to sign up for Obamacare. This time, some guy who looks like Freddie \u2013 no, not that Freddie, rather Freddie Mercury from Queen \u2013 keeps appearing on your TV even though the TV is unplugged.\n\nAt one point, Freddie tries to really scare the young college guy by telling him \u201cwe\u2019ve got your cell phone and your email.\u201d Well, duh. Facebook\u2019s got their cell phone and their email too. As do a gazillion other Web sites, and every doctor they\u2019ve ever visited. What kid today doesn\u2019t assume that everyone, including the government, has his cell phone and his email?\n\nBut the best part of the video is towards the end, after Uncle Sam comes and \u201cscares\u201d you. The video puts up two screens as the big finale. Now, keep in mind that the entire point of these videos is to scare kids away from getting health insurance since having young people insured is a key component of health care reform, in part because the system needs healthy people in addition to sick people in order to be more affordable for everyone. So the intent here is to scare away young people, and thus hopefully make health care more expensive for everyone (and thus hurt the Affordable Care Act\u2019s image, oh yeah and hurt everyone else too by making everyone pay more for their insurance).\n\nHere\u2019s the first screen:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the second:\n\n\u201cGet the insurance\u2026\u201d Huh?\n\nLet\u2019s put aside for a moment the fact that college kids are already going to end up having insurance anyway, until the age of 26, because under Obamacare they can remain on their parents\u2019 plans. They couldn\u2019t before.\n\nBut far more importantly, what really caught my eye was the fact that the entire ad culminates in a message that reinforces the point that young people should get insurance, which is one of the main points behind the President\u2019s health care reform package.\n\nYoung people often don\u2019t get insurance, because they think they\u2019re invincible. So we\u2019d welcome a message that tells kids that they really ought to get insurance.\n\nAs for young people making sure that they get the \u201cright\u201d insurance, well duh. I\u2019m all for people checking the exchanges AND talking to their insurance company, and picking what\u2019s \u201cright for you.\u201d Of course, once they go to the exchanges they may very well find out that they\u2019ll get better insurance than they would elsewhere, but there\u2019s another thing young people are going to like about Obamacare. A lot of them might be eligible for subsidies that pay for part, or all, of their insurance. That won\u2019t happen if they go to an insurance company directly. And what kid doesn\u2019t like a free lunch?\n\nSo thanks, Uncle Sam! And Freddie.\n\nFollow @aravosis", "article_metadata": {"description": "So there's a new \"Uncle Sam\" Web ad where Freddie Mercury tries to scare young people away from signing up for Obamacare.
