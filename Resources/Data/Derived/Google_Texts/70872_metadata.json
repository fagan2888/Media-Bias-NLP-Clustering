To TELL Washington what i\u2019s actually going to do. Think that\u2019s an impossible dream? Just check out Article 5.\n\nOfficials with Convention of States, a project of the Citizens for Self-Government, say the U.S. Constitution already provides a solution that gives citizens of the U.S. a way to bypass Congress, decide what direction the nation to go and then announce marching orders.\n\nFix Washington so that those deficit budgets are a thing of the past. So that Washington\u2019s interference in local school-board curriculum decisions is gone. So that those orders for you to buy the health insurance Washington bureaucrats think you need no longer exist. So that a \u201cfederal government \u2026 drunk with the abuses of power\u201d is reined in.\n\nArticle 5 of the U.S. Constitution provides for a Convention of States which can amend the U.S. Constitution \u2013 for example, by demanding a balanced budget. Or simply removing the issue of marriage from the jurisdiction of the courts. Or how about eliminating the federal Department of Education entirely? Simply having it no longer there.\n\nThe article is an alternative to having Congress proposed amendments.\n\nIt allows that those changes also can be proposed \u2013 they\u2019d have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states ultimately \u2013 \u201con the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states.\u201d\n\nThe Convention of States website explains that the Founders provided the alternative, through which the states \u201ccan stop the federal spending and debt spree, the power grabs of the federal courts, and other misuses of federal power.\u201d\n\nGet \u201cConstitutional Literacy,\u201d a DVD set that explains how citizens of the U.S. are called on to enforce the sworn duty of every leader to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is what precisely what the Founders feared, and they gave us a solution we have a duty to use,\u201d organizers explain.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn, who represented Oklahoma in the U.S. Senate before leaving just recently, said the convention has become a necessity, because of Washington\u2019s perpetual overreach.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t fix it any other way,\u201d he told WND. \u201cWashington will never give up its power. It takes more every year, either through the bureaucratic branch, or through the courts.\u201d\n\nWhile he was in Washington, he said, he identified $400 billion in unnecessary spending every year, but could not eliminate it because of those in Congress who were not about to deprive their own constituencies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe,\u201d he told WND. \u201cThe only way to do it is a Convention of States.\u201d\n\nMark Meckler, president of the Citizens for Self-Governance, told WND, \u201cWe clearly have a runaway presidency, and a Supreme Court that enables that. \u2026 Congress has no spine.\u201d\n\nThe convention, he said, is the only mechanism for Americans to regain religious freedom, empower states with the rights given to them in the Constitution and more.\n\nHe said the current plan is to bring together representatives of the states to consider three issues: Fiscal restraints on the federal government, the imposition of limits on the scope and jurisdiction of the federal government, and term limits for federal officials, including members of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe actual practical portions of the plan could be the elimination of the Department of Education or the Department of Energy.\n\nStates could define that \u201cThe federal government has no role in education,\u201d he said.\n\nThey also could simply terminate the massive promulgation of millions of pages of federal rules by imposing a requirement that Congress authorize each and every rule.\n\nCoburn said the requirements are straightforward \u2013 at least two-thirds of the states (34) must approve identical resolutions calling for a convention. After that, Congress, which cannot stop the plan, must arrange for the particulars.\n\nFour states already have passed the resolution, and it\u2019s been introduced in dozens more already this year.\n\nThe goal, he said, is to return the federal government to the few dozen powers specifically given to the government in the Constitution. The rest of the responsibilities are supposed to rest with the states and their populations.\n\n\u201cOur Founders intended for the laboratories of democracy [the states] to work these things out,\u201d he said.\n\nMeckler said some big names have endorsed the idea \u2013 from Mark Levin and Sean Hannity to Allen West and presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Bobby Jindal.\n\nHe warned that there literally is no other mechanism to restrain Washington, but hope springs, since there already has developed support for the plan from 97 percent of the state legislative districts from coast to coast.\n\nThe organization announced that the draft rules for a Convention of States were revealed recently to several hundred state lawmakers meeting in San Diego.\n\n\u201cThe legislators, along with many more all across the nation, have been invited to participate in the Convention of the States Caucus,\u201d it said.\n\nWith that move, it has advanced beyond what any other group ever has done in support of such a convention.\n\n\u201cWhile other groups have talked about proposing rules, we are the only ones who actually took action and produced a working draft. And we already have 119 charter members signed on to help review and revise,\u201d it announced.\n\nThe project was launched by Meckler and Michael Farris, who also is chancellor of Patrick Henry College and chairman of the Home School Legal Defense Association.\n\nSarah Palin has endorsed the move, pointing out that it is \u201cthe tool that people have to rein in government.\u201d\n\nJindal said, \u201cOver-spending, excessive regulatory overreach and disdain for individual liberty all run rampant in Washington, D.C. Luckily, the Founders gave us a mechanism to reform a runaway federal government \u2026 We can \u2013 and we must \u2013 scale back the monstrosity that our federal government has become.\u201d\n\nHuckabee said the plan is both innovative and realistic.\n\nAccording to the Jefferson Statement, which was adopted just a year ago in Washington by former members of the Reagan administration, seasoned Supreme Court litigators, Ivy League professors and more, the national leaders believe the Article 5 procedure is the only constitutionally effective means of fixing the nation.\n\nTheir statement said, \u201cWe share the Founders\u2019 conviction that proper decision-making structures are essential to preserve liberty. We believe that the problems facing our nation require several structural limitations on the exercise of federal power. While fiscal restraints are essential, we believe the most effective course is to pursue reasonable limitations, fully in line with the vision of our Founders, on the federal government.\u201d\n\nIt explains some of the top legal minds in the nation also have promoted the plan.\n\nHere, advocates describe just exactly how to put Washington back under control:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The Washington elite in recent weeks have destroyed traditional marriage across America, have redefined English words to save Obamacare, have proposed regulations that could put your backyard under inspections by the EPA, have pulled off a deal critics say will grant the rogue Islamists in Iran nuclear weapons and more.
