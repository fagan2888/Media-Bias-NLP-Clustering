Small Business Owners Dropping Health Coverage That\u2019s Become Unaffordable\n\nRyan Cook wanted to help. The office manager at his small Raynham real estate office needed health insurance; her husband had lost his job and with it, the family\u2019s coverage.\n\nSo Cook looked into adding the woman and her family to his self-employed plan. \u201cAnd I was seeing prices at about $1,800 a month. That cost was ridiculous, quite frankly,\u201d said Cook, president of FCRG, Inc.\n\nRidiculous, but not a complete surprise, as Cook\u2019s own premiums have increased 50 percent in the last three years.\n\nHis office manager tried another option. She applied for subsidized coverage through the state Health Connector and was told she qualified. Her monthly contribution would be $250 a month.\n\n\u201cIt just made no sense at that point for me to provide that benefit to my employee,\u201d Cook said.\n\nCook says many small business owners he talks to at Chamber of Commerce luncheons and other meetings are struggling to stay competitive with larger firms when it comes to benefits.\n\n\u201cThe one that everyone is choking on is the cost of health care,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThey\u2019d love to be able to offer it but it just becomes so cost prohibitive to the business that you can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nJon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, says his members, which have an average of 10 employees, have seen premiums rise in the range of 12 percent every year for the last decade.\n\n\u201cA 12 percent increase in already-high health insurance premiums, coupled with rising rents, rising payrolls and, frankly, sales that are flat or down at the level of inflation, well, that doesn\u2019t work economically \u2014 something\u2019s going to give,\u201d Hurst said.\n\nSmall business rates approved for April 1 offer no relief. The base, or starting point for premiums, will rise anywhere from 0.4 percent at Tufts Health Public Plans to 32.3 percent at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The average base rate increase is 7 percent \u2014 many times the projected rate of inflation.\n\n\u201cPremiums reflect the cost of medical care,\u201d said Eric Linzer, senior vice president at the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a combination of rising prescription drug costs, care delivered in some of the highest-priced settings, and there are significant costs associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that have increased premiums.\u201d\n\nHurst says many small businesses have tried all the solutions brokers suggest, like offering coverage with high deductibles or increasing employee co-pays. Some of the larger small businesses are moving to self-insured coverage, where a company is responsible for the medical expenses incurred by its employees.\n\n\u201cOr maybe try to get their employees to be insured elsewhere if they are very small,\u201d Hurst said.\n\nThere are several changes that may have made it easier for workers to move from a company plan to MassHealth (Medicaid) or subsidized coverage through the Health Connector.\n\nFor one thing, making that transition is now allowed. Before passage of the ACA, Massachusetts residents who had access to insurance through work could not enroll in subsidized plans. But the ACA lifted that restriction and Massachusetts followed suit in 2014.\n\nSecond, many small businesses no longer face a penalty for failing to provide insurance. A state fee of $295 per worker for firms with 11 or more employees ended in 2013. The state employer penalty for small businesses is scheduled to be replaced this year by a federal fine that applies to some companies with more than 50 workers. Cook, the real estate president, says some companies are splitting in two so that they stay under the 50-worker threshold and avoid the fines.\n\nBill Vernon, Massachusetts director for the National Federation of Independent Business, says members who drop coverage do so because they can no longer afford it. Employees typically switch to a spouse\u2019s health plan, buy coverage on their own or, most commonly, enroll in MassHealth or a subsidized ConnectorCare plan.\n\n\u201cPeople are insured,\u201d Vernon said. \u201cWhat we see here, I think, is the shift as to who is paying and how it\u2019s being paid.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how big of a shift is underway. Raw numbers from the state Division of Insurance (DOI) show at least a 30 percent drop in small business coverage between 2007 and 2014.\n\nFewer Small Business Employers Offering Coverage:\n\nFewer Employees Covered By Small Business Plans:\n\nBob Carey, a health care consultant who was part of the team that launched the Connector, pulled the above DOI numbers after noticing a recent one-year drop in small business coverage rates.\n\nThe small business insurance filings for April 2016 show the number of workers covered by an employer plan has dropped another 5 percent.\n\nChanges in state and federal insurance law may explain some of the drop. People who are self-employed used to be counted as small businesses, but are now tallied in the individual market. More DOI data compiled by Carey shows 27,517 people who might be in this category. Then, some small businesses may have grown and moved into the larger employer category. And some firms, as Hurst said, have started self-insuring and would not be captured in the DOI figures.\n\nBut still, it looks like something is happening in the small business market.\n\n\u201cI think folks in this market assumed that the small group market, which is 50 or fewer employees, had remained relatively stable,\u201d Carey said. \u201cBut in fact we see that there\u2019s been an annual decline in both the number of people covered and the number of employers who offer coverage.\u201d\n\nDOI doesn\u2019t see the numbers that way.\n\n\u201cThe apparent decline over that timeframe cannot definitively be attributed to small employers not offering employees health insurance plans,\u201d said Chris Goetcheus, spokesman for the Office of Consumer Affairs. \u201cThese employers may have found alternative means to negotiate coverage in the large employer group, which DOI does not regulate.\u201d\n\nThe most recent survey of employer coverage might seem to support that idea. It shows that 76 percent of Massachusetts employers offered health insurance between 2011 and 2014, a rate that\u2019s significantly higher than the national average of 55 percent.\n\nBut Aron Boros \u2014 who directs the Center for Health Information and Analysis, the agency that produced that survey \u2014 says the overall steady rate masks some subtle changes.\n\n\u201cWe do see, over the last year, a trend where fewer members are receiving their coverage in that small group market,\u201d Boros said. \u201cWe see premiums increasing in that small group market at a more volatile and higher rate than in other sectors.\u201d\n\nBoros says he can\u2019t tell exactly where employees of small businesses go for insurance if the company ends coverage. Some of the numbers he\u2019s looking at don\u2019t add up. Private plans say they are covering about the same number of people, the state\u2019s uninsured rate was consistent last year at 3.6 percent, and yet enrollment in MassHealth and subsidized ConnectorCare is up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of an open mystery in these enrollment figures,\u201d Boros said.\n\nThere\u2019s no question this mystery is putting enormous pressure on the state budget. MassHealth grew to just over 2 million residents 15 months ago. That\u2019s one-third of the state\u2019s population. The Baker administration reviewed eligibility and the number dropped to about 1.8 million \u2014 still a quarter of all the men, women and children in Massachusetts. State Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders says she\u2019s not making a direct link between a decline in employer coverage and an increase in the state rolls yet, but is watching the insurance numbers closely.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts health reform law is based on all of us having shared responsibility,\u201d Sudders said. \u201cAs we go forward we need to be certain that our employers, our individuals and our insurers are all part of that conversation so that we can continue to have 97, almost 100 percent of folks in Massachusetts have health care coverage.\u201d\n\nMany small businesses say they hope to be part of that conversation, but they\u2019re struggling. The idea that employers would take their share of responsibility for expanding coverage was premised on the pledge that health insurance would be affordable. For many small businesses it is not.\n\n\u201cThe costs are getting crazy for us,\u201d said Tom Erb, president of Electric Time Co. in Medfield, where premiums rose 22 percent this year. \u201cFor a family plan, my cost per employee is $5 to $6 an hour.\u201d\n\nErb says he doesn\u2019t feel like he can drop health insurance and still attract good employees.\n\nBesides, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the options are, kick everyone out and throw them to the Connector?\u201d It\u2019s not something Erb wants to do.\n\n\u201cThis is a harbinger for the rest of the country,\u201d consultant Carey said. \u201cWe had, and we still have, more small employers offering coverage than almost any place in the country, but we\u2019ve seen a decline, and I think you\u2019ll see that play out in other states as health reform and people realize that there are other coverage options.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The one that everyone is choking on is the cost of health care,\" said Ryan Cook, a Raynham real estate president.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "\"The one that everyone is choking on is the cost of health care,\" said Ryan Cook, a Raynham real estate president.", "title": "Mass.
