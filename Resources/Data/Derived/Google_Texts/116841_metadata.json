Raise your hand if this hasn\u2019t happened to you:\n\nYou spot a raccoon on a lonely Nebraska back road, leap from your pickup truck and somehow manage to take a really crazy cellphone selfie of you and the raccoon, which you have wisely placed right next to your face.\n\nBy some sort of miracle, the raccoon has not bitten off your nose or scratched out one of your eyes, but as you lower your pal back to the ground he bites your leg. You react by sending the furry guy to heaven \u2014 with a gate pass from Pope Francis \u2014 by whomping the raccoon on the head with a wrench.\n\n(I am not raising my own personal hand, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m currently holding a wolverine near my face and taking a selfie and, well, judging by all the growling, I think I\u2019m going to need a really big wrench. Yeeoowww. And a nose.)\n\nThe heart-wrenching (or, in this case, head-wrenching) tale of the raccoon and the mean football player became such big news recently that even the Los Angeles Times published its own story, saying Gangwish was \u201ctrying to take a selfie with the mammal.\u201d\n\nWhich shoots down a commonly held belief that raccoons are members of the salmon family.\n\n\u201cThe 6-foot-2, 260-pound junior then took a wrench from his truck and killed the animal,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cNow, PETA wants him punished.\u201d\n\nI strongly believe all stories get better when you get PETA into them. And so, from PETA president Ingrid Newkirk, in a letter to University of Nebraska athletic director Shawn Eichort: \u201cIt\u2019s time for acts of cruelty to animals committed by players to be taken extremely seriously, and with violence in football culture now under the microscope, this is the time to address the issue.\u201d\n\nIngrid was, of course, referring to that infamous moment a few months ago, caught on surveillance tape, in which, according to the National Football League, Baltimore running back Ray Rice got into an argument in a hotel elevator, threw a left hook and knocked out a North American river otter.\n\nThe story got even better when Gangwish explained to the local paper, the Lincoln Journal Star, that after the raccoon bit him he knew it would have to be tested for rabies, \u201cso he attempted to subdue it with a wrench from his truck. The animal died, however.\u201d\n\nI know the feeling. Last summer a bat flew into our house and I, like Gangwish, attempted to \u201csubdue\u201d it. Lacking a wrench, I used a tennis racket, 15 thrown shoes, two shotguns and a metal trash can lid \u2014 not to mention the two dozen calls to 911 in which the dispatcher kept asking me to stop screaming.\n\nAnd he kept calling me \u201cma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nContact Rich Tosches at richtosches@gmail.com.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tosches: A raccoon selfie?
