It’s Day 4 of Obamacare, and health stocks are basking in its glory, as House Speaker John Boehner reportedly has indicated he would not hold the nation’s debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to defund the Affordable Care Act.

The sector was far outpacing the rest of the market among S&P 500 companies in early trading Friday, up nearly 0.9%.

St. Jude Medical

At the top of the class was medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc. /quotes/zigman/242119 /quotes/nls/stj STJ , up nearly 4% to $56.80 in recent action. Privately held CardioMEMS, of which St. Jude has a 19% stake, has received positive indications from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of approval for a heart-failure detection device, according to a research report from Leerink Swann analyst Danielle Antalffy.

Antalffy said the FDA released documents ahead of meeting next Wednesday in which the FDA acknowledged its effectiveness, and she now puts the likelihood of approval of the device at 90%. She also points out that St. Jude has exclusive rights to buy CardioMEMS for $375 million.

Also near the top was Dentsply International Inc. /quotes/zigman/54261 /quotes/nls/xray XRAY , of all companies. Reports were being released outlining the global prospects for dental suppliers, like Dentsply, already a big worldwide player in its sector.

Dentsply shares were up more than 3% to $44.71 in recent action, and was nearing the 52-week high reached on Sept. 11.

In the pharmaceutical group, Pharmacyclics Inc. /quotes/zigman/53242 /quotes/nls/pcyc PCYC continued its meteoric rise, up nearly 5% to a new all-time high of $142.28 after Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Andrews initiated coverage of the maker of the blood-cancer treatment ibrutinib, and rated it “outperform.”

“While consensus expectations are high for ibrutinib’s launch and [Pharmacyclic's] shares have appreciated about 130% in 2013 versus the [NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index's] 40%, long term we see [Pharmacyclic] as undervalued, due to ibrutinib’s opportunities in multiple blood cancers,” Andrews said in a note to clients.
