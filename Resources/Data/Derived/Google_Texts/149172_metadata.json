Paul Wieland, R-Imperial, predicts that his suit against mandated contraceptive coverage will help launch an avalanche of court challenges to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provision requiring insurance companies to offer such benefits.\n\nBut first Wieland needs to persuade a federal appeals court to reinstate his case. A lower court had tossed it out.\n\nOn Monday, Wieland's lawyer Tim Belz \u2013 a special counsel with the Thomas More Society -- told a three-judge panel with the federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that the Wielands are unfairly being required to obtain insurance coverage that includes coverage for contraceptives.\n\nThe parents, devout Catholics, object to having such coverage for their three daughters, Belz said.\n\n\u201cThe problem here is that the government has dragooned the parents,\u2019\u2019 Belz said. If they take the insurance coverage, they are violating their conscience, he asserted.\n\nWieland argues that if businesses can drop contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision, then employees should be able to reject the coverage as well.\n\nThe insurance in question is Wieland\u2019s coverage through the state government because he is a member of the General Assembly. He could obtain coverage through his business that could exclude contraceptives, but it would be much more expensive, Belz said in an interview later.\n\nWieland wasn't present for the court arguments because he was campaigning for the state Senate, Belz said.\n\nOne appeals court judge, James Loken, warned Belz that he needed to focus his arguments on why Wieland has standing to bring the case, and not on the merits of the case, which would include Wieland\u2019s objections to the coverage. A lower court had dismissed the case over the issue of \"standing.\"\n\nThe judges also asked whether Wieland\u2019s case is one for the state courts because his beef is with his insurance coverage. Belz said that the state insurers were simply complying with the provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which Wieland opposes.\n\nThe lawyer for the federal government, Alisa Klein, argued that group insurance coverage \u2013 such as that covering employees for the state of Missouri \u2013 can\u2019t be individually tailored to reflect what each employee wants covered and what they don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDifferent people will have different beliefs,\u2019\u2019 she said, citing as examples some individuals\u2019 objections to certain childhood vaccinations. Klein agreed that Wieland has no alternative for insurance coverage within Missouri state government but alluded to the fact that he could obtain other private insurance.\n\nThe point of group coverage is to provide insurance for a variety of medical procedures, Klein said. The recipients can decide which coverage they want to use.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "The lawyer for state Rep.
