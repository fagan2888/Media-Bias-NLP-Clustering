Four Gulf County residents are behind bars and are all charged with possession of Methamphetamine and Marijuana. Friday night, Gulf County Sheriff's Officials secured a search warrant after deputies responded to a 911 call regarding a domestic dispute at a home in Wewahitchka.

When deputies arrived on scene, they smelled a strong odor of Marijuana and saw plastic baggies of Meth in plain sight.

That is when they arrested 30-year old Josie Miller, 36-year old Timothy Miller, 39-year old Joseph Sketoe, and 29-year old Jamie Bruner.

Not only did deputies find a number of drugs, but also some stolen property. This included a trailer, that was reported stolen by the Bay County Sheriff's Office. Also, a boat along with its motor and trailer that was reported stolen by the Panama City Police Department.

Additional charges are pending, and the investigation is ongoing.
