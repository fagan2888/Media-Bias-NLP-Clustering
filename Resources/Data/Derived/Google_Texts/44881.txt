(CNN) — The U.S. Secret Service apprehended a man Thursday after he jumped over a White House fence as the first family was inside celebrating Thanksgiving.

The man, who jumped over a fence on the North Lawn, was almost immediately detained by Secret Service officers.

Photos on social media appear to show the man, whose identity has not been released, cloaked in an American Flag and raising his hands victoriously in the air.

CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the photos.

The stunt is hardly original.

The man was at least the third person to scale a fence and make it on to White House property this year.

While most are quickly captured, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran in September 2014 ran through the main floor past a stairway that leads up to the first family’s residence before he was subdued by Secret Service in the East Room.
