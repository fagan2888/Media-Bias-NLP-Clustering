However, smaller systems may rely on a CFO rather than a traditional investment committee.\n\n\u201cGiven that a CFO\u2019s primary objective is to maintain the overall financial well-being of the organization, the investment portion can sometimes be secondary,\u201d the report said.\n\nHealth organizations surveyed said they intended to add in-house investment staff in the next one to two years. However, Cerulli noted that hiring additional staff is difficult for many hospitals because of shrinking operating margins brought on by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a result, these health organizations have turned to consultants and outsourced-CIOs (OCIOs), which can be seen as a cheaper alternative to building an internal team. According to Cerulli, 85% of health and hospital systems used consultants in some capacity.\n\nHalf of those surveyed said they used consultants because of limited in-house investment resources. Other reasons cited included a desire for a more efficient investment process\u2014for example, saving money by using an OCIO instead of managing in-house\u2014and better access to asset managers.\n\nThe majority (69%) of organizations said they utilized strictly traditional consulting services, while 16% employed at least some discretionary services. Just 8% relied entirely on an OCIO provider.\n\nThose who did choose to outsource all investment decisions said they believed it was a more effective way to manage assets.\n\nRelated: Liquidity Is Top Concern for Health Care Funds\n\nAmy Whyte | awhyte@assetinternational.com | 646-308-2775", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Tight budgets and small internal teams cause health and hospital systems to rely on outside consultants and OCIOs, according to Cerulli Associates.", "Keyword": "health care fund, Cerulli Associates, Cerulli Associates health care report, Affordable Care Act operating margins, OCIO, health care fund consultants", "og": {"site_name": "aiCIO", "description": "Tight budgets and small internal teams cause health and hospital systems to rely on outside consultants and OCIOs, according to Cerulli Associates.", "title": "In-House Expertise Lacking at Health Care Funds", "url": "http://www.ai-cio.com/channel/Manager-Selection/In-House-Expertise-Lacking-at-Health-Care-Funds/", "image": "http://www.ai-cio.com/uploadedImages/Non_Searchable_aiCIO/magazine/2016/April/CIO416-Cover-Lauren-Tamaki.jpg?n=8328", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 856989139}, "robots": "index, follow", "mobileoptimized": 0, "viewport": "width=1140, initial-scale=0.65, maximum-scale=2.0, minimum-scale=0.65"}, "article_summary": "On average, health systems have just three in-house investment professionals, as of the second quarter of 2015.\nHealth organizations surveyed said they intended to add in-house investment staff in the next one to two years.\nMany health and hospital organizations currently have \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d internal investment capabilities, Cerulli Associates has found.\nAccording to Cerulli, 85% of health and hospital systems used consultants in some capacity.\nHalf of those surveyed said they used consultants because of limited in-house investment resources."}
