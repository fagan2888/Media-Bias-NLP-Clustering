About 70 percent of beneficiaries will continue to pay the same amount that has been charged for the past three years: $104.90 a month. Others will pay $121.80 a month, or more for higher-income beneficiaries who already pay higher premiums.\n\nAs previously reported, the double standard arises from a quirk in the law that occurs only when there is no Social Security cost of living increase (COLA) in any given year, which is the case for 2016. The law \u201cholds harmless\u201d people whose Part B premiums are automatically deducted from their monthly Social Security checks, ensuring that their payments are not reduced by a premium increase.\n\nGet answers to your health coverage questions \u2014 Medicare Q&A tool \u00bb\n\nBut this means that the whole brunt of the Medicare program\u2019s increased expenses must be shared among those who are not protected. These include people who are new to Medicare in 2016; already enrolled in Medicare but do not draw Social Security payments; or pay higher income-related premiums.\n\nThe standard $121.80-a-month premium, though still a hefty increase, is much less than the $159.30 a month \u2014 an unprecedented 52 percent hike \u2014 that was projected in the Medicare Trustees\u2019 report to Congress in July. That amount represented actuarial estimates of how much the Part B program, which covers doctors\u2019 services and outpatient care, will cost next year. Part B premiums are required by law to cover 25 percent of those costs, with the federal government paying the rest out of general revenue.\n\nBut under recent budget legislation, signed into law Nov. 2, Congress and the White House intervened to soften the burden on beneficiaries not held harmless. This requires those people to pay a surcharge of $3 a month (included in the $121.80) to begin paying off the loan that funded the reduction.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries who pay higher income-related premiums will see their monthly payments rise to between $170.50 and $389.80, depending on income level and including surcharges of between $4.20 and $9.60 a month.\n\nThe loan is expected to be paid off, and the surcharge to end, within five years.\n\nOther Medicare costs in 2016:\n\nPart B annual deductible: $166 (up from $147 in 2015).\n\nPart A premium (for the relatively few people who must pay premiums because they haven\u2019t earned 40 work credits from payroll taxes): $411 a month for those with fewer than 30 credits; $226 a month for those with 30 to 39 credits (up from $407 and $224, respectively).\n\nPart A deductible for patients admitted to the hospital: $1,288 (up from $1,260).\n\nDaily copays for admitted patients after 60 days in the hospital: $322 a day (up from $315) for days 61 to 90. Lifetime reserve days: $644 a day (up from $630).\n\nDaily copays in a skilled nursing facility: $0 for days 1 through 20; $161 a day (up from $157.50) for days 21 through 100.\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "After months of speculation, Medicare\u2019s standard Part B premiums for 2016 have been officially announced.
