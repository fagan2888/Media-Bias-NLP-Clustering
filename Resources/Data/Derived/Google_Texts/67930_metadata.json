O\u2019Reilly has used similar words to disparage the new White House press security Josh Earnest, calling him \u201cbefuddled\u201d and stating that he \u201clooks uncertain\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like he has a lot of credibility.\u201d\n\nWe are left, then, with a baseless, whiney complaint against O\u2019Reilly, the real thrust of which is that it\u2019s \u201cnot ok\u201d to express the opinion that a woman is \u201cout of her depth,\u201d even if that\u2019s what one believes. Since when is policing speech part of the job of an administration flack?\n\nThe more interesting question is why Team Obama selects obvious lightweights to hold forth to the press on U.S. foreign policy. There are two answers, I believe.\n\nFirst, Obama is playing to a core component of his base \u2014 the young. Those of us of a certain age may be put off by seeing U.S. foreign policy explained by someone who looks like she just stepped out of a Student Congress session. But to Obama\u2019s youthful fans, it probably seems very cool. So, perhaps, does Psaki\u2019s widely ridiculed (by old people) hashtag diplomacy.\n\nTeam Obama was ridiculed for using \u201cPajama Boy\u201d to pitch Obamacare; yet it may have gotten the last laugh when enrollment by the \u201cinvincibles\u201d picked up. Think of Psaki and Harf as the flack equivalents of Pajama Boy.\n\nIt may also be that Psaki and Harf are popular with women, or at least the significant portion of them who apparently buy into \u201cthe life of Julia\u201d/war on women narrative.\n\nBut there\u2019s a second, and think more fundamental, explanation for the State Department\u2019s use of Psaki and Harf. I believe Team Obama is trying to \u201cdemystify\u201d foreign policy \u2014 to make it look unthreatening almost to the point of child\u2019s play. Psaki and Harf provide visual expression of this view just by standing at the podium and talking.\n\nIf one believes that the world is a dangerous place and that the U.S. must, accordingly, respond with constant vigilance and, at times, forceful engagement, then you want your spokespersons to look and talk maturely and somberly \u2014 to project, in a word, gravitas. For those of us who see the world that way, James Haggerty (Eisenhower\u2019s press secretary who once said \u201cif you lose your temper at a newspaper columnist, he\u2019ll get rich or famous or both\u201d) is a model.\n\nBut suppose you don\u2019t believe the world is all that inherently dangerous. Suppose you believe, as Obama does, that the U.S. is at the root of many of the world\u2019s problems and that a new dawn in international relations is possible if America will just lighten up.\n\nIn that case, you will be quite happy with light, breezy young foreign policy spokespersons. And if, like Harf, that spokesperson likes to get snarky with conservative journalist, all the better.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that politicians and public officials tend to get the staff they deserve. This pet theory seems particularly applicable when it comes to spokespersons, and applicable on stilts to Psaki and Harf.\n\nJOHN adds: Yes, and let\u2019s not forget Tommy Vietor, a van driver for the Obama campaign who became a foreign policy spokesman for the Obama administration and famously said, in answer to a question about Benghazi, \u201cDude, this was like two years ago.\u201d Barack Obama proceeds, always, on the assumption that voters are idiots. I think his choice of spokesmen is just one facet of that cynical perspective, which so far has proved sadly accurate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly came under criticism from the Obama administration this week for stating that Jen Psaki, spokesperson for the State Department, \u201clooks way out of her depth\u201d and that\u2026", "title": "About those lightweight Team Obama spokespersons", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2014/09/about-those-lightweight-team-obama-spokespersons.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2014/09/Psaki-hastag.jpg?resize=599%2C803&w=240", "site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-07T01:20:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-07T13:46:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The more interesting question is why Team Obama selects obvious lightweights to hold forth to the press on U.S. foreign policy.\nI believe Team Obama is trying to \u201cdemystify\u201d foreign policy \u2014 to make it look unthreatening almost to the point of child\u2019s play.\nIn that case, you will be quite happy with light, breezy young foreign policy spokespersons.\nThis pet theory seems particularly applicable when it comes to spokespersons, and applicable on stilts to Psaki and Harf.\nTeam Obama was ridiculed for using \u201cPajama Boy\u201d to pitch Obamacare; yet it may have gotten the last laugh when enrollment by the \u201cinvincibles\u201d picked up."}
