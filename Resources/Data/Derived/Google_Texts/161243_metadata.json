It also asks that states be refunded for what they've already paid.\n\nThe federal government has determined states must pay a portion of the fee to their Medicaid managed care organizations to then pay to the federal government. States get some reimbursement from the federal government for that money, but they end up losing 54 cents for every dollar of the insurance tax.\n\nThe suit says the fee is projected to allow the federal government to collect between $13 billion and $15 billion from states over the next decade.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel's office said in a statement that the state spent more than $23 million in such fees in 2014 and 2015.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-24 08:50:47 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Six states filed a new lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.", "twitter": {"description": "Six states filed a new lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1456365047368.jpg?ve=1", "title": "6 states sue Obama administration over Affordable Care Act", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"6 states sue Obama administration over Affordable Care Act\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1456365047368.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-25T01:46:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"6f238d6d-d1ed-4743-8449-0e7a17d24f16\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Six states filed a new lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.", "dc.identifier": "6f238d6d-d1ed-4743-8449-0e7a17d24f16", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthc,executive", "description": "Six states filed a new lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Associated Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "6 States Sue Obama Administration Over Affordable Care Act", "dcterms.created": "2016-02-24 08:50:47 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Six states filed a new lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "6 states sue Obama administration over Affordable Care Act | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1456365047368.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2016-02-24", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"6 states sue Obama administration over Affordable Care Act\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1456365047368.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-25T01:46:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/24/6-states-sue-obama-administration-over-affordable-care-act.html\",\"post_id\":\"6f238d6d-d1ed-4743-8449-0e7a17d24f16\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "article_summary": "Six states filed a new lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.\nThe lawsuit says nothing in the Affordable Care Act's language provided clear notice that states would also have to pay the fee.\nThe federal government has determined states must pay a portion of the fee to their Medicaid managed care organizations to then pay to the federal government.\nThe suit seeks an injunction against the federal rules that say states are responsible for the fee.\n\"This notice was not even provided by rule but was ultimately provided by a private entity wielding legislative authority,\" the suit says."}
