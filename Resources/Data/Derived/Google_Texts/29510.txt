Mobridge, SD

Mobridge Police are investigating a possible attempted child abduction from earlier this week and are asking the public to keep an eye out.

According to a report, two children were playing in Mobridge City Park Thursday, September 3 when they heard men singing near the bathrooms.

When the children went to investigate the singing, an older woman with long, greying hair took one of the children by the arm and led her to older, tan, rusted pickup. The woman attempted to drive away with the girl in the vehicle, but the 8-year-old was able to open the door of the pickup and run away.

The child told an older sibling about the incident later that night, who then told their mother. Authorities are urging parents to talk with their kids about using caution with strangers.

Anyone who has seen the pickup or men singing in the park, or has any other information, is urged to contact Mobridge Police.
