Carl Levin (D-Mich.) has roamed the halls of Congress\u2019 upper chamber since before Ronald Reagan became president, but declined last year to seek re-election. One imagines, therefore, that he has some notion of how the Senate operates \u2013 or at least should operate.\n\nBefore tearing into his own party during his farewell address, however, he urged the nation to stay hopeful and optimistic.\n\n\u201cMany foresee a continuation of polarization and partisanship in the Senate and say that it\u2019s na\u00efve to suggest that the next Congress might come together, break out of gridlock, and accomplish great things,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know the Senate can do better because I\u2019ve seen it happen with my own eyes. The Senate has indeed demonstrated, even in our own era, that bipartisanship is not extinct. The Senate Armed Services committee has upheld a more than 50-year tradition of bipartisan cooperation to produce an annual Defense Authorization Act that advances the security of our nation. I\u2019m grateful to the members of the US military and their families for their selfless sense of duty.\u201d\n\nStriking a somewhat different tone, however, he also took a swipe at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his supporters for agreeing to overturn \"decades of Senate precedent\" by nuking the filibuster \u2013 a contentious maneuver Sen. Reid himself once vigorously opposed.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is protection of the minority that is the singular hallmark of the United States Senate,\u201d Levin reminded his colleagues. \u201cThe majority cannot always have its way. \u201c\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cI believe the excessive use of the filibuster to obstruct confirmation of President Obama\u2019s nominees was damaging to the Senate and to the nation,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut the Senate majority eliminated obstructions to presidential nominations through the use of the nuclear option, effectively accomplishing a rules change outside the rules, a method I could not support. In doing so, a precedent was established that the majority could effectively change the rules as it wished, by overruling the chair and the parliamentarian. That precedent will not serve the country well in the future, because it leaves the minority with no protection, diminishing the unique role of the United States Senate. I hope the Senate next year considers reversing that precedent while simultaneously, and I emphasize simultaneously, amending the rules so as to assure a president\u2019s ability to fulfill his or her constitutional duties.\"\n\nSen. Levin was one of only a handful of Senate Democrats to oppose what members of both parties have called, at one time or another, a \"naked power grab.\"\n\nYou can watch his entire speech below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kudos to Sen.
