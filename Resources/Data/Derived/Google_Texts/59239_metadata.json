Lompico gets water from three wells, which are starting to run low. California got less than a third of its average annual rainfall last year, and Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a drought emergency.\n\nLompico is looking at a water-district merger, \u201cBut with upwards of 90% of the state suffering the drought, a huge increase in rainfall is the only long term solution.\u201d\n\nHenry says whatever happens, she\u2019s staying put. \u201cWhat am I going to do? I\u2019m retired, this is my home. My house is paid for free and clear. You just don\u2019t walk away from something like that.\u201d\n\n+++\n\nSpeaking of drought, new forms of energy production are putting the nation\u2019s water supplies under pressure, USA Today reports.\n\nFracking, or hydraulic fracturing, has used 100 billion gallons of water in the U.S. since 2011, according to a report by Ceres, a green investment group.\n\nMore than half of the oil and gas wells that use fracking were in drought-stricken areas, \u201cand nearly half were in regions under high or extremely high water stress, such as Texas, the report says.\u201d\n\nOther highlights from the report:\n\n\u201cNationwide, more than 36% of the 39,000 wells drilled since 2011 were in areas already experiencing groundwater depletion.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexas has the highest concentration of hydraulic fracturing activity in the U.S. More than half of its wells put in since 2011 were in high or extremely high water stress regions, Ceres says.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Colorado and California, 97% and 96% respectively of the wells were drilled in regions under high or extremely high water stress.\u201d\n\nThe oil and gas industry says that its overall use of water is small and that it\u2019s doing more to recycle and reuse water.\n\nAnother report says natural gas fracking \u201csaves water overall by making it easier for utilities to switch from coal to natural gas power.\u201d\n\n+++\n\n\u201cAll the dynamics that drive up health costs have coalesced here in southwestern Georgia,\u201d reports the Boston Globe in a story about parts of the U.S. that are paying above-average health-insurance premiums as the Affordable Care Act comes online.\n\nSome rural areas are seeing dramatically higher premiums, the Globe reports. It\u2019s a combination of the population\u2019s health and market dynamics, the story says:\n\nExpensive chronic conditions such as obesity and cancer are common among the quarter-million people in this region. One hospital system dominates the area, leaving little competition.\n\nOnly one insurer is offering policies in the online marketplace, and many physicians are not participating, limiting consumer choice.\n\nUntil these elements are brought under control, it will be challenging for the Affordable Care Act to fully live up to its name, not just here but in other parts of the country where premiums are high. Other expensive places include rural Nevada, parts of Wisconsin, most of Wyoming, southeastern Mississippi, southwestern Connecticut, and Alaska.\n\n+++\n\nThe farm bill authorizes the Ag Department to help create a \u201cRural Gigabit Network Pilot Program,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t provide funding for the program.\n\nThe legislation would help Internet providers create ultra-high-speed access in rural communities. USDA would be authorized to give grants, loans or loan guarantees to IPs that agree to build out their one-gigabit systems within three years.\n\nFunding for the program would have to come in a separate appropriation, though.\n\n+++\n\nThe Postal Service would be prohibited from closing small, rural post offices for a period of five years in a new postal reform bill being considered by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.\n\nBut the impact of the proposed moratorium is uncertain, reports Mark Jamison in Save the Post Office.\n\nThe moratorium on closing rural post offices may not mean much either. At this point, the Postal Service has backed off on closing small post offices because of all the pushback it got when it started on this initiative a couple of years ago. While post offices will continue to close, we\u2019re not likely to see the mass closures that were threatened a couple of years ago. POStPlan [a plan that reduces post office hours and replaces full-time postmasters with lower-paid workers] has accomplished much of what the mass closures would have achieved. With over 10,000 postmasters replaced by part-time workers, most of the costs of operating small post offices have already been eliminated. (That accomplishment was applauded during the markup by Senator [Tom] Carper [D-Deleware], who twice noted how well POStPlan had worked at exchanging good $50,000/year jobs for jobs that paid $12.00 an hour.)\n\nJamison also reports on the possibility of the end of Saturday delivery.\n\nThe bill allows the Postal Service to go to five-day delivery service if and when total mail volumes drop below 140 billion pieces in any four consecutive quarters. Six-day package delivery is required to be maintained. Based on current volume projections, it looks like the Postal Service might be able to switch to five-day as early as 2016.\n\nRead more at Save the Post Office.\n\n+++\n\nWith all the problems confronting U.S.-Russia relations, there\u2019s now a new clash of cultures. Yogurt cultures, that is.\n\nRussia has blocked the import of 5,000 containers of Greek-style yogurt headed to U.S. athletes at the Olympics. Russian officials say shippers haven\u2019t completed the right paperwork. The U.S. says \u201cthe certification required by the Russians would be impossible to attain.\u201d\n\nAs the 5,000 containers of Chobani yogurt chill, politicians and yogurt promoters are using the occasion to heat up attention for the yogurt industry in Upstate New York.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc52\"", "article_summary": "Roundup: Epic Drought in CaliforniaCalifornia drought \u2022 Above-average premiums in Georgia \u2022 Rural gigabit program created but not funded \u2022 A bill to save rural post offices?\nWith over 10,000 postmasters replaced by part-time workers, most of the costs of operating small post offices have already been eliminated.\nThe moratorium on closing rural post offices may not mean much either.\nNewsweek reports from Lompico, California, one of 17 rural water districts that state officials say are two to four months from depleting their water supply.\nWhile post offices will continue to close, we\u2019re not likely to see the mass closures that were threatened a couple of years ago."}
