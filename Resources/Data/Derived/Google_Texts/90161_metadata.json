We look forward to hearing from you.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION REJECTS KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE: The Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline Friday, capping a politically charged review of the oil project that lasted more than seven years and escalated into a broader debate on energy, climate change and the economy. \u201cThe State Department has decided that the Keystone XL Pipeline would not serve the national interest of the U.S.,\u201d President Barack Obama said in brief remarks from the White House. \u201cI agree with that decision.\u201d Mr. Obama cited the urgency of climate change, and the need for American leadership on that problem, as key reasons for his decision.\n\nAndrew Cullen/Reuters\n\nKeystone became a symbol as much as a project, proving an unexpected rallying point for environmental activists, who portrayed it as epitomizing the U.S.\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. That prompted a backlash from conservatives, who said critics were opposing a valuable, job-creating project. The president said the pipeline had occupied an overinflated role in political discourse, adding that it was neither a silver bullet for the economy nor an express lane to climate disaster. The project would not have lowered gas prices, improved energy security or made a long-term contribution to the economy, Mr. Obama said.

Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 271,000 in October, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate, which is obtained from a separate survey of U.S. households, fell slightly to 5.0% in October, the lowest reading since April 2008 and down from 5.1% the prior month.

As part of the Affordable Care Act, most employers are required to include birth-control coverage in their health insurance plans, with no out-of-pocket costs for employees. The law fully exempted institutions like churches, but not religiously affiliated nonprofit employers such as Catholic universities or hospitals.

Officials said more than 350 additional unneeded facilities controlled by other programs in the Energy Department are likely eligible for transfer to the cleanup operation. But that office said its funds are limited and it isn\u2019t accepting any more projects for now, no matter their significance. John R. Emshwiller and Gary Fields reported.\n\nHOUSE PASSES HIGHWAY BILL WITH EX-IM BANK RENEWAL: The House on Thursday approved a multiyear transportation funding bill that would also renew the Export-Import Bank, increasing the odds that the measure would be signed into law.

Under the ACA, insurers have seen an influx of new membership in individual plans and in Medicaid plans they administer for the government, expanding the industry\u2019s total U.S. revenue to $743 billion in 2014, the year the law\u2019s biggest changes took effect, from $641 billion the year before, according to McKinsey & Co.
