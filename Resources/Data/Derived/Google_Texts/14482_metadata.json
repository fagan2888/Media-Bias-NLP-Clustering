Consumer spending increased only modestly in most districts and while capital spending increased on balance, there was only scattered reports of spending for capacity expansion.\n\nManufacturing increased in most districts but expectations for future growth were mixed. One particular bright spot in the employment picture was the healthcare sector, which grew at a solid pace in a number of districts, the Fed said.\n\nBoston, Cleveland and St. Louis Fed districts cited \"sizeable\" wage increases for jobs in information technology services, skilled construction and manufacturing.\n\nIn Philadelphia, firms \"indicated they had raised their starting wages in order to attract higher-quality workers\" while in Chicago more contacts had increased wages for low-skilled, entry-level workers, the Fed said.\n\nSeveral districts also reported difficulties filling certain low- and high-skilled jobs, including retail positions in Boston and construction work in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and San Francisco.\n\nFed policymakers next meet on April 26-27. The Fed dialed back expectations on further hikes this year, after it raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point from near zero last December.\n\nPolicymakers on the whole now predict two hikes this year while investors currently see little prospect of a rate increase before December.\n\nThe Beige Book was compiled by the Chicago Fed with information collected on or before April 7, 2016.\n\n(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.", "title": "U.S. economic activity expanded, several regions see pickup in wage growth: Fed", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/13/US-economic-activity-expanded-several-regions-see-pickup-wage-growth-Fed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/markets-stocks_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/13/US-economic-activity-expanded-several-regions-see-pickup-wage-growth-Fed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/markets-stocks_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Consumer spending increased only modestly in most districts and while capital spending increased on balance, there was only scattered reports of spending for capacity expansion.\nBoston, Cleveland and St. Louis Fed districts cited \"sizeable\" wage increases for jobs in information technology services, skilled construction and manufacturing.\nThe Beige Book was compiled by the Chicago Fed with information collected on or before April 7, 2016.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy continued to expand from late February to early April and low unemployment appears to be spurring an uptick in wage growth, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.\nIn Philadelphia, firms \"indicated they had raised their starting wages in order to attract higher-quality workers\" while in Chicago more contacts had increased wages for low-skilled, entry-level workers, the Fed said."}
