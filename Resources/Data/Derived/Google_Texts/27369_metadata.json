The sale will provide Limoneira with equity income and allow it to make 50 cents per carton on the business's Asian lemon sales. The two elements should bring in an estimated $200,000 to $300,000 per year, according to Limoneira.\n\nThe agribusiness said it has had a long-standing relationship with Rosales and the deal allowed it to enter the Chilean agriculture market. It also aligns with Limoneira's goal to become a global, year-round lemon supplier.\n\n\"Along with expanding our participation in the growing global lemon business, this investment also enables Limoneira to better evaluate future potential investment opportunities in Chile's vast, productive agricultural properties,\" said Alex Teague, Limoneira senior vice president.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Santa Paula's Limoneira makes first international investment", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/business/companies/santa-paulas-limoneira-makes-first-international-investment-ep-564394281-351149491.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/limoneiraexpansionwebonly_7456013_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 396}, "type": "article", "description": "Continuing with its long-term strategy of supplying more lemons to a global market, Santa Paula's Limoneira Co. invests in Chilean lemon business.", "title": "Santa Paula's Limoneira makes first international investment"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/limoneiraexpansionwebonly_7456013_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Santa Paula's Limoneira makes first international investment", "description": "Continuing with its long-term strategy of supplying more lemons to a global market, Santa Paula's Limoneira Co. invests in Chilean lemon business.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe62cb\"", "article_summary": "\"Along with expanding our participation in the growing global lemon business, this investment also enables Limoneira to better evaluate future potential investment opportunities in Chile's vast, productive agricultural properties,\" said Alex Teague, Limoneira senior vice president.\n<p>STAR FILE PHOTO</p><p>The Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co.</p>Limoneira Co. has invested in a Chilean packinghouse as its first overseas venture.\nThe sale will provide Limoneira with equity income and allow it to make 50 cents per carton on the business's Asian lemon sales.\nThe Santa Paula agribusiness said it paid $1.75 million to own a 35 percent interest in Rosales S.A., a packing, marketing and sales business in La Serena, Chile, through its wholly owned Chilean subsidiary, Limoneira Chile SpA.\nThe two elements should bring in an estimated $200,000 to $300,000 per year, according to Limoneira."}
