Local nonprofit 75 North is spearheading an effort to develop the Highlander Neighborhood to the tune of $100 million dollars.\n\nMcDermott: 75 North is a local non-profit looking to create the next \u2018purpose built community\u2019 in the United States. The revamped Highlander Neighborhood marks the 15th purpose built community in the U.S. They are based on the Drew Charter School model in Atlanta, Georgia. It\u2019s a three tiered approach which includes mixed income housing, a cradle to college education pipeline and a community wellness element.\n\nRobertson: Most of the construction going on now is building new houses, apartments and retail space\u2026 that sort of thing. But 75 North\u2019s Executive Director Othello Meadows says that\u2019s just part of that they are trying to accomplish.\n\n\u201cIf we go and build nice apartments and houses in the Highlander neighborhood and don\u2019t do our job educationally, then quite frankly we\u2019ve failed in what we set out to do,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWhich is to really transform a neighborhood, we think that you do that through education.\u201d\n\nMcDermott: Howard Kennedy is the neighborhood elementary school, and will be part of the Highlander Neighborhood redevelopment project. Students at Howard Kennedy admittedly face a lot of problems. Ninety-eight percent of students are on free or reduced price lunch. The poverty rate in the area hovers around 30 percent, and when it comes to academic achievement, out of the 805 elementary schools in Nebraska, Howard Kennedy ranks in the bottom five.\n\nRobertson: It certainly sounds like a lot to overcome, but Howard Kennedy\u2019s new principal Tony Gunter told us he has big plans for his school.\n\nI see one of your goals is to be in the top five schools in 10 years? \u201cYou see the smile on my face,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cI have no doubts about that. The most important thing I can do is to make sure we have the right staff, and to make sure every day they give 110 percent.\u2019\n\nMcDermott: Gunter says having the right teachers in place is a good first step. But he says we also have to change the way kids in his school are being taught.\n\n\u201cWhen kids are inquisitive, let\u2019s encourage them to ask question, let\u2019s encourage them to talk, especially at a young age,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cThere is this thing that when you are in school you want kids to be quiet. No! Let\u2019s develop that language and get them talking.\u201d\n\nRobertson: Part of developing the language of learning is focusing on the right subjects. Nationally, many districts are focusing on STEM classes, Science, technology, engineering and mathematics. But at Howard Kennedy, the focus is on STEAM curriculum\u2013 which is like Stem, but includes Art education\u2014things like theater and music.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of brain research behind the whole musical piece. The crossing of the midsection (of the brain) to help develop the kids\u2019 brains and even have a vocabulary. So it\u2019s a big stretch with connecting synopses in their brains.\u201d\n\nMcDermott: Basically Gunter is saying things like music education can make kids smarter by helping to form links in the brain between what they learn and how they apply it. The President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities says kids from impoverished areas who have arts as part of their curriculum are four times more likely to have high academic achievement, and three times more likely to have better attendance in school. And students at Howard Kennedy will be in school more 45 minutes per day and five days more every year.\n\nRobertson: Gunter says there are also plans to add infant and toddler classrooms, to get kids learning sooner. But for me the biggest change that will help people is the fact Howard Kennedy is putting a full service Health clinic in the school. Historically, poor people didn\u2019t have health insurance, and even with the Affordable Care Act, many people don\u2019t have the time or money to go see a doctor.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, when kids are healthy they learn more.\n\nHoward Kennedy\u2019s medical clinic will be operated by staff from the Charles Drew Medical Center, and will be open to basically anyone in the community. In addition to basic medical services, there will be dental and behavioral health care as well.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re healthy you can\u2019t learn, a healthy body is a healthy mind. If we don\u2019t take care of ourselves, when you look at how many kids are absent from school. If you\u2019re not in a seat learning, you\u2019re not operating at a hundred percent.\u201d\n\nMcDermott: Gunter and his staff are obviously excited about the changes coming to his school. But many of the benefits that these changes will bring won\u2019t be recognized until these kids graduate. But Othello Meadows, executive director at 75 North, says fixing the schools is really the only guaranteed way of ending the cycle of poverty. He says the whims of business and economics come and go\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026But right now we have generations of kids who aren\u2019t prepared to compete, educationally. And I really didn\u2019t understand that until I got much deeper into this work. You just have kids that don\u2019t have a fighting chance because of the way they\u2019ve been prepared.\u201d\n\nRobertson: Meadows and Gunter both say education is the most important part of turning things around in North Omaha, but teachers only have contact with kids while they are in school. They say the rest of the community, and the city as a whole, has to step up and do their fair share to ensure generational poverty is wiped out in north Omaha.\n\nComments are closed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The non-profit 75 North is spearheading a $100 million dollar investment in the Highlander Neighborhood.", "robots": "noodp"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd70c4\"", "article_summary": "Local nonprofit 75 North is spearheading an effort to develop the Highlander Neighborhood to the tune of $100 million dollars.\n\u201cWhich is to really transform a neighborhood, we think that you do that through education.\u201dMcDermott: Howard Kennedy is the neighborhood elementary school, and will be part of the Highlander Neighborhood redevelopment project.\nMcDermott: 75 North is a local non-profit looking to create the next \u2018purpose built community\u2019 in the United States.\nReinvesting in North Omaha: Transforming a NeighborhoodBy KVNO NewsFebruary 17th, 2016Part IIClick here for Part I, here for Part IIIRobertson: We\u2019re standing in the Parking lot where Salem Baptist Church meets the construction for 75 North where the sounds of construction will be pretty common for the next few months.\nBut Othello Meadows, executive director at 75 North, says fixing the schools is really the only guaranteed way of ending the cycle of poverty."}
