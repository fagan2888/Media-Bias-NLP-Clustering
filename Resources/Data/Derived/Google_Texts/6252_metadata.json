Members of Northcrest along with volunteers from other churches will be out in the community doing everything from cleaning schools, helping the boys and girls club to conducting random acts of kindness. Jamie Castle says putting forth an effort to make where we live a better place, while at the same time, spreading the word of God, is important.\n\n\u201cWe decided that we needed to do something in our own city to show the people here that we love them. It\u2019s great to go out of the country for a week, but if you can some in your own city, this is our mission build,\u201d Northcrest Committee Missions member Jamie Castle explains. \u201cThis is where people need to know that we love them and that Jesus loves them.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to help out this week, members will meet in the student building at Northcrest Church every morning before heading out.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Northcrest Baptist Church in Meridian has kicked off its annual \u201cLove Out Loud\u201d week.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "Northcrest Baptist Church in Meridian has kicked off its annual \u201cLove Out Loud\u201d week.", "title": "Northcrest's \"Love Out Loud\" Mission Kicks off at Dumont Plaza", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Northcrests-Love-Out-Loud-Mission-Kicks-off-at-Dumont-Plaza-314477861.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/048/A66/048A667294CF4FEEBDCDA7329904D2BC", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/631/708/631708E6E03046CEA64D2FDBC314DF83.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Northcrest Baptist Church in Meridian has kicked off its annual \u201cLove Out Loud\u201d week.", "title": "Northcrest's", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Northcrests-Love-Out-Loud-Mission-Kicks-off-at-Dumont-Plaza-314477861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/LOVE+OUT+LOUD4.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Northcrest's \"Love Out Loud\" Mission Kicks off at Dumont Plaza", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Northcrests Love Out Loud Mission, Kicks off at Dumont Plaza"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e27\"", "article_summary": "Northcrest Baptist Church in Meridian has kicked off its annual \u201cLove Out Loud\u201d week in Dumont Plaza.\nJamie Castle says putting forth an effort to make where we live a better place, while at the same time, spreading the word of God, is important.\n\u201cWe decided that we needed to do something in our own city to show the people here that we love them.\nIt\u2019s great to go out of the country for a week, but if you can some in your own city, this is our mission build,\u201d Northcrest Committee Missions member Jamie Castle explains.\n\u201cThis is where people need to know that we love them and that Jesus loves them.\u201dIf you would like to help out this week, members will meet in the student building at Northcrest Church every morning before heading out."}
