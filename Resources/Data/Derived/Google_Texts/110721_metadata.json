The nonprofit, a local branch of a national organization, provides free repairs and accessibility upgrades to seniors whose homes might otherwise become uninhabitable.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost typically what we\u2019ll see here are issues of deferred maintenance,\u201d said RTO Executive Director Lisa Shulman Malul. \u201cAre they going to pay for their heat, pay for their food or pay for maintenance?\u201d Social service agencies aren\u2019t equipped to help with physical repairs; RTO tries to fill that gap.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou compound deferred maintenance over 20 years,\u201d said Associate Program Manager Nic Lukehart, and a home can become unlivable.\n\n\n\nOf the homeowners RTO serves in Oakland, 90 percent are African American; the rest are equally divided between white and Latino residents. \u201cIn a good year, we can touch 30 percent\u201d of the people who request assistance, Lukehart said. This is not a good year. The group is currently able to complete repairs for just 15 to 20 percent of those who request help.\n\n\n\nRTO will assist with a wide variety of repairs as well as accessibility upgrades such as ramps, railings and lighting to help seniors navigate safely in their homes. Donations of time, money and goods from the community such as from members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and Anderson Carpet company help keep the organization afloat.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery now and again, you\u2019ll have a volunteer and they\u2019ll fall in love with the homeowner,\u201d said Lukehart. After installing a new wheelchair ramp for a homeowner named Melba, one longtime volunteer worked with her to restore an exercise machine she had been given by a hospital. RTO contacted the manufacturer to find parts for the very old machine, and \u201cwe finally get this installed,\u201d Lukehart said. \u201c[Melba] was in tears by the end of it.\u201d He ran into her at the grocery store later and found out she had built up to exercising for a full hour every day.\n\n\n\n--Laura McCamy\n\n\n\n\n\n(Photo courtesy of RTO.)OAKLAND, Calif.--\u201cWe need to build more housing at all income levels, including affordable housing,\u201d Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in arecent telephone interview. Oakland city staff are currently working on a Housing Equity Roadmap, due out in this month.\u201cThe goal of the roadmap is to prevent displacement and to preserve affordability,\u201d Schaaf said. \u201cWe have this incredible population of elders here who have worked their whole lives and given so muchto this city. It is our duty to work to give them security in their last years.\u201dThe California Assembly is working on legislation that would provide more funding for affordable housing. In the meantime, the Oakland\u2019s Housing Assistance Center works to connect seniors with support and services to help them stay in their homes. Many private organizations throughout Oakland also provide much-needed services. Here are just three of the nonprofits, whose innovative approaches are helping low income seniors age with grace and ease.Studies have shown that your zip code is the biggest determinant of your life expectancy . Joshua Simon, executive director of the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation ( EBALDC ), cited as-yet-unpublished data showing that Piedmont residents will live, on average, 16 years longer than the residents of Oakland\u2019s San Pablo corridor , one of the neighborhoods that the nonprofit serves.\u201cThe reality is that people live in neighborhoods and not just in buildings,\u201d said Simon. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have healthy, safe places where people can afford to live.\u201dThe Healthy Neighborhood program targets the San Pablo corridor and Havenscourt neighborhoods as pilots for a more comprehensive approach to improving health and decreasing poverty. Partnering with community stakeholders and connecting residents to the wider neighborhood are key components of this approach \u2014 and also critical to combating isolation in seniors.\u201cThe irony is, by making an age-friendly community that makes it better and easier for seniors, you also make a better neighborhood for the next generation of youth,\u201d said Simon. \u201cThat also makes it safe for all of us, regardless of our age.\u201d\u201cWe encourage resident civic engagement in our buildings,\u201d said Simon. \u201cWhen people move into our buildings, we give them a voter registration form\u2026 We look for ways that people can be engaged in the neighborhood.\u201dThe nonprofit hopes to spread this model to other sites, filling some of Oakland\u2019s affordable housing gap. \u201cAs rents skyrocket, market forces are squeezing out the potential sites for affordable housing,Simon noted. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we tie up sites as quickly as possible, which is what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\u201cI want to get my sight back,\u201d said Jack Johnson, 67, with an optimistic smile framed by his neatly combed beard. He was soaking up the sun on a warm winter day in the sunny courtyard of St. Mary\u2019s Center , a nonprofit that works with extremely low-income seniors and families. Johnson repaired houses and cars until he lost his sight three years ago, but, he said, \u201cI want to go back to work.\u201d He stops by the senior center three to five days a week. \u201cSt. Mary\u2019s satisfies many of my needs,\u201d he noted.The center offers a variety of services, including case management for homeless seniors over 55, a senior drop-in center, daily low-cost lunches, medical services and a 25-bed winter shelter, Oakland\u2019s only homeless shelter specifically for seniors.The center is an oasis of serenity in a chaotic neighborhood. On weekday mornings, seniors gather at round tables in the drop-in center. Artwork from classes held at the center adorns the walls. Case workers meet with clients in small offices at the back of the room. A large table in front is filled with food donated by local stores and delivered by volunteers, which will be given away later.Last year, St. Mary\u2019s provided case management for 467 homeless seniors and reached out to 500 who live alone to help break their isolation. The nonprofit\u2019s senior programs reach more than 1,000 low-income Oakland seniors each year.Carol Johnson, St. Mary\u2019s executive director, says that gentrification is only one part of the problem for low-income seniors. Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is a crucial source of income for many of the seniors she works with, maxes out at a meager $889.40 per month for a single person in California.With rents even at single room occupancy hotels as high as $700, Oakland housing is too expensive for someone living on SSI.\u201cBecause of the lack of cost of living increases over the past few years, their spending power has decreased dramatically,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat only adds to the number of seniors who can\u2019t pay their rent.\u201d(Photo courtesy of RTO.)SSI is meant to bring people who are aged, blind or disabled up to the poverty line. For low-wage earners over 65, SSI supplements the small payments they receive from Social Security. Congressional Democrats are proposing the SSI Restoration Act to improve the law\u2019s income and asset limits, which haven\u2019t been adequately updated in over 40 years.\u201cMany of these people have had long work careers, but their Social Security payments don\u2019t bring them to the federal poverty level,\u201d Johnson observed.\u201cWe can\u2019t fix everything and we recognize that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really try to walk with people and be as supportive as we can.\u201dThese are just some of the many innovative programs that work hard to help Oakland\u2019s low-income seniors stay safe at home during their retirement years.As Mayor Schaaf said, \u201cThere is no one silver bullet that is going to solve this problem.\u201dOakland Local", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable housing, senior housing, tech boom, gentrification, elders of color, seniors income security, rebuilding together oakland", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
