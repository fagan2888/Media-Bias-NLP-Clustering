That could lead to as much as $1.5 trillion in rebuilding costs, says a CoreLogic report out Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s season is projected to be slightly below normal in hurricane activity, but the early arrival of Hurricane Arthur on July 3 is an important reminder that even a low-category hurricane or strong tropical storm can create powerful riptides, modest flooding and cause significant destruction to property,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Jeffery, senior hazard scientist for CoreLogic Spatial Solutions, in a press release.\n\nRelated: What Climate Change Is Really Costing You\n\nCoreLogic looked at single-family residential structures in 19 coastal states as well as the District of Columbia, including mobile homes, duplexes, manufactured homes and cabins. The potential reconstruction costs takes into account labor and materials based on total destruction.\n\nHere are the five states with the highest total number of properties at risk:\n\nFlorida: 2.48 million properties at risk Louisiana: 738,165 properties at risk New York: 466,919 properties at risk New Jersey: 445,928 properties at risk Texas: 434,421 properties at risk\n\nFlorida also tops the list of five states with the highest value of reconstruction costs for at-risk homes:\n\nFlorida: $490.40 billion in potential reconstruction costs New York: $182.47 billion in potential reconstruction costs Louisiana: $161.06 billion in potential reconstruction costs New Jersey: $134.19 billion in potential reconstruction costs Virginia: $92 billion in potential reconstruction costs\n\nRelated: The Amazing Storm That Swallowed a Street and the Cars on It\n\nTotal exposure varies significantly from state to state given differences in population, trends in residential development, geographic risk factors, length of coastline and other factors, noted CoreLogic.\n\nFor instance, Florida and Texas are both at high risk because of their extensive coastlines. Louisiana and New Jersey have smaller coastlines but have relatively low elevations \u2013 allowing storm surge inundation to extend farther inland and affect more homes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More than 6.5 million homes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are at risk of storm surge inundation, which could result in $1.5 trillion in rebuilding costs, according to a CoreLogic report released Thursday morning.", "title": "Massive Storm Surge Damage Could Cost $1.5 Trillion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/10/Massive-Storm-Surge-Damage-Could-Cost-15-Trillion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10292012_hurricane_sandy_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/10/Massive-Storm-Surge-Damage-Could-Cost-15-Trillion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10292012_hurricane_sandy_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "More than 6.5 million homes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are at risk of storm surge inundation, which could result in $1.5 trillion in rebuilding costs, according to a CoreLogic report released Thursday morning.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The potential reconstruction costs takes into account labor and materials based on total destruction.\nAlthough predictions indicate lower than normal storm activity this year, more than 6.5 million homes along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are at risk of storm surge inundation.\nThat could lead to as much as $1.5 trillion in rebuilding costs, says a CoreLogic report out Thursday morning.\nLouisiana and New Jersey have smaller coastlines but have relatively low elevations \u2013 allowing storm surge inundation to extend farther inland and affect more homes.\nFor instance, Florida and Texas are both at high risk because of their extensive coastlines."}
