Sutherland would have been mainly responsible for oversight of these issues.\n\nIn addition to these \"high-priority risks,\" which University Audit & Compliance officials said have been resolved, auditors identified 14 \"medium-priority risks.\" They said that \"urgent management attention is required\" to address those risks within 60 days. They added that, so far, three of those issues have been resolved.\n\nUSF Health executives ordered the audit after suspecting that portions of the Center were underperforming financially. Auditors found that while CAMLS did break even, it was mainly because USF Health provided additional financial support. In concept, the Center is supposed to fund itself through simulation training of medical professionals from around the world.\n\nLast week, a university trustees workgroup said while the center will continue pursuing those clients, it will now focus more on training USF Health students.\n\nUSF plans to open its new Morsani College of Medicine a short distance from CAMLS in 2019. That move downtown will now start before that, as CAMLS will soon house a number of medical school programs.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/audit-no-fraud-usf-camls-possibility-existed", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/467366682.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Audit: No Fraud At USF CAMLS, But Possibility Existed"}, "story_id": 467350614, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Mark Schreiner", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Audit: No Fraud At USF CAMLS, But Possibility Existed"}, "nid": 13693, "datePublished": "2016-02-21", "keywords": "CAMLS, USF Health, audit", "wordCount": 445, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "WUSF's Mark Schreiner reports on the audit of USF Health CAMLS.\nIn addition to these \"high-priority risks,\" which University Audit & Compliance officials said have been resolved, auditors identified 14 \"medium-priority risks.\"\nWhile the audit released by USF Health late Thursday didn't find any evidence that fraud took place at the Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS), it indicated that the possibility of fraud existed, as the center lacked the necessary internal controls.\nAuditors found that while CAMLS did break even, it was mainly because USF Health provided additional financial support.\nUSF Health executives ordered the audit after suspecting that portions of the Center were underperforming financially."}
