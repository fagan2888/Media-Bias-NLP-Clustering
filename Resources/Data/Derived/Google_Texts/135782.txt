It’s almost a rule: If you live in the rural West, you need a dog, preferably a big dog like a Lab, ideally a rescue mutt.

Some dogs relish posing in the beds of pickups, noses elevated to sniff the wind; others run barking back and forth along fences, desperate to break free and chase after deer or perhaps bring down the occasional cyclist. Then there are the small-town dogs who think they own the alleys, and like to pick on newbie dogs.

Two years ago, Ruth Pettigrew moved to Hotchkiss in western Colorado, population 1,400, in part because it bills itself as the “friendliest town around.” To her surprise, she discovered a pattern of unfriendliness when she and her leashed pets encountered other canines in town, she told the North Fork Merchant Herald.

“My own dogs have been attacked three times — unprovoked — all by dogs that were without supervision,” she reports. Neighbors advised her to “get bigger dogs” and “carry a weapon,” “drive elsewhere,” or keep her dogs “inside a fence.” So Pettigrew realized she (and her dogs) needed to be in “combat-fitness” shape.

What does the well-dressed dog walker wear when expecting trouble from aggressive dogs? Pettigrew suggests that you and your dogs don Kevlar bulletproof vests, strap Tasers and Mace to your arms, and hang a bat or club from a belt. And wear steel-toed boots on your feet — it’s a jungle out there.
