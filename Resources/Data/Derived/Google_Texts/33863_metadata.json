There's good news, though.\n\nConsumers now have until Jan. 10, 2014, to make their first payment on insurance that takes effect New Year's Day. They still have to enroll for a health plan in their state's Marketplace by Dec. 23, 2013, to receive that Jan. 1 coverage.\n\nThe latest deadline change came Wednesday from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry.\n\nThe payment deadline had been Dec. 31, 2013. Although each health plan has the option to make its own decision, it\u2019s expected that most major carriers will go along with the new payment deadline.\n\nKeep in mind, that\u2019s for the 36 states where the federal government runs the Marketplace. If you live in a state that runs its own Marketplace, your deadlines might be different.\n\nYou can still get insurance for 2014 if you sign up after the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline -- you just won\u2019t have coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\nThe new law has already had multiple \u201ckey dates\u201d for consumers to keep in mind, and many of those dates have changed in the past few weeks.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "health insurance, obamacare, affordable care act, insurance deadlines", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "If you want health insurance through the Affordable Care Act starting Jan. 1, you\u2019re running out of time.", "title": "Know Your 'Obamacare' Health Insurance Deadlines", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20131219/know-your-obamacare-deadlines", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/news/2013/12_2013/know_your_obamacare_deadlines/69x75_know_your_obamacare_deadlines.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "If you want health insurance through the Affordable Care Act starting Jan. 1, you\u2019re running out of time.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda671\"", "article_summary": "The latest deadline change came Wednesday from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry.\nDec. 19, 2013 -- If you want new health insurance through the Affordable Care Act starting Jan. 1, you\u2019re running out of time.\nThey still have to enroll for a health plan in their state's Marketplace by Dec. 23, 2013, to receive that Jan. 1 coverage.\nConsumers now have until Jan. 10, 2014, to make their first payment on insurance that takes effect New Year's Day.\nAlthough each health plan has the option to make its own decision, it\u2019s expected that most major carriers will go along with the new payment deadline."}
