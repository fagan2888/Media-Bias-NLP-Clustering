It\u2019s a lose-lose strategy,\u201d Patton said. \u201cThe goal of policymakers should be to reduce barriers to care and encourage participation, allowing individuals to lead healthier, more productive, financially stable lives.\u201d\n\nThe proposed monthly premiums would be in addition to modest co-pays Medicaid recipients are required to pay. Kasich pushed to expand Ohio\u2019s Medicaid coverage to cover additional people, including single, childless adults, and the governor is asking the Ohio General Assembly to keep that expansion going. Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to low-income people who can\u2019t afford to buy private health insurance, even with the subsidies offered by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA spokesman for the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Sam Rossi, said the proposal only applies to a small portion of the state\u2019s Medicaid recipients and is designed to help higher-income recipients learn how to transition to private health insurance. The vast majority of Ohio\u2019s Medicaid clients would not be asked to pay the premiums, he said.\n\nThe Medicaid premium proposal is part of the budget proposal Kasich submitted a few weeks ago. It asks state lawmakers to approve Medicaid premiums for adults who are over 100 percent of the state poverty level. If the Ohio General Assembly adopted the proposal, it would save Ohio\n\n$1.6 million in 2016 and\n\n$3.2 million in 2017.\n\nPatton said while research shows charging reasonable fees doesn\u2019t create a barrier to health care for middle class or rich people, fees can deny service to poor people struggling to pay for the necessities of life.\n\nIt can lead to a situation where a person deciding whether to buy diapers or go in for a checkup might say, \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good, I don\u2019t need a checkup,\u201d she said.\n\nMuch of the point of health care reform is to encourage preventive care, so people don\u2019t put off problems until they have a heart attack or another medical emergency and wind up in the emergency room, Patton said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s budget proposal states that in 2014, Medicaid provided health care coverage for 2.8 million Ohioans.\n\nThat figure is now up to 2.9 million, and Kasich\u2019s proposal would affect only 100,000 people, those living above the poverty line, Rossi said.\n\nThe proposal is not intended to raise revenue, but to introduce people who likely will transition out of Medicaid to the idea of paying health insurance premiums, Rossi said. The premiums are comparable to what they would pay to buy private health insurance in the Affordable Care Act health exchanges once subsidies are taken into consideration, he said.\n\nThe proposal also does not affect seniors or disabled people on Medicaid, Rossi said.\n\nPolicy Matters Ohio and Kasich are on the same page on whether Medicaid expansion should continue. Lawmakers have until the end of June to write the next two-year state budget.\n\nThe expansion added about 490,000 Ohioans to Medicaid coverage, according to testimony that Kasich\u2019s Medicaid director, John McCarthy, gave to the House Finance Subcommittee on Health and Human Services on Feb. 26. About 52 percent of the newly-covered people are men, and 48 percent women.\n\nPatton said the House will put together its budget proposal sometime in April and pass it along to the Senate.\n\nHospitals in Ohio support the continued expansion of Medicaid eligibility, Patton said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that the lawmakers look out across Ohio\u2019s health systems and understand what we\u2019re hearing from the hospitals,\u201d she said.\n\nRossi, asked how Medicaid expansion is faring, responded, \u201c\u201cWe are actively meeting with and working with our counterparts in the legislation on the budget proposal as a whole, and we are looking forward to continuing to do so over the next several months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>A progressive advocacy group is criticizing the Kasich administration for proposing premiums of about $20 a month for some Medicaid users, saying such fees are a barrier that likely will", "og": {"site_name": "Sandusky Register", "description": "Most Medicaid clients would not be affected", "title": "Kasich proposing that some Medicaid recipients pay monthly premiums", "url": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/Health-Care/2015/03/14/Kasich-proposing-that-some-Medicaid-recipients-pay-monthly-premiums", "image": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/image/2015/03/14/x720_q60/F-Inqueue-SR-StoryArchive-wendy-patton-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com", "description": "Most Medicaid clients would not be affected", "title": "Kasich proposing that some Medicaid recipients pay monthly premiums", "image": {"src": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/image/2015/03/14/x720_q60/F-Inqueue-SR-StoryArchive-wendy-patton-jpg.jpg"}, "creator": "sanduskyregistr", "site": "@sanduskyregistr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201503140018}}, "keywords": "Sandusky Register,Health Care", "google-site-verification": "fZibeoFmCJXMlwdTVWdLhmIoBIawotoXlU1VnWOTyc0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Kasich proposing that some Medicaid recipients pay monthly premiumsA progressive advocacy group is criticizing the Kasich administration for proposing premiums of about $20 a month for some Medicaid users, saying such fees are a barrier that likely will cause some recipients to lose health care.\nIt asks state lawmakers to approve Medicaid premiums for adults who are over 100 percent of the state poverty level.\nThe Medicaid premium proposal is part of the budget proposal Kasich submitted a few weeks ago.\n\u201cRequiring premiums for access to health care works against public health and a more efficient, effective health-care system.\nMedicaid provides health insurance coverage to low-income people who can\u2019t afford to buy private health insurance, even with the subsidies offered by the Affordable Care Act."}
