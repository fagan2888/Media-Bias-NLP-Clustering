The government just gets in the way too much. Lagasse specifically singled out the current president's policies.\n\n\"It's becoming a very challenging industry to become a very successful average restaurateur,\" continued Lagasse. \"I can't charge $300 a person in my restaurant or I would not be in business. Am I using any different ingredients? Not really. Am I using any caliber of service staff? I don't think so. I think our service is as good or better than most places.\" \"And then you add all the Obama nonsense to what it's become in the last several years. I don't have anything against Mr. Obama. I'm just saying the way that, you know... the government should stay out of things. [...] Pretty soon, they're going to wipe a lot of the middle restaurateurs and restaurant cooks. [...] If it continues, then watch: you're going to have high-end, and you're going to have fast food, and you're going to have chain restaurants.\"\n\nLagasse shared his thoughts on TNT's On the Menu. He predicts that if the government doesn't start getting out of the way, the American restaurant industry will split and leave entrepreneurs and start-ups behind. American restaurants will consist only of high-end establishments like the ones Lagasse owns, fast food and chain restaurants, because no one else will be able to succeed.\n\nAlso read:", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Famed Chef Emeril Lagasse Says Obama May Drive Him Broke | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Apparently he's just doing it wrong too.", "title": "Famed Chef Emeril Lagasse Says Obama May Drive Him Broke", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/famed-chef-emeril-lagasse-says-obama-may-drive-him-broke/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/09/Emeril-Lagasse.jpg", "updated_time": 1464253205, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Apparently he's just doing it wrong too.", "title": "Famed Chef Emeril Lagasse Says Obama May Drive Him Broke", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/famed-chef-emeril-lagasse-says-obama-may-drive-him-broke/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/09/Emeril-Lagasse.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Famed Chef Emeril Lagasse Says Obama May Drive Him Broke | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Famed Chef Emeril Lagasse Says Obama May Drive Him Broke", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd08\"", "article_summary": "[...] If it continues, then watch: you're going to have high-end, and you're going to have fast food, and you're going to have chain restaurants.\"\nFamed Chef Emeril Lagasse Says Obama May Drive Him BrokeFamed chef Emeril Lagasse says that it's becoming all but impossible to be a successful restaurateur in America today.\n\"It's becoming a very challenging industry to become a very successful average restaurateur,\" continued Lagasse.\n\"And then you add all the Obama nonsense to what it's become in the last several years.\nHe predicts that if the government doesn't start getting out of the way, the American restaurant industry will split and leave entrepreneurs and start-ups behind."}
