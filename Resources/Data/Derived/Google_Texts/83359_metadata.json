Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat and a rising star in her party.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s measure, which failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate in June, would allow about 25 million Americas with college loans to refinance their debt at today\u2019s lower interest rates. The White House has been a strong advocate for the bill, with the president personally pushing the legislation on multiple occasions in recent months.\n\n\u201cCongress should pass a bill to let students refinance their loans at today\u2019s lower interest rates, just like their parents can refinance their mortgage,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe president also urged universities to rein in tuition costs while saying both high school and college students should take their education seriously this year.\n\n\u201cTo all you young people, now that you\u2019re heading back to school, your education is something you have to take personally,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to push yourself; to take hard classes and read challenging books. Science shows that when you struggle to solve a problem or make a new argument, you\u2019re actually forming new connections in your brain. So when you\u2019re thinking hard, you\u2019re getting smarter. Which means this year, challenge yourself to reach higher. And set your sights on college in the years ahead. Your country is counting on you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama on Saturday challenged the nation's students to excel in class this fall while also pushing Congress to back a bill that would allow college graduates to refinance their student loans.", "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama on Saturday challenged the nation\u2019s students to excel in class this fall while also pushing Congress to back a bill that would allow college graduates to refinance their student loans.", "title": "Obama pushes Elizabeth Warren\u2019s student loan reform bill", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/16/obama-pushes-elizabeth-warrens-student-loan-reform/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/obama-warren-ap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/obama-warren-ap.jpg", "title": "Obama pushes Elizabeth Warren\u2019s student loan reform bill", "description": "President Obama on Saturday challenged the nation's students to excel in class this fall while also pushing Congress to back a bill that would allow college graduates to refinance their student loans.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd001c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCongress should pass a bill to let students refinance their loans at today\u2019s lower interest rates, just like their parents can refinance their mortgage,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nPresident Obama on Saturday challenged the nation\u2019s students to excel in class this fall while also pushing Congress to back a bill that would allow college graduates to refinance their student loans.\nThe president also urged universities to rein in tuition costs while saying both high school and college students should take their education seriously this year.\nThe White House has been a strong advocate for the bill, with the president personally pushing the legislation on multiple occasions in recent months.\n\u201cTo all you young people, now that you\u2019re heading back to school, your education is something you have to take personally,\u201d Mr. Obama said."}
