People in the Philippines have something to cry about.\n\nThe contrast could not have been more stark between a blubbering Rudd capping off his spectacular career with another spectacle and Tony Abbott just 10 minutes earlier giving the interview of his life on ABC's 7.30, as he tried to fix his predecessor's biggest mess.\n\nThere was the Prime Minister bluntly stating that it was not in the national interest to engage in the sort of soap opera politics Rudd had perfected.\n\nThe 24-7 West Wing pantomime was the hallmark of Rudd's time in office, always providing diversions and entertainment for a voracious media. It became a drug for journalists, not just those in the \"love media\" of the ABC and Fairfax. Laurie Oakes has been carrying on like an addict deprived of his fix since Rudd lost the election.\n\nBut Abbott is one cold turkey. \"I'm not interested in providing sport for journalists,\" he told 7.30. \"I'm not interested in starting a fight or provoking an argument; I'm interested in stopping the boats.\n\n\"And why I'm interested in stopping the boats is because this is a humanitarian disaster as well as an affront to Australian sovereignty.\"\n\nThe spurned luvvies of the media, along with Labor, the Greens and compassionistas, are demanding \"transparency\" in the government's boat-stopping operations, as if they are high-minded idealists preserving democracy.\n\nBut it was just such cartoon morality that got us into the mess in the first place, persuading Rudd he could dismantle the Howard government's border protections and be hailed as a hero.\n\nAnd it worked for those years after Rudd created the people-smuggling boom, as the love media and so-called human rights lawyers and refugee activists studiously ignored the boats they are now so excited about.\n\nBut finally reality overwhelmed spin. It's hard to ignore dead bodies floating in the sea.\n\n\"I want to stop the boats for Australia's sake and for the sake of common humanity,\" Abbott said.\n\n\"Surely all Australians, including the media, should want to stop the boats, not to provoke an argument.\"\n\nAbbott's construction is correct. Those calling for blow-by-blow details of \"on-water\" operations are only providing marketing material for people-smugglers and causing trouble with Indonesia. Why should the government help them?\n\nThis was the rabbit Rudd pulled out of the hat and could never fit back in. For him it was always about the optics of government, not the actions that so often were botched.\n\nRudd played at prime minister as though it was a role in a movie. It was about showing off to visitors at Kirribilli House that he had the US President on the phone, being photographed visiting a movie star in hospital, and putting his name to impenetrable essays on economics.\n\nIt was about hobnobbing with world leaders at global summits and being made a fuss of in Seat 1A by Qantas. It was more about the trappings than the business of government.\n\nRudd's ended his political career the way he lived it, bitter, vengeful, wallowing in self pity, dragging out the limelight, complaining about petty slights, boasting with grandiosity and railing at colleagues who wouldn't be there if he hadn't \"saved the furniture\".\n\nHe hijacked the first business day of the 44th Parliament and ambushed new Labor leader Bill Shorten, who was given just 10 minutes' notice of Rudd's bombshell.\n\nIn the end, Rudd was a broken man, hunched and angry, flinching from Shorten's hand on his shoulder, neither man able to look at the other.\n\nAgain, how different it was to John Howard's behaviour when he lost office in humiliating circumstances in the Ruddslide of 2007, losing his own seat of Bennelong to Maxine McKew by 2434 votes.\n\nBut Howard was gracious in defeat, even turning up at the official declaration of the poll when he didn't have to, smiling and shaking hands with the victor, and having a cup of tea with the voters who had rejected him.\n\n\"This is a wonderful exercise in democracy and it is a privilege to be part of that process,\" he said at the time.\n\nJohn Howard was indeed a class act. History will treat Rudd less kindly.\n\nSOLUTION TO ALL THE HOT AIR ON CLIMATE\n\nIT was a world first on Thursday night when the Rational Optimist and the Skeptical Environmentalist shared stage in Melbourne.\n\nBritish science writer Matt Ridley and Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg also shared a scathing disdain for the scare tactics of the green movement over the latest typhoon to hit the Philippines.\n\n\"Do you really think cutting off carbon emissions is going to help the victims of Typhoon Haiyan,\" asked Lomborg, who shot to fame with his 2001 book The Skeptical Environmentalist, which holds that no environmental problem is so bad it can't be fixed by human progress.\n\nViscount Ridley's 2010 bestseller The Rational Optimist also dismisses the case for catastrophic climate change.\n\n\"Humanity is the solution, not the problem. Centralised government is the problem not the solution,\" he told the Institute of Public Affairs.\n\n\"Our species will always find innovative ways to surmount obstacles.\"\n\nLomborg, a vegetarian environmentalist, blasted those who are trying to capitalise on the Philippines tragedy.\n\n\"Yes, there are ferocious cyclones in the world, as there always have been. But \u2026 claiming that CO2 cuts is the way to tackle cyclone damages is simply immoral.\"\n\nEven if the world was to drastically cut carbon dioxide emissions any impact would only occur in 50-100 years.\n\nThe real way to help typhoon victims is to build them better houses.\n\nA BRIDGET TOO FAR\n\nIT'S a complete foot-stamping outrage that the latest instalment of Bridget Jones' Diary has killed off Darcy and turned Bridget into a 51-year old cougar.\n\nWhat a let-down for all the women around the world who believed in the happy ending.\n\nWe willed silly Bridget to come to her senses and snap up the treasure in front of her eyes: Darcy. Swoon!\n\nAnd what an insult to Jane Austen, whose Pride and Prejudice formed the basis for Helen Fielding's 1996 chick-lit classic.\n\nBad enough that Austen's spirited Elizabeth Bennet was transformed into a 20th century dumpling who wears granny undies, drinks too much and obsesses about her looks. But at least Mr Darcy was worthy of his literary predecessor. He was the patient prize at the end of Bridget's tizz.\n\nBumping him off is just wrong.", "article_metadata": {"description": "YOU'D have to be heartless not to feel sympathy for Kevin Rudd, tearstained and forlorn, announcing his resignation from politics.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "YOU'D have to be heartless not to feel sympathy for Kevin Rudd, tearstained and forlorn, announcing his resignation from politics.", "title": "Rudd really was a crying shame", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/rudd-really-was-a-crying-shame/story-fni0cx12-1226761629618", "image": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2013/11/16/1226761/629591-73b7cdfe-4e57-11e3-95c1-9e9b6c573736.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2013/11/16/1226761/629591-73b7cdfe-4e57-11e3-95c1-9e9b6c573736.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226761629618, "keywords": "prime minister, love media, crying shame, marketing material, Jane Austen, humanitarian disaster, national interest, boat-stopping operations, humiliating circumstances, streaming tears, border protections, human rights lawyers, opera politics, so-called human rights, Overseas visitors, man able, broken man, people-smuggling boom, world leaders, grown man, business day, dead bodies, global summits, petty slights, spurned luvvies, blow-by-blow details, cold turkey, catastrophic climate change, complete foot-stamping outrage, British science writer, carbon dioxide emissions, ,,,Philippines, Parliament House, House of Representatives, Kirribilli House, Helen Fielding, Smith Kym, The Edge, Elizabeth Bennet, Matt Ridley, Bjorn Lomborg, Bridget Jones, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Colin Firth, Kevin Rudd, John Howard, political career, Australian sovereignty, Actor Colin Firth, cartoon morality, official declaration, high-minded idealists, spectacular career, refugee activists, voracious media, shaking hands, impenetrable essays, emotional flaccidity", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Nov 17 12:31:51 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sun Nov 17 12:31:51 EST 2013", "author": "Miranda Devine"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19b1\"", "article_summary": "\"I'm not interested in starting a fight or provoking an argument; I'm interested in stopping the boats.\n\"And why I'm interested in stopping the boats is because this is a humanitarian disaster as well as an affront to Australian sovereignty.\"\nYOU'D have to be heartless not to feel sympathy for Kevin Rudd, tearstained and forlorn, announcing his resignation from politics.\nLaurie Oakes has been carrying on like an addict deprived of his fix since Rudd lost the election.\nThere was the Prime Minister bluntly stating that it was not in the national interest to engage in the sort of soap opera politics Rudd had perfected."}
