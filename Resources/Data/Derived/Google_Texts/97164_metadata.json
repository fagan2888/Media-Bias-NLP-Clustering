In addition, the production company is marketing it as being shot in Tennessee.\u201d\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of Robin Williams\u2019 final movies, \u201cBoulevard,\u201d filmed with a $302,000 taxpayer investment, still has earned no interest from film distributors.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One of Robin Williams\u2019 final movies, \u201cBoulevard,\u201d filmed with a $302,000 taxpayer investment, still has earned no interest from film distributors.", "title": "Unreleased Robin Williams Film Got $302K in Funding From Tenn.
