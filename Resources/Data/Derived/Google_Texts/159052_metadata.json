The words supposedly contain every difference between ancient maps and our own. Where old maps were illustrated and incomplete, ours are accurate and photographed from the sky. Old maps were pricey and precious; ours are nearly free and ubiquitous.\n\nMost importantly: Old maps\u2014early modern European maps\u2014contain uncharted territory, across which beasts rumble and serpents writhe. They have dragons.\n\nOur technology might be indistinguishable from magic, but it does not contain magical creatures. Google Maps does not have dragons.\n\nOr that\u2019s the story, anyway. But I\u2019d always wondered: Do any old, original maps actually say those words, \u201cHere be dragons?\u201d\n\nThe answer, it seems, is \u2026 No.\n\nNot a single old paper map presents those exact words\u2014\u201cHere be dragons\u201d\u2014 in the margins or otherwise. Nor does any paper map include \u201cHic sunt dracones,\u201d the words\u2019 Latin equivalent.\n\nBut a globe does.\n\nThat\u2019s right: One globe\u2014just one\u2014contains the words Hic sunt dracones. Called the Hunt-Lenox Globe, it was built in 1510, making it one of the first European globes ever made. It\u2019s tiny and made of copper\u2014you can see it pictured above. Now in the possession of the New York Public Library, the Hunt-Lenox Globe contains the famous warning on the southeast coast of Asia:\n\nNo dragons are near the words themselves, but the globe hides various sea beasts throughout.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But an ancient globe does.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "But an ancient globe does.", "title": "No Old Maps Actually Say 'Here Be Dragons'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/Screen_Shot_2013_12_11_at_2.45.59_PM-1/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/no-old-maps-actually-say-here-be-dragons/282267/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Where old maps were illustrated and incomplete, ours are accurate and photographed from the sky.\nBut I\u2019d always wondered: Do any old, original maps actually say those words, \u201cHere be dragons?\u201dThe answer, it seems, is \u2026 No.\nNot a single old paper map presents those exact words\u2014\u201cHere be dragons\u201d\u2014 in the margins or otherwise.\nOld maps were pricey and precious; ours are nearly free and ubiquitous.\nGoogle Maps does not have dragons."}
