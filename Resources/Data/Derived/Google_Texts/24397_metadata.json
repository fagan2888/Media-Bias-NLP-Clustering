But any list of their most comical claims would have to include those involving the law\u2019s \u201cwayback clause.\u201d Haven\u2019t heard of that one? Well, like the provision authorizing the IRS to issue subsidies via federal exchanges, it\u2019s absent from PPACA\u2019s text. Nonetheless, its efficacy is routinely touted by Obamacare\u2019s proponents as proof that \u201creform\u201d works.\n\nThe most celebrated effect of this amazing provision is its retroactive reduction of medical inflation during the years preceding the law\u2019s implementation. Obamacare was passed in 2010. However, except for a few minor provisions, it didn\u2019t go into effect until 2014. Yet the law\u2019s wayback clause is such a powerful cost control tool that it has been able to traverse the time-space continuum and slow the rate of health care inflation, as the President himself has phrased it, \u201cevery single year since the law passed.\u201d\n\nThe wondrous workings of the wayback clause have also been heralded by congressional Democrats. Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, for example, told a radio interviewer the following: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare.\u201d And the President\u2019s advisors have, of course, chimed in. The Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal to credit the \u201clargely unheralded slowdown in health spending\u201d to Obamacare.\n\nIt goes without saying that such marvels have been the subject of many \u201cnews\u201d articles and countless opinion pieces. A typical example of the latter is this column in the New York Daily News by Bill Hammond, who parrots the party line and issues the following snide challenge: \u201cSo who will be the first major Republican to admit that Obamacare is working? Who among the GOP\u2019s brain trust is intellectually honest enough, or brave enough, to follow the developing facts instead of talking points and opinion polls?\u201d\n\nBut if Hammond wants anyone to admit that Obamacare is working based on the decline of health care inflation, he will have to explain why that trend began eight years before the law was passed. As the New York Times reports, \u201cThe slowdown in spending growth began in 2002.\u201d Does Hammond actually believe Obamacare\u2019s wayback clause was able to transcend the laws of physics as well as economics, that it was able to reach all the way back to the Bush era and halt what he calls the \u201cruinous spiral of spending\u201d?\n\nHammond would be loath to say so, of course, but it is possible to be honestly skeptical about the claims he and others make concerning the law\u2019s successes, particularly in the area of costs. Nonpartisan studies attribute the decline in health care inflation to economic factors, insisting that the recession was the most important factor in reducing growth in medical spending: \u201cThis suggests that the recent decline is not primarily the result of structural changes in the health sector or of components of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSome have even suggested that considerable credit for the slowdown in health care inflation\u2014you Obamacare advocates should sit down before reading further\u2014must go to the policies of George W. Bush. Much of the decline has been driven, these researchers point out, by a \u201cremarkable\u201d slowdown in Medicare spending, particularly in the Part D prescription drug program. Specifically, they write, \u201cOur analysis shows that Part D has accounted for over 60 percent of the slowdown in Medicare benefits since 2011.\u201d\n\nFor those na\u00efve enough to claim that this is a benefit of Obamacare\u2019s closure of the much maligned \u201cdonut hole,\u201d the reality is that this puts upward pressure on medical spending. Which brings us to the kind of inflationary pressures that our health care system will face because of PPACA. Beginning in 2014, the law increased demand on our health care system while doing nothing to increase the supply of medical services. This is by definition inflationary. And there are already signs that this is having the predictable effect.\n\nBloomberg reports that federal data suggest the party is already over: \u201cThe nation\u2019s nearly $3 trillion medical bill grew 5 percent last year, compared with an average annual rate of 3.9 percent from 2009 to 2013.\u201d And it gets worse. It appears that the 2014 acceleration in medical inflation might just be the beginning: \u201cThe data confirm earlier estimates by Altarum economists, which might be a sign that costs will accelerate in 2015.\u201d In other words, Obamacare has probably ended the 12-year downward trend in health care inflation.\n\nAnd yet, as recently as last week, the President made a speech in Cleveland in which he included a none-too-subtle suggestion that Obamacare was responsible for keeping \u201chealth care inflation at the lowest rate in nearly 50 years.\u201d This will no doubt go down with his countless other false claims as an all-too-characteristic lie. Obamacare has made U.S. health care more expensive, less accessible, and it will eventually reduce its quality. No amount of presidential prevarication will alter that. Not even the wayback clause can change it.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf82\"", "article_summary": "But any list of their most comical claims would have to include those involving the law\u2019s \u201cwayback clause.\u201d Haven\u2019t heard of that one?\nNot even the wayback clause can change it.\nThe most celebrated effect of this amazing provision is its retroactive reduction of medical inflation during the years preceding the law\u2019s implementation.\nWhich brings us to the kind of inflationary pressures that our health care system will face because of PPACA.\nYet the law\u2019s wayback clause is such a powerful cost control tool that it has been able to traverse the time-space continuum and slow the rate of health care inflation, as the President himself has phrased it, \u201cevery single year since the law passed.\u201dThe wondrous workings of the wayback clause have also been heralded by congressional Democrats."}
