There actually is something sad about Rudy\u2019s long self-destruction, which began before his disastrous presidential primary bid of 2008. Sad, but possibly instructive to the future sidewalk lunatics among today\u2019s Republican presidential wannabes. Maybe you had to be with Giuliani at the start of his electoral career to learn what they and the rest of us should learn from this spectacle: not to gloat or cluck our tongues, but to consider how often genuine political promise coexists with puerility and worse.\n\nThroughout the fall 1993 New York mayoral campaign, I tried harder than any other commentator I know of to convince my left-liberal friends that Giuliani would win \u2014 and that he probably should, because Democrats had all but asked for it.\n\nIn my New York Daily News column, in the New Republic, and on cable and network TV, I insisted it had come to this because racial \u201cRainbow\u201d and welfare-state politics were imploding, not just in New York and not only thanks to racists, Ronald Reagan or robber barons, but because something had gone wrong with liberal politics itself. You didn\u2019t have to believe all of Giuliani\u2019s \u201ccolorblind,\u201d \u201claw-and-order,\u201d free-market rhetoric to want some big shifts in liberal Democratic paradigms and to see that, in New York City, some of those shifts would require a political battering ram, not a scalpel.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Giuliani during the 1993 campaign and during his first year in City Hall, and while I criticized him several times for presuming far too much, I defended a lot of his record to the end of his tenure, and still would defend some of it. He forced New York, that great capital of \u201croot cause\u201d answers to every social problem, to get real about remedies that worked, in the world that we had to work with. Some of these remedies turned out to be preconditions for progress of any kind: I saw Al Sharpton blink as I reminded him in a debate that twice as many New Yorkers had been felled by police bullets during David Dinkins\u2019 four-year mayoralty, which preceded Giuliani\u2019s, than during Giuliani\u2019s then-seven years in office (1994-2001).\n\nEven as late as July 2001, when Giuliani\u2019s personal and political blunders were beginning to eclipse his accomplishments and he had only a lame duck\u2019s six months to go, I showed in a New York Observer column that he\u2019d facilitated housing, entrepreneurial and employment gains for people whose loudest advocates called him a racist reactionary. James Chapin, the late democratic socialist savant, considered Giuliani a \u201cprogressive conservative\u201d like Teddy Roosevelt, who\u2019d been a New York City police commissioner before he\u2019d been president.\n\nYet, even after 9/11 had given Chapin\u2019s comparison real resonance, Giuliani couldn\u2019t have carried his methods and motives to the White House without damaging the country, for two reasons that run deeper in him \u2013 and probably also in Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry and other wannabes \u2014 than \u201chorse race\u201d liabilities like a loss of one\u2019s temper at a podium.\n\nThe first serious problem facing politicians like this is structural and political: A man who fought the inherent limits of his mayoral office as fanatically as Giuliani would have construed his presidential prerogatives so broadly that he\u2019d have made George W. Bush\u2019s notions of \u201cunitary\u201d executive power \u2013 and, yes, some of Barack Obama\u2019s notions along those lines \u2014 seem soft.\n\nEven in the 1980s, as an assistant attorney general in the Reagan Justice Department and then as U.S. attorney in New York, Giuliani was imperious and overreaching. He \u201cperp-walked\u201d Wall Streeters out of their offices in dramatic prosecutions that failed. He made the troubled daughter of a state judge testify against her mother and against the former Miss America Bess Myerson in another failed prosecution charging that Myerson had hired the daughter to bribe her mother the judge into helping \u201cexpedite\u201d a messy divorce. The jury was so put off by Giuliani\u2019s tactics that it acquitted all concerned.\n\nAt least, as U.S. attorney, Giuliani served at the pleasure of the president and had to defer to federal judges, as of course he did also as mayor. Had he become president, however, U.S. attorneys would have served at his pleasure \u2014 a dangerous arrangement in the wrong hands, as we learned when Alberto Gonzalez was George W. Bush\u2019s A.G.\n\nAs mayor, Giuliani fielded his closest aides like a fast and sometimes brutal hockey team, micro-managing and bludgeoning city agencies and even agencies that weren\u2019t his, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Board of Education. They often deserved it richly enough to make his bravado thrilling and effective. But Rudy Savonarola wasn\u2019t above cutting indefensible deals with crony contractors and pandering shamelessly to some Hispanics, orthodox and neoconservative Jews, and other favored constituencies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is an important lesson here for us all: How often genuine political promise coexists with puerility and worse", "title": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s sad self-destruction: How \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d became just another GOP sidewalk lunatic", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There is an important lesson here for us all: How often genuine political promise coexists with puerility and worse", "title": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s sad self-destruction: How \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d became just another GOP sidewalk lunatic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/rudy_giulianis_sad_self_destuction_how_americas_mayor_became_just_another_gop_sidewalk_lunatic/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2007/03/what_an_anti_giuliani_ad_should_say.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There is an important lesson here for us all: How often genuine political promise coexists with puerility and worse", "title": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s sad self-destruction: How \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d became just another GOP sidewalk lunatic", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2007/03/what_an_anti_giuliani_ad_should_say.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Sleeper", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Al Sharpton, Barack Obama, david dinkins, Editor's Picks, New York City, Rudy Giuliani, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Even in the 1980s, as an assistant attorney general in the Reagan Justice Department and then as U.S. attorney in New York, Giuliani was imperious and overreaching.\nThere actually is something sad about Rudy\u2019s long self-destruction, which began before his disastrous presidential primary bid of 2008.\nSad, but possibly instructive to the future sidewalk lunatics among today\u2019s Republican presidential wannabes.\nJames Chapin, the late democratic socialist savant, considered Giuliani a \u201cprogressive conservative\u201d like Teddy Roosevelt, who\u2019d been a New York City police commissioner before he\u2019d been president.\nTopics: Al Sharpton, Barack Obama, david dinkins, Editor's Picks, New York City, Rudy Giuliani, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, News, Politics NewsWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest wasn\u2019t just being diplomatic or clever yesterday when he said he feels sad and sorry for Rudy Giuliani, the former \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d who\u2019s been raging like a sidewalk lunatic at President Obama."}
