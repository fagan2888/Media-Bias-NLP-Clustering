That would be prima facie evidence that, in federal contracting, no bad deed goes unrewarded.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Obama administration cut ties Friday with CGI Federal, the original contractor for healthcare.gov. The IT firm, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Canadian company CGI, had a two-year federal contract valued at $100 million.\n\nThat was despite the fact that CGI\u2019s performance on a medical registry for diabetes patients in the Canadian province of Ontario \u2013 a cohort of less than 1 million people \u2013 was so horrendous, including three years of missed deadlines, that the provincial government jettisoned its $46.2 million contract with the IT firm.\n\nThe question is, how companies with such problematic track records as CGI Federal and Accenture nevertheless managed to score lucrative contracts with the Obama administration.\n\nSome suggest that the relationship between first lady Michelle Obama and her Princeton University classmate, CGI Federal senior vice president Toni Townes-Whitely, may have helped CGI win its contract.\n\nAnd there\u2019s speculation that the $286,168 President Obama has received from Accenture\u2019s political action committee and the firm\u2019s employees and their family members may have influenced its just-announced award.\n\nWe are not prepared to say that CGI Federal and Accenture received sweetheart contracts from the Obama administration. But we don\u2019t think it unreasonable to say that CGI\u2019s record of incompetence and Accenture\u2019s record of gaming the federal procurement process should have disqualified those firms from being awarded government contracts.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Editorial: Going from unreliable to untrustworthy? | federal, accenture, million, cgi, obama, contract, administration, contracts, government, company", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "The global consulting and technology services company Accenture agreed in September 2011 to pay the U.S. government $63.6 million to resolve a whistle-blower lawsuit alleging the company submitted false claims for payment under numerous contracts with federal agencies for information technology services.", "title": "Editorial: Going from unreliable to untrustworthy?", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/federal-597139-accenture-million.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mzd3ds-b781248162z.120140113144228000gij1i04ad.1.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mzd3ds-b781248162z.120140113144228000gij1i04ad.1.jpg"}, "description": "The global consulting and technology services company Accenture agreed in September 2011 to pay the U.S. government $63.6 million to resolve a whistle-blower lawsuit alleging the company submitted fal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Editorial: Going from unreliable to untrustworthy?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/mzd3ds-b781248162z.120140113144228000gij1i04ad.1.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "federal, accenture, million, cgi, obama, contract, administration, contracts, government, company", "publication_date": "2014-01-13", "access-type": "free", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Editorial: Going from unreliable to untrustworthy?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09b0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cKickbacks and bid rigging undermine the integrity of the federal procurement process,\u201d Tony West, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, said at the time.\nThe IT firm, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Canadian company CGI, had a two-year federal contract valued at $100 million.\nPerhaps it will even top the $63.6 million settlement Accenture paid the government for undermining the integrity of the federal procurement process.\nWe are not prepared to say that CGI Federal and Accenture received sweetheart contracts from the Obama administration.\nSpeaking of which, the Obama administration cut ties Friday with CGI Federal, the original contractor for healthcare.gov."}
