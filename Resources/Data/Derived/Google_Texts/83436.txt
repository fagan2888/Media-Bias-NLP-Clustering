Wichita, KS

From signed jerseys and bats, to a series of autographed baseballs - even the Chiefs' Derrick Johnson sent a signed ball; each item will help raise money for Kaiser Carlile's memorial.

"What grabbed my attention obviously was the Miquel Caberea, that was my son's favorite player," Kaiser's dad Chad Carlile said.

Kaiser's family drove in from Liberal, KS to see the fundraiser for Kaiser. Dad Chad even threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Many fans wanted to come to the ballpark to show their support to the family.

"I want to help Kaiser's family, and the memorial, it is beautiful I can't wait to see it," supporter Mary MacMartin said.

The memorial will be a granite baseball fountain, that will have a quote from Kaiser saying, "Play hard and have fun."

When it's done, Kaiser's family will be back in Wichita for the dedication, and they want the community to know how much they appreciate the love they've gotten since Kaiser's death.
