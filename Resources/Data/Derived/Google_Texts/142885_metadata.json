Murphy faces Monica Vernon in the June 7 Democratic primary. (Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nDUBUQUE, Ia. \u2014 On a sunny spring afternoon perfect for shoe-leather campaigning, Pat Murphy is at home, sitting on the living-room couch with his feet propped on a pillow on the coffee table.\n\nThis, the Dubuque Democrat says, is the key to his congressional candidacy.\n\nHe has a computer on his lap and a phone balanced on the arm of the couch. The laptop is loaded with autodialer software; with the click of a button the phone dials a number pulled from a list of northeast Iowans likely to vote in next month\u2019s Democratic primary.\n\nMurphy says he\u2019s contacted some 27,000 people this way, and talked to 5,000 of them.\n\nA long-time state legislator and former speaker of the Iowa House, Murphy, 56, is making his second run for Congress in Iowa\u2019s 1st District. He\u2019s seeking to avenge a 2014 loss to incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Rod Blum in the Democratic-leaning district, but faces an uphill battle against former Cedar Rapids City Councilwoman Monica Vernon in the June 7 primary.\n\nHe says he spends three to five hours a day calling voters, interrupted only by the occasional yaps of his poodle-bichon mix, Toto, and the low murmur of ESPN from the TV above the piano. There\u2019s a bronze bust of John F. Kennedy on a buffet across the room and a painting on the wall of Democratic presidents playing pool.\n\n\u201cThe biggest outreach we\u2019ve done is right here,\u201d he said, motioning to the autodialer. \u201cI ask them what issues they want to talk about and I ask them for their vote.\u201d\n\nResponse rates are best, he says, on rainy days.\n\nThe one-by-one approach is necessary in part because Murphy lags far behind Vernon when it comes to the fundraising and institutional support necessary for wider voter outreach. She\u2019s backed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and has outraised Murphy by more than $1 million according to their latest campaign finance reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running a much more grassroots campaign this time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know, especially since Monica has a pile of more money than we do, we\u2019ve got to have more of a ground game.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Pat Murphy, Democratic candidate for Iowa's 1st Congressional District, left, and his son, John, wait for Teri Murphy to finish voting Thursday, May 5, 2016, at the election annex building in downtown Dubuque. (Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)\n\nIn his phone calls and on the campaign trail, Murphy plays up his record as Iowa House speaker, the leadership office he held from 2007 to 2011 when Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office.\n\nDuring his period at the helm, lawmakers raised the minimum wage, expanded state-funded preschool, extended civil rights protections and blocked efforts to prohibit same-sex marriage.\n\nState Rep. Chuck Isenhart, a fellow Dubuque Democrat who served with Murphy for six years, credited the former speaker with accomplishing many of his goals despite something of a disconnect between legislative Democrats and Democratic Gov. Chet Culver.\n\n\u201cPat had his priorities, knew the process and did what he could to move those priorities through the process,\u201d he said. Isenhart hasn\u2019t endorsed candidate in the race, but called Murphy a \u201ctop-notch legislator.\u201d\n\nBut even when Murphy raises his statehouse accomplishments on the trail, the goal is often to draw a contrast with his opponent, underscoring the essentially adversarial nature of his candidacy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a proven record,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have squat. Is that an OK word to use? Squat?\u201d\n\nMurphy even takes credit for what Vernon holds as her greatest success: Cedar Rapids\u2019 recovery after the 2008 flood.\n\n\u201cAll right, she\u2019s been on the Cedar Rapids City Council, she did a lot of stuff for flood recovery,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cbut the biggest pieces she did for flood recovery was stuff that I approved as speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nA Vernon ally argues that characterization isn't fair. State Sen. Jeff Danielson, D-Cedar Falls, led a legislative panel in 2010 that examined state funding for disaster response, and said he's never seen a local official as invested in the legislative discussion as Vernon was.\n\n\u201cFor Pat Murphy to minimize Monica Vernon\u2019s role in the process as if it didn\u2019t matter is not correct,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was there and engaged.\u201d\n\nMurphy is less inclined, though, to discuss a contradiction in his own record: After years of identifying himself as \u201cpro-life,\u201d he now says he supports legal access to abortion. Vernon and her allies have seized on this, highlighting instances during his legislative career in which he aligned with anti-abortion groups and backed measures restricting the procedure.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m pro-choice, and I\u2019ve been pro-choice,\u201d Murphy said in an interview, pointing to instances in which he blocked abortion restrictions, expanded stem-cell research and increased funding for family planning services as House speaker. \u201cWe did a bunch of progressive things for women when I was speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s congressional platform calls for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave. He opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and says he favors building on the Affordable Care Act health care law by providing a \u201cpublic option\u201d for coverage and lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55.\n\nBut the issue he focuses most of his rhetoric on is his constancy as a Democrat \u2014 and Vernon\u2019s history of shifting party affiliation. Voter records show she was registered as a Republican for years before becoming a Democrat in 2009, after she\u2019d been elected to the city council.\n\nVernon\u2019s party switch is central to Murphy\u2019s first TV ad, and he raised it repeatedly throughout the day a Des Moines Register reporter followed his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d Murphy told a resident over a ham-ball and baked potato lunch at an affordable housing complex in Dubuque. \u201cI have been my whole life. That\u2019s a problem for my primary opponent \u2014 the first 51 years of her life she was a Republican.\u201d\n\nResponding to that charge on Vernon's behalf was U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, a Democrat from the neighboring 2nd District.\n\n\"As a Democrat and a congressman and someone who has endorsed her in the race, I have absolutely no concerns whatsoever about Monica\u2019s past party affiliation,\" Loebsack said. \"She became a Democrat, she\u2019s a good Democrat, and I have every confidence that she\u2019s going to vote for her district in a largely progressive way.\"\n\nRegardless, drawing sharp contrasts with Vernon remains Murphy's top talking point, and one he raises frequently with the voters he reaches from his living room with the autodialer,\n\n\"She's going to be outspending us probably 2-to-1 on ads, but the bottom line is ours are going to be much more hard-driving than hers,\" he promised one potential voter as they wrapped up their call. \"OK, thanks, Marlene. Enjoy exercise class.
