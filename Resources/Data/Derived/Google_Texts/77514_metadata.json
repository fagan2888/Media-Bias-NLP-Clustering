Now, 93 percent of Longs Peak students are enrolled in a music class.\n\n\"It's great to see so many kids getting involved in these programs but as participation increases, so does the need,\" Lemons said.\n\nAnd it is not just low-income families who need help with expensive instrument costs, he said.\n\nStudents who play multiple instruments or families with more than one student taking music classes often cannot afford the price tag.\n\nProviding loaner instruments to families allows students who would not otherwise be able to participate to remain in music classes, Lemons said.\n\nMortensen learned to play the trumpet in the Longs Peak band and is hoping his project will allow other students to have the same positive experience that he did.\n\nMortensen expects the donated instruments to last up to 15 years and provide assistance to up to 240 students.\n\n\"I'm still playing and want other kids to have the same opportunities,\" Mortensen said. \"Mr. Lemons is a great director who taught me to have fun, develop my talents, and to be confident.\"\n\nContact Times-Call community reporter Whitney Bryen at 303-684-5274 or wbryen@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26306892/longmont-high-student-donates-instruments-longs-peak-band", "modificationDate": "2014-08-09T17:49:46-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n \n  Times-Call community reporter", "description": "As Longs Peak Middle School prepares to take in fifth graders this fall, former Ram Ty Mortensen is hoping to put instruments in the hands of incoming students.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26306892:view"}, "startDate": "2014-08-09T10:56:18-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26306892/longmont-high-student-donates-instruments-longs-peak-band", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0809/20140809__10TCASCOw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As Longs Peak Middle School prepares to take in fifth graders this fall, former Ram Ty Mortensen is hoping to put instruments in the hands of incoming students.", "title": "Longmont High student donates instruments to Longs Peak band"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "As Longs Peak Middle School prepares to take in fifth graders this fall, former Ram Ty Mortensen is hoping to put instruments in the hands of incoming students.", "title": "Longmont High student donates instruments to Longs Peak band", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26306892/longmont-high-student-donates-instruments-longs-peak-band", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0809/20140809__10TCASCOw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-09T10:56:18-0600", "endDate": "2024-08-09T10:55:05-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont High student donates instruments to Longs Peak band", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Whitney BryenTimes-Call", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-08-09T10:59:58-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Last school year, about 120 Longs Peak students were borrowing instruments owned by the school district, Lemons said.\nMortensen collected the instruments, including clarinets, flutes, trombones and trumpets, through private donations this summer and turned them over to Longs Peak band director Chad Lemons Saturday.\nNow, 93 percent of Longs Peak students are enrolled in a music class.\nLess than 50 percent of students participated in music classes when Lemons was a student at Longs Peak in the late 90s, he said.\nThe need for instruments is expected to increase this year at Longs Peak as the school, and likely band, enrollment grows when the school adds a grade, Lemons said."}
