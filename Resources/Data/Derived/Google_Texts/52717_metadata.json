They say that opposites attract, and we can't wait for these two to become an item, because they really do compliment one another and their strengths offset the other's weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBarry Doesn't Treat Iris Like A Prize\n\n\n\nUnlike some men, Barry doesn't treat Iris like a prize to be won or plot to steal her away from Eddie Thawne. Instead, he treats her like a goddess and loves her for who she is, not who she represents.\n\n\n\nThey Are Best Friends\n\n\n\nWhile Iris may still be in denial of her feelings for Barry, they are still best friends and she admits to the Flash that she is determined to reignite his faith in the impossible.\n\n\n\nThey Trust One Another\n\n\n\nEven though Iris and Barry are on the rocks because the latter feels incredibly guilty for lying to his best friend about being the Flash, they still trust one another.\n\n\n\nIt is most evident when Barry finally tells Iris that he loves her-he trusts that she will not laugh at him or grow angry at him for not telling her sooner.\n\n\n\nPlus, Iris trusts him too-otherwise, she would have never told him that she was dating Eddie and planning on moving in with him if she didn't.\n\n\n\nThey Know Each Other Inside And Out\n\n\n\nBarry and Iris know each other inside and out. The former spent a ton of money to buy Iris a replica of her mother's wedding ring and the latter purchased a very expensive microscope for Barry, which clearly shows that she cares very deeply about him.\n\n\n\nWestAllen fans, why do you like Barry and Iris's relationship?
