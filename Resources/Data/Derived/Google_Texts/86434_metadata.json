A premature baby.\n\nMy daughter is a preemie. That sounds common enough, even kind of cute.\n\nI was a preemie, too. My mother can\u2019t recall how early, maybe four or five weeks. Early enough that as she was being rushed into the delivery room, she was so distraught that a nurse told her not to worry, that her own child had been born early, too, and was just fine.\n\nThen comes the laugh line: My mother sobbed, But\u2014is your kid smart?\n\nAt this point in the storytelling, my mother would shake her head. \u201cCan you believe it? That nurse should have slapped me.\u201d\n\nAnd we would laugh. There I stood, sound of body, brain apparently intact.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nFive and a half months into my second pregnancy, I woke up in labor\u2014sudden, unexplained labor\u2014and my daughter was delivered via emergency cesarean.\n\nIn recent years, I think I\u2019ve read in passing about some increase in the incidence of premature births, in the level of prematurity. I think I\u2019ve read about the astronomical costs and extraordinary interventions involved in caring for such babies. I probably wondered to myself, without dwelling on it for long, whether all of them truly ought to be saved.\n\nI\u2019ve heard of babies so tiny they can fit in the palm of your hand. I\u2019ve seen those photos somewhere. The NICU here has one taped to the door: a baby nestled in a cupped palm, sepia-toned, serene and perfect. Just like a regular baby, only in miniature.\n\nMy daughter looks nothing like that.\n\nShe\u2019s pre-premature. She\u2019s pre-alive.\n\nThen again, the books displayed in the NICU list a category for a baby like her: \u201cextremely premature.\u201d These books chart the probabilities of outcomes for each category of preemie, from \u201cmildly premature\u201d to her category: the odds of death, of major complications, of serious disability.\n\nHer official gestational age is 25 weeks and three days. In terms of her odds, every one of those days matters. But we never had any certainty about her due date.\n\nOne of the books has no row for cases more extreme than hers. It also notes that, until recently, a preemie like her had virtually a zero percent chance of survival. This book distinguishes itself from other books for parents of preemies as the one with a \u201cpositive approach.\u201d\n\nMost of the charts list 1,000 grams as the lowest cutoff. My daughter has already dropped below her birth weight of 705 grams, and she is dropping lower by the hour.\n\nEventually, I find charts that include rows for babies born at 24 weeks, 23 weeks, even 22 weeks and under, but then there are no statistics, only words in parentheses: poor outcome, insufficient data, N/A.\n\nOr blank spaces.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s an unproductive question, an unseemly question, a petty question. As patiently as they can, the doctors attempt to dispel it from their higher realm.\n\nIf I\u2019d arrived at the hospital sooner, wouldn\u2019t my daughter have been safe?\n\n\u201cYou were fully dilated when you got to triage,\u201d Dr. Bryant, my obstetrician, says.\n\nBut if I\u2019d arrived twenty minutes earlier, one hour, three hours\u2014\n\n\u201cThe baby was coming out,\u201d she says.\n\nMy husband Peter fixates on the grimy suitcases he hefted up from the basement in preparation for the renovation. All evening, I was overtaken by fits of sneezing, but it had already been a terrible allergy season.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the suitcases,\u201d Dr. Bryant says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the sneezing.\u201d\n\nThen was it that my pregnancies were so close together?\n\nDr. Bryant says that an interval of less than six months between pregnancies is considered risky. The interval between mine was at least eight.\n\nWas it that Peter and I made love that night?\n\nGently, firmly, Dr. Bryant shakes her head.\n\nThen what happened?\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d Dr. Bryant says. \u201cIn my decades of practice, I\u2019ve known this to happen.\u201d\n\nWhen we ask Dr. Kahn, she says, \u201cWell, someday someone will win a Nobel for figuring out the answer to that.\u201d\n\nThe general prevailing theory, she says, is that, for some reason, the baby needed to come out.\n\nSomething went wrong and we all missed it. Something so wrong that my daughter exited my body before her skin could hold itself together, before her brain could withstand the trauma, before she could nurse, before she could breathe.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nDid I deliver a child or lose one?\n\nDo I keep holding on or do I prepare to let go?\n\n\u201cTwo things that happened in 2012,\u201d AOL CEO Tim Armstrong declares at a town hall meeting one year after my daughter has come home from the hospital, the same week she takes her first steps. \u201cWe had two AOLers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were okay in general. And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost. So when we had the final decision about what benefits to cut because of the increased health care costs, we made the decision, and I made the decision, to basically change the 401(k) plan.\u201d\n\nOn his own computer screen, my husband watches the headlines proliferate, from Capital New York (ARMSTRONG: \u201cDISTRESSED BABIES FIGURED IN 401(K) ROLL-BACK) to Fortune (ADD TIM ARMSTRONG\u2019S \u201cDISTRESSED BABIES\u201d TO THE PILE OF GAFFES) to Daily Kos (BREAKING! THERE\u2019S STILL AN AOL, AND ITS CEO IS STILL AN A-HOLE).\n\nOn Twitter, \u201cdistressed babies\u201d is becoming a meme:\n\n\u201cHow many distressed babies does AOL pay this guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope these \u2018distressed babies\u2019 are happy.\u201d\n\nOn the overhead TV screens throughout the newsroom, Peter watches close-ups of Armstrong rotate among playbacks of the CEO\u2019s previous blunders. On cable news shows, talking heads debate health care costs, privacy laws, the Affordable Care Act, corporate responsibility, crisis management, potential legal and civil liabilities, AOL stock prices\u2014all in the context of \u201cdistressed babies.\u201d\n\nHis own newsroom gawks and titters at the spectacle. A number of Peter\u2019s colleagues\u2014editors, writers, PR flacks\u2014knock on his door to gossip: Can you believe this? What an idiot.\n\nOne of the first reports\u2014by Re/code\u2019s Kara Swisher, a prominent tech journalist\u2014inaccurately summarizes Armstrong\u2019s town hall comments as referring to \u201cthe difficult and costly pregnancies of two employees,\u201d as if \u201cdistressed babies\u201d could only be the result of such circumstances. All the subsequent speculation focuses on \u201cAOL moms.\u201d None of the experts challenge these assumptions. None of the commentators seem to consider the possibility that one of the employees in question could be a father.\n\nExcept for those of Peter\u2019s coworkers who know the barest outlines of our daughter\u2019s arrival and immediately identify Mila as one of those \u201cdistressed babies.\u201d The sympathetic ones come by Peter\u2019s office to express recognition of his uncomfortable position. Hey, he\u2019s talking about your kid, right? How\u2019s she doing? How are you?\n\nThe next day, the media uproar over \u201cdistressed babies\u201d continues at a fever pitch. More talking heads, more commentary, more analysis, more tweets. Instead of a public apology, Tim Armstrong issues an internal memo, which is leaked to the media almost immediately:\n\n\u201cAs we discussed at the town hall, we care about you and the company\u2014a lot\u2026In that context, I mentioned high-risk pregnancy as just one of many examples of how our company supports families when they are in need\u2026As I have said over and over again, our employees are our greatest asset. Let\u2019s move forward together as a team.\u201d\n\nThe cold slap seeps in. With each clarification that Tim Armstrong issues, our family seems more and more at fault somehow, and our daughter\u2019s humanity seems less and less evident.\n\nEver since my daughter\u2019s arrival, my shame and guilt seem to have taken up permanent residence in my body along with my organs and bones, as fixed and familiar as they are unseen and unexamined. Likewise, my sense of being a burden, of encumbering others because of my failure to hold on to my own baby, has become the hidden pulse of my daily existence.\n\nSomehow Tim Armstrong has managed to broadcast those innermost feelings at a companywide meeting before they became fodder for the twenty-four-hour news cycle. And now that those feelings are out there for the world to digest, I can finally take a closer look at them myself.\n\nWhat did I do wrong other than experience a medical emergency?\n\nWhat resources did my daughter use other than the health insurance that my husband and I purchased?\n\nHow did Tim Armstrong and his corporation extend themselves for my family other than by complying with the basic terms of our benefits?\n\nDistressed babies. I know about \u201cdistressed jeans\u201d and \u201cdistressed leather.\u201d I\u2019ve heard the terms distressed securities and distressed properties. Or distressed merchandise: damaged goods.\n\n\u201cDistressed babies\u201d sounds like another bit of corporate-speak, except that I doubt it shows up on any MBA vocabulary list. It\u2019s both a dehumanizing insult and a strange euphemism that seems intended to demonstrate extra sensitivity on the part of the speaker\u2014as opposed to, say, premature babies or sickly babies or g-ddamn pain-in-the-ass babies.\n\nIt aims for a show of sympathy while positioning the speaker as the hero of this scenario. It brings to mind a fussy infant wailing to be picked up rather than a child fighting for every minute of her life.\n\nDistressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were okay in general.\n\nAfter all these months of struggling to say those words myself\u2014she was born\u2014now Tim Armstrong has said them for me, in a context that suggests that she probably shouldn\u2019t have been. Babies that were born. \u201cThat,\u201d not \u201cwho.\u201d\n\nWe paid a million dollars. Did he personally pay her bills? After all my dealings with the insurance company, this is news to me.\n\nTo make sure those babies were okay in general. Did he demand some guarantee from the doctors that I never received? Does Mila count as \u201cokay in general\u201d now? If not, should she be written off as a bad investment?\n\nI tell myself that people make mistakes. But I can\u2019t pretend that these off-the-cuff remarks don\u2019t reveal a damning, perhaps unconscious judgment of me and my daughter.\n\nEven if I accept that Armstrong\u2019s intention was not to scape-goat those babies but to point out his pride in having paid for their care\u2014an apparently exorbitant expense that somehow drained AOL\u2019s coffers to the point that he was forced to recoup it from another component of employee benefits\u2014that judgment just became explicit in his assumption that \u201cdistressed babies\u201d must be the result of \u201chigh-risk pregnancies.\u201d Which no one in the media has questioned, either.\n\nThe implication is that our baby was a risky proposition from the start, and therefore her care was optional. We selfishly claimed more than our fair share of health benefits, and Tim Armstrong and AOL bailed us out. The medical treatment that saved our daughter\u2019s life was not a basic right or even a contractual obligation, but an act of corporate charity and proof of Tim Armstrong\u2019s personal generosity. And Peter\u2019s co-workers have only us to blame for those cuts to their retirement savings.\n\nI reach for Peter\u2019s hand. I tell him that if he can move on as if this never happened, I can, too. Peter says that if that\u2019s what I want, he can. We go back and forth, around and around.\n\nAt last, Peter says, \u201cI guess I can\u2019t.\u201d His anguish is plain on his face.\n\nEver since our daughter\u2019s arrival, my rawer emotions and overt trauma have often taken precedence over his. Sometimes, I remind myself, my husband needs rescuing, too.\n\nWhen I sit down at my desk, it\u2019s past midnight. My hands are trembling and my heart is pounding, but my head feels very clear.\n\nThirteen months ago, my daughter left the hospital and never looked back. I\u2019m the one living as if I\u2019m trapped behind walls of glass.\n\nIf I don\u2019t come forward as the mother of my baby, I might as well forsake her. If I don\u2019t reclaim her story, I might as well label her a burden, a tragedy, a creature who shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo I write. All the details that have seemed unspeakable, I write.\n\nI\u2019m the mother of one of those \u201cdistressed babies.\u201d I\u2019m the reason the CEO of a large corporation felt the need to cut benefits.\n\nA million dollars. At this point, I have no way of knowing if Tim Armstrong and AOL actually paid that amount, though this accounting certainly doesn\u2019t square with my rudimentary grasp of how insurance works. I understand that a CEO might have a different approach to valuation of a human life than, say, a mother. But I\u2019m not sure, in the final accounting, how many of us could survive such a calculus.\n\nWould it have occurred to Armstrong to single out the medical expenses of an employee who survived a car crash, or needed heart surgery, or got breast cancer?\n\nFor the first time, it occurs to me that when Dr. Kahn described Mila\u2019s birth as catastrophic, she meant the word in the medical sense. A catastrophic medical event is, almost by definition, unforeseeable and unpreventable.\n\nYes, our daughter needed costly intensive care. Yes, we are grateful\u2014indelibly grateful\u2014that our employer-subsidized plan covered most of the expenses.\n\nBut isn\u2019t that the whole point of health insurance?\n\nAt last, I describe Mila\u2019s first steps, those two tiny steps that she took in the days leading to Tim Armstrong\u2019s town hall meeting. And I finally use the word that, for me, might be the most dangerous word of all.\n\nMiracle.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that my daughter emerged from her birth completely unscathed. I don\u2019t mean that she is an act of divine intervention more than a person. I don\u2019t mean that she has to be a miracle\u2014or even \u201cokay in general\u201d\u2014in order to justify her existence.\n\nShe is a miracle in the way that any child taking her first steps is a miracle. And yes, she deserves a little extra credit. Some recognition of her strength, not only her suffering; of her resilience, not only her damage.\n\nExcerpted from Girl in Glass: How My \u201cDistressed Baby\u201d Defied the Odds, Shamed a CEO, and Taught Me the Essence of Love, Heartbreak, and Miracles, by Deanna Fei.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If I don\u2019t reclaim my daughter's story, I might as well label her a burden, a tragedy, a creature who shouldn\u2019t exist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "If I don\u2019t reclaim my daughter's story, I might as well label her a tragedy", "title": "How My Preemie Defied the Odds, Shamed a CEO and Taught Love", "url": "http://time.com/3956206/girl-in-glass-premature-baby/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/girl-in-glass.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=420", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/girl-in-glass.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=420"}, "description": "If I don\u2019t reclaim my daughter's story, I might as well label her a tragedy", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How My Preemie Defied the Odds, Shamed a CEO and Taught Love"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "books, parenting", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "premature baby, distressed babies, healthcare, health insurance premature babies"}, "article_summary": "Excerpted from Girl in Glass: How My \u201cDistressed Baby\u201d Defied the Odds, Shamed a CEO, and Taught Me the Essence of Love, Heartbreak, and Miracles, by Deanna Fei.\n\u201cDistressed babies\u201d sounds like another bit of corporate-speak, except that I doubt it shows up on any MBA vocabulary list.\nDistressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were okay in general.\nDistressed babies.\nSomehow Tim Armstrong has managed to broadcast those innermost feelings at a companywide meeting before they became fodder for the twenty-four-hour news cycle."}
