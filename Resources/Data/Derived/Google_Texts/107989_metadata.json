Rick Perry has nine months left in office but he is not acting like a lame duck.\n\nOn the contrary, his Wednesday visit to Lubbock \u2014 to honor departing Texas Tech Chancellor Kent Hance and to receive the National Association of Drug Court Professionals\u2019 governor of the year award \u2014 exemplify his busy schedule, even though the Legislature is not in session.\n\nAnd nothing figures more prominently in his busy schedule than his out-of-the-state travels.\n\nIn recent months he has traveled to Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Nevada, New York, Tennessee and Virginia as well as to Cancun, Mexico; Davos, Switzerland; and London.\n\nThere is a good reason for it, according to those who are watching the longest serving governor in Texas history.\n\nThough Perry won\u2019t say it publicly, except that he is keeping his options open \u2014 as he told Fox News last week \u2014 the way he talks everywhere he goes leaves no doubt he is getting ready for another presidential run.\n\n\u201cTexas\u2019 conservative fiscal principles continue to be a national example for stimulating job growth at all wage levels and creating opportunity for families,\u201d Perry said Tuesday after the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas reported that from 2000 to 2013 Texas experienced more job growth at all pay levels than any other state.\n\n\u201cEmployers know Texas gives them the best chance at success because our limited government approach leaves more money in their pockets, allowing them to risk their capital, create jobs and see a return on their investment,\u201d Perry said.\n\nThis was one of his main selling points in 2012 before his presidential run collapsed \u2014 largely because of his \u201coops\u201d moment in a nationally-televised debate among Republican hopefuls. Perry could not remember the name of the third federal agency he wanted to abolish if elected president.\n\nTo West Texas Republicans such as Carl Tepper, there is no doubt Perry intends to run for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to redefine himself and its working,\u201d said Tepper, chairman of the Lubbock County Republican Party. \u201cI am not a Perry cheerleader, but his demeanor and style are different.\u201d\n\nPolitical observers across the nation also expect Perry to run.\n\n\u201cAny politician who has ambitions wants the big prize, and the big prize is the presidency,\u201d said Daniel Franklin, a University of Texas at Austin graduate, now associate professor of political science at Georgia State University in Atlanta.\n\nTexas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said his party also expects Perry to run for president, and plans to be ready for him.\n\n\u201cWe intend to constantly point out that this man has been a terrible governor,\u201d Hinojosa said.\n\nFor instance, Texas ranks 49th in public education funding, Hinojosa said. He also said Perry\u2019s refusal to allow the state to participate in the Medicaid expansion offered under the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 better known as Obamacare \u2014 has hurt many Texans.\n\n\u201cHe leads a Texas government for wealthy corporations and for the right wing of his party, and the hell with everybody else,\u201d Hinojosa said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, News, ENRIQUE RANGEL, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Gilberto Hinojosa, Kent Hance, Rick Perry", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "AUSTIN - Gov.
