Luis Gutierrez has introduced a law to replace former President Andrew Jackson with a woman on the $20 bill.\n\n\u201cAs women fill more and more positions of leadership in United States and in U.S. economy, there remains one place they are not represented: on United States currency. This legislation will change that,\u201d the Illinois Democrat said in a press release.\n\nThe \u201cPut a Woman on the Twenty Act\u201d would set up a committee of citizens tasked with recommending a choice to the treasury secretary.\n\n\u201cRecognizing and celebrating the significant contributions of women throughout American history on U.S. paper currency makes a powerful statement to my daughters and to young women across this country and to people across the globe who look to America as an example of inclusion and equal rights,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said.\n\nBills are supposed to be redesigned every 10 years to prevent counterfeiting, so the $20 bill, which was last redesigned in October 2003, is ready for an overhaul.\n\nThe bill follows a related bill in the Senate introduced last week by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat, who said in a statement on her website that \u201cit\u2019s long overdue\u201d for U.S. currency to include the contributions of women.\n\n\u201cThe incredible grassroots support for this idea shows that there\u2019s strong support for a woman to be the new face of the $20 bill,\u201d she said.\n\nSupporters of the measure, including lobbying group Women on 20s, insist the effort is nothing personal against President Jackson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
