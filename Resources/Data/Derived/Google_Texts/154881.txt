CORINTH – An Alcorn County child care facility that was issued an emergency license suspension in mid-March has been given permission to reopen by the Mississippi State Department of Health.

The license suspension notice issued to Circle Y Child Care on March 16 stated that the state department of health had “reasonable cause to believe that at least six children enrolled in the facility have been sexually and physically abused at the facility or on premises near the facility, while in the care of the facility.”

The facility was closed for 14 days, and the state department of health conducted an investigation, said Liz Sharlot, state department of health spokeswoman.

Health department regulations state that after 14 days a facility gets to have a hearing or the facility is reopened, she said.

“We did not have sufficient evidence to call a hearing,” Sharlot said.

Therefore, the health department allowed Circle Y Child Care to reopen on March 31 with restrictions. One part of the facility is the daycare while another part contains a private Christian school. The restriction states that the daycare children must stay on the daycare side of the facility, Sharlot said.

Circle Y has had a good record in the past, Sharlot noted.

Sheriff Ben Caldwell said the decision to close Circle Y Child Care and to reopen it was made by the Mississippi State Department of Health and not his office.

The sheriff’s office still has an ongoing investigation, Caldwell said.

“No one’s been arrested or charged at this time,” the sheriff said.

Circle Y is located on County Road 512, which is off of Highway 45, south of Corinth.

Circle Y officials could not be reached for comment by telephone.
