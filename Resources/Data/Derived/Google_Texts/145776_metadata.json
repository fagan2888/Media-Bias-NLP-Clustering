Three-quarters of them received adjuvant chemo within 90 days of cancer surgery.\n\nAs distance to the chemotherapy center increased, the likelihood of getting the chemo decreased. Patients who had to travel more than 250 miles were about 60 percent less likely to get it than those who had to travel less than 12.5 miles.\n\nIn most cases, patients would be traveling back to the facility where they had their cancer surgery to have adjuvant chemo.\n\nThe number of oncologists in the immediate vicinity of the patient\u2019s home was not associated with the odds of receiving chemo. But patients with no insurance, and those with public insurance, were less likely to get chemo if they lived in an area with few oncologists.\n\nFor people with private insurance, oncologist density did not make a difference, the authors reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nOncologist density ranged from zero oncologists per 100,000 residents in rural areas like west Texas, to more than seven oncologists per 100,000 residents in areas like central Florida.\n\nPatients who cannot afford private insurance might have less ability to travel to get chemo, or to take the necessary days off of work to get it, Lin said.\n\nDr. Daniel G. Haller, professor of medicine emeritus at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not part of the new study, pointed out that often, patients cannot drive themselves home after a chemotherapy session.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have close family members to drive them or cannot take one day off every two weeks twelve times, for a typical regimen, they may not get the treatment,\u201d Haller told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nTravel distance likely affects treatment for many conditions, like cardiac follow-up or diabetes, Haller said.\n\nAdjuvant chemo is highly recommended for some, but not all, colon cancers, Lin said.\n\nIn the U.S. the average age at colon cancer diagnosis is 70, and many older patients may have other health conditions which preclude chemotherapy, or make it less likely that the chemotherapy will benefit them, Haller said.\n\n\u201cHow many of those people were recommended to get chemo? You don\u2019t know what was said after their surgery,\u201d based on the data in this study, he said. Some patients might have been told not to get adjuvant chemo, he added.\n\nBut in some cases, patients are told to get adjuvant chemo but refuse, or do not have the social support to get to their appointments, Lin said.\n\n\u201cFor the travel barrier, there are several things we can do to help patients,\u201d including the patient navigator service available in many major cancer centers, she said.\n\nA patient navigator works one-on-one with a cancer patient and identifies barriers to their care and how they can be overcome, she said. Navigators can contact physicians available in the local area or make appointments or find transportation assistance.\n\nSome nonprofit organizations offer travel assistance as well, Lin said.\n\n(Reporting by Kathryn Doyle)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "some, colon, cancer, patients, travel, distance, limits, access, chemo", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who have been treated for colon cancer are less likely to get chemotherapy after surgery to reduce the risk of future cancer if they have to travel far for the appointments, according to a new study.", "title": "For Some Colon Cancer Patients, Travel Distance Limits Access To Chemo", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/some-colon-cancer-patients-travel-distance-limits-access-chemo-349328", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/25/shutterstock218458957.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who have been treated for colon cancer are less likely to get chemotherapy after surgery to reduce the risk of future cancer if they have to travel far for the appointments, according to a new study.", "title": "For Some Colon Cancer Patients, Travel Distance Limits Access To Chemo", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/some-colon-cancer-patients-travel-distance-limits-access-chemo-349328", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/25/shutterstock218458957.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/25/shutterstock218458957.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-25T10:25:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T10:25:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who have been treated for colon cancer are less likely to get chemotherapy after surgery to reduce the risk of future cancer if they have to travel far for the appointments, according to a new study."}, "article_summary": "Preventive chemotherapy given after cancer surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence is called \u201cadjuvant\u201d chemotherapy, and guidelines recommend that stage III colon cancer patients start receiving adjuvant chemo within three months of surgery.\nHer team analyzed data from close to 35,000 patients with stage III colon cancer diagnosed between 2007 and 2010.\nPatients that have been treated for colon cancer are less likely to get chemotherapy, a new study suggests.\nIn most cases, patients would be traveling back to the facility where they had their cancer surgery to have adjuvant chemo.\nThree-quarters of them received adjuvant chemo within 90 days of cancer surgery."}
