Their noses contain more than 220 million olfactory receptors, making their sense of smell thousands of times more sensitive than humans\u2019 \u2014 humans only have five million of these cells. It\u2019s these cells that give bloodhounds the ability to track, rescue dogs the ability to find people buried in rubble, and most recently, a German shepherd-mix the ability to detect thyroid cancer.\n\n\u201cCurrent diagnostic procedures for thyroid cancer often yield uncertain results, leading to recurrent medical procedures and a large number of thyroid surgeries performed unnecessarily,\u201d said Dr. Donald Bodenner, chief of endocrine oncology at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, in a press release. These procedures typically include detecting suspicious thyroid nodules \u2014 lumps that form in the thyroid, which are mostly benign \u2014 and then performing a fine-needle biopsy to collect and analyze the cells for malignancy. While it\u2019s a simple procedure, it\u2019s never completely accurate, and sometimes leads to additional biopsies, among other procedures that may be more painful or expensive.\n\nBodenner said the German shepherd-mix they trained to detect thyroid cancer could do so with only a bit less accuracy, but with the advantages of being inexpensive and noninvasive. The dog, named Frankie, was scent-trained to \u201cdifferentiate benign thyroid disease from thyroid cancer by smelling a person\u2019s urine,\u201d co-author Dr. Arny Ferrando said in the release. The researchers\u2019 study, which was presented Friday at ENDO 2015, the Endocrine Society\u2019s 97th annual meeting, found Frankie was accurate 88.2 percent of the time.\n\nFor their study, 34 patients submitted urine samples prior to undergoing a biopsy or surgery to analyze suspicious nodules. Of them, 15 were diagnosed as cancer while 19 were considered benign thyroid disease. Next, the urine samples were presented to Frankie, who was trained to either lay down if the sample was cancerous or turn his head away if it was benign. His nose was able to match 30 of the 34 samples to their diagnostic outcome.\n\nWhile there was only a small number of patients for Bodenner and his team\u2019s study, the findings add to a growing body of research highlighting how dogs can contribute to the field of medicine. In 2012, a study found they were about 83 percent accurate when it came to identifying people infected with the superbug Clostridium difficile. Another study from 2011 found dogs could differentiate lung cancer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \u201cIn the breath of patients with lung cancer, there are likely to be different chemicals to normal breath samples,\u201d study author Thorsten Walles said at the time. It\u2019s likely the urine of people with thyroid cancer also contains different chemicals than that from non-cancer patients.\n\nBodenner and his team plan to work with the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine in Auburn, Ark., next to train two bomb-sniffing dogs to identify thyroid cancer. Although the research is still in its early stages, it could lead to new, cheaper, and less painful approaches to cancer diagnoses.\n\nSource: Bodenner D, Ferrando A, et al.
