Heading downtown Sunday? Take public transit!

With the USA Pro Challenge cycling race rolling into town, a food festival on the 16th Street Mall, and the Colorado Rockies ending their three-game series against the Marlins, there will be street closures throughout the day, and parking will be more difficult than usual.

The Rockies game is scheduled for a 2:10 p.m. start, which is close to the time cyclists are expected to be rolling into Denver along Speer Boulevard.

The 16th Street Food Festival will be on the mall until 7 p.m.

It is the last leg of the race, with cyclists riding down Highway 93 from Boulder to end at Civic Center Park.

Most closures in Denver will be from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

Between Sherman and Steele streets, 17th Avenue will be closed sometime between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. “It all depends on when the riders get in,” Bob Wilson, Colorado Department of Transportation spokesman said.

Interstate 25 off-ramps at Speer Boulevard will close at about 2:30 p.m., and so will Colfax Avenue from Glenarm Place to Sherman Street.

No parking is allowed along the route starting at 6 a.m. Sunday, and by 12:30 p.m. illegally parked vehicles had already been towed.

“Once they get outside Boulder, it’s a rolling closure, anytime you get behind the cyclists it will be slow going,” Wilson said.

RTD is encouraging people to take the bus and light rail.
