While libraries are better known for books, story time and due dates \u2013 since the launch of the ACA, many libraries across the United States have embraced a new role as a go-to community resource for information on health insurance.\n\nCarrie Cline is the new director at the Neosho/Newton County library in Southwest Missouri. She\u2019s worked at libraries throughout Southwest Missouri for nearly two decades. Though her library is small, she says helping people find health insurance coverage is a logical extension of their mission in their community of 56,000 residents.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a better place [to get help] than the library because we reach so many different people that it's not based on your religion, your economics, it\u2019s just based on the fact that we're here to help you,\u201d Cline said.\n\nNearly 60 percent of libraries in the US are now offering programs designed to help their patrons identify health insurance resources according to the 2014 Digital Inclusion Survey. Some libraries are even training their own staff to be ACA navigators or bringing in volunteers to assist people with different languages and cultures.\n\nThough smaller, rural libraries often do not have the resources to support this level of help, Cline says they can \u201cat least offer a space where trainers can come in, meet with clients, meet with the general public and help them get enrolled,\u201d Cline said.\n\nThroughout open enrollment, Cline's library hosts certified application counselors from a local community health organization called Freeman Health System.\n\nThese counselors are trained in the up-to-date information on the ACA and actually sit with the individuals, guiding them through the enrollment process, step by step.\n\nCamille Midcap, the lead certified application counselor, said the library acts a bridge between people needing coverage and Freeman Health System\u2019s enrollment services. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t reach the more vulnerable populations, the hard to reach populations without them,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nHelp like this can be especially valuable for those who may have low health care literacy such as low-income individuals, rural populations and non-English speakers. For all of these people, the library is usually a known community resource.\n\n\u201cThose in that community are very familiar and I think feel comfortable to come to the library,\u201d Midcap said. \u201cSo we've stationed there, in all those communities for the past couple years and it has always been successful.\u201d\n\nFrancisca Goldsmith, a librarian and author of a book on the ACA published by the American Library Association this year, said that libraries are known as a judgement-free zone because \u201cpublic libraries are open to all and have information for all.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind her book, \u201cLibraries and the Affordable Care Act: Helping the Community Understand Health-Care Options,\u201d is to assist librarians in understanding the ACA and help them identify the health insurance needs of their community. And she says, just as libraries are a go-to destination for tax preparation assistance in the spring, they\u2019re starting to be known as \"community connectors\" to open enrollment help.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of library staff would actually be surprised at how just the fact that the federal government and many state governments have advertised that `the information is available at your library,\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cPeople are hearing that message over and over.\u201d\n\nLibrarian Carrie Cline said the relationship with Freeman Health System already feels natural for the Neosho-Newton library, and she doesn\u2019t intend for the library\u2019s commitment to the community won\u2019t stop with the ACA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we're here for - is to help you, no matter what the subject,\u201d Cline said. \u201cWe want to be the ones to help you find what you're after or at least get you started in the right direction or guide you to someone who knows more than we do, who could actually help you.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "With just a little over a month left in the third open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act, some people may need a little additional help getting", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Health & Wealth Desk", "og": {"url": "http://kbia.org/post/during-open-enrollment-libraries-connect-community-healthcare-options", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201512/460967225.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With just a little over a month left in the third open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act, some people may need a little additional help getting", "title": "During Open Enrollment, Libraries Connect Community to Healthcare Options"}, "story_id": 460848712, "twitter": {"site": "@KBIA", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KBIA"}, "author": "Rebecca Smith", "org_id": 394, "dc": {"title": "During Open Enrollment, Libraries Connect Community to Healthcare Options"}, "nid": 83220, "datePublished": "2015-12-28", "wordCount": 998, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Throughout open enrollment, Cline's library hosts certified application counselors from a local community health organization called Freeman Health System.\nAnd she says, just as libraries are a go-to destination for tax preparation assistance in the spring, they\u2019re starting to be known as \"community connectors\" to open enrollment help.\nHealth insurance can be a confusing topic, with its array of terminology and choices to puzzle through, from premiums and co-pays, to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.\nA national survey by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that more than 70 percent of people surveyed after the last open enrollment period said they wanted one-on-one assistance enrolling in insurance coverage.\nThough her library is small, she says helping people find health insurance coverage is a logical extension of their mission in their community of 56,000 residents."}
