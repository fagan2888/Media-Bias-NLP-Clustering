Ted Cruz has twice as many people thinking negatively about him as liking him.\n\nWhile polls are a snap-shot in time, there is little good news in the poll for the Republican Party, which 53 percent of the public blames for the government shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, poll numbers for President Obama and the Democratic Party, while not winning any accolades, have remained stable. The Democratic Party favorability rating declined from 42 percent to 39 percent. Obama\u2019s approval ratings actually went up two points to 47 percent.\n\nIn addition, half of Americans are opposed to defunding Obamacare.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough bad news for Republicans, the favorable/unfavorable rankings are dismal. For the tea party, it\u2019s 21 percent/47 percent, the Republican Party is 24 percent/53 percent and Ted Cruz is 14 percent/28 percent.\n\nBut what does this mean for Texas politics? Certainly governor candidate Greg Abbott is closely aligned with Cruz. The senator\u2019s former boss has tweeted his support of Cruz\u2019 campaign to dismantle Obamacare.\n\nAnd Texas\u2019 strong conservative roots show little sign of weakness. At least that\u2019s what all the Republican statewide candidates are banking on. They have so far been unified in their opposition to in-state college tuition for noncitizens, anti-gay rights, anti-abortion and anti-Obamacare. The scramble has been on who can get the furthest right on those issues.\n\nBut the question becomes will the national antipathy to the government shutdown do any political harm to Texas congressional or statewide candidates? Or maybe the tourism ads are right, Texas is a whole other country.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC9wb2xsLXRlZC1jcnV6LWFuZC1nb3AtdGFraW5nLWh1Z2UtaGl0LWZyb20tc2h1dGRvd24uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christy Hoppe", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "A national NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Republican popularity at its lowest ebb and Texas Sen.
