Last month, three people were killed and nine wounded when Robert Lewis Dear opened fire at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.\n\nAt a court hearing this week, Dear blurted out that he was a \u201cwarrior for the babies\u201d and admitted his guilt. When he was arrested last month, Dear hinted that he may have been influenced by increasingly extreme anti-abortion rhetoric when he said \u201cno more baby parts.\u201d\n\nNo one was injured in Saturday\u2019s attack and the clinic was closed at the time.\n\n\u201cThis year has been one that\u2019s been filled with a lot of hateful and vile rhetoric, and I think that\u2019s creating a violent opposition to Planned Parenthood and to health care providers, and it needs to stop,\u201d Kogut told CBS St. Louis.\n\nJust days after the deadly Colorado Springs shooting, Congressional Republicans voted to defund Planned Parenthood in their ongoing efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a move the president is expected to veto.\n\nDear\u2019s attack came after Republican presidential nominee Carly Fiorina gave a graphic description of non-existent footage depicting a live fetus squirming while Planned Parenthood staffers dissected it. She was refering to heavily-edited and discredited videos released by anti-abortion propaganda group, Center for Medical Progress. The videos have given the GOP an opening to ramp up their battle against the women\u2019s health care provider.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/plannedparenthoodprotest-flickrusersmirk4-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Vandal strikes St. Louis Planned Parenthood in Saturday morning rock-throwing attack"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Planned parenthood protest (flickrusersmirk)Glass windows and a door at a Planned Parenthood facility in St. Louis, Missouri have been busted out in an apparent act of vandalism, St. Louis Public Radio reports.\nLast month, three people were killed and nine wounded when Robert Lewis Dear opened fire at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.\nDear\u2019s attack came after Republican presidential nominee Carly Fiorina gave a graphic description of non-existent footage depicting a live fetus squirming while Planned Parenthood staffers dissected it.\nThe videos have given the GOP an opening to ramp up their battle against the women\u2019s health care provider.\nThe windows and doors were shattered with rocks in what appears to be a targeted attack on the women\u2019s health facility on Saturday morning, Mary Kogut, head of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, to the radio station."}
