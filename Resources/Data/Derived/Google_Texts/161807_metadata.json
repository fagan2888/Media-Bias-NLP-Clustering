Benson\u2019s sexual orientation is given little fanfare \u2014 \u201ca footnote in a 316-page book,\u201d as he put it \u2014 in End of Discussion: How the Left\u2019s Outrage Industry Shuts Down Debate, Manipulates Voters, and Makes America Less Free (and Fun), which Benson co-authored with Mary Katharine Ham, a fellow Fox contributor.\n\nIf his book and job titles don\u2019t make things absolutely clear, Benson is a gay conservative. He\u2019s also someone who says he cares much more about \u201ca nuclearized Iran\u201d and \u201cthe failures of Obamacare\u201d than most gay issues. And while he said he doesn\u2019t think it especially matters that he\u2019s coming out, Benson was sitting down for an interview on precisely that topic. Rather than wait for the book\u2019s release, he decided to come out publicly before then, sitting down with BuzzFeed News recently to discuss the book, the Republican Party, and his life.\n\n\u201cGay rights is not something that dominates my attentions \u2014 or my passions \u2014 and that may seem incongruous, that may seem counterintuitive to a lot of people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the issues that I care about most undergird the reasons why I\u2019m a conservative and have been forever and will be a conservative moving forward.\u201d\n\nID: 5653789\n\nThe book will be published as the debate over religious liberty protections continues to dominate the presidential conversation around gay issues, something that Benson and Ham are aware of and tackle in the book. (The chapter of the book in which Benson comes out is titled, \u201cBake Me a Cake, Bigots.\u201d)\n\nMany conservatives have argued there must be a legal process for exemption from laws on the basis of religious belief. For his part, Benson argued that exact space between existence and participation is what has helped accelerate acceptance for marriages. The idea that same-sex couples\u2019 marriages wouldn\u2019t affect straight couples\u2019 marriages was \u201ca very effective argument that won over a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for civil marriage, I\u2019m for nondiscrimination laws \u2014 but I think there should be broad carve-outs for religious organizations, in particular, and narrow carve-outs for closely held businesses that serve the wedding industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the religious liberty debate has gained traction, proponents of the religious liberty side of the debate have faced pushback \u2014 sometimes against specific individuals or their businesses \u2014 leading many conservatives to argue, more broadly, that internet culture is too quick to punish dissenters. Ham and Benson address that issue in their book, as well.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of gay people have felt for generations, obviously, that they have not been treated fairly, and I don\u2019t think that coming to a point of social harmony and then pushing further in this almost vengeful, \u2018Let\u2019s get \u2018em,\u2019 hounding people out of jobs \u2026 [I]t\u2019s not productive, it\u2019s not good for the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue that most animated Benson, though, over the course of the 45-minute interview was the accusation sometimes made that gay Republicans must be self-hating people.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s extraordinarily closed-minded and betrays a lack of imagination, at the very least,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, he let out an extended soliloquy in defense of what is likely to be seen as a part of his public persona now.\n\n\u201cA free-thinking, free citizen of a free country is not obliged to be confined to a bedazzled ideological straitjacket because that\u2019s how they \u2018ought\u2019 to think and \u2018ought\u2019 to vote and \u2018ought\u2019 to rank their priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not true, it shouldn\u2019t be true, and I think part of liberty and tolerance and coexistence is understanding that, \u2018Hey, I might have something in common with this person over here, and they have every right under the sun to disagree with me on this whole panoply of public policy questions over here.\u2019 And if their views on those things lead them to another conclusion about how they exercise their right to vote, to jump to the conclusion that that is borne of some secret, deep-seated self-loathing is just lazy and boring.\n\n\u201cAnd false.\u201d\n\nBenson knows there will be some conservatives, as well, who question him now. To them, he said he would just direct them to all that he\u2019s written and said since he was in college at Northwestern University. \u201cI do my best to shrug it off and just go on living my life.\u201d\n\nAnd, despite the disagreements Benson likely will have with some gay liberals, he acknowledges the importance of the progress that has been made on gay rights.\n\n\u201cI do not lose sight of how historically fortunate I am to be living in this country in this era, given who I am,\u201d he said. As for his own path, he explained, \u201cThis is the final stage for me, personally, on this journey, where I have been incredibly fortunate to have been able to undertake each step of this process completely on my own terms.\u201d\n\nAnd now, he felt that it was time to let people know that his voice \u2014 already a part of the political discussion \u2014 was that of a gay man.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re writing about it in the book, I did not want to cede control of that information to someone else,\u201d he explained. He wanted to talk about this himself, rather than someone else, because he didn\u2019t want it \u201cto seem as though I was hiding or being untruthful or ashamed \u2014 and that hasn\u2019t been my mentality at all. So, for a number of reasons, it seemed like the time had arrived and this is how we did it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also, he acknowledged, a key time for his party on LGBT issues. Most notably, the Supreme Court will soon rule on a set of marriage and marriage-recognition cases, and is expected to rule bans on those marriages unconstitutional. \u201cI think the party is in a state of flux, with deep disagreements \u2014 rooted in many cases, but not all, generationally \u2014 and that is a political dilemma at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nBenson also acknowledged the base of the party largely remains opposed to issues like marriage equality, which he and Ham both support. And he noted the political reasons for why that opposition remains the default in the Republican Party. \u201cYou need that base, you need your core voters to turn out to win elections,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of those who oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples \u201care not bigots.\u201d\n\nOn the other end, he said, \u201cYou also, if you\u2019re the party, have to look to the future and worry about this type of issue being one of those threshold issues for a lot of young people, where it is a barrier to entry to the party\u201d \u2014 people who would otherwise consider Republican candidates but won\u2019t \u201cso long as their party is discriminating against my brother, who\u2019s gay, or my dear friend who is gay.\u201d\n\nCalling that \u201ca real obstacle,\u201d Benson said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a quick fix to that.\u201d He added that he\u2019s been watching the responses to the \u201cwould you attend a same-sex wedding\u201d question, calling the affirmative answers from some candidates \u201ca softening, without conceding the policy question.\u201d\n\nBenson distanced himself, slightly, from those obstacles \u2014 but left the door open for more involvement going forward.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m as fascinated as anyone to see how it plays out. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to become particularly activist on any of this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom time to time\u2014\u201d he stopped. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3770179, "userid": 315836}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Guy Benson is gay, but he doesn't really think that matters.
