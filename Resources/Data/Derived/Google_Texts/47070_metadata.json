Absolutely, because I know what it means to consumers.\u201d\n\nSince almost nine in 10 Americans shopping for health insurance plans on the ACA exchange receive financial assistance, most of them would not actually see a particularly drastic price increase.\n\nWhen proposing new rates for 2016, insurers have to justify why they are seeking price increases. It is then up to the state insurance regulators to determine if the rate increases are justified or not.\n\nRelated: Obamacare ruling: what about the 35 million people who are still uninsured?\n\nAaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the ACA, told CNBC that the law increases competition for consumers, since they can shop around for the best deals.\n\n\u201cLast year, more than half of re-enrolling customers on HealthCare.gov actively shopped and selected a new plan, something that wasn\u2019t possible for many consumers prior to the ACA due to the risk of being charged a higher premium or denied coverage entirely due to a pre-existing condition,\u201d Albright explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsumers will find a range of quality, affordable coverage options on the marketplace in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe thinking goes that in order to stay competitive, health insurance plans will keep their rate hikes low.\n\nInstead of hoping that competition will keep the rates down, Wisconsin Democrats have introduced a bill designed to do so. Currently, there are six health insurance companies are seeking rate increases between 10% and 33% on the Wisconsin-listed plans. It is unlikely that the bill will pass through the state legislature, which is currently controlled by a Republican majority.\n\nSo far, some of the highest reported approved rate hikes have been the 36% rate hike for BlueCross BlueShield in Tennessee, a 26% rate hike for CareFirst insurance plans in Maryland and 25% rate hikes for Kentucky HealthCooperative plans in Kentucky and Moda Health plans in Oregon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Some states have already approved hikes as high as 36% as firms seek increases for a third of the health insurance plans listed on the Obamacare exchange", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Some states have already approved hikes as high as 36% as firms seek increases for a third of the health insurance plans listed on the Obamacare exchange", "title": "Health insurers seek double-digit rate hikes for 2016, report finds", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/05/obamacare-health-insurance-rate-increases-2016", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89a544281bf5d57ed0e9935b40b58eb87e1792f/0_0_4962_2977/master/4962.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=0a536029d161f2c6c225f24defa7db9b", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/05/obamacare-health-insurance-rate-increases-2016?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/05/obamacare-health-insurance-rate-increases-2016", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/05/obamacare-health-insurance-rate-increases-2016?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@kasperka", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b89a544281bf5d57ed0e9935b40b58eb87e1792f/0_0_4962_2977/master/4962.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/05/obamacare-health-insurance-rate-increases-2016?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US healthcare,Obama administration,Insurance industry,Healthcare industry,Barack Obama,Health insurance,Business,Money,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-09-05T17:17:04.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jana-kasperkevic", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-09-05T18:59:21.000Z", "tag": "US healthcare,Obama administration,Insurance industry,Healthcare industry,Barack Obama,Health insurance,Business,Money,US news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89a544281bf5d57ed0e9935b40b58eb87e1792f/0_0_4962_2977/4962.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=7ff259675480a4551feb58c4b2b951fe", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US healthcare,Obama administration,Insurance industry,Healthcare industry,Barack Obama,Health insurance,Business,Money,US news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd148\"", "article_summary": "US insurers have asked for double-digit increases for about third of the health insurance plans listed on the national healthcare exchange, a report has found.\nSo far, some of the highest reported approved rate hikes have been the 36% rate hike for BlueCross BlueShield in Tennessee, a 26% rate hike for CareFirst insurance plans in Maryland and 25% rate hikes for Kentucky HealthCooperative plans in Kentucky and Moda Health plans in Oregon.\nThe AgileHeathInsurance.com report found that 7% of plans sold on the exchange have proposed a rate increase of at least 30%, and 14% of the plans have proposed a rate increase of at least 20%.\nCurrently, there are six health insurance companies are seeking rate increases between 10% and 33% on the Wisconsin-listed plans.\n\u201cConsumers will find a range of quality, affordable coverage options on the marketplace in 2016.\u201dThe thinking goes that in order to stay competitive, health insurance plans will keep their rate hikes low."}
