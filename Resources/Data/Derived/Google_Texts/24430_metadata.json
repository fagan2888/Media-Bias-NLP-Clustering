Paul LePage and a caller on MPBN\u2019s \u201cMaine Calling\u201d on Monday.\n\nThe main point of confusion seemed to be around existing eligibility for childless adults under Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for low-income people.\n\nMaine is one of 19 states that hasn\u2019t expanded Medicaid for under the federal Affordable Care Act. This expansion was a main part of the health care law passed in 2010, but a later Supreme Court decision made expansion optional for states and LePage has vetoed it five times, citing cost.\n\nOne of his biggest gripes with expansion has been that it would cover an estimated 55,000 childless adults. His administration has pushed other changes that cut Medicaid to 14,500 parents and approximately 10,000 childless adults at 2013\u2019s end.\n\nIn Maine and other states that haven\u2019t expanded, childless adults making less than 100 percent of the federal poverty mark of roughly $12,000 fall into a gap in the law, not qualifying for Medicaid or subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act reserved for people making between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level.\n\nModerator Jennifer Rooks vaguely pressed LePage on that gap, after which he said that expansion wouldn\u2019t help that population. It led into an exchange with a caller who seemed to be a childless adult who said she didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re disabled or pregnant, you can get Medicaid in Maine but otherwise, you cannot,\u201d the caller said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d LePage replied.\n\nBut it is, for the most part. Maine covers pregnant women under Medicaid at up to 209 percent of the federal poverty level and children are also covered, while people with disabilities can get Social Security benefits. Childless adults otherwise aren\u2019t covered, which LePage acknowledges at the end of the exchange with the caller.\n\nErika Ziller, a professor who focuses on health care at the University of Southern Maine\u2019s Muskie School of Public Service, said LePage \u201cappears to be mistaken on several points\u201d in the interview.\n\nThat included the exchange about childless adults and a claim that Maine wouldn\u2019t qualify for the same match for expansion that the federal government is offering other states \u2014 100 percent of costs for the first three years and 90 percent later.\n\nThis is true for one expansion segment \u2014 parents between 100 percent and 138 percent of the poverty level would only qualify for a 62 percent match because Maine expanded Medicaid in the early 2000s.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Samantha Edwards said LePage was \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d on that population. However, Maine would get the higher rate on childless adults, as was outlined in a 2014 letter from the Obama administration.\n\nZiller said \u201cit\u2019s not clear\u201d exactly what Maine\u2019s match would like because of past expansions and delayed expansion, but \u201cif Maine were seriously considering expansion then we could negotiate some of these points.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal government has shown a willingness to be flexible with states \u2014 we just haven\u2019t tried,\u201d she said. \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nMaine GOP hits McCabe for post outing (alleged) litterer\n\nA top legislative Democrat was criticized by the Maine Republican Party on Monday for a Facebook post containing personal information of a woman whose trash he found on the ground near his home.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, posted a picture of a hospital bracelet with the name of a Skowhegan woman, her phone number, her age and her doctor, telling anyone who sees her to \u201ctell her no littering on Malbons Mills Rd.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Maine Republican Party said McCabe endangered her, leaving her vulnerable to \u201cburglars seeking prescription medication, to scammers or potential individuals seeking to do her harm.\u201d McCabe is running a crucial 2016 race against incumbent state Sen. Rodney Whittemore, R-Skowhegan.\n\nThe woman, who the Bangor Daily News isn\u2019t identifying, said she left the bracelet on the dashboard of her vehicle with the window open and it blew out. She seemed less upset about the disclosure of her information than about her reputation.\n\n\u201cIt upsets me that he\u2019d put that out there because I don\u2019t throw things out the window,\u201d she said of McCabe, who called her to discuss it.\n\nReached while he was at Home Depot buying a trash picker, McCabe, who works for the Northern Forest Canoe Trail as an outreach coordinator, said he spends a lot of his free time picking up trash around his home, a rental property of his and at natural sites and said litter has \u201conly increased.\u201d\n\nHe posted another littered receipt with a phone number on Monday, and he said he\u2019s done it to draw attention to the problem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty honest guy and I don\u2019t sugarcoat things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou throw your trash on the ground, you know, I\u2019m probably going to call you on it.\u201d \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nQuick hits\n\nLePage will be in Bangor for his next town hall meeting on Wednesday, which will be at the William S. Cohen School on Garland Street from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nIf you want to change your party to vote in Maine\u2019s primary election on June 14, you\u2019ve got to do so by May 27 in most places, according to Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap\u2019s office. Unenrolled voters can enroll in a party up until Election Day. \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nReading list\n\nBest of Maine\u2019s Craigslist\n\nA \u201cslender, extremely fit vegetarian\u201d from Waldo County who calls himself the \u201ccoolest old Christian\u201d around and got arrested at a California nuclear plant with Jackson Browne in 1981 is recently single. \u201cThese are the end times for sure,\u201d he says, so \u201can RV and a physically sensual active wife sounds perfect to me.\u201d\n\nWhat a beautiful ode to love: \u201cWhen ever I hear from you I feel like my heart has become a glittering Pegasus and is gonna fly out of my chest. I want a billion of your babies and to be married by a Neal Diamond impersonator.\u201d \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "State & Capitol", "description": "Good morning from Augusta, where today's round-up starts with a confusing exchange on Medicaid expansion between Gov.
