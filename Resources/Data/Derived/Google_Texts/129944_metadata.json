We're reprinting this article on Edwards's attempted comeback, which originally appeared in the issue dated July 28, 2014, below.\n\nGonzales, La.\n\nThe last time I saw Edwin Edwards, he was breaking the law. It was 14 years ago, in the cafeteria of the Russell B. Long federal courthouse in Baton Rouge, where a portrait of Russell\u2019s dad Huey\u2014the Kingfish himself\u2014kept watch over the lobby. At the building\u2019s ribbon-cutting several years earlier, Edwards, who was then in the last of his four nonconsecutive terms as emperor/governor of Louisiana (and who is now running for Congress), had joked that the ceremony was \u201cmy first invitation to a federal courthouse not delivered by U.S. marshals.\u201d\n\nLike all his best lines\u2014and Edwards always had the best lines (on his electoral chances: The only way I can lose . . . is if I\u2019m caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy; on his deliberative competitor: Dave Treen is so slow, it takes him an hour-and-a-half to watch 60 Minutes)\u2014the one at his courthouse christening was dark, perfectly timed, and rooted in truth.\n\nBy early 2000, though, the joke was on Edwards. Claiming he was the victim of a political witch hunt, he had slipped the feds for decades in over a dozen grand jury probes. He\u2019d even won two jury acquittals during the \u201980s for the same alleged hospital-contracts scheme. But Edwards was finally on trial with six codefendants, including his son Stephen, for improperly influencing the disbursement of state riverboat casino licenses after leaving office. He was offered a plea deal which for only a year in prison would\u2019ve let Stephen walk (his son told his dad he\u2019d blow his brains out if dad capitulated). As an ice-water craps player who earned millions at Vegas gaming tables, often raising eyebrows by hauling cases full of cash to and from the governor\u2019s mansion, Edwards rolled the dice.\n\nMany Edwards-watchers found it peculiar that the law was finally closing in on Edwards, a populist Democrat in the Long tradition, for selling an office that he no longer owned. If you bug-zapped all the parasites who buy and sell influence in Washington, the city would fast resemble a postapocalyptic moonscape. And in graft-riddled Louisiana, where a large swath of elected officials have historically proven amenable to under-the-table remuneration, many considered Edwards\u2019s activities to be run-of-the-mill lobbying. Besides, Republican Mike Foster had already replaced Edwards as governor. How much influence did Edwards have to peddle with a state gaming board he hadn\u2019t appointed?\n\nThe feds had surreptitiously wired Edwards\u2019s life\u2014reportedly tapping even his bedroom, and perhaps giving them a salacious soundtrack. (The unapologetic womanizer once said the only thing he had in common with his electoral opponent David Duke, a former KKK member, was that \u201cwe are both wizards under the sheets.\u201d) With 26,000 recorded conversations, there was no indisputable smoking gun. But the prosecution trotted out all manner of curiosities and a large cast of costars\u2014large dollar figures scribbled on cocktail napkins, huge sums of cash stashed in ash bins or duck carcasses, heavy-breathing from codefendants wondering about people being wired\u2014that kept everyone awake during a four-month trial. (Except the juror who was dismissed for sleeping.)\n\nBoth a fierce verbal jouster and wily former country lawyer (he was born the dirt-poor son of a sharecropper in Cajun country), Edwards never did himself many favors in the looking blameless department. In a turn that largely endeared him to the public while enraging his antagonists, Edwin habitually goosed his own outlaw image. Once, upon hearing that some jurors in his mid-\u201980s trial had stolen towels from the hotel where they were sequestered, he deadpanned, \u201cI have been judged by a jury of my peers.\u201d\n\nThis was a ploy straight out of the Longs\u2019 populist playbook. Edwards as governor was never as dictatorial or demonstrably crooked as Huey, who hired and fired LSU football coaches and insisted state employees kick 10 percent of their salaries back to his \u201cdeduct box.\u201d Nor did he run as hot-blooded and crazy as Huey\u2019s brother, Earl, who kept his political machine chugging along from a mental hospital in Mandeville, after his own wife, Miz Blanche, had him committed, possibly out of vengeance for Earl\u2019s publicly squiring a stripper. But Edwards absorbed the lessons of their appeal: Stand up for the little guy, and don\u2019t be afraid to kick the big guy in the shorts. (Numerically, there are a lot more little guys than big guys who vote.) Tap the oil and gas companies in the carotid artery, and keep the revenue stream flowing. Keep the people swimming in gravy, from roads and bridges to hot school lunches to patronage jobs, patronage being right up there with shrimping and oil refining as one of the state\u2019s leading industries.\n\nAbove all, keep the masses entertained. Do that, and they\u2019ll forgive many of your shortcomings, even if they occasionally switch you out for a goody-two-shoes reformer, an infatuation that never lasts long. As Uncle Earl once prophesied: \u201cSomeday, Louisiana is gonna get good government, and they ain\u2019t gonna like it.\u201d With a recent Justice Department study reporting Louisiana is still top-of-the-pile in corruption convictions over the last decade, it doesn\u2019t look like that day\u2019s dawning is an imminent threat.\n\nBut aside from being a savvy knife-fighter, compromise-forger, and able administrator who accomplished much, particularly in his first two terms in the \u201970s before the state\u2019s finances became tougher sledding (balancing budgets, streamlining bureaucracy, rewriting the state\u2019s convoluted constitution), Edwards had a visceral appeal that seemed to spring from letting the electorate in on the joke. If many of us have lost faith in public servants, thinking of them as self-dealing grifters, Edwards\u2019s black-humored one-liners (If we don\u2019t get Dave Treen out of office, there won\u2019t be anything left to steal) pulled back the curtain on the kabuki theater. As his bitter rival Duke once said, \u201cHe was devoid of principle, but at least he was honest about it.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to the courthouse cafeteria in Baton Rouge, where I watched Edwards break the law, and served as an accomplice. Just weeks before the verdict came down, Judge Frank Polozola had taken away one of Edwards\u2019s greatest weapons\u2014his gift of gab. The judge was nicknamed The Ayatollah for his autocratic manner, yelling at reporters for tromping through courthouse flower beds, and screaming at defense lawyers that if they kept snickering they\u2019d \u201cbe taken out of here in handcuffs. I don\u2019t care if you hate my guts, you\u2019re stuck with me!\u201d The Ayatollah placed Edwards under a gag order, effectively barring him from doing interviews.\n\nEver willing to help someone shed the yoke of judicial tyranny, I\u2019d convinced Edwards to allow me to shadow him, so long as I embargoed the piece until after the verdict. After all, what could The Ayatollah do then? Send him to jail? He was likely headed there anyway.\n\nIn the cafeteria, Edwards sat at a table, forking his eggs and grits, attempting to chat while prosecutors circled like sharks. As I was busily taking notes, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t be seen talking to you while you\u2019re writing.\u201d I folded my notebook, thinking that was the end of that session. But Edwards instead instructed me, \u201cDrop it in your lap,\u201d and we commenced.\n\nFinally thinking that too dangerous\u2014The Ayatollah\u2019s walls had eyes\u2014Edwards commanded, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the car.\u201d We adjourned to the Durango of one of his adult daughters, the two of them sitting in the backseat, until one of them, Victoria, a former actress and showgirl, said, \u201cDaddy, why don\u2019t we take a ride?\u201d As we tooled around Baton Rouge, Edwards chatting away in merry contempt of the gag order, we drove past the great big governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cThat\u2019s where I used to live,\u201d Victoria chirped.\n\nA few weeks later, after The Ayatollah had dismissed another juror during deliberations under mysterious circumstances (one who\u2019d thought the government hadn\u2019t made its case and who would\u2019ve hung the jury had he been allowed to stay), 11 jurors came back with a guilty verdict, dinging Edwards on 17 counts of money-laundering, racketeering, conspiracy, and extortion.\n\nFacing a 10-year sentence, Edwards would spend the better part of the next decade living in a big house of another sort.\n\nI head down I-10 to Gonzales, about 25 miles south of Baton Rouge, where Edwards now lives in a golf course community with his third wife, Trina, whom he met when she started writing him in prison. In March, Edwards announced to the surprise of many that he was running for Congress in Louisiana\u2019s 6th District, a seat being vacated by Republican Bill Cassidy, who is running for the Senate against Mary Landrieu. I am due to meet Edwin at his house, so we can head to a campaign fundraiser in Morgan City on the Cajun Coast.\n\nBut that\u2019s a bit of a trick. Louisiana\u2019s been pounded with rain for the last 12 hours, taking on more water than it did during Katrina. Cow pastures now are duck ponds. The Do Right Full Gospel Church looks more like Noah\u2019s Ark, its parking lot having turned into a swamp. I get within a few blocks of the house, but half his neighborhood is a water hazard. When the water smacks up to the door of my sad, rented Chevy Cruze, which is pushing its wake into low-lying neighbors\u2019 living rooms, I give up the fight, call Edwards, and tell him the car\u2019s not going to make it. He instructs me to head to a nearby grocery store, where he\u2019ll pick me up in a higher-sitting truck.\n\nForty minutes later, Edwin rolls up in a Silverado, his friend Darren, a chemical salesman, serving as driver. (Edwards\u2019s campaign is lean and mean\u2014at the time of my visit, he has no campaign manager, no press secretary, he runs his own schedule out of a notebook and has only two staffers, one of them his wife, who is assistant treasurer.) Before I can say hello, the 86-year-old has dashed off into the grocery store to pick up prescriptions like a dutiful senior citizen.\n\nI am glad to see Edwards again, and not just because he has four-wheel drive. I\u2019d figured the last time I saw him would be the last time I saw him. Before going to prison, feeling uncharacteristically morose, Edwin told me he figured he had 6 to 10 years left of \u201cbiblically allotted time.\u201d But here we are a decade and a half later.\n\nHaving neither shanked anyone in the prison shower, nor forced fellow inmates to buy a riverboat casino license, Edwards earned an early release in 2011, after serving eight years. The Silver Fox is whiter on top these days, sports hearing aids and is nearly deaf without them, and his satiny Cajun lilt sounds wispier. Other than that, he\u2019s in fine fettle, and still quick as a jackrabbit mentally.\n\nThe last time I saw him, the man who used to cruise LSU\u2019s sorority row in the gubernatorial limo was married to Candy, a comely blonde then 35 years old. They divorced while he was in prison. Now, he\u2019s married to Trina, a comely blonde who is 35 years old. Edwards puts me in mind of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character Wooderson in Dazed and Confused, the graduate who kept returning, saying that\u2019s what he loved about high-school girls: \u201cI keep getting older, they stay the same age.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t likely to trade Trina in for a new 35-year-old anytime soon, however. They have a bond, besides the very short-lived A&E reality show they starred in, The Governor\u2019s Wife. After remembering that Edwin had some sperm frozen when trying to get a vasectomy reversed in the \u201990s, they discovered his deposit still got the job done. Trina underwent in vitro, and, voil\u00e0\u2014they now have 10-month-old baby Eli.\n\nEdwards admits he was off on his actuarial projections, though he\u2019s unrepentant for not yet being dead. Once in prison, he doggedly decided he was going to come out whole. Upon his conviction, he\u2019d said, \u201cThe Chinese have a saying that if you sit by the river long enough, the dead body of your enemy will come floating down the river.\u201d He was talking about his own body, washing right into the feds\u2019 gill-net.\n\nBut lately, he\u2019s been the one sitting by the river, having outlasted most of his antagonists. The U.S. attorney who spearheaded Edwards\u2019s takedown, Eddie Jordan, resigned when pressure built for, among other sins, being found liable by a federal jury for firing 42 white employees and replacing them with his fellow African Americans after he\u2019d become district attorney of Orleans Parish. The Ayatollah passed last year at 71. \u201cThe judge is looking up at us from where he is, now,\u201d Edwards deadpans.\n\nThen there was John Maginnis, the gimlet-eyed dean of the Louisiana press corps, who, while amused by Edwards, reliably strafed him. I tell Edwards I\u2019d planned on inviting Maginnis out for drinks while visiting. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll reach him,\u201d Edwards cracks. \u201cI know,\u201d I say, having discovered that Maginnis died at the age of 66 on the very morning I tried to Google his contact info.\n\n\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d Edwards says dryly, \u201cdon\u2019t Google me.\u201d\n\nBut neither does Edwards think himself invincible. He knows what\u2019s coming. Looking out across the gray marshlands as rain pounds the truck windshield, Edwards says, \u201cI\u2019m too far from the womb and too close to the tomb not to realize that death sits on my shoulder. Every time I look at [Trina and Baby Eli], I just wish I could look forward to seeing him graduate from school. I realize that\u2019s unrealistic. But I\u2019m going to tell you this: In the short time I\u2019m going to be with them, I\u2019m going to give them more attention and love than a lot of children get from lifelong parents.\u201d\n\nAlways a hard-charger, Edwin doesn\u2019t spend much time brooding about loss. He\u2019d never want to go back, but prison wasn\u2019t so bad, he says. He\u2019d resided in two facilities, first in Fort Worth, then in Oakdale, Louisiana. Things got considerably better when he moved closer to home. \u201cThey understand Cajun cooking\u2014the food was much better than in Fort Worth.\u201d He was prison librarian and de facto jailhouse lawyer, helping other prisoners deal with power-of-attorney issues and other tangles. \u201cI tried to do what I could to make life a little better for them, because in doing that, it made me feel like I still had a purpose in there.\u201d\n\nBut like any good gambler who comes up short, he also keeps track of what\u2019s gone. People who accuse his new wife of being a gold-digger are barking up the wrong tree. \u201cShe may be a gold-digger, but all she got was the shaft,\u201d Edwin says, seeing as how there\u2019s not much gold left to dig.\n\nHe gets by just fine. He made some smart real-estate decisions and gives paid speeches now, all over Louisiana. His 611-page authorized biography, written and exhaustively researched by Leo Honeycutt, a former Baton Rouge television anchor who used to cover Edwards, often adversarially, has been a local bestseller for a half-decade. (To both Edwards\u2019s and Honeycutt\u2019s credit, the book is no whitewash, containing the good, the bad, and the ugly, right down to the worst of the wiretap transcripts and Edwards\u2019s unfaithfulness to his first wife, Elaine.) But neither of those, nor the reality show, had much reach beyond state borders. As A. J. Liebling once wrote of the Longs, \u201cSouthern political personalities, like sweet corn, travel badly. They lose flavor with every hundred yards away from the patch.\u201d\n\nSo the losses have mounted, too. \u201cThe trial cost me $1.8 million in forfeiture, then the $250,000 fine,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI had to pay taxes on about $300,000 of money I never got.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had to pay taxes on money you say you never extorted? That\u2019s gotta hurt,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah, it hurts,\u201d winces Edwards. Though we can laugh about it, now. At least I can.\n\nHe adds that he had a roughly $2 million legal tab between him and his son\u2014\u201cI paid everything.\u201d The least he could do, since he figured his son wouldn\u2019t have gone to jail if he hadn\u2019t been related to the U.S. attorney\u2019s favorite target. And then of course, there were the friends who died while he was in prison. \u201cThirty-four,\u201d he says without missing a beat, but who\u2019s counting? His sister and oldest brother died while he was in the joint. He made one of the funerals, the other was too hard to arrange with the authorities. When Harry \u201cChinese Cowboy\u201d Lee, the legendary Jefferson Parish sheriff, kicked, Edwards recorded a eulogy from prison, having promised he\u2019d give one.\n\nHe used to love to hunt, especially elk by horseback in the mountains. \u201cBut convicted felons cannot possess and use firearms,\u201d he says. So he donated his 260 guns to Ducks Unlimited, which they auctioned off for a quarter of a million dollars to build more duck habitat. Neither does he gamble anymore. Not because the law forbids it, but because \u201cI don\u2019t have any money that I can afford to lose. I don\u2019t gamble for fun, I gamble to earn.\u201d And he was a serious earner at the craps table, he lets me know.\n\nBesides being a child of the Depression, whose father didn\u2019t trust banks, it\u2019s why Edwards constantly dealt in large sums of cash, he claims. \u201cThey paid me in cash when I won, and I paid them in cash when I lost.\u201d But he won more than he lost. To prove he\u2019s not bluffing, he says, \u201cMy income tax records [during the nine years he produced for the trial] show that I reported and paid taxes on $1,900,000 in gambling winnings. Now you\u2019re lookin\u2019 at a fella that ain\u2019t gonna pay no taxes on gambling winnings that I didn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nWe spend some time relitigating the fine points of the trial, which I won\u2019t replicate here. Edwards, ever the skillful lawyer, has mastered the arcana, but it\u2019s too detailed and tortuous to explain. Besides, I figure Edwards, guilty or innocent, paid his debt with interest. Even John Maginnis wrote, years before Edwards was released, that \u201csix years in the pen is ample punishment for the Justice Department\u2019s tortured theory of his crime.\u201d Not to mention, Maginnis added, that the judge \u201cpiled on by giving Edwards more time than the sentencing guidelines called for.\u201d\n\nBut generally speaking, I\u2019m still curious. Does Edwards, who benefited from a civic-minded bumper sticker when running against the racist Duke that said, \u201cVote for the Crook, It\u2019s Important,\u201d consider himself an honest man? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says, without hesitation. In fact, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t go around telling people I\u2019m innocent. But I will tell you I\u2019m not guilty of what the trial was about. The record\u2019s there for anybody to see. And contrary to the opinion of some, it had nothing to do with my role as governor. It had nothing to do with being bribed or using improper influence in my office or selling riverboat licenses. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I repeat ad nauseam, it had nothing to do with what I did or didn\u2019t do as governor.\u201d\n\nOkay, fine, I say, seizing on the first part of his answer. \u201cSo what aren\u2019t you innocent of?\u201d Edwards laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to tell anybody that I\u2019m innocent of everything, but I\u2019m not going to tell you what I think I\u2019m not innocent of because I don\u2019t have that feeling about myself. I\u2019m not one of those people who go around telling others how wonderful and honest I am. I am what I am. And everybody should judge me based upon his or her dealings with me. Not based on what some reporter from New York wrote about me.\u201d\n\nAn interesting answer. In some ways, it\u2019s a brilliant one, managing to be honest and slippery. It recalls something Edwards said on the stand during his trial, which might\u2019ve even made The Ayatollah laugh. When asked if he was lying, he said, \u201cNo. And if I were, you\u2019ve got to assume that I wouldn\u2019t be telling you.\u201d\n\nWhie Edwards\u2019s last campaign was two decades ago, he doesn\u2019t appear to be suffering ring-rust at his fundraiser. Watching him work a catering hall in Morgan City is kind of like watching Elvis return to Graceland. He innocently flirts with older women in French, and younger women in English. He remembers who smokes and whose daddy worked where and minute details he should have forgotten years ago. Like supporters during his four terms, the crowd here is a total grab-bag: black and white, fisherman and oil worker and realtor and Chamber of Commerce burgher, and even an Elvis impersonator from Elvis\u2019s fat-ass, late-Vegas stage, with whom I put away a plate or three of spicy Natchitoches meat pies.\n\nA former state representative who lost her election due to scandal like a good native tells me how the legislature has gone to seed since Edwin left the big chair\u2014hyper-partisan, dog-eat-dog, and every man a king in the worst possible way. Back in Edwards\u2019s day, as everyone from hard-bitten journalists to pols on both sides to constituents will tell you, the governor\u2019s mansion didn\u2019t even have a fence. (Unlike now, with Bobby Jindal, who doesn\u2019t need one since he\u2019s always off seeding his future presidential run.) All of the above were frequently invited in to sit at Edwin\u2019s table, where you might watch him eat a whole sweet potato with his hands, while he listened to your plaint. Not for nothing did Edwards regularly land at or near the top of favorite Louisiana governor polls even while he was in prison. (Jindal\u2019s last year of disapproval ratings rank slightly above al Qaeda\u2019s.) A guy running for district judge tells me, \u201cThe only thing the governor [Edwards, not Jindal] is carrying is his baggage, you know? Were it not for that, I wouldn\u2019t even see a race, to tell you the truth.\u201d\n\nA middle-aged marine-welding-company manager with a thick Cajun accent, nicknamed \u201cNoonie,\u201d tells me about hanging signs for Edwards when he was kid in an early campaign until 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, so that when \u201cpeople woke up, it looked like Edwards had diarrhea all over Morgan City.\u201d Noonie once saw Edwards during a parade\u2014maybe the Shrimp and Petroleum Festival. This was during a time when race relations could still get a little testy in Louisiana, which never bothered Edwin, who\u2019d gone to the mattresses for blacks since his earliest days. But when Edwards\u2019s car arrived in front of a corner liquor store where 200 or so blacks were assembled, Noonie says, \u201cSome girl is yellin\u2019, \u2018Edwin! Edwin!\u2019 He jumped out of the convertible, kiss that girl on the lips, and took a big ol\u2019 swig of her bottle of liquor. Give it back to her, and got in the car. A black girl! In front of all those people!\u201d\n\nI point out that Edwin is a teetotaler\u2014alcohol being the one vice that never turned his head. But Noonie shrugs: \u201cPull the lever, baby! He do what he had to do to win.\u201d\n\nNoonie is on a roll, and I\u2019m afraid to stop him. Regarding Edwin\u2019s troubles, Noonie gives his considered legal opinion, though I should stress he is not an attorney: \u201cHe told them to f\u2014 themselves! It\u2019s called BIG BALLS! That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Where\u2019s your pride at, as a man? You know? He stood up for my grandparents that didn\u2019t have nothin\u2019\u2014fishermen who didn\u2019t have s\u2014. Him right there.\u201d\n\nI even hear Edwards\u2019s hosannas sung by a Republican who has slipped in under the radar and has a blank check in his backpocket. He intends to sign it in his wife\u2019s name so his Republican family doesn\u2019t find out. I ask him what the appeal is, since he admits he never votes for Democrats, and can\u2019t, even now, since he doesn\u2019t live in Edwin\u2019s district. \u201cI\u2019m here to see the man, that\u2019s it,\u201d says the Republican. \u201cTo see him is like seeing Elvis. You may not like Elvis\u2019s music, but you\u2019re gonna see him, because he\u2019s Elvis.\u201d\n\nI call Elvis over (Edwin, that is, not the impersonator guarding my meat pies) to give the man a thrill. I explain his situation to Edwards, trusting he\u2019ll be touched. Instead, Edwards looks possum-eyed at the Republican, then at me, and says, \u201cShut up and get the check!\u201d\n\nUnlike the Longs, Edwards doesn\u2019t approach the mike as though it\u2019s on fire and he\u2019s trying to blow it out. But he does have their seat-of-the-pants spontaneity. He never prepares speeches, and often doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s speaking at all. But he can speak fluently for hours on just about any topic, never looking at a note. And as an old populist pro, he knows how to ring the dinner bell.\n\nHe admits to the crowd straightaway that Morgan City is not in his district, but that shouldn\u2019t matter, since \u201cmoney don\u2019t know where it came from . . . and I\u2019ll spend it in the 6th District for your benefit.\u201d He sings hyperlocal songs, such as the need to keep the Mississippi River dredged to accommodate oceangoing vessels. And for a homer crowd, he goes unpredictably omni-partisan. Like any self-respecting Democrat, he knocks the Tea Party for extremism but confesses his new wife is a Republican. \u201cAfter 86 years of being a Democrat, I found something good to do with Republicans\u2014sleep with them!\u201d he says to wild applause.\n\nHe adds that he\u2019d have voted for Obama in 2008 but didn\u2019t, \u201cbecause where I was at the time, there were no voting machines.\u201d He then proceeds to flay Obama for everything from keeping troops in Afghanistan to bunging up the Keystone pipeline, which Louisiana could benefit from. If we don\u2019t run the oil down here, he asserts, the Canadians will just sell it to the Chinese, who\u2019ll use it to make cheap oil-based goods like Mardi Gras beads, selling it right back to Louisianans at marked-up prices. Edwards is for covering the poor. But while upbraiding Republicans for trying to sink Obamacare, which is the law of the land and has many fine points like coverage for preexisting conditions, he then proceeds to bash the hell out of it, asserting how necessary it is to gut its worst features, from restricted doctor-choice to crippling small business with its requirements.\n\nThese are all good practice-cuts to take, since Edwards is running in a solidly Republican district. Earlier in the evening, he held forth to me in front of several people on how while he believes, as a child of the Depression, that government should help those who can\u2019t help themselves, the whole South has become Republican because Nancy Pelosi and many national Democrats \u201cwant government to be the answer for everything, and it can\u2019t be. . . . People need self-pride . . . government should be a helping hand, not a handout.\u201d For a second, I think I hear the Kingfish rolling over in his grave. But Edwards\u2019s Democratic audience is eating it up, too. For a flaming yellow-dog populist, he appears to be what these days has become a filthy word\u2014a moderate. A man you can do business with, and not just if you need a riverboat casino license.\n\nWarming to the mike, Edwards gets even more expansive, sweeping in libertarians and family-values types in one fell swoop. \u201cI\u2019m running on family values,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you right now, I\u2019m not one of those people who wants to tell you what to do. What church to go to . . . what happens in your bedroom. I\u2019m not interested in that, and it\u2019s not my job. I\u2019m not running to be a preacher or a priest. I\u2019m running to be a congressman. Now yes, I\u2019m running on family values. But you know what family values is? It\u2019s an 86-year-old man getting up at five in the morning to change the diaper of his 10-month-old child. That\u2019s family values.\u201d\n\nScrew Congress\u2014the crowd is ready to reelect him Emperor of Louisiana.\n\nBack in the truck on the way to Gonzales, Edwards rides shotgun holding a banker\u2019s envelope with a fat stack of checks. It feels kind of like old times, or would, if the FEC let him take it in cash. Edwards can no longer hunt and gamble, and though he lives in a golf-course community, he\u2019s played only once in three years. He mainly just rides Eli around in a golf cart, which the youngster loves to do all day. He\u2019s even too old and too happy with his new wife to womanize. Politics is his one remaining vice.\n\nSo as the rain assaults us, we drill down on his campaign. During the LBJ and Nixon eras, Edwards was a three-term congressman, starting out strong, but racking up a pretty decent absentee record on votes while he was training his sights on running for governor. He still wouldn\u2019t mind doing the latter if the law didn\u2019t prevent felons from running for statewide office until 15 years after their release, making him ineligible until he\u2019s 99. But Edwards sloughs off his old congressional voting absenteeism, saying most of the votes were inconsequential. He was there when it counted (such as extending the Voting Rights Act\u2014one of three congressmen from the South to do so).\n\nDespite a brief flirtation with being Ted Kennedy\u2019s potential running mate when he challenged Carter in 1980, Edwards never had much ambition to go national, figuring he had too much baggage for the rest of the country. \u201cHuey and Hitler and a lot of other politicians wanted to rule the world,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cBut no single individual is going to rule the world. It\u2019s too diverse, and too big. I wanted to rule Louisiana, and I got my way.\u201d As for running for Congress now, he confesses he likes the action. \u201cGives me meaning and purpose.\u201d Besides, as he likes to say on the stump, \u201cI can\u2019t make it any worse.\u201d\n\nHis biographer, Leo Honeycutt, puts it a bit earthier. When rumors circulated that Edwin was jumping in, Honeycutt asked him, \u201c \u2018What the f\u2014 are you doing? You\u2019ll be 3 years away from 90.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, what else have I got to do?\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019ve got a 1-year-old, and a 35-year-old wife. I can think of a number of things.\u2019 He said, \u2018This is what I\u2019m about, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been about, and it\u2019s what I\u2019m always going to be about.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLouisiana has gone seriously red since Edwards\u2019s gubernatorial heyday. Five of its six congressmen are now Republicans, and while Democrats had a century-long lock on the governor\u2019s chair up until the end of Edwards\u2019s second term in 1980, only two have won since, besides him\u2014one-and-a-half if you count Buddy Roemer, who party-switched near the end of his term. Many handicappers say there\u2019s no chance Edwards will win in the 6th, especially since it was redistricted by Republicans in 2011, shuttling off many blacks (a staple Edwards voting bloc) to the solidly Democratic 2nd.\n\nBut as with most things in Louisiana, there are undercurrents. The district, which sits astride the Mississippi and encompasses all of conservative Baton Rouge, along with several central and southern parishes, is still fairly black (roughly one out of four voters). Additionally, the new lines now pick up portions of heavily Cajun parishes like Terre-bonne and LaFourche, which Edwards considers a fair trade. (Those are literally his people.)\n\nMore important is the state\u2019s jungle primary system, which Edwards introduced as governor back in the \u201970s, in which all parties run together, then the top two finishers go head-to-head in a runoff. Originally intended to help Democrats who had to claw each other\u2019s eyes out in contentious primaries while Republicans sat idle, resting up for the general in a then-heavily Democratic state, the jungle primary had the unintended effect of letting Democrats cross the aisle to vote for Republicans, which they did as the national party grew more liberal. For this, Edwards has facetiously been called \u201cthe father of Louisiana\u2019s Republican party.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s running against nine Republicans\u2014though there\u2019s so many, he may have lost count. And while the race is still sleepy, it looks as though they\u2019re already cannibalizing each other\u2019s support. Edwards is way ahead in the few polls taken thus far\u2014around the 40s. Sniffy pundits say he\u2019ll likely get smoked in the runoff, when Republican support consolidates (polls do show Edwards lags in one-on-one matchups).\n\nMaybe. But the craps player is clocking his odds. He\u2019s only lost 1 out of 12 career races. He considers himself \u201cpretty much a lock\u201d for the runoff. Not making that would likely involve a dead girl/live boy scenario. So he likes his chances: \u201cI never started an election in my life where I have 40 percent going in.\u201d\n\nEven if he\u2019s pushing 90, none of the competition is exactly putting the fear of Jesus in Edwin. Who\u2019s he supposed to be afraid of? State representative Lenar Whitney, who technically lives outside the district? (\u201cI\u2019m dropping out now,\u201d Edwin jokes, when finding out she\u2019s running.) There\u2019s baby-faced software developer Paul Dietzel, whose selling point seems to be that he\u2019s the grandson of LSU football coaching legend Paul Dietzel, a biographical entry he\u2019s so at pains to highlight that he had his first name legally changed.\n\nUnlike the rest of the field, Edwards has close to 100 percent name recognition, albeit not always for the right reasons. One Republican frontrunner, state senator Dan Claitor, even tweeted, \u201cUnlike last time, don\u2019t vote for the crook, it\u2019s important.\u201d But Edwards recently joined Twitter, and woe to those who try to match one-liners with him: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say . . . go ahead and talk about David Vitter.\u201d\n\nEdwards calls the current senator (now running for Louisiana governor) \u201can unfortunate man.\u201d He thinks of Vitter, who used to bring ethics charges against Edwards when he was a state representative, as a typical Louisiana \u201creformer\u201d\u2014only in this state could Vitter be considered one while having two hooker scandals in his jacket. \u201cHe lives in fantasy world. He thinks he knows all the rules and regulations and how the rest of us should live while having a secret double life of his own,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cIt\u2019s like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\u2014except a lot less clean. Hell\u2019s hottest fires are burning for hypocrites.\u201d\n\nAll of this is fascinating enough. But I have an unrelated unanswered question. Whatever happened to Candy, the wife he divorced while in jail? When I was here in 2000, Candy and I had gone together\u2014while Edwin was getting a prostate exam\u2014to pick up their yellow lab Caesar from the vet after he\u2019d been hit by a car. Since then, it sounds like she\u2019s had a rough go\u2014a domestic abuse incident here, a traffic altercation there. What gives?\n\nEdwin\u2019s face grows tight. It\u2019s the only time I see his gears seize up. While Trina gets along just fine with his first wife, Elaine, Candy is not her favorite subject. \u201cLet me just say to you,\u201d Edwards warns, \u201cTrina doesn\u2019t want me to talk about Candy, and I don\u2019t want to talk about Candy.\u201d For a second, I\u2019m worried that the man they used to call the Cajun Prince has been henpecked beyond recognition. I tell him I only brought it up with him, alone, in case it was a sore spot with Trina. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would have been better if you\u2019d asked in her presence, because I\u2019d like her to hear me say I don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d\n\nAlways willing to help someone score points with the little missus, I gamely suggest I bring Candy up in front of Trina the next day. \u201cDo that!\u201d Edwards says enthusiastically. Professional wrestlers have a word for this\u2014kayfabe\u2014portraying staged events as being real. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to give you a rather sharp answer,\u201d he warns, always the gentleman, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what makes her happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what you have to do,\u201d I tell him.\n\nI've not checked the Poynter Institute handbook, but I\u2019m pretty sure our prearrangement runs against good journalism ethics. Maybe Edwards\u2019s looseness is rubbing off on me. One night, his biographer Honeycutt and I meet for drinks at the Kingfish Lounge at the Capitol Hilton, which used to be the old Heidelberg, where Huey liked to hole up, and where a secret tunnel (which still exists) ran under Lafayette Street, to another hotel, so clandestine visitors of the governor could escape notice.\n\nWhen Honeycutt was first told by intimates that he was on Edwards\u2019s short list to be his biographer, he told them he didn\u2019t give a toss if he were on the list at all. Having covered Edwards for years, he was amused by him but didn\u2019t particularly like him, thinking him arrogant and possibly crooked. The deeper he got into the research however\u2014and he spent years poring over microfilm in the basement of LSU\u2019s Middleton Library\u2014the more he found himself getting turned around. Not by Edwards\u2019s charm, but by what he did for the state. And because often\u2014much more often than he gets credit for with the outlaw image he\u2019s largely cultivated\u2014he lands in the vicinity of telling the truth.\n\nEven in the case that sent Edwards away, Honeycutt became convinced that Edwards may have let people believe things about his power that he thought would benefit him\u2014power he no longer had. But extortion? Threatening to sink potential casino licensees\u2019 chances if they didn\u2019t pay him? Not his style. \u201cLook,\u201d says Honeycutt. \u201cEdwards is extremely smart. He knows exactly where the line is, and doesn\u2019t cross it.\u201d Not for nothing did it take the feds three decades to get him.\n\nAnd even here, with the Candy kayfabe\u2014which, technically speaking, was my idea\u2014look at how Edwards observes the spirit of Trina\u2019s law, if not the letter. He doesn\u2019t spill to some reporter about Candy, as directed. So what\u2019s the harm in demonstrating that truth with a little white lie?\n\nThe next day, I am sitting in Edwards\u2019s study in his well-appointed French Country home. On one wall hangs his gubernatorial oil portrait. On his desk is a plaque that reads Illegitimi non carborundum\u2014mock Latin for \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.\u201d On the far wall hang three George Rodrigue portraits of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost of Louisiana politics. There\u2019s Huey, in a double-breasted white suit, holding his hat under an umbrella oak. There\u2019s Uncle Earl, posting up at an old-timey microphone in rolled shirtsleeves, about to spit hellfire. And on the far right is Edwin Washington Edwards, standing serenely in a white suit at a lectern, looking at you through dead, five-card-stud eyes.\n\nJoining us is Trina\u2014tall and blonde, all sass and fizz and Dixie sunshine\u2014and Baby Eli, who she holds on her lap as Edwin runs in and out to wash off the teething ring which keeps dropping to the floor, causing Eli to chew Trina\u2019s arm.\n\nI ask Edwin what everyone wants to know but is afraid to ask\u2014what about prison sex? Did he turn to other inmates in the sprawling loneliness of that lost decade? No, he\u2019s proud to inform me. Though there was \u201csome young fella that kind of took a liking to me, for want of a better expression\u2014think he had an uncle in politics in Texas. I\u2019d be eating with my friends, and he\u2019d bring me an extra orange, or if we had hot dogs, he\u2019d bring me one of his weenies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to give you his weenie?\u201d Trina giggles.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Edwards says, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t my size.\u201d\n\nLate one night, the young man tried to come see Edwards in his room at their low-security prison. \u201cI\u2019m very reluctant to hurt people\u2019s feelings . . . but I said, \u2018What the hell are you doin\u2019 here, man? Get your butt home and get out of here.\u2019 \u201d Before the torch-carrier could depart, a guard came, and the man dove behind Edwin\u2019s locker. Not wishing for either of them to get thrown into solitary, Edwards chatted for several minutes with the guard until he left. He then told the kid to get out and never come back. But Edwards never ratted, he says proudly.\n\nWe talk quite a bit about their short-lived reality show. They both seemed to have hated it worse than the critics, who hated it pretty badly. (\u201cCreepy on almost every level,\u201d said Variety.) \u201cThere\u2019s nothing real about a reality show,\u201d says Edwards. One of the contrived scenes which producers set in motion involved Edwin shopping for a cemetery plot and a funeral suit, as Trina might be burying him at any moment.\n\nWhich Edwards now calls \u201cstupid.\u201d Something he\u2019d never do in real life. \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m going to wear when I die. I told Trina, \u2018Just make sure I have on shoes, in case I get cold feet.\u2019 She said, \u2018Where you\u2019re goin\u2019, you won\u2019t have cold feet.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEdwards never shies away from the age question. In fact, he even allowed me to accompany him, with Trina and Eli, to his ear doctor, to get fitted for a new inner canal hearing aid since he can\u2019t stand wearing the current ones. As the audiologist peered into his ears, she informed him that he had a perforated ear drum. Rather than being alarmed, Edwards cracked, \u201cIf you see light from the other side, don\u2019t tell the reporter.\u201d Considering his age will almost certainly be made an issue in this campaign, I asked him why he\u2019d take the chance of allowing me to rub his nose in it. \u201cI\u2019d rather look deaf than stupid,\u201d he reasoned.\n\nTrina says that despite the papers wanting to imply she\u2019s a \u201cgold-digger and a whore,\u201d she legitimately fell in love with Edwards after first writing him in prison upon reading his biography (she was in high school during his last term). Then she visited him and found him cutting up with guards, exhibiting his Cajun joie de vivre, and generally looking like he was having a better time than she was. \u201cHey, how do I get in there?\u201d she wondered.\n\nAs for their age difference? \u201cNever even thought about it. I still don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes when people say he\u2019s 86, I think, oh gawwwd, that\u2019s old! But just standing here, it doesn\u2019t cross my mind. Besides, most people don\u2019t stay married for 10 years. In 10 years, I\u2019ll probably be glad he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope she waits that long,\u201d Edwin says, playing the sitcom husband.\n\nI\u2019m enjoying the fun and games, but in talking about staged reality, I have some kayfabe of my own to conduct. Say, I ask the happy couple, are you guys still cordial with Candy?\n\nPicking up my cue, Edwin jumps on me like a human trampoline: \u201cI told you yesterday, none of that! We don\u2019t talk about Candy! Maybe you didn\u2019t hear me . . .\u201d\n\nTrina looks pleased.\n\nLater that afternoon, I am interviewing Edwards in his nearly empty campaign office. The talk turns once again to guilt and innocence, a recurring theme. When he was young, before he got established as a lawyer in Crowley, he became devoutly religious, and did a hitch as a youth minister in the Nazarene church. For a while, he thought ministry might be his path.\n\nBut when he drew closer to the people in his church, \u201cthey all had feet of clay,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was my fault. The -theory is, if you keep your eye on Jesus and on the cross, and not on people, you won\u2019t be disappointed. But I was disillusioned because of what I learned about those who professed to be something else at church.\u201d\n\nHe left the Nazarenes, resuming his birthright as a lukewarm Catholic. But he resolved to not be one of those hypocrites, looking moralistic, just for show. I ask him if, when this life is over, he thinks he\u2019s heaven-bound. \u201cWell,\u201d he pauses, thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m positive I don\u2019t know any reason why I wouldn\u2019t be. But I\u2019m not in a position to decide that. Someone much greater than I will make that decision. But unlike [with] The Ayatollah, I\u2019ll be happy, because I\u2019ll get a fair trial.\u201d\n\nThroughout our interview, his phone goes off like an alien aircraft having engine problems\u2014a ringtone Trina says is called \u201cthe only one he can hear.\u201d Or else Trina steadily interrupts with various favors that need doing for people, herself included. Her cousin, it turns out, was just pulled over in another parish when her car was swerving, and they got her for \u201ctrying to evade the police or something.\u201d I ask Trina if her cousin was drinking. \u201cI think she was . . . \u201d and here, she makes a snorting motion. (Trina is as candid as her husband.)\n\nAnyway, she was wondering if Edwin could call the judge, not for a favor, just to set bond. The judge happens to be Trina\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Billy, and she doesn\u2019t want to call, since his wife likely wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. Edwin rolls his eyes, but gets on the horn, and leaves a message: \u201cBilly, Edwin Edwards. Sorry to bother you, but at your conven-ience, give me a call. No, I don\u2019t want to send [Trina] back, just give me a call, please.\u201d\n\nHe hangs up, asking his wife, \u201cDo you have any other family members [in trouble]?\u201d\n\nTrina sees me scribbling during this unfolding saga, and says, \u201cOh God, you\u2019re gonna write that?\u201d Of course I am, I tell her. My bouts of kayfabe aside, I am a professional journalist. Edwards doesn\u2019t bat an eye, and assures her it\u2019ll be fine. As Honeycutt tells me, Edwards has gone \u201cfrom the bucket list, to the f\u2014 it list.\u201d\n\nBut Edwards does remember another call that needs to be made. We\u2019re supposed to have lunch tomorrow with his daughters at Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse. He\u2019d make the reservation, he says, but they bring the tab to whoever calls. I tell him I\u2019ll pay, but he should call\u2014we\u2019ll get a better table. He gets on the phone, and the hostess asks if the governor will be celebrating anything.\n\n\u201cI am celebrating,\u201d he says, \u201cbut only because I\u2019m with someone who\u2019s going to take the check.\u201d\n\nThe following day at Ruth\u2019s Chris, Edwin, Trina, Baby Eli, and I meet up with Edwin\u2019s daughters, Victoria and Anna. It\u2019s a reunion of sorts. I haven\u2019t seen the girls since that afternoon 14 years ago when we all drove around Baton Rouge together, flipping the bird at The Ayatollah\u2019s gag order. They\u2019re in their sixties now, but Trina enjoys calling them \u201cmy stepdaughters.\u201d\n\nNobody is drinking besides the reporter, but that doesn\u2019t put a damper on anyone\u2019s high spirits. Victoria, who has streaked black-and-blue hair and likes to smoke e-cigarettes, blasting the vapor out of both nostrils like a dragon, peels her skirt partway down and shows me the tattoo of her cat, Peanut, on her hip. She writes her number on my notepad, and jokes that if I want to see her fleur-de-lis, inked in a more discreet location, to give her a call.\n\nWe talk about the girls\u2019 multiple marriages\u2014they count them off\u2014four for one, five for the other. \u201cThey ran out of fingers,\u201d cracks Edwin. I ask them why they keep throwing men on the discard pile. \u201cBecause we can\u2019t find anyone like daddy,\u201d Victoria says. \u201cNobody measures up,\u201d amens Anna.\n\nThey reject any possibility that their father could be guilty of the crimes he was accused of, but I ask the girls if they think their father made any mistakes during the trial. \u201cHe should\u2019ve been less arrogant,\u201d Anna says. \u201cYou can\u2019t be less of something that you\u2019re not,\u201d chimes in Edwin. \u201cThat explains it,\u201d adds Victoria, seconding her sister.\n\nAnna says she\u2019s not crazy about her father running for Congress at his age. \u201cBut he will wear you out. He blows and goes from the minute he opens his eyes.\u201d I ask what his energy secret is. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get away from them,\u201d says Edwin.\n\nSteering the conversation to more dangerous territory, I mention their father\u2019s womanizing reputation, one he\u2019s never particularly denied and even fed. Once, when he took several planeloads of contributors on a trip to Paris, charging them $10,000 apiece to retire a campaign debt, a nun at Notre Dame cathedral told him she was going to French-kiss him. To which he answered, \u201cSister, just don\u2019t let me get into the habit.\u201d\n\nSurely, I suggest to the girls, much of it happened on their mom\u2019s timecard. How does that make them feel? Victoria goes on a tear, defending her father and giving me a list of reasons her mother had it coming, reasons I won\u2019t repeat here. Edwin winces, and calls time-out, making her stop. It\u2019s the only time I see him visibly angry besides our Candy session, when he was faking it.\n\nKeep in mind, I\u2019ve never heard a defense of Edwards on that front, which Victoria was attempting to offer. But the next night, when I arrive at a local political dinner, Edwin and Trina make a beeline for me. \u201cWhile I have regard for our relationship,\u201d Edwin says, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to do something you won\u2019t want me to ask. We are both very unhappy about Victoria\u2019s comments about her mother.\u201d I tell Edwin not to worry. It didn\u2019t sound fair to me, so I wouldn\u2019t have used the comments even if he hadn\u2019t asked. He looks relieved. Then he says, \u201cWhen Victoria got done with all that bulls\u2014t, I\u2019m just glad you didn\u2019t ask her what she thinks of me.\u201d\n\nThe dinner we are attending, and which Edwards is keynoting, is thrown by the East Baton Rouge Democratic executive committee, and is entitled \u201cRemembering Our Roots: Every Man a King.\u201d It\u2019s intended to recall the glory days of Huey P. Long. Considering the red tide that has rolled over Democrats in Louisiana for the last several decades, I can\u2019t say I blame them for growing nostalgic.\n\nWithout belaboring the details, the dinner and its speakers and award-winners are mostly a snore. One local functionary after another gets up and bashes all the usual suspects, Tea Party-this and Bobby Jindal-that and Republicans are trying to eat our babies. The standard stuff, with a sepia-toned populist twist.\n\nAt night\u2019s end, after Edwin has received throngs of idolaters, Trina and I stand outside with him. \u201cMy dogs are barking,\u201d she says, her heels killing her, and the three of us take a bench. Since Trina is a Republican, we both give Edwin the business about going more savagely partisan tonight. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard you do that. . . . I felt accosted,\u201d says Trina.\n\nTo be sure, Edwin did ramp it up at the pep rally, trash-talking Jindal for destroying everything from the charity hospital system to the education system to just about any other system you can name. He prattled on about Republican attitudes toward \u201cHispanics and blacks and Jews,\u201d who \u201cthey claim they have a big tent [for], but it\u2019s hard to get in.\u201d The crowd gobbled it like kibble, of course, but both Trina and I found it beneath him. Edwards being Edwards, however, he did take off in some unorthodox directions. Sitting there, reviewing his performance, I marvel at the things he got away with that might cause a more conventional politician to have to find another line of work.\n\nThere was the joke he returned to (three times by my count) about Ben Jeffers, his former chief of staff who won the night\u2019s lifetime achievement award. Edwards kept suggesting Jeffers wasn\u2019t actually black, in front of a mostly black crowd. (Jeffers is a light-skinned African American, and Edwards, it should be noted, likely appointed more blacks during his administration than any Southern governor of his time or any other.) Then there were the extended sexually themed Cajun jokes that didn\u2019t have much to do with anything. There was also the long discussion of his prison record and the trial.\n\nThis could sink anyone else, I suggest. But the crowd practically hoisted him to their shoulders and paraded him around the room. Upon hearing my review, Edwards looks alternately pleased and slightly insulted. As if to say, why wouldn\u2019t he be able to carry it off?\n\n\u201cI hate to throw bouquets to myself,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the bottom line, if I try to explain it to you, is simply this: no hypocrisy. That\u2019s what gets most politicians. People will forgive you for just about anything except being a hypocrite. . . . I\u2019m outspoken. It gets me in trouble sometimes. On the other hand, it\u2019s the way I am. I\u2019m not going to B.S. anybody. [Tonight], I went as far as the line would let you. I would\u2019ve not gone any further, because that would\u2019ve been improper. But there\u2019s a line you can get to, and people understand that. . . . They know me and I know them. They know where my heart is, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nPerhaps worried he\u2019s gone too earnest, he adds, \u201cYou can tell your peers you met the only living politician who can get away with whatever he wants.\u201d Most of the time, I remind him, except for that decade he spent in the pen.\n\nA few nights earlier, Leo Honeycutt, who probably knows Edwards as well as any writer ever will, told me Edwards doesn\u2019t have any real close friends. He tends to keep the counsel of the only man he trusts\u2014himself. So I\u2019m taken aback when Edwin bids me adieu, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re one of the only friends I have on the other side, make sure nothing happens to you.\u201d I don\u2019t know what he means by \u201cother side.\u201d Conservative? Journalist? I don\u2019t bother asking. But flashing back to our kayfabe caper, the thought occurs to me that I\u2019m getting worked by the Silver Fox. If so, at least I\u2019m getting worked by the very best.\n\nOn the way home, I stop by the Kingfish Lounge in Huey\u2019s old hotel and order a nightcap to go, taking my whiskey for a walk down the promenade along the Mississippi, which lies a few hundred yards beyond. Downriver a little, on the Belle of Baton Rouge Riverboat Casino, a band is pumping blue notes into still air. I stop in front of a place the locals call Paperclip Pier. Because the Mississippi rises and falls as much as 40 feet, it\u2019s not a conventional pier. The end of it spirals down into the water, so that cruising boats have multiple options for debarkation, depending on the river level.\n\nI stroll to the end and take the corkscrewing walkway all the way down, the river flowing over its lower reaches. In my suit and dress shoes, I walk right up to the water line, but don\u2019t cross it. I have a superstition when visiting strange cities. If they\u2019re near a water body of note, I need to touch it. There is none more notable, of course, than the Father of Waters itself. From a distance, with the city lights shimmering off it, it looks placid and lazy. But up close, it\u2019s another story. People drown here, deceived by its appearance. I watch the river move for a long time, and don\u2019t spot the bodies of anyone\u2019s enemies floating by\u2014just driftwood collecting in the eddies. I set my bourbon down, and put my hands in the river. It is cool and muddy, and beneath the surface, there\u2019s no telling which way the crosscurrents run.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Louisiana,Matt Labash,Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "Editor's note: [F]our-time former governor and ex-convict Edwin Edwards -- a Louisiana icon, both beloved and reviled --&nbsp;has lost his first, and likely last, political race at the ballot box,&nbsp;the Times-Picayune reports.
