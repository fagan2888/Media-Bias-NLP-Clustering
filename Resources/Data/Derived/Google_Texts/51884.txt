In this episode of “Kids React” — a video series by the Fine Bros, where kids respond to current events and other cultural artifacts — 11 kids ages 6 to 13 react to a computer from the 1970s. The computer is pre-Internet, pre-hard drive, pre-mouse and all around vexing to the Google generation.

In the video, the kids respond to an old pong-like game, floppy disks and the infuriating “error” message. Their reactions are priceless.

“This computer is an error!” says 9-year-old Dash.
