After some sleepless nights during those first tumultuous months, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration saw its newborn health insurance marketplace slowly gain footing.\n\nToday, Healthcare.gov is finally walking. But on wobbly legs. And some of the other kids don\u2019t want to play with it.\n\nMany Americans wonder how the insurance marketplace \u2014 a signature component of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 will turn out. The next year will prove a key test, as consumers continue sorting out what the health reform law means for them, politicians wage war over its many provisions, and the Supreme Court weighs a case that could bring it to its knees. Or not.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from year two and beyond for the ACA in Maine.\n\nSupreme uncertainty\n\nThis summer, the U.S. Supreme Court could potentially deal a crushing blow to the ACA. The justices will decide whether federal subsidies that help consumers to afford their health insurance apply only in states that set up their own insurance marketplaces, or, as is the case now, also in states that use the federal marketplace. More than half of all states, including Maine, use Healthcare.gov, which is geared toward people who buy their own health insurance rather than get coverage through work or the government.\n\nThe case hangs on some imprecise wording in the health reform law. If the court decides the subsidies can\u2019t be issued to consumers in Healthcare.gov states, millions of consumers could drop or forgo insurance because it\u2019s too expensive without the financial leg up. In Maine, that\u2019s nearly all of the 36,000 people who have signed up for a plan so far in 2015, as almost 90 percent qualified for financial assistance.\n\nBut the court might rule in favor of the subsidies, meaning nothing would change for consumers. The Obama administration is so confident of a favorable decision that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has refused to publicly entertain the possibility of the subsidies disappearing.\n\nMany Americans remain unaware of the case, according to a December poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Eighty-four percent have heard only a little or nothing at all about it. (A fair number were no doubt too busy hitting the mall or entertaining relatives during the holidays to ponder the legal underpinnings of the health reform law.) And most people get their insurance through work or government programs like Medicaid and Medicare anyway, so the case won\u2019t directly affect their health insurance bill.\n\nSome experts think the public\u2019s ignorance of the case is OK, because the court\u2019s decision won\u2019t be retroactive, so consumers wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything back if the justices rule against the subsidies. Better to focus on enrolling people without muddying the waters with this case, a new development in an already complex law plagued by misinformation, they say.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we need is to confuse people more about a program that by its design is confusing and has been made even more confusing by the opposition to it,\u201d said Sharon Treat, who supports the ACA and specialized in insurance and health care issues as a former state representative and senator from Hallowell.\n\nPlus, if the court rules in favor of the subsidies, all this speculation amounts to a bunch of hot air.\n\nHowever, consumers could lose their subsidies if the court rules against the federal marketplace. In 2014, the subsidies slashed Mainers\u2019 average premiums from $443 a month to $99 a month. The Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimate that 55,000 Maine residents would lose subsidies worth $280 million come 2016 if the justices rule against them.\n\nJust two states, Arkansas and Illinois, are taking steps to establish their own insurance marketplaces as a contingency plan, according to Modern Healthcare. The other 32 states using Healthcare.gov, including Maine, remain in wait-and-see mode, said Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor. The delays could mean many states will end up watching their constituents lose coverage.\n\n\u201cI would hope that states should be moving en masse right now, to get their ducks in a row, in case the Supreme Court strikes down [the subsidies],\u201d Bagley told California Healthline.\n\nMany doubt if Maine has the political will to create its own marketplace. Gov. Paul LePage and many Republican lawmakers, who now hold a majority in the state Senate, vehemently oppose the ACA.\n\nLePage vetoed expanding Medicaid under the health reform law and in 2012 refused to set up a state-run exchange, defaulting to Healthcare.gov instead.\n\n\u201cMaine will not be complicit in the degradation of our nation\u2019s premier health care system,\u201d LePage wrote in a November 2012 letter to U.S. HHS.\n\nMany Mainers would be forced to drop their insurance without a subsidy, including Treat, who bought a plan through Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could pay for it without the subsidy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in March and won\u2019t release a decision until June, well after open enrollment concludes on Feb. 15.\n\nPolitical drama\n\nThe Supreme Court justices aren\u2019t the only ones with the power to knock the ACA off its feet. The Republican-led U.S. Congress is gearing up for more votes to repeal the law, despite Obama\u2019s promised veto of any legislation to kill his signature achievement. A repeal might not pass in the Senate, where Democrats maintain the numbers to potentially derail such a move, but even they dislike some of the law\u2019s provisions.\n\nIn 2015, we may see Congress debate bills to roll back some of those provisions, such as a tax on medical device makers.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the public warms up to the law. Americans remain deeply divided over the ACA, with 46 percent viewing it unfavorably, according to Kaiser\u2019s December poll. Forty-one percent like the law, while 14 percent had no opinion.\n\nWill LePage soften toward the ACA and Medicaid expansion in 2015? We\u2019ll have to wait and see on that, too. The Maine Medical Association, which represents the state\u2019s doctors, predicts he will, by proposing a modest Medicaid expansion that would mostly help people below the poverty line.\n\nStates can propose alternative ways to structure their Medicaid expansions with special permission from the federal government. Five states have already done so, and four more are considering such a move. Maine could be next.\n\nBetter health insurance tools\n\nWhile the pundits and politicians brawl over the ACA, consumers are using the insurance they signed up for under the law, visiting their doctors and buying prescription drugs.\n\nAfter kicking the tires on their coverage in 2014, some realized their benefits weren\u2019t quite what they thought. The ACA requires insurers to provide plainspoken explanations of each plan\u2019s benefits and costs, but some policyholders were surprised to learn their family doctor wasn\u2019t part of the network or a needed medication wasn\u2019t covered. Some people with health insurance through work ran into the same problems.\n\nDirectories listing the doctors included in insurers\u2019 networks were often out of date or inaccurate, and lists detailing covered prescriptions were similarly confounding.\n\nA coalition of health care advocacy groups \u2014 including epilepsy patients who rely on their medications to function day to day \u2014 wrote to Secretary Burwell in November calling for greater transparency.\n\n\u201cThese families have enough that they\u2019re dealing with and to add on this other piece is such a struggle,\u201d Kristine Binette, field service coordinator in Maine for the Epilepsy Foundation New England, said at the time. \u201cYou fight enough for everything, you shouldn\u2019t have to fight to get what you need. Especially when the medications are available \u2014 that\u2019s the craziest thing.\u201d\n\nPrescription drugs lists, or \u201cformularies,\u201d should be more accessible and easier to use, so consumers can figure out which plan best meets their needs, said Mitchell Stein, a Maine health policy consultant who supports the ACA. New regulations requiring insurers to update their doctor directories once a month would help, he said.\n\n\u201cThat information should be easily available to you before you select the plan, but like with the directories, that has not always been the case,\u201d Stein said.\n\nThe Obama administration has proposed new changes designed to help consumers better understand their options. The benefit summaries will provide more examples to illustrate consumers\u2019 potential out-of-pocket costs and leave out some information for easier reading.\n\nStein expects 2015 will bring more focus on ways to help consumers choose a plan, potentially tools built into Healthcare.gov or new standalone products sold by independent companies. Rather than going cross-eyed reviewing a slate of health plans with different benefits, consumers could plug in their specific medical needs and receive a recommendation for a few plans to consider.\n\nSpending less time worrying about health insurance? Not a bad New Year\u2019s resolution.\n\nTax time\n\nIn 2015, many Americans will get a clearer look at the relationship between Obamacare and the tax man.\n\nWhen you file your taxes for 2014, you\u2019ll have to tell the government if you had health insurance last year. If you didn\u2019t, you\u2019ll either have to pay a penalty or prove that you qualify for an exemption. (For the specifics, check out our FAQ on the ACA.) The government collects the penalties as additional taxes.\n\nThe law encourages people to get health insurance by offering subsidies, or tax credits, to make premiums more affordable. If you received a tax credit, you\u2019ll have to demonstrate that you received the correct amount. If you received too much, your refund could get nicked or you\u2019ll have to write a check to Uncle Sam.\n\nThe tax credit is based on the previous year\u2019s income, so if your income changes, the amount of your tax credit will, too. When you file your taxes, the government will check this. If you earned more than you expected to in 2014, you\u2019ll owe money.\n\nAll of this could amount to a big headache come tax time, some experts worry. In September, the Obama administration informed more than 300,000 people who signed up for coverage through Healthcare.gov that their income information didn\u2019t jibe with what the IRS had on file. They had until the end of that month to submit pay stubs, tax returns and other information or risk losing their subsidies.\n\nSome consumers could be surprised to find their refund docked for health insurance, instead of paying off credit card bills from Christmas.\n\nObamacare will affect the pocketbooks of large employers, too. The law requires that large businesses offer health insurance to employees or face a penalty. That provision, called the employer mandate, was supposed to take effect at the beginning of 2014, but the administration put off enforcing it until 2015. Some, including a former White House press secretary, predict the mandate will be dropped altogether.\n\nBut as the law stands now, businesses with more than 100 workers will have to offer insurance this year. The relatively few companies of that size in Maine already provide benefits to their workers, so Maine will see a bigger impact in 2016, when smaller businesses \u2014 those with 50 or more full-time employees \u2014 must offer insurance or pay a fine.\n\nHealthy ambitions\n\nMost of the discussion about the ACA centers on health coverage, which makes sense given the law\u2019s changes to the insurance system. But the law also seeks to improve the quality of health care while lowering costs. One way is by asking states to experiment with new models and report back.\n\nHere, the state is using a $33 million grant awarded under the law in February 2013 to find new ways of paying for and delivering health care that could ultimately lower costs for Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, while making those programs\u2019 beneficiaries healthier. Health advocates hope lessons learned will benefit the health care system overall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the secrets of Obamacare,\u201d said Andrew Webber, CEO of the Maine Health Management Coalition, which has partnered with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to administer the grant.\n\nMaine was awarded the grant, along with five other states, because of its existing progress in transforming health care, he said.\n\nMaine\u2019s Medicaid program, known as MaineCare, accounts for about a third of the total state budget. Like Medicaid programs in other states, it faces critical funding shortages. Reducing its costs while keeping recipients healthy is no small feat.\n\nSo far, costly emergency room visits and hospital readmission rates \u2014 the percentage of people who end up back in the hospital after they just got out \u2014 are down, according to Maine DHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew.\n\n\u201cWe are putting our [State Innovation Model] grant funding to work strengthening primary care and prevention, developing new payment models, and improving data and analysis,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis supports the department\u2019s overall goal of driving down health care costs by focusing on prevention and integrated care.\u201d\n\nThe effort could eventually result in more than $1 billion in savings over three years, DHHS said when the grant was announced.\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious goal.
