Serge Ibaka added 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting as the Thunder left a sellout crowd of 19,812 booing the home team, or making no noise at all.\n\n\u201cI said that on the bench, I was like, \u2018Man, it feels like nobody\u2019s in here,\u2019\u201d Durant said.\n\nAmare Stoudemire scored a season-high 22 points, and Tim Hardaway Jr. had 21 for the Knicks, who also were missing starting point guard Raymond Felton. J.R. Smith scored 20 points, but shot 8 for 22 and was booed when he left the court for good.\n\nAnthony sat out for the first time this season. The Knicks were never really in it without him and may not have had a chance with him the way the Thunder played.\n\n\u201cDefensively, we just weren\u2019t there tonight,\u201d Knicks coach Mike Woodson said.\n\nThe Knicks not only had trouble with the Thunder, but also with the special edition sleeved jerseys NBA teams are wearing on Christmas.\n\nBeno Udrih hit the side of the backboard on two shot attempts in the first half, tugging on his sleeve after the second as if blaming his struggles on his equipment.\n\nOklahoma City had a much easier time in the uniforms. Coach Scott Brooks said before the game the Thunder hadn\u2019t had a formal practice in them, but players had shot around the last few days in the jerseys that featured a giant logo in the middle of the chest and jersey numbers on the left sleeve.\n\n\u201cThey look great. Hopefully, we play well in them,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nThey played superbly.\n\nComing off a 104-98 loss to Toronto on Sunday that ended a nine-game winning streak and was their first setback at home this season, they shot 54 percent and got 18 points from Reggie Jackson.\n\nDurant made all five shots in the first quarter, with the Thunder leading 35-29 after shooting 70 percent. Jackson and Durant made 3-pointers to start the second, making Oklahoma City 16 of 22. Ibaka did most of the work in an 8-2 spurt midway through the period that extended the lead to 17, and the Thunder led 60-46 at halftime.\n\nDurant and Westbrook took turns being unguardable on the perimeter in the third, boos growing louder as Oklahoma City went on to its sixth straight road victory.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m disappointed with them. Honestly, my disappointment probably outweighs theirs,\u201d Knicks center Tyson Chandler said about the fans. \u201cIt is what it is. They come out here to see a show and they come here to see their team play hard and I understand it.\u201d\n\nAnthony was hurt Monday night in a victory at Orlando, saying afterward he hoped to play Wednesday. But he looked glum and wasn\u2019t walking particularly well by the locker room area after getting treatment and testing the ankle, and the Knicks announced he wouldn\u2019t be in uniform about 50 minutes before the start.\n\nHe sat on the bench wearing a brown sports jacket, getting up slowly during timeouts whenever the Knicks called them in a futile attempt to stop the Thunder\u2019s onslaught.\n\nThe Knicks fell to 0-7 in orange uniforms this season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Durant scored 29 and Westbrook finished with 14 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in his first triple-double of the season and seventh of his career.", "Author": "Brian Mahoney", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Durant scored 29 and Westbrook finished with 14 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in his first triple-double of the season and seventh of his career.", "title": "Durant, Westbrook lead Thunder rout of Knicks", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/durant-westbrook-lead-thunder-rout-knicks/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/thunder-knicks-basketballjpeg-0d80b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/thunder-knicks-basketballjpeg-0d80b.jpg", "title": "Durant, Westbrook lead Thunder rout of Knicks", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "description": "Durant scored 29 and Westbrook finished with 14 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in his first triple-double of the season and seventh of his career."}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, New York Knicks, Kevin Durant Carmelo Anthony, Durant, Russell Westbrook"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07a7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI just know that if we play the way we play, team basketball, Thunder basketball, not too many teams that can beat us,\u201d Westbrook said.\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder made sure of it with the most dominant performance ever by a road team on Christmas.\nDurant scored 29 points, Russell Westbrook had a triple-double by the middle of the third quarter, and the Thunder rolled to a 123-94 victory Wednesday over the New York Knicks.\nSerge Ibaka added 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting as the Thunder left a sellout crowd of 19,812 booing the home team, or making no noise at all.\nThe Knicks not only had trouble with the Thunder, but also with the special edition sleeved jerseys NBA teams are wearing on Christmas."}
