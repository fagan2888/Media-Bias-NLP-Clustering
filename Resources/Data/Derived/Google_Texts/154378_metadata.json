John Hickenlooper on Tuesday announced the grant, designed to reward state innovation, after months of work by a team of experts examining ways to improve coordination between mental health care and other medical care. Colorado will spend the money during the next four years.\n\nNational studies have shown people are far more likely to start and complete mental health therapy when it is offered in the same place as their primary care doctor. Treatment drops off dramatically when patients are referred to separate mental health clinics.\n\nColorado will spend the grant helping primary care doctors transform their practices to incorporate mental health professionals. A major part of the project is a health information technology plan that connects patient information on physical and mental health care, said Dr. Benjamin Miller, director of the Farley Health Policy Center at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe want to transform how we pay for health care to make it much more inclusive, including mental health,\u201d said Miller, who worked on the grant project.\n\nThe new health care model would focus on treating the \u201cwhole patient,\u201d and the payment plan would move away from the fee-for-service model that pays per procedure and toward a whole-health model.\n\nThe Denver Post examined Colorado\u2019s frayed mental health system and looked at how an integrated model of physical and mental health services can work, in a four-part series last month.\n\nThe federal government is giving out $665 million to states, but Colorado is one of 10 chosen as test sites and receiving more funds for health systems, said Vatsala Pathy, director of the state innovation model at the governor\u2019s office. The project affects people with private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and the government-funded Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nIn Colorado, the innovation project is intended to tie insurance payments to health outcomes and engage people in their own health care.\n\n\u201cWe understand the connections between mind and body, and integration of behavioral health with physical health services is a critical need for Colorado and our nation,\u201d said Susan E. Birch, executive director for the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which will administer the funds.\n\nSeveral agencies, including CU, the Colorado Health Institute and the Center for Improving Value in Health Care, worked on the grant proposal. Colorado earlier received $2 million in federal funds to plan the project.\n\nJennifer Brown: 303-954-1593, jenbrown@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jbrowndpost\n\nBREAKDOWN: Read the Denver Post investigative series on mental health in Colorado.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado to receive $65 million mental health grant", "title": "Colorado to receive $65 million mental health grant", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/16/colorado-to-receive-65-million-mental-health-grant/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__20141123_A20_cd23ivgmentalhealthjp2p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141122__20141123_A20_cd23ivgmentalhealthjp2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-16T13:20:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:59:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5bb6\"", "article_summary": "Colorado will receive $65 million of federal funds to help bring mental health treatment into primary-care doctors\u2019 offices, part of a plan to make sure more Coloradans receive mental health treatment when they need it.\nJennifer Brown: 303-954-1593, jenbrown@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jbrowndpostBREAKDOWN: Read the Denver Post investigative series on mental health in Colorado.\nSeveral agencies, including CU, the Colorado Health Institute and the Center for Improving Value in Health Care, worked on the grant proposal.\nThe Denver Post examined Colorado\u2019s frayed mental health system and looked at how an integrated model of physical and mental health services can work, in a four-part series last month.\nBREAKDOWN: Read the Denver Post investigative series on mental health in Colorado."}
