Instead, he\u2019s afraid to turn down any job that comes his way. \u201cI spend all of my time scrambling,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m afraid to take vacations. I\u2019m afraid because of the cost, and I\u2019m afraid to take vacations because, oh my gosh, I might miss a project opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\nZupnik is one of the millions of Americans whose work lives have shifted radically in recent years. One in three working Americans now is part-time, freelance, in a temporary or project-based job, or employed as a \u201cperma-temp,\u201d according to the Freelancers Union. Most have no job security or benefits, such as employer-subsidized health insurance or a pension plan. The Harvard Business Review recently called it by far the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. job market.\n\n\n\nThe numbers are expected to grow, in part because of a mandate in the new health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act, requiring companies with more than 50 employees to offer health insurance only to those who work at least 30 hours a week.\n\n\n\nPeter Capelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said the change began in the 1980s, with the first wave of restructuring and outsourcing, together with the decline of unions and skilled manufacturing jobs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has pushed the uncertainty that business copes with onto the work force,\u201d he said in an interview over Skype. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t know for sure these days whether demand will be up or down, or how long projects will last. It used to be that they carried workers in the life-time employment arrangements. When business went down, they kept them around. Now they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nCorinne Pulicay, half Harry Zupnik\u2019s age, is in a similar bind. Last year she quit a full-time job because it had no promotion potential. Now she\u2019s struggling to support herself while she studies textile design and marketing part-time.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had trouble finding a steady job doing the same thing I used to do, doing production art, so I\u2019ve had to resort to doing a variety of temp jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people of my generation are very disillusioned. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any expectation that we\u2019ll get Social Security benefits in the future. I know a lot of my peers who, along with their day jobs, wait tables or tend bar, or are on more than one freelance gig.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really good as individuals at accommodating uncertainty,\u201d said Capelli. \u201cMost people don\u2019t have the deep financial pockets that might make it reasonable to do. It\u2019s not good for employees. The employers prefer it, and think it helps them remain competitive. So, it\u2019s a winners and losers story here, and the employers have been winning and the employees have been losing.\u201d\n\n\n\nZupnik points to the pressure businesses feel from Wall Street and their stockholders to increase profits by cutting labor costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re justifying it by the bottom line, by the fact that they\u2019re looking at short-term measurable financial results, and not at long-term value creation. There are intense pressures from Wall Street to perform and to perform now. And when you fail to perform, these companies are punished,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThere is a world of difference in the lives of all those who work at irregular or \u201ccontingent,\u201d jobs. Day laborers, many of them undocumented immigrants, wait on certain corners in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx every morning in hopes of picking up a day\u2019s work on a building site, or cleaning houses. Others must arrive before dawn at blue-collar temp agencies, like Manpower, and are bused out to non-skilled jobs in warehouses or factories.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, some well-paid professionals choose a freelance life. Interior designer Clare Donahue, for example, has worked as an independent contractor for 30 years, shrugging off anxious family members who urged her to get a regular job. Paradoxically, her employment now seems more secure than her sister\u2019s, who always had a regular job, said Donahue.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has struggled for security her whole life, and yet she\u2019s ended up moving from job to job. She\u2019ll start at a job, the company will be bought, they\u2019ll start laying people off, and then everyone is fired. You go through this cycle again and again,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAs for herself, Donahue isn\u2019t as confident about the future as she once was.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt really insecure until recently,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation for me now than it was when I started out 30 years ago. It may come to a point where there\u2019s no safety net at the end where you need it. If I were injured, if I retired and needed help, there\u2019s no guarantee now that anything will be there.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Harry Zupnik, who recently took a temporary job in Buffalo, one of the most distressing aspects of the new economic landscape is that even the projects he does land are limited in scope, and don\u2019t give him an opportunity to use all his skills. His struggle for employment touches every part of his life, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tiring, it\u2019s affected my family life, my friendships, my relationships, my self-confidence, the way I feel about myself when I walk down the street,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCorinne Pulicay is currently checking copyrights for a textbook publisher, but that project will be done in a few months. She doesn\u2019t know if she will be able to find a good full-time job with benefits, even after she graduates with an associate\u2019s degree.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a new economic system is being born, where you have to sort of fend for yourself economically, you have to hustle and find new avenues of making an income. But you know some people are better at that than others, and what if you\u2019re not one of those people, what happens to you?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Economy, VOA, United States, security, employment, U.S., Weaver, u.s. economy, benefits, contractor, work force, american workers, permanently temporary, freelancers union, steady job, permanent employment, freelance", "Author": "Carolyn Weaver", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "One in three American workers is now either freelance, a project-based contractor or permanently temporary, says non-profit group Freelancers Union", "title": "US Freelance 'Perma-Temp' Economy Takes Hold", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/us-freelancer-perma-temp-economy-takes-hold/1775767.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/088BA394-CBF6-4429-9EB2-DC7370A5D115_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/088BA394-CBF6-4429-9EB2-DC7370A5D115_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "US Freelance 'Perma-Temp' Economy Takes Hold", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
