It will still offer one basic-level plan for individuals off the exchange.\n\nShipley said Blue Cross intends to offer plans through the exchange again in 2017, but he\u2019s not sure if any will be PPO plans.\n\n\u201cI think the PPO plan for certain people who have a lot of health care needs is a great plan. It\u2019s just that it costs a lot more and we have to have the rates to be able to offer it to people,\u201d said Shipley, \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to know that I\u2019ll be able to get the rates that I need to have.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Cross exit from the health exchange came after Franchini rejected a 51 percent rate increase the insurer had said it needed.\n\nEarlier this month, the only other insurer that offered PPO plans to individuals, New Mexico Health Connections, said it was dropping plans to offer those insurance products in 2016. Around 1,900 people have Health Connections PPO plans.\n\nLegislators at the committee meeting were concerned that the lack of PPO options would hurt very ill people who may need to go out of state to get the best care. Franchini pointed out that before the Affordable Care Act, insurers could deny coverage to people who had pre-existing health problems.\n\nLisa Reid, director of the life and health division in Franchini\u2019s office, who also spoke at the meeting, ventured that in future insurers may have to offer wider provider networks in their HMO plans as a selling point to customers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 The state insurance regulator predicts that preferred provider organization plans that allow patient ...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rosalie Rayburn | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/649403/individual-ppos-disappearing.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/plugins/journal-open-graph/img/albuquerque-journal.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "The state insurance regulator predicts that preferred provider organization plans that allow patient ...", "title": "Updated: Individual PPOs disappearing"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b77\"", "article_summary": "In July, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas announced that it would not offer individual PPO plans in 2016, a decision that affected 367,000 people.\n.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 The state insurance regulator predicts that preferred provider organization plans that allow patients flexibility to choose providers will eventually disappear in the individual health insurance market across the country.\nFranchini\u2019s prediction echoed a comment made by Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico President Kurt Shipley during a meeting this week with the Journal editorial board.\nShipley said Blue Cross intends to offer plans through the exchange again in 2017, but he\u2019s not sure if any will be PPO plans.\nHe said PPO plans typically cost insurers about 20 percent more than HMO plans because insurers have less control over the providers patients chose to use."}
