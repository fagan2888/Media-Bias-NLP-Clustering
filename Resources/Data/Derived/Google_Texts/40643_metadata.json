Matt Mead (R) expressed an interest in adopting Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act. Wyoming is one of the most conservative states in the nation; Mead is hardly a moderate; and resistance to \u201cObamacare\u201d is the norm in this ruby-red state.\n\nBut Mead wasn\u2019t kidding. In fact, as Dylan Scott reports , the GOP governor has moved beyond just expressing an interest \u2013 he\u2019s practically demanding his state move forward on Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe have fought the fight against the (Affordable Care Act),\u201d he said at the statehouse, according to the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our best to find a fit for Wyoming. We are out of timeouts, and we need to address Medicaid expansion this session.\u201d Mead, as the conservative governor of a thoroughly Republican state, is emblematic of the conservative thawing on Medicaid expansion. He began negotiating with the Obama administration in July, and his office released an expansion plan in November. Under the plan, enrollees would have to make small co-payments and those above the poverty line would have monthly premiums.\n\nIn an unexpected move for any Republican governor, Mead has even told lawmakers that the Affordable Care Act provision is necessary to create jobs in Wyoming.\n\nAt the same time, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) is another red-state governor who\u2019s advancing Medicaid expansion in his state, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is reportedly in negotiations with administration officials about a conservative version of the policy in his state, too.\n\nAnd what about Texas?\n\nRegular readers may recall that the Lone Star State\u2019s new far-right governor, Republican Greg Abbott, sought out additional information about the agreement Utah reached with the Obama administration, raising hopes that Texas might be next in line to do the right thing.\n\nGovernor-Elect Greg Abbott (R., Texas) will not expand Medicaid despite hopes by Obamacare supporters that he would do so following a report that he inquired about Utah\u2019s variation of the health program. \u201cFear not \u2013 Governor-elect Abbott has fought Obamacare and will continue to fight against it. He believes the ACA is not the best option for patients, doctors or taxpayers,\u201d spokeswoman Amelia Chasse tells National Review Online in a statement.\n\nI see these as temporary setbacks. Unless Republicans on the Supreme Court completely destroy the American health care system, policies like Medicaid expansion almost certainly will become the norm in the near future.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, those who continue to argue that states should reject the policy out of partisan spite \u2013 regardless of the benefits for families, regardless of the needs of state hospitals, regardless of the effects on state finances \u2013 are facing headwinds that are only growing stronger.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "States can only hurt themselves on purpose for so long before madness ends.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/red-states-continue-move-towards-medicaid-expansion", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "States can only hurt themselves on purpose for so long before madness ends.", "title": "Red states continue to move towards Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/red-states-continue-move-towards-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2013/09/ap13030516820.jpg?itok=3xEtMA0U", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/red-states-continue-move-towards-medicaid-expansion", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/09/ap13030516820.jpg?itok=tSgVQwSq", "height": 553}, "title": "Red states continue to move towards Medicaid expansion", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "States can only hurt themselves on purpose for so long before madness ends."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-16T11:37:51-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,wyoming,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Red states continue to move towards Medicaid expansion", "published": 1, "date": "01/16/2015 11:37:51 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/red-states-continue-move-towards-medicaid-expansion"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "States can only hurt themselves on purpose for so long before madness ends.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, Obamacare, Wyoming"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb086\"", "article_summary": "We are out of timeouts, and we need to address Medicaid expansion this session.\u201d Mead, as the conservative governor of a thoroughly Republican state, is emblematic of the conservative thawing on Medicaid expansion.\nMatt Mead (R) expressed an interest in adopting Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act.\nBill Haslam (R) is another red-state governor who\u2019s advancing Medicaid expansion in his state, and North Carolina Gov.\nUnless Republicans on the Supreme Court completely destroy the American health care system, policies like Medicaid expansion almost certainly will become the norm in the near future.\nIn fact, as Dylan Scott reports , the GOP governor has moved beyond just expressing an interest \u2013 he\u2019s practically demanding his state move forward on Medicaid expansion."}
