(Photo: Eric Gay/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Fewer Hoosiers used the federal health exchange to get insurance this year than did last year, the federal government reported Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said 196,242 Hoosiers selected a 2016 plan through the open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31.\n\nThat compares with 219,185 Hoosiers who selected a 2015 plan during last year\u2019s open enrollment period.\n\nNationally, 4 million more people selected a 2016 plan in the 38 states using HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe drop in Indiana is because some switched their coverage to Medicaid after Indiana expanded eligibility last year, according to federal and local officials.\n\nBut more than 200,000 Hoosiers estimated to be eligible for exchange coverage still haven\u2019t signed up, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNearly half of this year\u2019s plan selections were made by people living in the Indianapolis area.\n\nThose without coverage could be upset when they face the increased penalty for not having insurance.\n\nThe penalty, which kicks in when 2016 federal income taxes are paid next year, is $695 per adult, or 2.5 percent of annual household income \u2014 whichever is higher.\n\nFederal officials said that, based on what they heard from local enrollment sites and the response they tracked from enrollment reminders that mentioned the penalty, it was a large motivating factor.\n\n\u201cA lot of young people were used to getting that $500 (tax) refund \u2026 (and) didn\u2019t want to lose it,\u201d said Kevin Counihan, CEO of HealthCare.gov.\n\nJulia Holloway, who ran the outreach and assistance program for Affiliated Service Providers of Indiana to enroll Hoosiers, said that reaction was particularly evident in the final few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe've had more people talk about the penalty when they\u2019ve called,\u201d she said.\n\nSubsidies to help purchase insurance are available to people earning from 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nIndiana started allowing Hoosiers earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level into its new Medicaid program, HIP 2.0, about a month into 2015. About 65,000 Hoosiers already covered by Healthcare.gov qualified for HIP 2.0, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.\n\nSpokesman Jim Gavin said last month it was too early to tell how this year\u2019s Medicaid enrollment would be affected.\n\nBut Holloway and Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the drop in exchange enrollment from 2015 to 2016 is due to the shift to Medicaid for some enrollees.\n\nPremiums for the 2016 plans available in Indiana through HealthCare.gov dropped an average 13 percent from 2015, the largest decline in the nation. But one reason is likely that Indiana's rates started out on the high side when plans were first available for 2014.\n\n\u201cI think people had a lot of choices,\u201d Holloway said of 2016 coverage. \u201cThey were able to find some more affordable plans this time.\u201d\n\nEnrollment is up nearly 50 percent from the first year of coverage. But the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that eligible Hoosiers who lack coverage outnumber those who have chosen a plan.\n\nCritics say that\u2019s a sign of failure for the Affordable Care Act, which created the exchange and expanded Medicaid.\n\nBut Holloway said there are still many people who don\u2019t know about the coverage options.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always repeating our phone number \u2014 877-313-7215 \u2014 in hopes that people know who to call,\u201d she said.\n\nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
