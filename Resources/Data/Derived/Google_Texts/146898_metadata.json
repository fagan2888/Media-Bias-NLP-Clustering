In the wild jaguars normally live 12 to 15 years.\n\n\u201cJackson lived a very long life and was a great ambassador for his species,\u201d said Dan Meates, interim director of Niabi Zoo. \u201cHe was a strikingly beautiful cat who was very charismatic. He has touched thousands of lives and inspired many to learn more about how to protect endangered cats. We will miss him dearly. We\u2019d love to hear visitors\u2019 favorite stories or memories of Jackson on our Facebook page.\n\nAs animals age their medical needs may increase, and our keeper team, who know these animals very well, are trained to notice subtle differences in behavior,\u201d said Meates. \u201cThis allows us to detect any signs of aging that might become problems and immediately address them and helps us maintain the best possible quality of life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of Niabi Zoo's big cats, Jackson the jaguar, was put down earlier this week.", "og": {"site_name": "OURQUADCITIES", "description": "One of Niabi Zoo's big cats, Jackson the jaguar, was put down earlier this week.", "title": "Niabi Zoo jaguar euthanized", "url": "http://www.ourquadcities.com/news/niabi-zoo-jaguar-euthanized", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ourquadcities/photo/2016/03/17/JACKSON%20JAGUAR_1458253842786_7601215_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 979124188767212}, "google-site-verification": "2vs6Ae0GE_bJ_zIUevxlSajPbKw-4X51OdF6nvVhpuQ", "keywords": "News,Local News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-03-17T22:37:50+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T22:37:51+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "One of Niabi Zoo's big cats, Jackson the jaguar, was put down earlier this week.\n\u201cJackson lived a very long life and was a great ambassador for his species,\u201d said Dan Meates, interim director of Niabi Zoo.\nJackson, who was 21 years old, was euthanized by the zoo's veterinary staff after a rapid decline in his health.\nThe jaguar had been at the zoo since 1995.\nHe has touched thousands of lives and inspired many to learn more about how to protect endangered cats."}
