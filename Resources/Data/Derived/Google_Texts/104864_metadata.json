With 32,108 abortions, 2013 had the lowest annual number of abortions ever recorded in Pennsylvania. Figures for 2014 and 2015 are not yet available.\n\nHere in Pittsburgh there are mixed views about what is causing the decline.\n\nA national compilation of state health department data collected by the Associated Press earlier this month found that there has been an overall 12 percent drop in the number of abortions performed nationwide between 2010 and 2013. Pennsylvania\u2019s drop during that same period was just a smidgen above the national rate, at 12.7 percent. Compared with other states, Pennsylvania had the fifth highest annual number of abortions, preceded by New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, respectively.\n\nThe age group most likely to have an abortion was 20-24, and almost all abortions occurred during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFor Marlene Wohleber, former president and current website administrator of the anti-abortion group People Concerned for the Unborn Child, this trend is strongly indicative of a growing awareness of the humanity of the unborn child.\n\nMs. Wohleber said that the activities of the anti-abortion community, including protesting outside abortion clinics and putting up billboards that tell women they have options besides abortion have contributed largely to the decline.\n\nMary Lou Gartner, the political director of PCUC, said the introduction of ultrasounds now allow women to see the fetus at a very early stage.\n\n\u201cThe claim that it is just a blob of tissue no longer holds any weight,\u201d she said.\n\nSusan Frietsche, senior staff attorney at the Women\u2019s Law Project and abortion rights activist, said that there is no evidence for a shift in public opinion against abortion.\n\nShe cited the findings of a 2014 Gallup study, which showed that Americans have been split roughly evenly between support and opposition to abortion since 2010.\n\nMs. Frietsche added that restrictions against abortion, ranging from legal restrictions to campaigns led by anti-abortion groups, do not affect abortion rates.\n\n\u201cI think that women will do anything to get an abortion when they need it, and that they will do anything to maintain a pregnancy if that\u2019s what they want,\u201d she said.\n\nAleigha Cavalier, public affairs director at Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania, said that the drop in abortion rates is due to greater access to contraception and better sexual education.\n\nShe said that Planned Parenthood has seen a 91 percent increase in the use of IUDs and implants since 2010. Both are considered the most effective forms of reversible birth control available, according to the American College of Gynecology and Obstetricians. Ms. Cavalier added that the Affordable Care Act has also contributed to the decline in abortions, with its mandate of improved contraceptive coverage.\n\nUnplanned pregnancies still happen, Ms. Gartner said, and women can make a choice between ending or continuing their pregnancy. There has been a shift in public opinion, she said, and fewer women choose abortions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decision that women have to make at that stage in their lives, and we think that more women are choosing life,\u201d she said.\n\nMicaiah Bilger, education director at the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, agreed. She added that women have more support to manage unplanned pregnancies, such as free counseling, diapers, help with rent and scholarships to get them through college.\n\nMore research is needed to discern which factors are affecting the rate of abortions, said Ms. Frietsche.\n\n\u201cThis needs more study, women don't decide to have an abortion lightly.\u201d\n\nAmaka Uchegbu: auchegbu@post-gazette.com, 412-263-3571, Twitter: @AmakaYDN.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of abortions performed in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation, has fallen in recent years.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Times have changed since Phyllis Wetherby manned a phone line for the National Organization for Women, taking calls from women looking for financial assistance to get an abortion.
