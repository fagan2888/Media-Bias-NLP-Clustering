Using these measures, patients with private insurance had lower risk-adjustment mortality rates than Medicare beneficiaries for 12 out of 15 procedures and conditions, according to lead author Christine S. Spencer, an associate professor and executive director of the school of health and human services in the college of public affairs at the University of Baltimore, and her team.\n\nThe difference in care is significant. For example, mortality rates for Medicare patients were 104 percent higher for hip replacements and 102 percent higher for esophageal resection. Medicare patients had an average of 5.85 more deaths per 1,000 patients than patients with private insurance at the same hospital, according to the study.\n\nPrivately insured patients also had lower mortality rates than those in other payer groups, albeit to a lesser extent, according to the study. The only procedures for which patients with private insurance had higher mortality rates than Medicare patients were pneumonia, stroke and congestive heart failure.\n\n\"Medicare patients appeared particularly vulnerable to receiving inferior care,\" the study's authors wrote. \"These findings suggest that to help reduce care disparities, public payers and hospitals should measure care quality for different insurance groups and monitor differences in treatment practices within hospitals.\"\n\nThe authors suggest several possible reasons for the disparity, including delays or restrictions in care and unequal access to newer technology. Privately insured patients also may have doctors who provide them with more individualized treatment, or have access to \"newer, more expensive treatments,\" the study said.\n\nAn April study found Medicare patient mortality rates were on the rise in critical access hospitals, but had declined in other hospitals over the past decade, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMortality rates rise at critical access hospitals, drop at others\n\nReport card: Hospitals improve mortality rates with the help of public reporting\n\nMortality rates vary, even in 'top cities'\n\nHospital rankings, mortality rates based on chance, study says", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patients with private insurance receive better hospital care than those without it, according to a new study published in Health Affairs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Patients with private insurance receive better hospital care than those without it, according to a new study published in Health Affairs.", "title": "Study: Privately insured patients receive better hospital care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/study-privately-insured-patients-receive-better-hospital-care/2013-10-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Agency for Healthcare Reseach and Qualit (AHRQ),hospital mortality rates,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3ff\"", "article_summary": "Patients with private insurance receive better hospital care than those without it, according to a new study published in Health Affairs.\nMedicare patients had an average of 5.85 more deaths per 1,000 patients than patients with private insurance at the same hospital, according to the study.\nThe only procedures for which patients with private insurance had higher mortality rates than Medicare patients were pneumonia, stroke and congestive heart failure.\nFor example, mortality rates for Medicare patients were 104 percent higher for hip replacements and 102 percent higher for esophageal resection.\nPrivately insured patients also had lower mortality rates than those in other payer groups, albeit to a lesser extent, according to the study."}
