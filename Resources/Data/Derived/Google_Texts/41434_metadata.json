MacGillivray and his crew used every IMAX 3-D trick at their disposal, from jaw-dropping aerial footage of sun-splattered landscapes to in-your-face encounters with furry, squeaky creatures like prairie dogs.\n\nAs if the visual feast weren\u2019t enough, the film also serves up actor-environmentalist Robert Redford as narrator, climber Conrad Anker as narrative focal point, and a soundtrack that features rocker Bruce Springsteen. But missing from the buffet, as usual, is the story of the parks\u2019 future \u2014 the one filled with those diverse people who will not only enable the parks\u2019 continued existence but, as the impending nonwhite majority in this country, also provide the political, economic and spiritual wherewithal to ensure the future of the planet.\n\nThe film gets off to a promising start with its mention of Native Americans and their belief that this country\u2019s \u201cnatural wonders belong to no one, they belong to us all.\u201d But to go from that utterance to Springsteen\u2019s version of the Woody Guthrie classic \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d renders most everything in between not only as antithetical, but also as a continuing indictment of the National Park Service\u2019s overwhelming whiteness.\n\nThis land doesn\u2019t appear to be made for you and me if a significant number of us are missing from the picture. And \u201cNational Parks Adventure\u201d feeds this perception by illustrating the national parks experience as an almost exclusively white one.\n\nThe trick to solving the diversity issue, of course, is to actually begin diversifying. Otherwise, absent outside agitation, there\u2019s little potential for recognizing that diversity indeed is an issue. The people affected aren\u2019t at the table.\n\nThis is the challenge for the production company MacGillivray Freeman, known for producing IMAX hits like \u201cEverest,\u201d \u201cDolphins\u201d and \u201cThe Living Sea.\u201d When asked about diversity in his film following a Seattle screening, Shaun MacGillivray, president of the production house, hailed the film\u2019s opening remarks about Native Americans. When asked if he\u2019d considered actually showing Native Americans and other people of color onscreen, MacGillivray said, \u201cIf my crack research team had found a character with a more diverse story, we would have considered using one.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what one his team might have found: Ryan Hudson may be no Conrad Anker, but he is a black professional snowboarder with a compelling story. Hudson grew up in and out of homeless shelters until, at 14, his life was changed by an introduction to snowboarding by Outdoor Outreach, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering at-risk youth through outdoor activities. Hudson was part of an expedition, led by Anker, that attempted to climb Denali. Hudson was with Anker, his stepson Max Lowe, and friend Rachel Pohl at one of the film\u2019s more spectacular stops in Pictured Rocks National Seashore.\n\nWe know Hudson is there because Pohl mentions his presence. If you watch carefully, without blinking, you\u2019ll see him on the screen, ever so briefly. What a lost opportunity.\n\nMacGillivray also said that the filmmakers also wanted to portray John Muir and Theodore Roosevelt, the architects of the Park Service, \u201cwho just happened to be white.\u201d The only semblance of diversity is shown in some of the user-generated content near the end of the 43-minute film. The National Park Service should have known better, yet it allowed a project to be executed with blatant racial ignorance.\n\nThe agency hasn\u2019t delivered on pre-centennial promises to ramp up diversity efforts. Its ranks remain 82 percent white, about the same as its visitation, in a country that is 38 percent nonwhite and growing fast. Even the National Park System Advisory Board found that \u201cdespite ongoing efforts to address diversity gaps, the Park Service is perceived by stakeholders as neither diverse nor inclusive.\u201d\n\nNational Parks Adventure attempts to herald the national parks road trip as quintessentially American, but instead proves the conceit as quintessentially white American. When Springsteen belts out, \u201cThis land is your land,\u201d a much too significant portion of this country is forced to disagree. In essence, MacGillivray\u2019s work reflects too closely the history of the agency it celebrates. And as a film, it joins a cinematic legacy long dominated by sci-fi flicks that rarely consider the presence of people of color in anyone\u2019s future.\n\nGlenn Nelson is a contributor to Writers on the Range, an opinion service of High Country News (hcn.org).
