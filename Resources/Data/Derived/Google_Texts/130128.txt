President Obama was in Argentina on Thursday and made one of his patented 'American apologies' for actions that the Central Intelligence Agency took during Argentina's "dirty war."

In the 1970s, Soviet communism and socialism was spreading rapidly throughout South America and the CIA created Operation Condor to help local right-wing groups such as the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance repel the Russian influence. Politics aside, trying combat the spread of communism has never been easy and CIA agents did what was necessary to protect the United States.

But rest assured, Obama, who swept in to save the day, gave a most sincere apology to Argentina on behalf of the "early dark days" of the CIA and the United States.

"I believe we have a responsibility to confront the past with honesty and transparency,” Obama said. “A memorial like this speaks to the responsibilities that all of us have. We cannot forget the past, but when we find the courage to confront it, and we find the courage to change that past, that's when we build a better future."

"This park is a tribute to their memory but it's also a tribute to the bravery and tenacity of the parents and spouses, siblings and the children who love and remember them," Obama said during remarks at the memorial. "Today, we also commemorate those who fought side-by-side with Argentinians for human rights."

According to ABC News, Obama said the United States government would declassify U.S. military and intelligence documents related to the "dirty war," at the request of Macri and human rights groups.

I will leave it up to you to decide who Obama was referring to when he said, "commemorate those who fought side-by-side with Argentinians for human rights."
