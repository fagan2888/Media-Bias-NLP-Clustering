U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst returned to Iowa this weekend, fresh off her freshman introduction to the U.S. Congress.

Ernst is the first woman to be elected to Congress in Iowa. She is also the first female combat veteran in the U.S. Senate.

“Now I will be the first first-year senator to give the Republican response to the State of the Union address,” she said.

Ernst was tight-lipped as to what she would say in the speech, but said she would drink plenty of water beforehand.

“I will make sure I’m hydrated, yes,” she said.

People in Red Oak, Iowa, had other questions for Ernst, ranging from subjects such as Cuba and the Affordable Care Act. Some wondered what it was like to live in Washington, D.C.

“Coming from Iowa with low cost of living and going to Washington, D.C., it’s a little bit of a sticker shock, but we’ll make it. I’m thrifty,” she said.

She said things are a little faster paced in the nation’s capital.

“So, I was sworn in on Jan. 6, and that was between noon and 1 and at 2 o’clock we had our first committee meeting, so jumped right into armed services,” she said.

Ernst said she is up for the challenge.

“I look forward to working for the people of Iowa. We have a lot of issues coming up. The budget, Keystone XL, a number of things that are very important to Iowans,” she said.
