WASHINGTON, D.C., September 8, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) -- As Congress comes back to session, all eyes are on the beginning of a new budget year on October 1 -- and the question on everyone's mind is whether a battle over Planned Parenthood funding will lead to a partial government shutdown.

The abortion giant’s funding appears to be safe: Almost every Democrat in Congress is behind it, and only 19 House conservatives have said they will stand against a budget resolution that funds Planned Parenthood. This would still allow House leadership to pass a budget bill without Democratic votes.

The Hill reports that it would take 28 Republicans rejecting their leadership to hold up any funding. At that point, House leaders could ask Democrats -- who for the most part have declared that they will shut down the government if Planned Parenthood isn't funded -- to support their budget, defund Planned Parenthood, or see a government shutdown.

In the Senate, Texas senator and GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz is expected to send a letter urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, to not fund Planned Parenthood in a budget resolution. Like 18 House conservatives, he also sent a letter to his chamber's leadership before the recess.

“I believe we should use every and any procedural tool available to defund Planned Parenthood,” Cruz wrote a month ago.

However, many Republicans are wary of being blamed for a government shutdown, which happened when Democrats refused to compromise on funding for the Affordable Care Act.

Last week, McConnell said the Planned Parenthood funding fight would have to wait until a new president is elected.
