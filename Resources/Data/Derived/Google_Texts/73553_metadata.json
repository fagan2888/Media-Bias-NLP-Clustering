Cameron Espinosa, an eighth-grader at Paul R. Haas Middle School in Corpus Christi, Texas was pronounced dead on Monday, September 16, several days after being bitten multiple times by ants while playing a home game on the school field.\n\nOn September 11, the 12-year-old football player was standing on the sidelines and started yelling \u201cAnts! Ants!\u201d according to Lorette Williams, director of communications for the school district to the Daily News. The coach of the Haas Middle School football team told the boy to \u201cget a water bottle and spray yourself off\u201d before Espinosa started yelling out in pain, said Principal Lynda Ann De Leon, to KZTV, a CBS-affiliate. While Espinosa drenched himself with water, he collapsed on the field, losing consciousness, as the paramedics were called to rush the young boy to Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital in Corpus Christi.\n\nEspinosa remained in critical condition for several days while his mother kept the community up to speed on the status of his condition via Facebook posts. Less than a week later, the boy\u2019s condition severely deteriorated, and he was declared dead early Monday morning. The unexpected death of the young football player left his teammates, classmates, and the school faculty mourning the loss of a star.\n\nHaas Middle School cancelled all extracurricular and athletic events for the rest of the week and has grief counseling services available for students and staff on hand. The Texas middle school has decided to honor the memory of the 12-year-old by creating ribbons with Espinosa\u2019s jersey number and the colors of the school, and passing them out to studnets and faculty. \"Students and teachers have been wearing green and white ribbons with the number 66 on them,\" said Williams, USA Today reports.\n\nThe sudden death of the football player led Hector Salinas, a school board member, to survey the football field, where he found more than 20 ant piles. Salinas is outraged at the insect infestation and believes the football coaches should have scanned the field before letting the students play. \"If in fact the coaches there knew that there was a problem with ants before\u2026 Then you know what? It should have been taken care of,\" he said KRIS-TV, a local station.\n\n\"It really bothers me because here we got a young kid that is fighting for his life and... I don't know... Could this been prevented?\" Salinas asked, prior to Espinosa\u2019s death. Espinosa was unaware that he was allergic to ants and the school district apparently had no record of allergies on the young boy.\n\nThe Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital would not provide further information on Espinosa\u2019s death when contacted by the Daily News on Monday afternoon. Based on the football player\u2019s reaction, the ants that attacked him were most likely fire ants.\n\n\u201cIn some patients only one sting could trigger a life-threatening reaction,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Fineman, an allergist with the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic and immediate past president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, the Daily Mail reports. Fire ants are usually red or black and are prominent in the southern United States. In that region, they are considered to be a significant health hazard and are the number one cause of insect stings. These ants inject a venom that can provoke an allergic reaction of a single itchy red bump or anaphylactic shock \u2014 and are the only poisonous ants.\n\nMore than 500,000 Americans are sent to the emergency rooms every year due to insect stings, with a minimum of 50 insect-related deaths incidents occurring per year, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cameron espinosa, football player ant bites, fire ants, allergic reaction", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 12-year-old Texas football player, Cameron Espinosa, was pronounced dead after an allergic reaction to ant bites during a football game.", "title": "12-Year-Old Football Player Dies From Ant Bites", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cameron-espinosa-12-year-old-football-player-dies-after-ant-bites-due-severe-allergic-reaction", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/18/fire-ants.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 12-year-old Texas football player, Cameron Espinosa, was pronounced dead after an allergic reaction to ant bites during a football game.", "title": "12-Year-Old Football Player Dies From Ant Bites", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cameron-espinosa-12-year-old-football-player-dies-after-ant-bites-due-severe-allergic-reaction", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/18/fire-ants.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/18/fire-ants.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-18T18:19:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-18T18:19:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 12-year-old Texas football player, Cameron Espinosa, was pronounced dead after an allergic reaction to ant bites during a football game."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd93\"", "article_summary": "A Texas middle school football player was not able to complete what would be the final football game of his life after suffering an allergic reaction to ant bites during a halftime huddle.\nOn September 11, the 12-year-old football player was standing on the sidelines and started yelling \u201cAnts!\nThe unexpected death of the young football player left his teammates, classmates, and the school faculty mourning the loss of a star.\nThe sudden death of the football player led Hector Salinas, a school board member, to survey the football field, where he found more than 20 ant piles.\nHaas Middle School cancelled all extracurricular and athletic events for the rest of the week and has grief counseling services available for students and staff on hand."}
