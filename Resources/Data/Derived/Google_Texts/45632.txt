A new round of testing may provide new insight into the life of an unidentified girl who was found dead inside a trash bag on a beach this summer.

On June 25, the girl’s body was discovered on a peninsula in Boston Harbor opposite Logan Airport, according to Massachusetts State Police. The toddler was estimated to be around 4 years old and was nicknamed “Baby Doe.”

The latest scientific testing revealed that the child may have spent time in any of six different New England states before her death. The tests included isotopic analysis, which examined hair and tooth enamels for isotopes coming from the food and water in specific regions of the country. The results suggested Baby Doe may have moved around the country during her short life.

“Scientists have not yet compared the biological evidence with drinking water samples in other countries. As a result, investigators are not drawing any specific conclusions on the analysis until it is complete,” said a statement from Massachusetts State Police.

These results, said authorities, are preliminary and require further testing and study. Prior examination of pollen samples found in the trash bag where she was found suggested she had spent time in the Greater Boston area prior to her death. This, along with the fact that her body did not show advanced signs of decomposition when it was found, led investigators to believe she died in the area rather than a distant location.

Authorities urge anyone with information concerning the girl to utilize a tip line that has been set up for the case.
