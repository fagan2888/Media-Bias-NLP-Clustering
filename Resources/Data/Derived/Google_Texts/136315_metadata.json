(AP) \u2014 Ryan Reed won for the first time in a NASCAR national series with an Xfinity Series victory Saturday at Daytona International Speedway, where Sprint Cup star Kyle Busch was injured in a late crash.\n\nReed, the 21-year-old driver for Roush Fenway Racing, passed Brad Keselowski for the lead on the last lap to grab the win in the debut race for new sponsor Xfinity.\n\nThe race ended minutes after Busch was transported to a hospital with what appeared to be an injury to his right leg or ankle. He hit head-first into an inside retaining wall with eight laps remaining, and was only able to climb halfway through his window.\n\nBusch appeared to be pointing into the car as rescue workers arrived to help him to the ground. His leg was wrapped in a splint and he was on a stretcher as he was loaded into the ambulance.\n\nHis wife, Samantha, was crying as she left the infield care center with team owner Joe Gibbs and team president J.D. Gibbs. Samantha Busch is pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child, a boy due in May.\n\nAs Kyle Busch was being evaluated at Halifax Health Medical Center, older brother Kurt was due at a final appeal of his indefinite NASCAR suspension.\n\nKurt Busch was suspended Friday by NASCAR because a Delaware judge ruled he choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall. He\u2019s already been replaced in Sunday\u2019s season-opening Daytona 500 by his race team; now Kyle Busch\u2019s status for the biggest event of the season is in question.\n\nThe direct hit by Kyle Busch on an interior wall was in a spot that did not have SAFER barrier. His car had traveled through the grass and slammed hard into the wall, ricocheting off in a crumpled heap. Reaction was swift on social media from drivers calling on NASCAR to install the energy-absorbing material everywhere at race tracks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond me why we don\u2019t have soft walls everywhere,\u201d tweeted six-time champion Jimmie Johnson.\n\nFormer driver Jeff Burton, now a television analyst, called on NASCAR to overcome costs, \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive but we have to find a way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan Reed wins Xfinity race at Daytona; Kyle Busch injured", "title": "Ryan Reed wins Xfinity race at Daytona; Kyle Busch injured", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ryan Reed wins Xfinity race at Daytona; Kyle Busch injured", "title": "Ryan Reed wins Xfinity race at Daytona; Kyle Busch injured", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/22/ryan_reed_wins_xfinity_race_at_daytona_kyle_busch_injured/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-nascar-xfinity-auto-racing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ryan Reed wins Xfinity race at Daytona; Kyle Busch injured", "title": "Ryan Reed wins Xfinity race at Daytona; Kyle Busch injured", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-nascar-xfinity-auto-racing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenna Fryer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe319c\"", "article_summary": "The direct hit by Kyle Busch on an interior wall was in a spot that did not have SAFER barrier.\nHe\u2019s already been replaced in Sunday\u2019s season-opening Daytona 500 by his race team; now Kyle Busch\u2019s status for the biggest event of the season is in question.\nSamantha Busch is pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child, a boy due in May.\nAs Kyle Busch was being evaluated at Halifax Health Medical Center, older brother Kurt was due at a final appeal of his indefinite NASCAR suspension.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsDAYTONA BEACH, Fla.
