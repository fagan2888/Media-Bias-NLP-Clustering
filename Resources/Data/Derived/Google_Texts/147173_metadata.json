On the flight back to Rome, he was asked if he supported individuals, including government officials, who refuse to abide by some laws, such as issuing marriage licenses to gays. \u201cConscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right,\u201d Francis said. [\u2026] \u201cI can\u2019t have in mind all cases that can exist about conscientious objection but, yes, I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right,\u201d he said, speaking in Italian. \u201cAnd if someone does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right,\u201d he added. Francis said conscientious objection had to be respected in legal structures. \u201cOtherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying: \u2018This right has merit, this one does not.'\u201d\n\nThe American public disagrees with this sentiment, however. A recent poll found that 63 percent said Davis should be required to issue marriage licenses even though she objects on religious grounds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While theres disagreement among Republicans over whether or not Kentucky clerk Kim Davis was correct to put up a fight in refusing to issue marriage licenses in the wake of the Supreme Courts same-sex marriage decision, her position has gotten support from someone all the more important: Pope Francis..05/26/2016 18:57:53PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "While theres disagreement among Republicans over whether or not Kentucky clerk Kim Davis was correct to put up a fight in refusing to issue marriage licenses in the wake of the Supreme Courts same-sex marriage decision, her position has gotten support from someone all the more important: Pope Francis.", "title": "Pope Francis Defends Conscientious Objection to Same-Sex 'Marriage'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/28/pope-francis-defends-conscientious-objection-to-samesex-marriage-n2058174", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/270/2015-09-27T205508Z_1_LYNXNPEB8Q0HN_RTROPTP_3_POPE-USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "While theres disagreement among Republicans over whether or not Kentucky clerk Kim Davis was correct to put up a fight in refusing to issue marriage licenses in the wake of the Supreme Courts same-sex marriage decision, her position has gotten support from someone all the more important: Pope Francis.", "title": "Pope Francis Defends Conscientious Objection to Same-Sex 'Marriage'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/28/pope-francis-defends-conscientious-objection-to-samesex-marriage-n2058174", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/270/2015-09-27T205508Z_1_LYNXNPEB8Q0HN_RTROPTP_3_POPE-USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pope Francis Defends Conscientious Objection to Same-Sex 'Marriage' , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cConscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right,\u201d Francis said.\nA recent poll found that 63 percent said Davis should be required to issue marriage licenses even though she objects on religious grounds.\n[\u2026] \u201cI can\u2019t have in mind all cases that can exist about conscientious objection but, yes, I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right,\u201d he said, speaking in Italian.\nFrancis said conscientious objection had to be respected in legal structures.\nWhile there\u2019s disagreement among Republicans over whether or not Kentucky clerk Kim Davis was correct to put up a fight in refusing to issue marriage licenses in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex \u2018marriage\u2019 decision, her position has gotten support from someone all the more important: Pope Francis."}
