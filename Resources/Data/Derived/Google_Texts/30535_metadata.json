She has spent five months living on the International Space Station and advised Sandra Bullock for her performance in the film \"Gravity\".\n\nOne law I would pass: I learned everything from kindergarten. So my law would be to be nice to everyone.\n\nWho I'd ennoble: I would not ennoble anyone. There is no need for anybody to be higher than anybody else.\n\nOne thing I would ban: I would ban being narrow-minded about who people are. If I sit with a baby on board an airplane people would try not to sit next to me.\n\nWho I'd send to Siberia: Sometimes, I'd send my husband. But really, we'd probably like to see it together.\n\nWhere I'd build my palace: We already have a palace \u2013 the International Space Station. The view is simply amazing. Once you have seen it, it's really hard to feel like you belong to just one country.\n\nCompulsory book to read: Calvin and Hobbes, by Bill Watterson. It's a delightful series. My son loves this book \u2013 I actually brought it to space with me", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icon/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,ibtimes.co.uk,newsweek.com,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk", "description": "The American astronaut would send her husband to Siberia", "og": {"url": "http://europe.newsweek.com/if-i-ruled-world-nasa-astronaut-catherine-coleman-328922", "site_name": "Newsweek", "image": "http://d.europe.newsweek.com/en/full/7101/catherine-coleman-nasa-astronaut.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://europe.newsweek.com/if-i-ruled-world-nasa-astronaut-catherine-coleman-328922", "image": {"src": "http://d.europe.newsweek.com/en/full/7101/catherine-coleman-nasa-astronaut.jpg", "identifier": "http://d.europe.newsweek.com/en/full/7101/catherine-coleman-nasa-astronaut.jpg"}, "description": "The American astronaut would send her husband to Siberia", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newsweekeurope"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-19T09:49:58+01:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=950626384, affiliate-data=10lRpF", "fb": {"app_id": 411783372335134}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/icon/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Science,If I ruled the world,NASA,Astronaut"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8a6\"", "article_summary": "Who I'd send to Siberia: Sometimes, I'd send my husband.\nShe has spent five months living on the International Space Station and advised Sandra Bullock for her performance in the film \"Gravity\".\nCatherine Coleman is an American Nasa astronaut.\nWhere I'd build my palace: We already have a palace \u2013 the International Space Station.\nWho I'd ennoble: I would not ennoble anyone."}
