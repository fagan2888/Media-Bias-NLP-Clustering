New and upcoming research will reveal for the first time exactly how a long-term blueberry intake will affect the human body thanks to creative ideas in delivery.\n\n\u201cIn science, we get very anal, \u2018why is it? Why is the blueberry very good?\u2019 and we start digging down and ultimately we find something, some compound, and then someone wants to make it into a pill instead of served as a food,\u201d said Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, who served on the scientific advisory committee for the 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and presented his research titled \u201cPolyphenols: A Very Good Idea\u201d at the Blueberry Health Research and Culinary Luncheon on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHopefully the message that we can reach at the end of the day today is that we don\u2019t need to necessarily look for a magic bullet or a magic food, or I hate the term \u2018super food\u2019 because it makes it seem like there\u2019s something more magical about it than it is,\u201d Rimm said. Previous research has extracted particular compounds out of the blueberry and into its participants\u2019 diets in order to explore its health benefits; however, no one has fed them all-natural blueberries.\n\nWith the support of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council, who collected over two tons of blueberries, dried them, then broke them down into powder form, Rimm can now collaborate with the University of East Anglia to find out how long-term blueberry intake benefits humans.The Council works to promote the healthy growth of the blueberry industry through research and wellness awareness.\n\nThe reason for the powder and not just regimenting their participants to eat blueberries is because each blueberry pack is different, with various sizes and from different produces. By using the same batches of blueberries and turning them into powder form, researchers will be able to give precisely measure amounts of one to three servings a day, and easily create a placebo to serve as a control. Their blind study currently has 25 participants signed up, but they are waiting for more and hope to have their findings published within a year.\n\n\u201cA group of polyphenols are called flavonoids and one of the components of flavonoids are anthocyanin, which is what makes blueberries, blue,\u201d he said. Blueberries yield a vast amount of health benefits, as they are low in fat, full of dietary fiber, vitamin C, at 80 calories a cup. The phytonutrients within them are dietary polyphenols, which are also found in wine, tea, apples, chocolate, and coffee, and are responsible for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been decades of science of studying the blueberry. It started out by doing some basic studies of getting a petri dish and pulling a compound out and seeing what it does in a petri dish,\u201d Rimm said. \u201cThen they\u2019ve done some high dose feeding studies of animals to see what they did but everyone\u2019s always worried if you give a mouse a lot of blueberries is it really the same thing as feeding it to humans?\u201d\n\nThen food chemists from around the world began to analyze different fruits and created very detailed food compound data bases. This allowed researchers, physicians, and dieticians alike to look at a patient\u2019s diet, see what they\u2019ve eaten and know exactly how many compounds of polyphenols and other compounds are in your body.\n\nPolyphenol s are the most abundant antioxidant in our diets, and according to a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, they\u2019ve only come to the attention of nutritionists recently. It\u2019s been proven to prevent cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and osteoporosis. \u201cPolyphenols are in hundreds and hundreds of different compounds of things we eat,\u201d Rimm said. \u201cThey have other potential we need to explore. They\u2019re not just antioxidants.\u201d\n\nLast year, Rimm published a study in the journal Circulation on the health benefits of blueberries' key compound anthocyanin, and it was found to show better aging for middle-aged women. The top 20 percent who ate blueberries most frequently were shown to have the best life longevity and health, as opposed to the bottom 20 percent who faired the least. Rimm looks forward to the results of his newest study in order to show just what blueberries can do for our health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blueberries, human, body, 2, tons, powdered, blueberries, may, soon, help, reveal, fruits", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Blueberries contain powerful health benefits within their compounds, and a new study will soon find exactly what benefits there are to yield.", "title": "Powdered Blueberries May Soon Help Reveal The Fruit's Dietary Prowess", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-human-body-2-tons-powdered-blueberries-may-soon-help-reveal-fruits-dietary-prowess", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/researchers-develop-blueberry-powder-effectively-study-its-benefits.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blueberries contain powerful health benefits within their compounds, and a new study will soon find exactly what benefits there are to yield.", "title": "Powdered Blueberries May Soon Help Reveal The Fruit's Dietary Prowess", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blueberries-human-body-2-tons-powdered-blueberries-may-soon-help-reveal-fruits-dietary-prowess", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/researchers-develop-blueberry-powder-effectively-study-its-benefits.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/researchers-develop-blueberry-powder-effectively-study-its-benefits.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-26T17:25:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T17:25:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Blueberries contain powerful health benefits within their compounds, and a new study will soon find exactly what benefits there are to yield."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f4c\"", "article_summary": "Blueberries yield a vast amount of health benefits, as they are low in fat, full of dietary fiber, vitamin C, at 80 calories a cup.\nRimm looks forward to the results of his newest study in order to show just what blueberries can do for our health.\nBlueberries were first examined by botanists more than 13,000 years ago, yet it has only been in the last two decades that researchers have been paying their health benefits much attention.\nPrevious research has extracted particular compounds out of the blueberry and into its participants\u2019 diets in order to explore its health benefits; however, no one has fed them all-natural blueberries.\nThey\u2019re not just antioxidants.\u201dLast year, Rimm published a study in the journal Circulation on the health benefits of blueberries' key compound anthocyanin, and it was found to show better aging for middle-aged women."}
