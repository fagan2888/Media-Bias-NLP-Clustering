The couple racked up thousands in medical bills before learning there was a problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so stressful. If I get into an accident or something, I\u2019m not covered,\u201d Tran said Friday. \u201cI have to find ways to resolve this. I know I\u2019m paying every month for nothing. It\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d\n\nInsurance brokers say dozens of other consumers are enduring payment problems \u2014 and thousands more yet to use their coverage could face Tran\u2019s trouble if they get sick or injured.\n\nLas Vegas insurance broker Pat Casale estimates that 10,000 of the exchange\u2019s 38,000 enrollees have had payment struggles, including 60 of the 90 clients he signed up. Today, about 3,800 health link buyers statewide have unresolved issues, he said. Some don\u2019t know yet that they have coverage issues. One of Casale\u2019s clients went to the doctor two weeks ago and only then learned he had no policy.\n\nThat\u2019s why brokers say exchange customers need to confirm they are covered.\n\n\u201cYou have to check it literally every week from your effective date,\u201d said Las Vegas broker Lou Cila. \u201cAnd you have to be pushy. Tell (Nevada Health Link) that you want someone on the phone to confirm to you that your carrier will have your information within 24 hours, if they don\u2019t have it already.\u201d\n\nBut Tran and Le say they were plenty persistent. They illustrate the maddening plight of the unknowingly uninsured \u2014 maddening for consumers because their case shows how easy it is to fix problems that are not being addressed.\n\nBILLS POURING IN\n\nThe couple signed up for a plan ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline for coverage effective Jan. 1, and paid their first premium in January. They didn\u2019t worry when their ID cards didn\u2019t come until February \u2014 Tran said he understood there were computer glitches.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t know was that Xerox, the Nevada Health Link website contractor and the party responsible for forwarding payments to carriers, was apparently not sending his money to Health Plan of Nevada.\n\nAfter 90 days without payment, consumers lose their coverage, so Health Plan of Nevada dropped Tran and Le after April 30.\n\nTran and Le didn\u2019t get a cancellation notice until July \u2014 two months after they arranged for medical procedures, lab tests and medications they thought were covered.\n\nThe bills started to pour in about five weeks ago.\n\nNevada Health Link told Tran he looked current in the system, but Health Plan of Nevada told him it hadn\u2019t been receiving his payments. So Tran traipsed over to the insurer\u2019s Tenaya Way offices with bank statements and sent a letter to the state Division of Insurance. The state\u2019s response: It was waiting for a response from Health Plan of Nevada.\n\nThere was still no resolution by Friday. Nor could the exchange say when his issue would be fixed.\n\nBut Health Plan of Nevada and the exchange had no trouble working things out Monday afternoon, within three hours of a Review-Journal call about Tran\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Mr. and Mrs. Tran\u2019s patience as we worked with the exchange to resolve this matter and ensure they are provided with ongoing access to health care services,\u201d Health Plan of Nevada parent UnitedHealthcare said in a statement. \u201cThis issue, which continues to occur, was a result of us not receiving or being provided all the necessary information and payments in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nThe exchange was still reviewing Tran\u2019s case late Tuesday, said spokesman Tyler Klimas, who said \u201ceach enrollment issue is different.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to identify and help solve these issues so consumers can focus on getting the care they need. There will continue to be collaboration between the exchange, Xerox and carriers in these efforts,\u201d Klimas said.\n\n\u2018HUGE DISCONNECT\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely Tran and Le will be the last exchange customers reporting missed payments.\n\nOn Monday \u2014 a due date for premium payments \u2014 some consumers discovered the \u201cmake payment\u201d button had disappeared from Nevada Health Link\u2019s website.\n\nBrad Zucroff of Las Vegas said a customer-service representative told him at 5:45 p.m. Monday there was \u201cno ETA for a fix.\u201d Tuesday morning, Zucroff said, there was still no way to make a payment online or by phone.\n\nZucroff said he was told he could mail a check, but he wouldn\u2019t get a receipt. He definitely wants a record: It took seven months to iron out his effective-coverage date, which the exchange listed incorrectly on his paperwork and fixed in its system just last week. His insurer still doesn\u2019t have the right information, though, he said.\n\nKlimas said Tuesday the exchange was unaware of any new problems with the online payment portal.\n\n\u201cWe encourage any enrollee who might be experiencing difficulties paying online to call a customer service representative for assistance or use one of the other payment options available,\u201d he said.\n\nXerox declined to comment on Tran\u2019s case, citing patient-privacy laws, but brokers say the payment trip-ups begin and end with the company\u2019s computers.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s a huge disconnect in the software between the client, the carrier, the agent and the money,\u201d said Dwight Mazzone, a broker and exchange consumer-affairs committee member. \u201cThey can\u2019t seem to put everything in the right bucket that says, \u2018Here\u2019s the application, here\u2019s the premium, let\u2019s forward it to the insurer and have them issue the case.\u2019 We don\u2019t know where they send payments, or why they\u2019re not sending payments.\u201d\n\nAdded Casale: \u201cXerox can show payments are received, but they\u2019re not sending everything over to the carriers to be effectuated properly. If nothing is going over to the carrier, then the carrier has no way to verify the member. So the member is trapped in cyberspace.\u201d\n\nMORE TO COME\n\nThat trap should begin releasing consumers in November. That\u2019s when the state exchange, which fired Xerox effective at year\u2019s end, begins borrowing the sign-up system of the federal healthcare.gov exchange. After the changeover, insurers will bill and collect payments directly.\n\nUntil then, consumers should verify coverage, and the exchange and carriers should meet face-to-face to reconcile questionable accounts, Mazzone said.\n\nAnd while it might be \u201cmoral\u201d to halt exchange plan cancellations until payment problems are patched, as some brokers have suggested, it\u2019s not practical, Mazzone said. Insurers have no choice but to cancel coverage if they\u2019re not getting paid. Instead, he said, Xerox should be held liable for medical expenses of people left uncovered because of system flaws.\n\nTran doesn\u2019t care about the specifics. Just fix it, he said.\n\n\u201cThey should do their job. Pay Health Plan of Nevada so consumers don\u2019t become victims,\u201d Tran said Friday. \u201cDo a better communication job with Health Plan of Nevada. Don\u2019t just email me and tell me everything is fine. I think this is a common problem, but no one can do anything about it.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at 702-380-4512 or jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
