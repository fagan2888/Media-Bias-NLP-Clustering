Right now, that should be the mood permeating through the Scott Walker campaign. The latest CNN/ORC poll showed just how steep this once shining star in the 2016 field has fallen, almost into irrelevancy:[emphasis mine]\n\nFive other candidates received less than one-half of 1 percentage point support: former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Walker's collapse is especially stark. Celebrated by conservatives -- in the party's base and its donor class alike -- for his union-busting efforts in Wisconsin, Walker at one point led the field in the key early voting state of Iowa. His support had already dropped to 5% in a CNN/ORC poll in early September, but the bottom appears to have fallen out completely since then -- with a second flat debate performance coming after criticism of his disparate answers on issues like birthright citizenship.\n\nWalker had three positions in a week on the issue of birthright citizenship (not good), but let's get back to the one-half of one percent part. Team Walker must\u2013to quote Donald Trump\u2013 really be feeling like a bunch of \u201ctotal losers.\u201d This guy was leading in Iowa. He has a narrative that can carry a national campaign. Walker balanced budgets, curbed the excessive power of public sector unions, cut taxes, and has the proud citation of being undefeated against every Democratic attempt to destroy him. The man\u2019s been in campaign mode ever since the 2012 recall; his entire first term as governor was one giant election. In 2010, he\u2019s elected. By 2012, there\u2019s the recall. And by 2014, he\u2019s facing Mary Burke in his re-election bid. Walker should never have been rusty, or at least his political infrastructure, but it seems to have corroded.\n\nAfter he jumped into the 2016 ring, there was this Politico piece detailing those Walker had defeated in his past elections. The underlying theme: don\u2019t underestimate him; one former rival said, \u201cI could summarize my advice for people running against him\u2026\u2018Don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Yet, that was in July, where he was in that weird territory of being the frontrunner or a solid candidate (top three); he\u2019s neither of those now. On average, he\u2019s seventh in the polls in Iowa. Not nearly good enough to win a contest which was widely reported as either a must-win for his campaign or one that would show us why he has what it takes to win this primary. It\u2019s all here, here, here, and here, and here\u2013all roads to the White House for Walker go through Iowa. With Trump, Carson, and now Fiorina surging\u2013and with such a big field\u2013support has taken a nosedive. It seems the small-town, pull yourself up by your bootstraps narrative that Walker embodied didn\u2019t catch on with voters.\n\nThe first sign that the Walker campaign was sinking was the beginning of August, where it was reported that the governor was reportedly boring conservatives to death* in Iowa:\n\nAfter seven months as the clear favorite to win this first-in-the-nation caucus state, the Wisconsin governor is suddenly sinking in the polls\u2014 overtaken by the summer\u2019s massive anti-establishment wave and at risk of losing his grip. \u201cHe\u2019s lost a lot of momentum here because he didn\u2019t convert that early momentum into committed caucus-goers. Now he\u2019s got to re-start his engine here, and that\u2019s not easy to do,\u201d said Doug Gross, a GOP operative who supported Mitt Romney four years ago and has yet to commit to a candidate this cycle. [\u2026] \u201cThe enthusiasm right now is clearly on the side of the insurgents,\u201d said Matt Strawn, a former state GOP chairman who is neutral in the current nomination fight. \u201cBut the race is just beginning in earnest. It\u2019s one thing to poll high in August, but whether those candidates can withstand the long campaign is still an open question.\u201d With the caucuses still six months away, longtime political observers here aren\u2019t ready to call Trump the front-runner, viewing him as a cunning media manipulator who is leveraging his celebrity this summer but unlikely to endure. But they can\u2019t ignore the strain of scorn for the political establishment elevating newcomers like Carson and Fiorina over career politicians \u2013 a strain that likely runs far deeper than The Donald\u2019s support.\n\nThe publication noted, \u201cthe race is still winnable for Walker because other top-tier candidates have yet to ignite. Jeb Bush, despite having the strongest organization in Iowa, isn\u2019t a natural fit in a socially conservative state.\u201d That appears to be right. The piece included quotes from fair-goers that ranged from Jeb\u2019s a bit too liberal to he\u2019s a nice fellow, but we need \u201cnew blood in the White House.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to predict that Jeb Bush will last longer than Scott Walker at this juncture. The New York Times\u2019 Nate Cohn agreed that Walker has the resume and the base of support to do well. Walker does appeal to the Republican Party\u2019s conservative wing and the establishment. Yet, there were some who agreed that Walker wasn\u2019t ready for \u201cprime time,\u201d given some of his campaign\u2019s early moves:\n\nNo other Republican combines a natural factional base in an early primary state with the potential for broad acceptability throughout the party. Jeb Bush will face persistent resistance from the party\u2019s conservative wing, even if his combination of superior resources and just enough appeal could allow him to prevail in a protracted fight. The many conservatives competing with Mr. Walker in Iowa, like Ted Cruz or Mr. Huckabee, have won loyal but narrow support by embracing messages that alienate much of the party. Marco Rubio, perhaps the only candidate who appeals more broadly throughout the party than Mr. Walker, does not have a natural base of support in the party and has struggled to break through. But a straightforward path to victory is no guarantee of victory. In August 2011, if you had asked, \u201cWho is in the best position to win the Republican nomination?\u201d many might have responded \u201cRick Perry.\u201d On paper, he was broadly acceptable throughout the party and to its establishment, he had a strong pitch to conservative voters desperate for an alternative to Mitt Romney, and he led polls in Iowa and nationally in 2011. But he promptly blew his opportunity with a series of missteps that made him seem woefully unprepared for the presidency.\n\nThat\u2019s seems to have happened here as well:\n\nEarly on, he \u201cpunted\u201d on questions about evolution; he said he did not know whether President Obama was a Christian; he argued that his experience facing down protesters in Madison prepared him to defeat the Islamic State; and he quickly shifted positions on ethanol and immigration to align with the preferences of Iowa voters. [\u2026] These doubts are not limited to the party\u2019s moderates. Tom Coburn, the former senator from Oklahoma, said Mr. Walker \u201cmight not be ready for prime time.\u201d Mike Lee, a senator from Utah, said he was \u201cdoubtful\u201d about Mr. Walker before meeting him. Mr. Lee apparently came away impressed, but the initial expectation may be the better indicator of his reputational challenge.\n\nYou have this, plus Walker\u2019s super PAC doling out $7 million in ad buys in Iowa in early August. This seems to have been ineffectual. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t help when you have two lackluster debate performances. The recent CNN/Salem debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California saw Walker throw a few zingers at Donald Trump and criticize the debate questions as ones not geared towards policy, but it was more of the same.\n\nThere were some problems with policy as well. In August, the governor unveiled his health care reform white paper, which had some good points, but was a bit light on how he would pay for it (via WSJ) [emphasis mine]:\n\nMr. Walker said his plan is akin to a \u201ctax cut of about a trillion dollars. That\u2019s probably about one of the biggest tax-relief plans we\u2019ve had, pro-growth, economic development-tax relief plans we\u2019ve had in the past 40 years. That\u2019s going to have a dynamic and important impact on the nation\u2019s economy.\u201d The tax-credit system Mr. Walker proposed would provide a tax credit of $900 a year for those 17 years old or younger and escalate to a credit of $3,000 for people between the ages of 50 and 64. It also would increase annual limits on tax-sheltered health savings accounts, a popular program for people in high-deductible plans, and would provide a $1,000 refundable tax credit to anyone who signs up. Walker aides said it could reduce premiums by as much as 25%. [\u2026] Mr. Walker called his plan \u201ccost neutral,\u201d but he didn\u2019t explain how he would pay $802 billion in increased Medicare spending that would be triggered by a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also has said repealing the health-care law would increase federal budget deficits by $137 billion over the next decade. Mr. Walker\u2019s 6\u00bd-page proposal doesn\u2019t address how he would pay for his plan beyond a vow to cut spending on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance for the poor, and institute a tax on so-called Cadillac health plans.\n\nForbes\u2019 Avik Roy, who served as a senior adviser to Gov. Rick Perry, also noted the meager details of how a Walker administration would pay for his health care reform package.\n\nYet, forget policy. As of now, Walker\u2019s position in the GOP field is finished. He spent the better part of this month traveling on a motorcycle trying to tell voters that he still has a pulse in this contest. Is a staff shake-up needed? Is that the steroid that needs to be injected into this campaign that no longer registers at the national level? The Washington Post reported there was some chatter that Walker\u2019s campaign manager, Rick Wiley, needs to be shown the exit; that he expanded full-time staff, which currently stands at 90, too fast\u2013and hasn\u2019t invested the summer fundraising haul in a way that pays off dividends. Then again, maybe it\u2019s the messenger and not the message.\n\nStanley S. Hubbard, a top Walker donor, admitted that something is off with his guy:\n\n\u2026He likes what he is hearing from Walker and he doesn't understand why his pitch \"doesn't turn people on.\" \"I think Walker says all the right things,\" he said, but \"something's missing in the demeanor.\"\n\nWell it seems to be all about \"demeanor\" since there will be no staffing shuffles. Those who will be moved will most likely be going to Iowa. Either way, Walker needs to shape up quick, before donors start to jump ship. I know we don\u2019t start voting until February, but when you skip the California Republican Convention, where there is some serious money, people start to get a feeling that your campaign is imploding. Oh, and you get those attending such events really mad by backing out. Also, on a separate note, not really good media attention when you owe vendors $100,000.\n\nNervous vendors to @ScottWalker presidential campaign tell AP they are waiting to be paid more than $100,000 \u2014 Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) September 17, 2015\n\n.@ScottWalker donor Stanley Hubbard tells AP: \"For some reason, the people I'm close to, they aren't getting excited about him,\" \u2014 Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) September 17, 2015\n\n.@ScottWalker campaign manager @rick_wiley tells AP no staff cuts planned, although some Madison-based workers may shift to Iowa \u2014 Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) September 17, 2015\n\n.@ScottWalker spokeswoman @kakukowski tells AP no staff changes requested by donors on call today, none announced \u2014 Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) September 17, 2015\n\nMaybe the whole campaign needs to end. We do have the luxury of choice. Marco Rubio would be the logical choice to ex-Walker fans to flock to\u2013and there\u2019s always the Carly option, though there is the fear that dozens of ICBMs with the words Hewlett-Packard on them could send her campaign into nuclear winter.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s what the hell happened to Walker\u2013and should he pack it in and call it a night? It sure looks that way\u2013and that's quite the punch to the gut for someone who had up until recently been viewed as a top-tier candidate.\n\n*Credit for that description goes to Politico's Mike Allen", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is this the end? .05/25/2016 23:46:30PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Is this the end?", "title": "Matt Vespa - Is It Time For Walker To Say A Painful Goodbye To His 2016 Ambitions?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/21/is-it-time-for-walker-to-call-it-a-day-n2054677", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/257/2015-09-15T012633Z_1_LYNXNPEB8E019_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-WALKER.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Is this the end?", "title": "Matt Vespa - Is It Time For Walker To Say A Painful Goodbye To His 2016 Ambitions?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/21/is-it-time-for-walker-to-call-it-a-day-n2054677", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/257/2015-09-15T012633Z_1_LYNXNPEB8E019_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-WALKER.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Is It Time For Walker To Say A Painful Goodbye To His 2016 Ambitions? , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddaa7\"", "article_summary": "Tom Coburn, the former senator from Oklahoma, said Mr. Walker \u201cmight not be ready for prime time.\u201d Mike Lee, a senator from Utah, said he was \u201cdoubtful\u201d about Mr. Walker before meeting him.\nScott Walker.\nRight now, that should be the mood permeating through the Scott Walker campaign.\nAfter he jumped into the 2016 ring, there was this Politico piece detailing those Walker had defeated in his past elections.\n@ScottWalker campaign manager @rick_wiley tells AP no staff cuts planned, although some Madison-based workers may shift to Iowa \u2014 Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) September 17, 2015."}
