We continue to see advances in the response to HIV: treatments have improved, and we now have the Affordable Care Act to help meet the healthcare needs of thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nBut in this time of hope, the Federal World AIDS Day theme for this year\u2014Shared Responsibility: Strengthening Results for an AIDS-Free Generation\u2014reminds us that we still have more to do.\n\nOne thing that helps us to share responsibility and to strengthen results is to focus on HIV\u2019s impact on individuals. That\u2019s why we asked one of HHS\u2019 lead voices on HIV issues to share his personal perspective on the epidemic. Please watch this video with Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, Infectious Diseases, and Director of the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy\u2014and then share it with your colleagues and friends.\n\nPlease join us in observing the day by participating in #FacingAIDS and sharing the HIV Testing Sites & Care Services Locator.
