This was to avoid a potential sexual harrassment lawsuit, although the woman also agreed to stay silent about NKU and her former employer.\n\nNorthern Kentucky University president Geoff Mearns, who negotiated the final settlement with former associate athletic director Chrissy Soards in conjunction with the Scott Eaton scandal. (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) Story Highlights NKU paid former associate athletic director $200,000 in 2013 to avoid sexual harassment lawsuit.\n\nChrissy Soards worked for former AD Scott Eaton, who was later fired for ethical violations.\n\nEaton had sexual affairs with several NKU workers and at least one adult student.\n\nEaton now serving 10 years for embezzling $311,000 from the school over 4 years.\n\nNorthern Kentucky University paid the subordinate of convicted embezzler Scott Eaton nearly a quarter of a million dollars two years ago to avoid a potential sexual harassment lawsuit and gained that worker\u2019s subsequent silence \u2013 the only such settlement NKU reached in the wake of the Eaton scandal, The Enquirer has learned.\n\nFormer NKU associate athletic director for compliance Chrissy Soards first complained to the school about the behavior of her boss Eaton in early March 2013, school officials acknowledged last week. The Enquirer previously reported that the first phone call about Eaton came in on March 8.\n\nOn March 16, the school fired Eaton for ethics violations, and two days later, Soards signed the $200,000 settlement agreement. The Enquirer obtained the agreement through a series of open records requests.\n\nNKU later discovered Eaton stole $311,000 from NKU using a university-issued credit card, and that he had inappropriate relationships with at least four women on campus, including an adult student.\n\nThe university has steadfastly refused to identify the women involved, although Board of Regents chairman Dennis Repenning this week acknowledged to The Enquirer that Soards and her attorney had threatened the school with a sexual harassment lawsuit.\n\nRepenning also said Soards\u2019 initial complaint threatened legal action and was the first sign anything was amiss with Eaton\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThis was the first we had heard about Eaton\u2019s activities ... prior to that, we thought he was a Boy Scout,\u201d said Repenning, an Erlanger-based lawyer. \u201cHe seemed to be everybody\u2019s favorite. Once we learned of this activity, this whole house of cards just fell apart.\n\n\u201cAnd I would not accept any characterization that we bought this woman\u2019s silence ... that would be incredibly unfair to the individual involved.\u201d\n\nEaton pleaded guilty to felony theft charges in April 2014 and is serving a 10-year sentence in the Campbell County Detention Center in Newport.\n\nSoards resigned from the school on March 25, less than two weeks after Eaton was fired. The settlement prohibits Soards from suing the school or helping anyone else sue the school. It was signed on March 18, 2013, and the payments were to be made by April 1, 2013. It also referred to a pre-existing and unrelated workers\u2019 compensation case Soards brought against the school. She is still eligible for her retirement benefits through the Kentucky Retirement System.\n\n\u201cSoards agrees not to hereafter initiate a lawsuit based on any claims released by her ... be party to such a lawsuit, or in any way assist or cooperate with any other person or entity of any kind or nature against NKU,\u201d the agreement states. It also requires her not to speak about the agreement and \u201cnot to make any statements or remarks that are disparaging toward\u201d NKU or anyone at the school.\n\nRepenning said the settlement \u201cwas a big deal for us ... this was no drop in the bucket.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo hundred thousand bucks is nothing to sneeze at and, as a lawyer myself, that is not a small number,\u201d Repenning said. \u201cLook at what she was making and we are talking about three years of her salary and benefits.\u201d\n\nNKU settled quickly,\n\nnow seeks reimbursement\n\nAt the time of the settlement, Soards was NKU\u2019s athletic compliance officer, making sure the school adhered to all the rules set forth by the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). She started working at the university in 2005, according to her personnel file, also obtained through open records requests.\n\nReporting directly to Eaton, Soards was earning $55,017.96 annually when she left the school. That\u2019s 24 percent more than the $44,195.64 Soards earned in 2010, although she received a 13.6 percent boost later in 2010 that was part of a campus-wide pay raise program.\n\nSoards declined comment through her attorney Barbara Bonar of Covington, citing the settlement\u2019s confidentiality clause. Bonar also declined comment on the case, including when Soards initially threatened a lawsuit against NKU, citing the same confidentiality clause. Bonar also said she had no knowledge of Soards\u2019 claim for workers\u2019 compensation and that it predated her other legal issues with NKU.\n\n\u201cWe did not represent her on that case,\u201d Bonar said.\n\nNKU president Geoff Mearns, who approved the final agreement, deferred comment to university spokesman Chris Cole.\n\nThe settlement was made \u201cto eliminate any possible distraction or reduction in resources as we investigated the full damage done to the school by Scott Eaton,\u201d Cole said.\n\nThe document itself does not list specific issues with the school. Coles declined to say whether Soards was romantically involved with Eaton.\n\n\u201cWe have released a lot of information about this case but one thing we have remained consistent on is our commitment to respect the privacy of the other individuals involved, so therefore we will not release their names,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThis is the only settlement agreement that was made in connection with the investigation of Scott Eaton.\u201d\n\nAfter Soards\u2019 initial contact in early March 2013, Mearns asked the school\u2019s board of regents for guidance, Cole and Repenning said. Mearns then approved the final settlement.\n\n\u201cThis all happened very quickly ... within a matter of weeks,\u201d Cole said. He added that the school also was bound by the agreement\u2019s confidentialty clause, which he said prohibited NKU from discussing the settlement unless \u201cbound by law.\u201d\n\nCole also declined to discuss Soards\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation case, citing privacy laws, saying only that it was unrelated to the Eaton situation.\n\nNKU is part of the state public university system, which is funded in part by tuition, student fees and state/federal tax dollars. The school has a budget of about $225 million annually.\n\nThe school is seeking reimbursement from Eaton as well as its insurance company for both the stolen money and the $200,000 settlement with Soards, Cole said. Like most major public institutions, NKU has an indemnity insurance policy to cover lawsuits, settlements and thefts.\n\n\u201cWe know that we will recoup some of that settlement from the insurance company, we just don\u2019t yet know how much,\u201d Cole said.\n\nPossible violation\n\nof open records laws\n\nThe university initially denied The Enquirer access to any documents surrounding Soards or Eaton two years ago, citing the ongoing investigation at the time. Cole, however, said there is no record of any initial specific requests for settlements associated with the case from 2013.\n\nNKU again denied access to the agreement when The Enquirer specifically requested any settlements with Soards or others involved with the case in an October 2014 open records request. NKU said the request sought \u201cforty plus years\u201d of settlement records, and that it \u201cplaces an unreasonable burden\u201d on the school. The document was produced only after The Enquirer threatened legal action last month to enforce its right to access the public record.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that there was a misinterpretation of the request and once we realized that the request was more narrow than we originally thought, we produced the document within a week,\u201d Cole said.\n\nThe Enquirer\u2019s Fort Mitchell-based attorney, Lyn Hils Mathews of the firm Graydon Head, said NKU\u2019s initial response violated state open records law, but it was unclear if the settlement agreement had been willfully withheld by NKU.\n\n\u201cWe hope that NKU will put systems in place in the future to allow it to make an efficient and good faith search of its records to provide a complete response to a records request the first time around,\u201d Mathews said. \u201cNeither The Enquirer nor the public should be forced to obtain legal counsel just to gain access to non-exempt public records.\u201d\n\nEaton declined visit requests made to him at the Campbell County Detention Center.\n\nHis actions and the subsequent scandal rocked NKU during Mearns\u2019 first year at the school.\n\nNorthern Kentucky University and Scott Eaton Scandal Timeline\n\nMarch 8, 2013 - Chrissy Soards or her attorney approaches NKU administrators, threatening a possible sexual harassment lawsuit in conjunction with the actions of Scott Eaton.\n\nMarch 16, 2013 - NKU president Geoff Mearns announces the firing of Eaton for \u201cethical violations.\u201d Those included affairs with NKU employees, including subordinates, as well as at least one adult-aged student.
