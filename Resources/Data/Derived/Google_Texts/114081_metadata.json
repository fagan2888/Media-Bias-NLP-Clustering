Then why does the ACLU support \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that won\u2019t assist the federal Department of Homeland Security in enforcing immigration law?\n\nOn Oct. 20, the ACLU crowed that it was a \u201cleader in a broad coalition\u201d that helped block via a 54-45 Senate cloture vote a bill halting funding to over 350 \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities.\n\nWhether it\u2019s tens of thousands of \u201cunaccompanied minors\u201d at the southern border, or shiploads of migrants from the Middle East, the progressive drumbeat is more, more, more.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of fundamentally transforming America through mass, multicultural immigration that will swamp social services, followed by the creation of millions of new \u201ccitizens\u201d who support progressive candidates and causes.\n\nThe Washington Post, whose scribes reflexively paint America as a bigoted place needing adult supervision from the United Nations, ran a piece last Wednesday reminding us that a majority of Americans in the 1930s opposed accepting Jews who were fleeing the Nazis.\n\nWell, that was bad, but the comparison is nonsensical. Jews did not then nor have now a subset of radicals threatening to blow up American cities. What was xenophobia or anti-Semitism in the \u201830s is not remotely like being cautious about importing a fifth column of Islamists that will undermine our freedom and security.\n\nBut terrorism is not the only reason to bar mass numbers of Muslim immigrants. As Europe is finding out, most of these immigrants refuse to assimilate, and pose a growing threat to the host countries, whose cultures are based on Christian notions of human rights.\n\nAuthor William Federer summarizes the problem we face trying to balance compassion toward refugees from Muslim lands and our own survival as a free people:\n\n\u201cIf the West naively promotes tolerance of a belief system that does not promote tolerance, it is effectively promoting intolerance. If the West refuses to promote [or import] an intolerant belief system, it is accused of being intolerant.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Federer chronicles in his book \u201cWhat Every American Needs to Know about the Qur\u2019an: A History of Islam and the United States,\u201d the Constitution is utterly incompatible with Islam\u2019s main texts \u2014 the Koran and the Hadith.\n\nNumerous verses prescribe the death penalty to \u201cinfidels\u201d who refuse to convert to Islam, which means \u201csubmission to Allah.\u201d For Muslims who convert to other religions, the penalty is also death.\n\nBoth Muslim texts relegate Christians, Jews and other non-Muslims as \u201cdhimmis\u201d (second-class citizens). Although official dhimmitude has ceased in many Muslim countries, the vast majority do not respect basic rights \u2014 especially for women \u2014 that Americans take for granted, such as driving, voting or owning property.\n\nAfter years of immigration from North Africa, the Paris metro area has \u201cNo-Go\u201d zones where French police won\u2019t dare enter, and women caught without head scarfs are beaten \u2014 or worse.\n\nIn Muslim countries, Shariah means second-class status for non-Muslims with discriminatory taxes and religious suppression. At worst, it means brutal persecution, including rape, slavery and executions, sometimes by crucifixion, as we are seeing Christians suffer in areas controlled by the Islamic State or by Boko Haram in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSpeaking of Christians, scores of ancient church-based communities in Iraq and Syria are being wiped out. Yet President Obama ignores the ongoing genocide and instead welcomes exponentially more Muslim refugees.\n\nShouldn\u2019t this bother all those pastors who reflexively support Mr. Obama no matter what he does? Secretary of State John Kerry said the administration wants to bring in 185,000 refugees through 2017, including 10,000 from Syria. If Europe is any indication, as The Washington Times\u2019 online opinion editor Monica Crowley noted in a recent column, the vast majority of such migrants will be young Muslim men, not families, as part of a hijra, or conquest through migration.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush opine that America\u2019s refugee policy should favor Christians, who not only face genocide but share American cultural values. Rick Santorum argues that we should resettle all such refugees in the Middle East instead of aiding the would-be caliphate in cleansing the area of Christians. Either way, Christians are not the problem.\n\n\u201cThere is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIf there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation.\u201d\n\nThe progressive left, with the ACLU leading the pack, has excoriated these common-sense observations as \u201cfear mongering\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d\n\nWill we be allowed to respectfully disagree a few years hence if current trends continue?\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a Washington Times contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If, as Franklin Roosevelt said, \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" we might have to redefine \"fear.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If, as Franklin Roosevelt said, \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d we might have to redefine \u201cfear.\u201d", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Progressive left slams common-sense precautions on Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/robert-knight-progressive-left-slams-common-sense-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/21/Establishment_Syrians_Unwanted_Refugees.JPEG-03cf6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/21/Establishment_Syrians_Unwanted_Refugees.JPEG-03cf6.jpg", "description": "If, as Franklin Roosevelt said, \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" we might have to redefine \"fear.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Progressive left slams common-sense precautions on Syri"}, "Author": "Robert Knight", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Social Issues, Politics, American Civil Liberties Union"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f59\"", "article_summary": "Then why does the ACLU support \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that won\u2019t assist the federal Department of Homeland Security in enforcing immigration law?\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a Washington Times contributor.\nIt\u2019s all part of fundamentally transforming America through mass, multicultural immigration that will swamp social services, followed by the creation of millions of new \u201ccitizens\u201d who support progressive candidates and causes.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:If, as Franklin Roosevelt said, \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d we might have to redefine \u201cfear.\u201dTo the progressive left, \u201cfear\u201d means taking common-sense precautions to protect our citizens, such as the House\u2019s 289 to 137 vote on Thursday rejecting President Obama\u2019s Syrian refugee plan.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said the administration wants to bring in 185,000 refugees through 2017, including 10,000 from Syria."}
