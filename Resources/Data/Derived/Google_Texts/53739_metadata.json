Diane Black, who re-introduced the \u201cTitle X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act,\u201d served as a nurse for over 40 years. She believes this video shows that Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t living up to the requirements set forth by the federal government in order to receive funding.\n\n\u201cThis is not family planning, this is family destruction,\u201d said Black, a Republican.\n\n\u201cI think the exposure to what is happening at Planned Parenthood is making people more aware of just what they are doing. On one side of the clinic they are doing what they make the public believe is the essential piece of what their programs are, and on the other side they are doing abortions,\u201d Black added.\n\n\u201cI am passionately pro-life but this latest discovery has taken us beyond the pro-life versus pro-abortion debate. This is about basic decency and humanity,\u201d Black commented in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Black addressed the following:\n\n1:14 Why she re-introduced a bill in January to end Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding.\n\n1:40 How do you respond to those who defend Planned Parenthood by saying the organization provides health services to minorities and the poor?", "article_metadata": {"description": "An interview with Rep.
