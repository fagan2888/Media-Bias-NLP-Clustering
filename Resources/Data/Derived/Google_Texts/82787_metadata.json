If they\u2019re not instructing the faithful to spew ObamaCare talking points over the Thanksgiving turkey, they\u2019re telling kids to crack down their families for thoughtcrimes. Such was Mrs. Obama\u2019s command to high-school students in Topeka, Kansas last weekend, as reported by The Blaze:\n\nObama said students need to police family and friends because federal laws can only go so far in stopping racism. \u201c[O]ur laws may no longer separate us based on our skin color, but nothing in the Constitution says we have to eat together in the lunchroom, or live together in the same neighborhoods,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no court case against believing in stereotypes or thinking that certain kinds of hateful jokes or comments are funny.\u201d To address these limitations in the law, Obama asked students to take steps to \u201cdrag my generation and your grandparents\u2019 generation along with you\u201d in the fight against racism. \u201cMaybe that starts simply in your own family, when grandpa tells that off-colored joke at Thanksgiving, or you\u2019ve got an aunt [that] talks about \u2018those people,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWell, you can politely inform them that they\u2019re talking about your friends. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s when you go off to college and you decide to join a sorority or fraternity, and you ask the question, how can we get more diversity in our next pledge class?\u201d she added. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s years from now, when you\u2019re on the job and you\u2019re the one who asks, do we really have all the voices and viewpoints we need at this table? \u201cBut no matter what you do, the point is to never be afraid to talk about these issues, particularly the issue of race,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember when the Obamas were touted as the harbingers of a post-racial, unified America. In reality, it\u2019s become all-racism, all-the-time, in every tiny corner of our lives \u2013 not to mention the remorseless equation of political dissent with racism by Obama surrogates, and the Democrats\u2019 scorched-earth campaign to hang on to the Senate in 2014 by throwing gasoline on every racial fire they can find.\n\nThere\u2019s so much creepy and wrong with Mrs. Obama\u2019s speech \u2013 all of which we\u2019re supposed to ignore, because the scourge of racism is so terrible that any means are justified to ending it \u2013 that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. But maybe we should start there, because nothing good ever comes of these \u201cby any means necessary\u201d crusades. There are far worse social crises to deal with than Grandpa\u2019s off-color jokes, or the latest uncomfortable turn of phrase from Auntie Those People. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that a truly post-racial America will be considerably less paranoid and uptight than what Mrs. Obama envisions here.\n\nThat\u2019s a lovely backhanded insult to older people she delivered, by talking about how the kids need to \u201cdrag\u201d their benighted elders into the enlightened future. The moral vanity of the young audience must have been greatly flattered.\n\nBut then we segue into the stuff about enforced \u201cdiversity\u201d in pledge classes and places of employment, and once again we have a liberal encouraging Americans to view themselves as criminals, presumed guilty of racism whenever bean-counting produces an insufficiently diverse mix of colors at the lunch table, sorority bake sale, or business meeting. Notice how the First Lady also assumes diverse \u201cvoices and viewpoints\u201d \u2013 a phrase no one associated with our rigidly doctrinaire liberal President should be allowed to use without getting laughed off the stage \u2013 equate automatically to skin color.\n\nMrs. Obama then built upon her lament about how we\u2019re not legally obligated to eat at racially integrated lunch tables by warning about the return of \u201csegregation\u201d:\n\nWhile Obama praised the student body for being racially diverse, she said segregation is happening again in some parts of the country, as some people are moving away and leaving city schools. She said that is leading to segregation that is as bad as it was decades ago. \u201cSo today, by some measures, our schools are as segregated as they were back when Dr. King gave his final speech,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSegregation\u201d is not the right word for people voluntarily choosing to move into, or out of, certain areas. Not a single school in the United States of America is \u201csegregated\u201d at all. It\u2019s a powerful term with a very specific meaning. It refers to a historical injustice, which the American people deserve better than to be accused of in 2014. This business of pretending we\u2019re one tiny misstep away from tumbling back to 1964, or maybe even 1854, is getting ridiculous, not to mention insulting.\n\nThe \u201cremedy\u201d for what Mrs. Obama describes as \u201csegregation\u201d would be\u2026 what? Forcing us to relocate at gunpoint, until every community has the officially prescribed mixture of ethnic backgrounds? Would black people who chose to live in certain neighborhoods be forced to relocate into predominantly white neighborhoods as well? Or are we supposed to abandon thoughts of \u201cfixing\u201d the problem and just feel guilty and inferior?\n\nWe can prevent officially-sanctioned discriminatory behavior, and we have done so. It\u2019s quite different to demand the modification of people\u2019s thoughts, under the threat of vigilante justice at the dinner table. It\u2019s very unlikely that racist thoughts can be completely expunged from the minds of fallen humanity, but we can set high standards for brotherhood and encourage men and woman of every background to meet them. Racialist obsessions are not the high road to meeting that goal, nor are blanket insults casually dropped on broad segments of the population.\n\nAs for encouraging diverse voices and viewpoints\u2026 well, many sitting in Mrs. Obama\u2019s high-school audience were presumably bound for college, where they\u2019ve been having a lot of problems with encouraging a broad spectrum of viewpoints, but very little of it has anything to do with racism.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "So much for post-racial, unified America.", "title": "Mrs. Obama tells high-school kids to monitor their families for racism | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/michelle_obama-480x319.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/05/20/mrs-obama-tells-high-school-kids-to-monitor-their-families-for-racism/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "So much for post-racial, unified America.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/michelle_obama-480x319.jpg", "description": "So much for post-racial, unified America.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2b7\"", "article_summary": "I can\u2019t shake the feeling that a truly post-racial America will be considerably less paranoid and uptight than what Mrs. Obama envisions here.\nThe \u201cremedy\u201d for what Mrs. Obama describes as \u201csegregation\u201d would be\u2026 what?\nSuch was Mrs. Obama\u2019s command to high-school students in Topeka, Kansas last weekend, as reported by The Blaze:Obama said students need to police family and friends because federal laws can only go so far in stopping racism.\nIf they\u2019re not instructing the faithful to spew ObamaCare talking points over the Thanksgiving turkey, they\u2019re telling kids to crack down their families for thoughtcrimes.\nEducation & AcademiaThe Obamas just keep trying to muscle in on our family gatherings and politicize the hell out of them."}
