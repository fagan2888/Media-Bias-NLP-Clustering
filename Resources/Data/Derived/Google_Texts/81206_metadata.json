Maybe one of the simplest activities, like watching a romantic movie and discussing it, can be sweeter than you think. (It doesn't have to be The Notebook.)\n\nResearchers believe that watching movies and discussing them can have a lasting impact on the quality of your relationship; couples who watch movies together may actually lower their chances for divorce, according to a study released recently. The researchers, interested in exploring different \u201ctreatment\u201d options for struggling couples, found that watching five movies about relationships together over the period of a month could cut the divorce rate in half.\n\nThey also examined how couples reacted to other relationship exercises that had nothing to do with watching movies but rather focused on compassion and acceptance training and conflict management. The last exercise, however, did focus on movies as a tool to help couples communicate better. The study included 174 heterosexual couples who were recently married.\n\n\u201cThe results suggest that husbands and wives have a pretty good sense of what they might be doing right and wrong in their relationships,\u201d Ronald Rogge, associate professor of psychology at the University of Rochester and lead author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cThus, you might not need to teach them a whole lot of skills to cut the divorce rate. You might just need to get them to think about how they are currently behaving. And for five movies to give us a benefit over three years \u2014 that is awesome.\u201d\n\nThe researchers studied what occurred in a movie-and-talk group, where participants first attended a 10-minute lecture on relationship awareness, and how watching couples in movies could help them be aware of their own behavior. They watched Two for the Road (1967), a romantic comedy describing a couple\u2019s ups and downs with young love, infidelity, and career stress. Then, the couples were asked to meet alone to discuss 12 questions about the movie couple\u2019s relationship. \u201cWere they able to open up and tell each other how they really felt, or did they tend to just snap at each other with anger? Did they try using humor to keep things from getting nasty?\u201d\n\nWith these questions, the couples were able to look back on their own relationship to see how it may relate to them. They were then tasked with watching one movie per week for about a month, while being required to talk about the narrative with one another for about a half hour afterward. They were able to choose out of 47 movies, like As Good It Gets (1997) and Gone With the Wind (1939). \u201cI think it\u2019s the couples reinvesting in their relationship and taking a cold hard look at their own behavior that makes the difference,\u201d Rogge said. \u201cFor these couples to stop and look and say, \u2018You know, I have yelled at you like that before. I have called you names before and that\u2019s not nice. That\u2019s not what I want to do to the person I love the most.\u2019 Just that insight alone, is likely what makes this intervention work.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of romantic movies out there to watch on Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 whether comedic or not. There\u2019s the Before Sunrise series, for example, which follows the lengthy love affair of a couple who first meet on a train to Vienna and spend one night together falling in love. The three movies, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight are all spaced 9 years apart, and consist mostly of Celine and Jesse, the two protagonists, as they walk and talk their way through a city. The two discuss love, relationships, philosophy, career, and also their changes and how they have grown \u2014 they also experience conflict in the last movie, when they are well into their forties and have kids and career problems.\n\nThere\u2019s also Love Story and Steel Magnolias, both of which are included in the study\u2019s movie list. Interestingly, the study\u2019s authors removed the typical \u201cfalling in love\u201d stories like Sleepless in Seattle or When Harry Met Sally, and focused instead on movies that revealed the difficulties of relationships at their lows and highs. \u201cThe idea that you are supposed to fall in love instantly and effortlessly is not reality and not relevant to most couples who are two, three or four years into a relationship,\u201d Rogge said in the press release, The New York Times reported.\n\nThink of it as a form of self-help. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly portable,\u201d Rogge said in the press release. \u201cThere are really great marriage intervention programs available now but most required trained therapists to administer them. If couples can do this on their own, it makes it so much easier to help them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "valentine's day movie, relationships, couples communication", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Watching a movie for Valentine's Day may be a good way to improve communication in your relationship and help you to better understand one another, research says.", "title": "A Valentine\u2019s Day Movie Could Save Your Relationship", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/valentines-day-movie-could-save-your-relationship-discussing-screen-couples-improves-communication", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/14/couple-watching-tv.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watching a movie for Valentine's Day may be a good way to improve communication in your relationship and help you to better understand one another, research says.", "title": "A Valentine\u2019s Day Movie Could Save Your Relationship", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/valentines-day-movie-could-save-your-relationship-discussing-screen-couples-improves-communication", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/14/couple-watching-tv.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/14/couple-watching-tv.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-14T17:27:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-14T17:26:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Watching a movie for Valentine's Day may be a good way to improve communication in your relationship and help you to better understand one another, research says."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd9f\"", "article_summary": "Then, the couples were asked to meet alone to discuss 12 questions about the movie couple\u2019s relationship.\nMaybe one of the simplest activities, like watching a romantic movie and discussing it, can be sweeter than you think.\nThey also examined how couples reacted to other relationship exercises that had nothing to do with watching movies but rather focused on compassion and acceptance training and conflict management.\nResearchers believe that watching movies and discussing them can have a lasting impact on the quality of your relationship; couples who watch movies together may actually lower their chances for divorce, according to a study released recently.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the couples reinvesting in their relationship and taking a cold hard look at their own behavior that makes the difference,\u201d Rogge said."}
