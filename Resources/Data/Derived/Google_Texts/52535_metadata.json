Ted Cruz, overcoming his attempt to filibuster the stopgap spending bill, which allowed Democrats to add back in full funding for Obamacare and power the bill through the chamber and sending it back to the House.\n\n\u201cThis is it. Time is gone,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who said he will not negotiate with the House GOP anymore. \u201cThey need to accept what we just passed.\u201d\n\nThe 79-19 vote saw 25 Republicans join with all Democrats to advance the bill, easily overcoming Mr. Cruz and his allies who had argued this was the key point that would determine whether major parts of President Obama\u2019s health care law take effect next week.\n\nPHOTOS: Famous quitters: Those who bailed rather than face scandal, scrutiny or stress\n\nOnce that hurdle was cleared, the rest of the votes were preordained. The Senate waived budget rules, voted to strip out the Obamacare defunding on a 54-44 party line vote, and passed the bill.\n\nThe bill now heads back to the House, where Republicans are struggling to figure out a path forward, trapped between a right wing which insists on full defunding and Senate Democrats, who just proved that stance cannot succeed.\n\n\u201cThis is like the movie \u2018High Noon. The two sides are walking down the street. I just hope that like the movie \u2018High Noon,\u2019 I hope the good guys win,\u201d said Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who accused Mr. Cruz and his allies of being anarchists, hoping to destroy government altogether.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama: Health law can\u2019t be stopped by govt. shutdown\n\nHe said the country is facing a situation \u201cevery bit as dangerous\u201d as the lead-up to the Civil War.\n\nFor Republicans, the rhetoric was more muted but the vote was no less weighty.\n\n\u201cDo we just give up?\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who joined Mr. Cruz\u2019s push to block the spending bill.\n\nWithout any action, the government\u2019s authority for basic spending expires at midnight Monday, and operations such as school funding and national parks would have to cease.\n\nThe House has passed a bill to fund government through Dec. 15 but to withhold any money for Obamacare. If all goes according to Senate Democrats\u2019 plans, they will pass their own bill that funds government through Nov. 15 and restores money for the health care law.\n\nDemocrats outflanked Republicans with parliamentary moves that left the GOP in a bitter internal argument over what the votes even meant.\n\nMr. Cruz and his allies argued the key vote was the first one on whether to filibuster the spending bill. They said if the GOP held together, they could successfully halt it, which would force Democrats to have to compromise and halt Obamacare funding or else face a government shutdown.\n\nBut Republican leaders feared that they would be blamed for the shutdown, and argued that a filibuster didn\u2019t make sense because at the point they would be voting, the bill still includes the defunding Obamacare language.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how I can vote otherwise on a matter that I want to see passed,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber.\n\nMr. Cruz and his allies, though, argue that is tantamount to voting for Obamacare funding. Indeed, Republicans have regularly led filibusters before when they\u2019ve argued Democrats structured an unfair floor debate.\n\nDespite their defeat, Mr. Cruz and his chief filibuster ally, Sen. Mike Lee, said the fight goes on.\n\n\u201cThis vote is not the end. It\u2019s not even the beginning of the end. It\u2019s the end of the beginning,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThe American people will always have the final word.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators from both parties linked arms to defy Sen.
