Bush\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign.\n\nBiggest campaign controversy: Cruz\u2019s campaign and supporters spread erroneous information about Ben Carson dropping out of the race as the Feb. 1 evening Iowa caucuses were commencing. Carson accused caucus winner Cruz of resorting to dirty tricks. Cruz apologized for his supporters\u2019 tactics.\n\nSignature campaign line: \u201cIf I\u2019m elected president ... the first thing I plan to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional action taken by Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nNumber of delegates: 226 of 1,237 needed to win\n\nISSUES\n\nFlint: Calls it \u201can absolute travesty.\u201d During during a Jan. 19 campaign stop in New Hampshire, according to NBC News: \u201cIt is a failure at every level of government. It is a failure of the city officials, it is a failure of the county officials, it is a failure of the state officials, and the men and women of Michigan have been betrayed.\u201d\n\nAuto bailout: Opposed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the federal government should be engaged in bailouts. Those industries would have (survived) and thrived.\u201d\n\nTaxes: Wants to establish a flat 10 percent tax rate on ordinary income, capital gains and dividends. Cruz also would increase the standard deduction to $10,000 per filer. Abolishes existing corporate income tax in favor a 16 percent business transfer tax that applies to capital income and labor payments, according to the Tax Foundation. Eliminates the estate tax.\n\nImmigration: Proposes tripling the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexican border. Cruz advocates for the use of a biometric tracking system for legal immigrants entering the country with work visas. Vows to end President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders allowing certain illegal immigrants whose children are legal residents or U.S. citizens to apply for work permits and deportation reprieves. Cruz considers the executive orders a form of amnesty and has vowed to increase the number of deportations by ending the so-called \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d practice. Cruz, who was born in Calgary, Canada, to an American mother and Cuban father, also proposes the end of birthright citizenship for American-born children of illegal immigrants.\n\nHealth care: Has called for total repeal of the Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate to have insurance and the private insurance marketplaces subsidized by taxpayers to contain the costs of coverage. Cruz has said \u201cevery last word\u201d of Obamacare must be repealed and replaced with a law that allows people to buy health insurance across state lines.\n\nAbortion: Opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother. Calls Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling a \u201cdark anniversary.\u201d Backed a Texas law requiring doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Voted to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nIslamic State: Cruz said in a Dec. 5 speech in Iowa that he wants to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d the Islamic militants. \u201cWe will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don\u2019t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d he said. Cruz later clarified that he wouldn\u2019t launch unguided, large-scale bombing raids on IS-controlled cities where civilians are living. \u201cThe object isn\u2019t to level a city,\u201d Cruz told CNN. \u201cThe object is to kill the ISIS terrorists.\u201d\n\nSyrian refugees: Introduced legislation to ban Syrian Muslim refugees from entering the country.\n\nSource: Detroit News research\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1p0ojiv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "U.S. senator weighs in on issues from Flint to Islamic State", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "U.S. senator weighs in on issues from Flint to Islamic State", "title": "Where does Ted Cruz stand on the issues?", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/03/02/ted-cruz-stand-issues/81243190/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. senator weighs in on issues from Flint to Islamic State", "title": "Where does Ted Cruz stand on the issues?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33227ee044f467250e5aabe04726559567effd99/c=824-0-4104-3280&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/02/DetroitNews/B99364127Z.1_20160302194109_000_GSSR6M43.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, u.s. sen. ted cruz, texas, michigan, march 8, presidential primary,"}, "article_summary": "Islamic State: Cruz said in a Dec. 5 speech in Iowa that he wants to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d the Islamic militants.\nAbolishes existing corporate income tax in favor a 16 percent business transfer tax that applies to capital income and labor payments, according to the Tax Foundation.\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen.
