But if you\u2019re not numb to it already, get used to this phrase, because you\u2019re going to hear it constantly in the weeks and months to come:\n\n\u201cJeb Bush, the moderate former governor of Florida\u2026\u201d\n\nIn terms of convenient but factually dubious crutches that will be leaned on constantly by the horse-race media, the \u201cBush-the-moderate\u201d narrative is poised to blow its competition out of the water. Its lesser cousin, \u201cBush-the-genius,\u201d won\u2019t even come close.\n\nThe problem with seeing Jeb Bush this way is rather simple: Unless \u201cmoderate\u201d simply means \u201cto the left of Ted Cruz\u201d \u2014 which, to be fair, it very well might! \u2014 it is a terrible descriptor for Bush\u2019s record. Indeed, when University of Northern Florida professor Matthew Corrigan needed a name for his new book on Bush, he went with \u201cConservative Hurricane: How Jeb Bush Remade Florida.\u201d He did so with good reason, as his review of Bush\u2019s track record demonstrates \u2014 on education and affirmative action, on taxes and reproductive rights \u2014 he did so with good reason.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke with Corrigan over the phone about his book. Our conversation touches not only on Bush\u2019s policy record, but also his governing style, his personality type, his vision of the role of government and how he\u2019d likely act if he became the United States\u2019 45th president. You can find our discussion, which has been edited for clarity and length, below.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about when you started paying close attention to Gov. Bush?\n\nI\u2019ve been a professor here [at the University of North Florida] for about 20 years and I started paying attention to him not as much in his first campaign but more in his second campaign in 1998. He came on as such an important force, and what I mean by that is that he was running against a lieutenant governor whose name was known but wasn\u2019t the personality that Jeb Bush was. When he campaigned and he won, you knew that we were in for a different type of governor here in Florida, so that\u2019s when I started paying attention to him.\n\nWhen I started thinking about writing the book was later, because I had written a book on the Bush and Clinton families and their quest for the presidency and one of the chapters in that book was on Jeb. I got interested in him and, of course, being here in Florida just magnified it. That\u2019s when I decided to write the book on him. When I wrote the book, I didn\u2019t know, obviously, that he\u2019d be probably running for president. I thought he might, but I wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nFor people outside of Florida, Jeb Bush isn\u2019t all that well known as a political commodity. What is the Jeb Bush personality?\n\nI think he has a particular style. He is not a glad-hander, maybe like George W., and he\u2019s not a stirring speech-giver like President Obama, but he\u2019s very good at answering questions and he magnifies belief in executive power, belief that if he\u2019s going to lead government we\u2019re going to get things done. With the Bush last name and with his forceful personality \u2014 and I would say that his personality as governor is different from the personality that\u2019s being seen in the media today; he seems to be much more moderate in style.\n\nHe was conservative as a governor, but [he\u2019s showcasing] a much more open expression, a much more moderate way of reacting to everything from reporters\u2019 questions to unflattering media inquiries and things like that. Let me give you an example: When the gay marriage issue came up recently, he said something to the effect that he was for so-called traditional marriage but we need to respect all sides. I\u2019m not sure you would have heard that especially during his first term as governor, because he was very conservative on socio-cultural issues. It was basically the idea of, hey, there\u2019s a right and a wrong on these issues and I\u2019m in the right. I think the overall personality \u2014 at least the outward image \u2014 has changed somewhat since he\u2019s left the governorship.\n\nPart of the way the media presents him to the national audience is as a moderate and a technocrat. Does that come through if you look at his time as governor?\n\nOne of the reasons that he\u2019s been seen as a moderate is because of the emergence of the Tea Party. If you go back to the 1994 race, which he lost, you could argue that he was the Ted Cruz of his time. He really talked about eliminating our state Department of Education. There was the infamous comment about African-Americans, when he was asked what he\u2019d do for blacks at the time, and said, probably nothing.\n\nWhen he won in \u201998 he definitely changed his manner and approach but he still had very conservative policies. I think what people don\u2019t realize is that his social and cultural agenda gets mixed up a little bit with his stance on immigration reform because they see that as the moderate or even liberal position on immigration", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the dominant media narrative, Jeb Bush runs to the center.
