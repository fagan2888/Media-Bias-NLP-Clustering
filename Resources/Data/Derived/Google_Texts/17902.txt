The Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday said former criminal offenders can be insured by Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for the poor.

People on probation, parole, under house arrest or living in halfway homes who otherwise are Medicaid-eligible can access the program, HHS clarified.

The move could insure up to 96,000 people this year in states that expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act, the agency said.

"Historically, the vast majority of justice-involved individuals have been uninsured, while experiencing disproportionately high rates of chronic conditions, infectious disease and behavioral health issues," HHS said.
