Coming up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan adds some musical flare to his program, welcoming Sheryl Crow for a face to face, primetime exclusive interview.

A nine-time Grammy Award winner, who has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide, Crow soon finds the conversation drifting away from music, as the host offers up one of his favorite questions:

"How many times have you been properly in love, in your life," asks Morgan, in his trademark probing fashion.

With relationships and romances often serving as the thematic heartbeat of her songwriting, Crow's answer isn't all that surprising:

"Many, many. With some very famous people, and some very not famous people," she shares. "I've been engaged three times."

Offering a rare window into her private life, Crow goes on to reveal details of a previous relationship, including specifics about couture that lasted much longer than the couple:

"I am very close to Ralph Lauren, I love him very much," she explains. "I still have the sketches for the wedding dress he designed for me. I got rid of the guy I was going to marry, but I still have the sketches."

Speaking honestly, the woman with eight studio albums to her credit admits that she is often to blame for failings in her love life:

"I take great credit, for some of the demises," says Crow, whose newest record, "Feels Like Home," was released this week. "It's difficult to date a woman who's strong, and who runs a business, and who's gone a lot."

Watch the clip for more of Morgan's interview with Crow – including the portion in which the singer addresses frequently reported similarities she shares with actress Jennifer Aniston – and for the full episode of "Piers Morgan Live," tune to CNN at 9.
