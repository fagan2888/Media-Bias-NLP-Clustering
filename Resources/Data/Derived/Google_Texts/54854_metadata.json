One volunteer firefighter from Hoven said he worked on the putting out the fire for over eight hours, and he has never seen a fire this intense in his five years of volunteering in the small community.\n\nThe residents of the small-town say it will be difficult to replace the building, and the memories, of the school that has stood in Hoven for decades.\n\n\u201cIt's devastating to lose the high school. Most people went to the high school. They lost their class composites. It's just devastating to the community,\u201d Superintendent Peggy Petersen.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nNobody was hurt in the fire. School had let out for the summer last Wednesday.\n\nWe will have more reaction from the community on this tragic event coming up tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News at 10.\n\nVideo Courtesy of Blair Ruckman", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "People in a small town in north-central South Dakota have lost a centerpiece of their community.
