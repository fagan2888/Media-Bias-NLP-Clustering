Wessington Springs, SD

Residents of Wessington Springs are cleaning up after a devastating tornado ripped through the small town earlier this week, but they aren't alone.

156 National Guard Soldiers initially responded after the disaster. Currently there are 49 still helping out around town. The plan is for the soldiers to stay in town until the cleanup is finished.

The guard initially provided security for the community by locking down the town so residents could collect belongings. Now the guard is assisting with picking up the debris across.

Even with all the heartbreak, the Wessington Community is grateful for what the National Guard is providing.

"Just to direct traffic and barricade roads. It was very, very, beneficial," Luanne Thompson said.

There are three companies currently in Wessington Springs; one from Sturgis, Belle Fourche, one from Pierre, Chamberlain, Mobridge, and also from Madison.
