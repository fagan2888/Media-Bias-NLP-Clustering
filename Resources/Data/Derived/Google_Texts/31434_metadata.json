Companies that trade on the Pink Sheets do not file financial reports with the SEC.\n\n\u201cWe are both saddened and confused by the actions taken against us by the federal government,\u201d Dittman said in the statement. \u201cWe intend to cooperate with the authorities \u2026 to show our prior actions were taken in good faith.\u201d\n\nNeither Dittman nor Sears responded to efforts to reach them.\n\nThe company said the SEC has inquired about its 2012 financial statements, revenue receipts and its failure to disclose Sears purchases of company stock.\n\nIt also said Sears is currently or had been affiliated with four companies that do business with FusionPharm, including Meadpoint Venture Partners, Bayside Realty Holdings, and Vertifresh.\n\nIn the New York case, Sears was sentenced to one month in prison, to be served at a facility as close to Thornton as possible, records show, and was later confined to his home for six months. He also paid a $15,000 fine and was on three years of supervised probation.\n\nHe was indicted with two others for allegedly manipulating the price of shares of a company, Vencap Inc., a business that purportedly developed and sold projection display screens to supermarkets.\n\nLike FusionPharm, Vencap was traded on the Pink Sheets.\n\nSears was CEO of Vencap\u2019s subsidiary, Vidiem. According to court filings, the alleged plan was to manipulate artificial demand for Vencap by paying bribes to stock brokers who in turn would have clients buy the company\u2019s stock.\n\nTheir plan was dismantled by undercover investigators who worked as brokers and puffed up the stock to nearly a dime a share from a penny.\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba02\"", "article_summary": "The SEC stopped trading on FusionPharm stock on May 16 over concerns about certain financial disclosures.\nFusionPharm was the fifth pot-related company to have sales of its stock halted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nCommon stock trading for FusionPharm Inc., a Denver-based company that recycles shipping containers into greenhouses marketed to cannabis growers, resumed trading Monday amid a federal securities inquiry into its activity.\nLike FusionPharm, Vencap was traded on the Pink Sheets.\nThe company said the SEC has inquired about its 2012 financial statements, revenue receipts and its failure to disclose Sears purchases of company stock."}
