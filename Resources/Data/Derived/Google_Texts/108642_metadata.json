The fan nodded.\n\n\"But you want the country to lock its doors?\" he continued, receiving a confused look from the fan in response.\n\nBack in New York, O'Reilly asked Watters which team's fans were more informed on pressing current events.\n\n\"At the last minute, Yale won,\" Watters said, noting that the verdict was controversial, as a Harvard student ran away before answering the final two questions.\n\n\"Head to head, Yale won, but if it was a test, they both bombed,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "11-24-14", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/wattersbearguy.png", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Watters' World: Harvard vs. Yale Tailgate Quiz\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/11\\/24\\/watters-world-harvard-vs-yale-tailgate-quiz\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/wattersbearguy.png\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-24T18:32:40-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"70749\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "This week, O&#039;Reilly Factor correspondent&amp;nbsp;Jesse Watters traveled to Cambridge, Mass. for the annual Harvard/Yale football game.Two female Yale fans told Watters they were having a &#039;very classy tailgate&#039;, while a", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.subject": "This week, O&#039;Reilly Factor correspondent&amp;nbsp;Jesse Watters traveled to Cambridge, Mass. for the annual Harvard/Yale football game.Two female Yale fans told Watters they were having a &#039;very classy tailgate&#039;, while a", "description": "This week, O&#039;Reilly Factor correspondent&amp;nbsp;Jesse Watters traveled to Cambridge, Mass. for the annual Harvard/Yale football game.Two female Yale fans told Watters they were having a &#039;very classy tailgate&#039;, while a", "prism.section": "nation", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "Watters' World: Harvard vs. Yale Tailgate Quiz", "dcterms.created": "11-24-14", "og": {"site_name": "FoxNation.com", "description": "This week, O&#039;Reilly Factor correspondent&amp;nbsp;Jesse Watters traveled to Cambridge, Mass. for the annual Harvard/Yale football game.Two female Yale fans told Watters they were having a &#039;very classy tailgate&#039;, while a", "title": "Watters' World: Harvard vs. Yale Tailgate Quiz", "url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/11/24/watters-world-harvard-vs-yale-tailgate-quiz", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/wattersbearguy.png", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "This week, O&#039;Reilly Factor correspondent&amp;nbsp;Jesse Watters traveled to Cambridge, Mass. for the annual Harvard/Yale football game.Two female Yale fans told Watters they were having a &#039;very classy tailgate&#039;, while a", "dc.date": "2016-05-26", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Watters' World: Harvard vs. Yale Tailgate Quiz\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/11\\/24\\/watters-world-harvard-vs-yale-tailgate-quiz\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/wattersbearguy.png\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-24T18:32:40-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"70749\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2600\"", "article_summary": "Two female Yale fans told Watters they were having a 'very classy tailgate', while a male Harvard tailgater later commented on the visiting Bulldogs using an expletive.\n\"At the last minute, Yale won,\" Watters said, noting that the verdict was controversial, as a Harvard student ran away before answering the final two questions.\nWatters asked.\nBack in New York, O'Reilly asked Watters which team's fans were more informed on pressing current events.\nIn the midst of interviewing another Harvard fan, host Bill O'Reilly made an unsuspected visit to the correspondent's World."}
