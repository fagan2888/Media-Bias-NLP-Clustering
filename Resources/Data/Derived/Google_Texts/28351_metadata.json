Jeb Bush talks alternative to Obamacare 'monstrosity'\n\nJeb Bush says that Obamacare is a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d and wants the government to focus instead on a catastrophic coverage plan to help people who experience costly medical crises.\n\nThe potential Republican 2016 presidential contender said that he doesn\u2019t see Obamacare being repealed before President Barack Obama leaves office. But once it is, he wants to see a different plan.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe effort by the state, by the government, ought to be to try to create catastrophic coverage, where there is relief for families in our country, where if you have a hardship that goes way beyond your means of paying for it, the government is there or an entity is there to help you deal with that,\u201d Bush said in Iowa last weekend. \u201cThe rest of it ought to be shifted back where individuals are empowered to make more decisions themselves.\u201d\n\nCatastrophic health plans are typically less expensive than a comprehensive insurance policy and only cover health costs in the case of a major medical event such as a cancer diagnosis or significant injury. The plus side for the consumer is that they are cheap; the downside is that they don\u2019t cover care for more routine illnesses or conditions, including doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nBush called Obamacare a \u201cmonstrosity of consolidating power in Washington, D.C.,\u201d saying the law suppresses wages and adds uncertainty to investment. The former Florida governor labeled it the greatest job suppressor in the \u201cso-called recovery.\u201d\n\nBush has long voiced opposition to Obamacare and has stressed that the GOP\u2019s best response would be a solid alternative. He said he\u2019d rather see a health system that is \u201cconsumer-directed\u201d and gives the patient a relationship with his or her health provider.\n\n\u201cWe restore [a patient-doctor relationship in the health system] by repealing \u2014 if possible at some point, I think that\u2019s post presidency of Barack Obama \u2014 the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,\u201d Bush said Friday at a fundraiser for Iowa Rep. David Young. \u201cAnd replacing it with a model that is consumer directed, where consumers, where patients, have more choices, where they have more of a direct relationship; where the subsidies, if there were to be subsidies, are state administered; and if there are to be exchanges, they aren\u2019t coercive exchanges; where there\u2019s no employer mandate, employee mandate or requirements of services provided that are extraordinary; where people have more customized types of insurance based on their needs; and it\u2019s more consumer-directed so that they\u2019re more engaged in the decision-making, and they have more choices than what they have today.\u201d\n\nBush cited Medicaid reforms that he put into place in Florida, which he calls a defined contribution plan, and says that he increased patient and physician satisfaction and reduced costs.\n\nKatie Glueck contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He said he doesn\u2019t see Obamacare being repealed before Obama leaves office.", "title": "Jeb Bush talks alternative to Obamacare 'monstrosity'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/jeb-bush-talks-alternative-to-obamacare-monstrosity-115913.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/09/20150309_jebbush_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Elections,Health Care,2016 Elections,Jeb Bush,Affordable Care Act,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He said he doesn\u2019t see Obamacare being repealed before Obama leaves office.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e71\"", "article_summary": "Bush called Obamacare a 'monstrosity of consolidating power in Washington, D.C.'
