Crazy, huh?\n\nHold up \u2026 how can there still be $1.38 trillion a year worth of \u201cuncovered\u201d Americans? Wasn\u2019t U.S. president Barack Obama\u2018s socialized medicine law supposed to take care of them?\n\n(Ahem).\n\nAnyway \u2026 Sanders has a way to pay for his plan.\n\n\u201cWe will raise taxes,\u201d Sanders told a Democratic town hall earlier this week. \u201cYes we will.\u201d\n\nWow. That\u2019s one way to do it \u2026 but a platform based on broad-based tax hikes is not what the Democratic establishment wants to be touting heading into the upcoming November elections. In fact Sanders\u2019 scheme is so far to the left even uber-liberal former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi \u2013 who rammed \u201cObamacare\u201d through a reluctant, Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress in 2010 \u2013 doesn\u2019t support it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running on any platform of raising taxes,\u201d Pelosi told a crowd in Baltimore, Maryland this week.\n\nThat\u2019s a wise decision \u2026 as this analysis from Market Research Foundation makes clear.\n\nDespite his overt socialism and headwinds within his own party, Sanders is running neck-and-neck with presumed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Iowa and has a big lead over her in New Hampshire.\n\nThere\u2019s a looming problem for \u201cThe Bern,\u201d though \u2026\n\nAccording to a new analysis, Sanders\u2019 plan doesn\u2019t cost $1.38 trillion a year \u2026 it costs $2.5 trillion a year. Which means Sanders is going to have to more than double his proposed tax hikes if he wants the numbers to add up.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan is \u201cunderfinanced by an average of nearly $1.1 trillion per year,\u201d according to a new study by Emory University\u2019s Kenneth E. Thorpe.\n\n\u201cTo fund the program, payroll and income taxes would have to increase from a combined 8.4 percent in the Sanders plan to 20 percent while also retaining all remaining tax increases on capital gains, increased marginal tax rates, the estate tax and eliminating tax expenditures,\u201d concluded Thorpe, a former Bill Clinton advisor.\n\nThorpe\u2019s most damning conclusion? That 71 percent of American households with private insurance would be \u201cworse off\u201d under Sanders\u2019 plan.\n\nYikes \u2026\n\nWe like Sanders. He seems like a nice guy. But math is clearly not his strong suit. Nor is simple logic \u2026\n\nAdding new layers of government intervention onto the American health care system has done nothing but create soaring costs and lower quality. Imagine how much worse these outcomes will be when government runs everything?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/01/29/feel-the-2-5-trillion-bern/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bernie-555x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Feel The ($2.5 Trillion) Bern \u2026"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ca6\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s a looming problem for \u201cThe Bern,\u201d though \u2026According to a new analysis, Sanders\u2019 plan doesn\u2019t cost $1.38 trillion a year \u2026 it costs $2.5 trillion a year.\nHold up \u2026 how can there still be $1.38 trillion a year worth of \u201cuncovered\u201d Americans?\nSenator Bernie Sanders says his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer nationalized medicine plan would cost taxpayers $1.38 trillion \u2026 a year.\nSanders\u2019 plan is \u201cunderfinanced by an average of nearly $1.1 trillion per year,\u201d according to a new study by Emory University\u2019s Kenneth E.
