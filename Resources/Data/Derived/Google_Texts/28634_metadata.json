Rick Scott took office in 2011, things have gone his way.\n\nAn improving economy brought more state revenue, making it easier to craft an annual budget. With a friendly and solid Republican majority in the Legislature, Scott got pretty much what he wanted, including tax cuts and efforts to reduce government regulation.\n\nHis greatest challenge was winning re-election in 2014 \u2014 which he did with a narrow but decisive victory over a well-funded, well-known opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist.\n\nBut less than five months into his second term, Scott faces his biggest test as Florida\u2019s chief executive.\n\nA House-Senate gridlock over a $4 billion difference in budget proposals and health care funding has shut down the Florida Legislature. Over the next two months, as the Legislature heads to a June special session, Scott will have to navigate a number of issues to keep his administration on a positive course.\n\nAt the heart of Scott\u2019s challenge is Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and disabled.\n\nScott, a former private hospital executive, opposed Medicaid expansion under the federal Affordable Care Act when he took office in 2011. But in 2013, he reversed himself and announced he would support expansion as long as the federal government paid the full cost, although the Legislature failed to act because of opposition in the House and Scott\u2019s tepid support.\n\nDuring the 2015 session, Scott again reversed himself, announcing his opposition to Medicaid expansion, which he strongly re-affirmed this past week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to support it. It\u2019s not a program that has worked,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Senate has advanced a Medicaid expansion plan, called the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange (FHIX) that would provide health care coverage to some 800,000 low-income Floridians. The Senate plan is designed to help offset the reduction or elimination of a federal program, known as the low-income pool (LIP), that pays Florida hospitals some $2.2 billion to cover uncompensated care they provide.\n\nThe House strongly opposed the Senate\u2019s FHIX plan, arguing that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS would approve some type of LIP funding going forward. The House abruptly ended its 2015 session three days early because of the dispute.\n\nScott met with HHS officials last week trying to get some idea of the fate of LIP. At the same time, he is suing HHS, alleging the federal agency is trying to \u201ccoerce\u201d Florida into expanding Medicaid. He stepped up the legal action May 7 by asking for an injunction in the case.\n\nScott said Florida needs \u201cfederal action right now\u201d on the hospital funding. \u201cThe low-income families in our state cannot wait on the federal government any longer.\u201d\n\nBut senators and others say HHS told the state last summer that LIP would not be continuing in its current form after this June. They say Scott should have prepared some type of replacement plan for the hospital funding.\n\n\u201cIt was your administration that signed off on the agreement to end LIP in its current form next month,\u201d said Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, leader of the Senate Democrats. \u201cIt was your administration that sat on its hands instead of crafting an alternative solution that the feds notified you would be needed.\n\n\u201cAnd it was you who fought against Obamacare before you supported it before you opposed it again, precipitating the House\u2019s unconstitutional departure and the session to crash and burn.\u201d\n\nIn a meeting with Scott this week, HHS officials told him that Florida\u2019s latest request for LIP funding falls short of the agency\u2019s goals, which are emphasizing coverage plans, like the Senate FHIX proposal, rather simply advancing federal funding to pay for uncompensated care at the hospitals.\n\nScott said state officials would try to continue to work with the federal agency, while adding \u201cfor them to be now just saying what we are proposing does not make sense is a little disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe state must have a budget by July 1 or Florida government would grind to a halt. It last happened briefly in 1992, for about 18 hours, when lawmakers belatedly got a budget to Gov. Lawton Chiles, who had vetoed two previous versions.\n\nThe failure to reach an agreement on a budget \u2014 which is possible but not probable \u2014 would leave Scott with a devastating legacy.\n\nTo avoid that, lawmakers must bridge a $4 billion gap in the Senate and House budget bills, which is largely the result of their differences over health care funding.\n\nDespite a $1 billion budget surplus this year, most of Scott\u2019s major spending initiatives are in jeopardy. Scott wanted $673 million in tax cuts. The House backed $490 million in tax cuts but the Senate refused, arguing that tax cuts were not possible until Florida resolved the uncertainty over the $2.2 billion LIP program.\n\nScott also wants to boost per-student funding in Florida\u2019s public schools to a record level \u2014 but it, too, remains in doubt because of the funding uncertainty.\n\nFurther complicating the budget debate are additional cost factors that lawmakers will now have to deal with, including a projected 15,000-student increase in the K-12 system and more than $200 million in unanticipated pharmacy costs in the state\u2019s Medicaid managed-care system.\n\nScott said he is now prepared to go forward with a bare-bones budget to keep Florida running if lawmakers cannot determine how much federal LIP funding will be available in the coming year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a budget done not knowing exactly their decision,\u201d Scott said about the HHS officials. \u201cRight now I\u2019m focused on a continuation budget, a base budget \u2014 whatever you want to call it \u2014 because of their decision.\u201d\n\nScott has said if lawmakers cannot agree on tax cuts this year, he will push for a $1 billion tax-cutting package next year.\n\nLate in the session, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, a veteran lawmaker with more than a dozen years of experience, said he advised Scott to take a role as mediator in the dispute between the House and Senate \u201cas opposed to taking one side or the other.\u201d\n\nBut Scott has clearly come down on the House side in his strident opposition to Medicaid expansion. It\u2019s not unusual for a governor to favor the policies of one chamber over the other, but in this divisive atmosphere his alliance may complicate his role.\n\nScott has already threatened a handful of senators with his veto power, which is an interesting move given that he only vetoed one bill last year \u2014 an extraordinarily low total for a governor in a regular session.\n\nScott\u2019s willingness to veto legislation will be tested early as the Senate sent Scott a bill (SB 228) on Thursday calling for online voter registration in Florida by 2017. The bill, which had strong bipartisan support and was backed by Florida\u2019s elections supervisors, drew criticism from Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Scott appointee. Scott will have to act on the bill before lawmakers return in their special session on June 1.\n\nScott, the Senate and the House all agree that Florida needs a new budget by July 1. But that is pretty much where the unity ends.\n\nLate in the session, House leaders made it clear that they did not think Medicaid expansion should be part of the special session agenda. Senate leaders said since Medicaid accounts for roughly $23 billion out of the state\u2019s $77 billion budget, its future would be part of any budget negotiations.\n\nWhile the budget will be paramount in the June 1-20 session, there will be pressure to add other items to the agenda.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is the fewer the issues on a special session agenda, the higher the prospects for success. And the budget alone is the largest and most complicated issue that lawmakers deal with each year.\n\nNonetheless, some will call for lawmakers to try to revive some of the major bills that died in the session, ranging from a comprehensive state water policy to a potential gambling agreement with the Seminole Tribe.\n\nAnd the health care debate could be further amplified in the middle of the special session if the U.S. Supreme Court invalidates the federal health insurance exchanges that were set up in states like Florida under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe nation\u2019s highest court will rule sometime in June. An adverse ruling against the federal exchange in Florida could leave some 1.6 million Floridians without health care coverage.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "As the Legislature heads to a June special session, Scott will have to navigate a number of issues to keep his administration on a positive course.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "A House-Senate gridlock over a $4 billion difference in budget proposals and health care funding has shut down the Florida Legislature.\nDuring the 2015 session, Scott again reversed himself, announcing his opposition to Medicaid expansion, which he strongly re-affirmed this past week.\nScott, the Senate and the House all agree that Florida needs a new budget by July 1.\nOver the next two months, as the Legislature heads to a June special session, Scott will have to navigate a number of issues to keep his administration on a positive course.\nAt the heart of Scott\u2019s challenge is Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and disabled."}
