A medical injury has caused four-time Olympic medal winner Evgeni Plushenko to drop out of the men’s figure skating individual event, just before he was to compete on Thursday. He was Russia’s sole competitor in the event and was expected to bring home a medal.

But during a warmup run, the 31-year-old skater awkwardly landed a triple axel, after which he remained hunched over, gripping his back. He attempted the stunt again, but failed, and consulted on the side with coach Alexei Mishin before announcing his withdrawal. The AP reports that “he actually was injured in practice the previous day.”
