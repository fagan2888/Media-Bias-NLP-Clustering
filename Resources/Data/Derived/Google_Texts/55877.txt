A Pennsylvania mother with a concealed carry permit is now facing up to three years in prison because she notified police of her loaded handgun during a traffic stop in New Jersey.

Shaneen Allen, 27, presented her Pennsylvania concealed carry permit and told a New Jersey officer about the handgun in her car when she was pulled over on October 1, 2013 in Atlantic County, a Philadelphia NBC affiliate reported.

“She voluntarily and honestly told the officer that she had her licensed handgun and gave him her license to carry,” Ms. Allen’s attorney, Evan Nappen, told the station.

The single mother of two was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and armor-penetrating bullets. She could face up to three years in prison if convicted.

Mr. Nappen said his client wasn’t aware it was against the law to drive through New Jersey with her .380 Bersa Thunder loaded with hollow-point bullets. She had bought the gun through a licensed dealer roughly a week before her arrest because she had been robbed twice earlier that year, the NBC affiliate reported.

According to the Pennsylvania Firearm Owners Association, Pennsylvania concealed carry permits are honored in 30 other states, but that doesn’t include New Jersey.

Mr. Nappen told the station he’s seen at least a dozen cases similar to Ms. Allen’s in the past year. He advocates for a federal law mandating concealed carry license reciprocity among states.

“People believe that your gun license should be treated like your driver’s license. Right now there’s a national law being proposed that would mandate that all states recognize other states licenses,” he told the station. “It’s still pending, but it’s needed for people like this. I’m calling that bill Shaneen’s law.”

A court date for Ms. Allen has been set for August 5. Her lawyer said he plans to request a dismissal of all charges.
