It's every service that you need now will be located in this facility. People don't have to travel anymore. We are able to provide that.\"\n\nCritical Care Director, Paula Bowers, adds, \"When somebody has a family member in the ICU, it's a crisis state for the family. So when we as a health care team are delivering care to the patient, we have to recognize the crisis state that entire family is in. So we are highly trained to deliver care to the entire family.\"\n\nAn addition to the new facility, each room has a futon for family members to stay the night, a fully function bathroom for both the patient and family, and a built in desk for nurses.\n\nA ribbon ceremony will be held October 10th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gulf Coast Medical Center is preparing to unveil its new facility this Thursday after two years of construction.", "language": "english", "author": "WJHG", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Gulf-Coast-Medical-Cnt--226609991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/MEDCENTER1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gulf Coast Medical Center is preparing to unveil its new facility this Thursday after two years of construction.", "title": "First Look at Gulf Coast Medical Center Expansion"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gulf Coast Medical Center is preparing to unveil its new facility this Thursday after two years of construction.", "title": "First Look at Gulf Coast Medical Center Expansion", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Gulf-Coast-Medical-Cnt--226609991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/MEDCENTER1.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "First Look at Gulf Coast Medical Center Expansion", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "First Look at Gulf Coast"}, "article_summary": "On the first floor, the intensive care unit is now a 20 bed unit that increases Gulf Coast Medical's care capacity by eight beds.\nGulf Coast Medical Center is preparing to unveil its new facility this Thursday after two years of construction.\nA new pediatric intensive care unit will provide four rooms for critically-ill pediatric patients.\nOn the second floor, the neonatal intensive care unit is expanding from a ten bed Level 2 NICU to an 18 bed unit that can now provide Level 3 NICU care, which will help accommodate more newborns.\nCritical Care Director, Paula Bowers, adds, \"When somebody has a family member in the ICU, it's a crisis state for the family."}
