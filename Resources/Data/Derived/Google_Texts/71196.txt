From the Affordable Care Act to Enforcement of the HIPAA Omibus Final Rule, last year was a monumental, if not confounding year for the health care industry compliance officers. Many hope 2014 is a smoother year and less “dizzying,” according to a new report that snapshots their wishes for the coming year.

According to idexpertscorp.com, in 2013, there were over 100 HIPAA privacy breaches affecting 500 or more individuals reported to the Office for Civil Rights. The largest of the breach was at Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield where a pair of laptops containing information for over 840,000 individuals was stolen. OCR also investigated at least dozens of organizations of potential violations under HIPAA.
