Yesterday they were told the company was sold.\n\nEmployees were to collect their last paycheck and not return to work.\n\nCustom Blenders is a food and bakery waste recycling company. Plants in Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas are all closing.\n\nA spouse of an employee from the plant here in Terre Haute tells us the employees had zero warning. She says they came to work yesterday and were told they we\u2019re terminated effective immediately.\n\nAnd that the way it was all done \u201cwas just wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think they should have been forewarned and they just weren\u2019t. They were all just kind of shocked. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s, I can speak for my husband, it\u2019s shock and kinds anger then kinda depressed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe employees did get their last check and they will be paid vacation.\n\nThe plant was sold to competitor Darling Industries.\n\nThere has been no confirmed word on the plans for the plant but some say the entire lot will be leveled.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Leading the Way in Terre Haute and the Wabash Valley with the most accurate and reliable news, weather, and sports coverage, along with the latest breaking news and severe weather coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488538858", "og": {"site_name": "WTHITV.com", "description": "Custom Blenders has sold it\u2019s plant in Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas. 15 fired in Terre Haute.", "title": "Custom Blenders employees left without work", "url": "http://wthitv.com/2014/10/02/custom-blenders-employees-left-without-work/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwthi.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/custom-blender.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "Twitter": {"description": "Custom Blenders has sold it's plant in Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas. 15 fired in Terre Haute.", "Site": "@WTHITV", "Card": "Summary_large_image", "Title": "Custom Blenders employees left without work"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The Wabash Valley's News, Weather and Sports Leader", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wthi", "fb": {"pages": 65409576342}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wthitv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/e396a450a3f32b43fa03fd4ba702dccf?s=16", "application-name": "WTHITV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTHITV", "published_time": "2014-10-03T02:21:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T02:45:54+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "5iOjTv9548kzHLo52jADaRfomdhZUDVLeei2c-gzjdI", "twitter": {"description": "Custom Blenders has sold it\u2019s plant in Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas. 15 fired in Terre Haute.", "title": "Custom Blenders employees left without work", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwthi.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/custom-blender.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wthitv", "site": "wthitv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Custom Blenders has sold it's plant in Indiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Texas. 15 fired in Terre Haute."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3725\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not a good week for the employees at Custom Blenders in Terre Haute.\nA spouse of an employee from the plant here in Terre Haute tells us the employees had zero warning.\nTerre Haute, Ind.\n(WTHI)- A business in Terre Haute has shut down.\nShe says they came to work yesterday and were told they we\u2019re terminated effective immediately."}
