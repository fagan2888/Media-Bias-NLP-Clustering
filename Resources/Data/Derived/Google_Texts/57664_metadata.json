But if they lived together unmarried, they would qualify for the subsidies and could literally save hundreds of dollars a month on their health care.\n\nA single person can qualify for subsidies if they make less than $46,000 a year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated,\u201d Aronowitz said. \u201cGo on the website, you\u2019ll see what I mean,\u201d Aronowitz told Champion.\n\nAronowitz, a freelance writer, and Cassara, who works as a freelancer in the film industry, lost their health coverage recently when Aronowitz was laid off.\n\nCritics of the Affordable Care Act have called the pricey decision the couple faces the \u201cmarriage penalty.\u201d But the income levels for subsidies were set by Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an educated, very well plugged-in person and I can\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Aronowitz said.\n\nAronowitz said she and her husband are deeply in love but together were never the \u201cmarrying type.\u201d Still, they said they\u2019re not taking the decision ahead of them lightly.\n\n\u201cIn our case, it would be worth it,\u201d Aronowitz said. \u201cIn other people\u2019s cases, where marriage is really, really important to them and they had this big wedding and it was this sacred experience, I think it would be a really tough decision for them.\u201d\n\nThe couple is looking at other health options before making the divorce decision.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "From website crashes to long holds on calls, the issues involved with the unveiling of the Affordable Care Act are well-documented.
