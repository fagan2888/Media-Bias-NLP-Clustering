And the family needed her.\n\nHer owner Nonna Russell knew it. Her husband Guy knew it.\n\nHer 6-year-old quadriplegic son, Ryan, knew it most of all.\n\nThough never trained as a service dog, Georgia, a 50-pound, 4-year-old English bulldog, is Ryan\u2019s companion, protector and friend.\n\nAnd for almost a week, she was missing.\n\nGeorgia often warned Ryan\u2019s family if he was having any trouble with his breathing, especially in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201cShe notices when something is wrong. She is not a certified service dog. She\u2019s not perfect. She is a natural service dog,\u201d Russell said. \u201cShe jumps on the bed. \u2026 She stands post.\u201d\n\nWhen Georgia, a former breeder dog with a maternal instinct, disappeared from home Oct. 17, the Russell family didn\u2019t panic.\n\nGeorgia knew where she lived. And though she did not have a history of wandering off, they lived in a good, close-knit neighborhood.\n\nRussell assumed a gate was left open by someone working around the house or the horse ranch they bought for Ryan\u2019s horse therapy.\n\n\u201cYou should see Ryan when he rides (Romeo). He just lights up,\u201d said the horse\u2019s trainer, Charda Lively. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the connection they have.\u201d\n\nGeorgia and Ryan also have a strong connection. They thought Georgia had just wandered off for a bit.\n\nBut, by Saturday, they were frantic.\n\n\u201cI really, honestly did not think she\u2019d be gone,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThen Saturday came. \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do.\u201d\n\nSunday was a hard day. In addition to Georgia\u2019s obvious absence, they had to mourn the death of a beloved family dog, 17-year-old Howie, who had been with the family since before Ryan was born.\n\nMonday, Russell locked herself in her room. She gave everyone the day off, unable to cope with everyday matters.\n\nRyan, who is in first grade, is home-schooled by a private tutor and was home all week while Georgia was not.\n\n\u201cWe searched on foot. We searched by horse. We searched by car,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe had the whole neighborhood looking.\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s dog-walker jumped at the chance to help by listing Georgia on Craigslist, asking Facebook friends to share the missing flier, and advertising the $2,500 reward. The roughly 50 people who work for and with Russell helped in any way they could.\n\nFinally, KTNV-TV, Channel 13 featured the dog\u2019s disappearance on its 11 p.m. news broadcast, which led to her homecoming.\n\n\u201cI thought if someone really wants a bulldog, I\u2019d give them the money to get their own,\u201d Russell said of the reward. \u201cI honestly would have paid whatever was in my savings account\u201d to get Georgia back.\n\nGuy Russell said the reward was offered with guarded optimism, and anything higher would have drawn scammers and heartbreak.\n\nThirty minutes after the segment aired, Nonna Russell got a text that read, \u201cI think I know where your dog is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really was unbelievable,\u201d Guy Russell said. \u201cIt was such a miracle someone happened to watch the newscast late at night. Such a miracle.\u201d\n\nWednesday morning, Russell learned that her sweet Georgia, who had two ACL knee surgeries and a bladder problem that required medicine, was sold for $800 to an acquaintance of the person who had texted Russell.\n\nRussell and her husband brought Georgia home Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get my hopes up,\u201d Russell said, though she was assured it was Georgia. \u201cI just wanted my dog back. I didn\u2019t want to cause a ruckus.\u201d\n\nIn a moving homecoming captured by KTNV, Ryan, a quadriplegic since surviving a near-drowning accident at 6 months old, managed to shift his arm until it was resting on Georgia. Tears streamed from his expressive eyes.\n\n\u201cWhile Georgia was gone, Ryan couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Russell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize until she was gone how much I depended on her.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s movement is so rare, his physical reaction to Georgia coming home was a small miracle for his parents.\n\n\u201cSomething like this makes you count your blessings,\u201d she said. \u201cSome things aren\u2019t replaceable.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Rochel Leah Goldblatt at 702-383-0381 or rgoldblatt@reviewjournal.com.
