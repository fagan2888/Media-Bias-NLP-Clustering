Run its course? Think again.\n\n\u201cTurn on a TV in Colorado and you might assume there are no issues more important to state voters than abortion rights, access to contraception and the definition of personhood.\u201d That according to an article about the contentious U.S. Senate race there in Real Clear Politics this week.\n\nIf it strikes one as odd that a Colorado race, or any of the many U.S. congressional races where it is happening, would be obsessing over \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d issues, given the abundance of crises facing our nation at the moment, Katie Pavlich can explain the conundrum. She does so with clarity, passion and an overwhelming abundance of evidence in her hard-hitting new book, \u201cAssault and Flattery: The Truth About the Left and Their War on Women.\u201d\n\nThe author writes, \u201cThe playbook [for the 2014 elections] is simple. War on women. Birth control. Republicans better be ready to counter it \u2026\u201d\n\nMaking this wake-up call all the more urgent: The GOP establishment\u2019s apparent readiness to blow it again. Case in point: an original interview the author conducted in 2013 with the epitome of the establishment himself, Mitt Romney. To the question of how he could have handled the War on Women attacks more effectively, Mr. Romney responded, \u201cWell, there are a lot of outrageous lies I just don\u2019t think women believe, so I\u2019m not sure how damaging they are.\u201d\n\nNot sure how damaging? This from a man who was bludgeoned by Democrats with \u201cbinders full of women\u201d and accusations he wanted to take women\u2019s birth control away lost women, and who subsequently lost women overall by 11 percent and single women by a breathtaking 36 percent.\n\nFormer Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s losing campaign for governor of Virginia wasn\u2019t any more effective in dealing with the attacks when they predictably came his way a year later. The abortion and contraception \u201czealot\u201d tag that Terry McAuliffe applied stuck, and Mr. Cuccinelli lost single women by 42 percentage points.\n\nYet in 2014 Republicans appear poised to fall for it once again. With the addition of \u201cpersonhood\u201d bill attacks to the Democratic arsenal, Republicans look flat-footed, as though they will try again to merely ignore the attacks and keep their fingers crossed that women will see the charges for the \u201coutrageous lies\u201d they are.\n\nHowever, now they don\u2019t have to ignore the attacks \u2014 a disastrous strategy. They have a secret weapon, a virtual handbook for the next election cycle and the one after that: \u201cAssault and Flattery.\u201d\n\nMs. Pavlich paints the compelling big picture: the unfounded \u201cWar on Women\u201d attacks will continue until conservatives figure out how to push back effectively. She outlines the basis for a proactive strategy: the Republican Party\u2019s history of championing women\u2019s rights and civil rights for all, and the corresponding cynical manipulation of women and minorities by Democrats over the years.\n\nThat history, combined with a damning critique of modern-day Democratic hypocrisy in how they view and treat women, demonstrate Republicans have no business maintaining a losing, defensive posture when it comes to female voters.\n\nThe list of Democratic and liberal men\u2019s offenses against any woman they can\u2019t control \u2014 conservative women \u2014 is enough to make one\u2019s head explode, both for its vulgarity (the author forewarns readers) and breadth.\n\nLeaving no sacred cow of the left unnamed, the author details, one after another, misogynists and womanizers from the left (read Teddy Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Bob Filner, John Edwards, Michael R. Bloomberg and a bevy of others) who say and do the most reprehensible things about and to women, and yet are either ignored or championed by Democrats and the mainstream media.\n\nOne of Ms. Pavlich\u2019s most compelling critiques was that of how the modern leftist movement made a conscious decision to use women for accumulating political power for themselves. From the anarchism of Bill Ayers to the Marxist inclinations of Betty Friedan, radicals \u201cbegan to infiltrate and hijack the feminist movement,\u201d setting out to systematically destroy the family and marriage in order to create dependency on government.\n\nWomen would be integral to achieving their \u201cunderlying agenda of socialism and redistribution of wealth.\u201d The motives of the Democrats and their allies when it comes to women are \u201cfar from pure.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama steps right into line with the agenda, propelling it forward with unabashed enthusiasm and the skill of a practiced community organizer. The author reminds readers of the webpage Mr. Obama launched during the campaign, \u201cThe Life of Julia,\u201d \u201ca sickening portrayal of the federal nanny state.\u201d Through the fictional Julia, Mr. Obama sought to lure female voters by outlining how the largesse of government would provide for them, as it did for Julia, in every stage of their life, but only if it is a government controlled by Democrats.\n\nThe author points out how disgusted the great early leaders of the feminist movement would be by the ploy of liberals to make women dependent yet again. She says the \u201ctrue war\u201d is one \u201cwaged to make all women subscribe to certain social behavior, involving complete sexual \u2018liberation\u2019 and \u2018independence,\u2019 and a war waged to convince women that the Democratic Party is the party that will give them everything they need to achieve that narrow-minded view on life \u2014 if they pledge their political allegiance.\u201d\n\nThe hypocrisy is overwhelming, but the cynicism is revolting. The party championed by the modern-day feminist movement, such as it is, wants to condemn women to a life of dependency on and servitude to not a husband, but a truly oppressive, power-hungry, ambitious and spirit-crushing master; namely, government.\n\nAll this matters deeply because when it comes to elections, \u201cwomen are being systematically played by the Democratic Party,\u201d Ms. Pavlich writes. Republicans, rather than exposing the lies and the devastating impact of the leftist agenda on women, are letting it happen.\n\nA recent NBC-Marist poll found that, despite the myriad issues plaguing the world now, having nothing to do with the Democrat-conjured \u201cWar on Women,\u201d 70 percent of Coloradan voters are \u201cless likely to support a candidate who backs limits on contraception.\u201d That is proof positive to Democrats that if they can continue to hammer Republicans over \u201cpersonhood\u201d and contraception, they can win, and they\u2019re counting on Republicans not to fight back.\n\nThis strategy, manifest in ads and direct mailings across the country, is a wake-up call to Republicans. \u201cAssault and Flattery\u201d is the answer to that call. The question remains: Will the GOP abandon failed efforts to win by ignoring the attacks, and instead take the high \u2014 and winning \u2014 ground, championing women with an ample arsenal, meticulously outlined by Katie Pavlich?\n\nKate Obenshain is a commentator, speaker and author of \u201cDivider in Chief\u201d (Regnery.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think the \"War on Women\" meme is passe?
