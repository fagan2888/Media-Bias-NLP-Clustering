During his Senate testimony on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew sought to deflate the $100 billion figure as he and other administration officials struggle to sell the Iran nuclear agreement to a highly skeptical Congress.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that after sanctions relief, Iran will only be able to freely access around half of these reserves, or about $50 billion,\u201d he testified, seated alongside Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.\n\nWithout providing detailed explanation, Lew said that $20 billion of the original $100 billion estimate is committed to projects with China, which cannot be spent for other purposes, while \u201ctens of billions in additional funds\u201d constitute unpaid or \u201cnon-performing loans\u201d that somehow must be accounted for by the Iranian government.\n\nRelated: Did Iran Negotiate in Bad Faith? That's the Key Question\n\nThe broader issue facing the Iranian government, said Rachel Ziemba a senior director for emerging markets with Roubini Global Economics in New York, is that any return to the global financial scene will have to be preceded by a period of \u201cdisentangling\u201d the country\u2019s banks and public institutions from the fallout of years of dubious lending practices and general economic stress.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s banks are full of a lot of non-performing or under-performing assets \u2026 and in this period of greater sanctions and economic contraction, those probably became even less performing,\u201d she said in an interview Friday. \u201cRight now, the banks do not have the capacity to lend to support the real economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's be clear what those assets are,\u201d Lew told members of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not money we are giving to Iran. It\u2019s Iran money that sits in other countries that was locked up because of international nuclear sanctions that were designed to bring them to the table to negotiate a nuclear agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s about $50 billion\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s at least $500 billion of domestic demand. They can\u2019t possibly scratch the surface of that need.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. in fact has already released billions of dollars to Iran, such as the nearly $3 billion released last summer as a show of good faith during the negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. However, according to the Congressional Research Service, there is still a substantial amount of money, real estate and other property being held.\n\nRelated: Iran eyes $185 billion oil and gas projects after sanctions\n\nThe Treasury Department claims the economic sanctions have cost Iran more than $160 billion since 2012 in oil revenue alone. Iran\u2019s oil exports were cut by 60 percent and have been held at those reduced levels for the past two years. Moreover, Iran\u2019s designated banks, along with its central bank, were cut off from the world. Since 2012, Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, has declined more than 50 percent. And its inflation rate has reached as high as 40 percent \u2013 one of the highest levels in the world.\n\n\u201cWe have maintained this pressure throughout the last 18 months of negotiation,\u201d Lew said. \u201cDuring the negotiation period alone, our oil sanctions deprived Iran of $70 billion in oil revenue. And Iran\u2019s total trade with the rest of the world remained virtually flat.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has argued that the final agreement negotiated in Vienna earlier this month allows the U.S. and the United Nations to \u201csnap back\u201d the sanctions if Iran breaks the deal and resumes development of its nuclear program. However, critics warn that once the U.S. and United Nations sanctions are lifted, the genie is out of the bottle and it would be very difficult for the U.S. to persuade Russia, China, Germany and other signatories to the agreement to reinstate them.\n\nThe almost certain loss of U.S. leverage over Iran once the sanctions are lifted is a major concern of Republican critics of the deal.\n\nRelated: End of Sanctions Worth Hundreds of Billions to Iran\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) declared Thursday, \u201cI can\u2019t predict this whole thing out, but what basically this deal does is interjects tens of billions, 13 percent upfront of Iran\u2019s economy, into the economy of the largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve never said that there isn\u2019t going to be a penny going to malign purposes,\u201d Lew said. \u201cUnder these sanctions, they've managed to find money to put into malign purposes. But I would not exaggerate how much that\u2019s going to change things.\u201d\n\nThe Fiscal Times\u2019 Rob Garver contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the Republicans\u2019 biggest fears about the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal is that Iran wi", "title": "Lew: Iran Not Getting the Full $100 Billion of Frozen Assets", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/26/Lew-Iran-Not-Getting-Full-100-Billion-Frozen-Assets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/financial-regulation-lew_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/26/Lew-Iran-Not-Getting-Full-100-Billion-Frozen-Assets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/financial-regulation-lew_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One of the Republicans\u2019 biggest fears about the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal is that Iran wi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc996a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDuring the negotiation period alone, our oil sanctions deprived Iran of $70 billion in oil revenue.\nRelated: Iran eyes $185 billion oil and gas projects after sanctionsThe Treasury Department claims the economic sanctions have cost Iran more than $160 billion since 2012 in oil revenue alone.\nIran\u2019s oil exports were cut by 60 percent and have been held at those reduced levels for the past two years.\nDuring his Senate testimony on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew sought to deflate the $100 billion figure as he and other administration officials struggle to sell the Iran nuclear agreement to a highly skeptical Congress.\nOne of the Republicans\u2019 biggest fears about the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal is that Iran will suddenly be flush with cash and better able to fund terrorism and attacks on U.S. interests."}
