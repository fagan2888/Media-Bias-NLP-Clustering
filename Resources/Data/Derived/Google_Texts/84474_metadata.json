The surcharge, labeled on receipts as \u201c3 percent healthy L.A.\u201d is \u201cso we are able to provide health care for our employees because there is going to be a fine implemented if you don\u2019t have health care this year.\u201d\n\nEach R\u00e9publique employee receives full coverage health care, Teordi told TheBlaze. She noted that if a patron is particularly unhappy with the added charge, the restaurant will remove it from the bill.\n\n\u201cIf people are very upset about it then of course we don\u2019t make them pay it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it off.
