With the president\u2019s speech to the nation last week, that inclination may have shifted, but either way, at this point the administration is committed to the term \u201cISIL.\u201d\n\nBut Todd is not the only commentator trying to figure out why Obama says \u201cISIL\u201d while the media tends to prefer \u201cISIS.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Harris Faulkner recently said she believed the president is \u201ctipping his hat\u201d to the group by using an \u201cL\u201d instead of an \u201cS.\u201d \u201cLevant is a bigger territory,\u201d she said on Outnumbered. \u201cThat\u2019s why they want to embrace that name and it includes many, many more countries than just Syria.\u201d\n\nThat theory is closer to the one Glenn Beck espoused in his \u201cdaily briefing\u201d with TheBlaze staff Monday, though, unsurprisingly, his ideas are a bit more convoluted.\n\nBeck noticed that technically, \u201cthe Levant\u201d includes Israel, along with Lebanon and Jordan. \u201cWe actually should be flipped,\u201d he said. \u201cI should be saying it\u2019s \u2018ISIL\u2019 and the president should saying it\u2019s \u2018ISIS,'\u201d because in Beck\u2019s view, the president wants to minimize the threat while he believes including the Levant better represents the group\u2019s true aims. So, does that mean Beck actually agrees with Obama on this one? Not quite.\n\nBeck accepts that the group should be called \u201cISIL\u201d and not \u201cISIS,\u201d but he thinks it should be called \u201cISIL\u201d as a \u201cwarning,\u201d which is apparently not what President Obama is doing.\n\nWhen Obama uses the term \u201cISIL,\u201d Beck sees it as a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to Israel. For the president to say that it\u2019s \u201cISIL\u201d and not \u201cISIS\u201d and not at the same time \u201cdouble down\u201d on Israel and warn that the group is \u201ctaking over the Holy Land\u201d is somehow disingenuous. \u201cThere is no more Israel if it\u2019s ISIL,\u201d Beck declared, ominously.\n\n\u201cSo if I\u2019m ISIS, and I hear the president say \u2018you\u2019re really ISIL\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m kind of wishy-washy on that whole Israel thing,\u2019 you\u2019re on my side,\u201d Beck concluded. \u201cFor him to say \u2018ISIL\u2019 is sending a message overseas to them: \u2018I know who you are. I\u2019m not doing anything, I\u2019m not doing anything.'\u201d\n\nGet all that? Beck agrees that the group, which calls itself simply \u201cthe Islamic State,\u201d should be called \u201cISIL,\u201d but not for the reasons Obama is using. And somehow, escalating missile strikes against the group in Iraq and possibly now Syria is the same as \u201cnot doing anything\u201d because he uses an \u201cL\u201d instead of an \u201cS.\u201d\n\nThe truest explanation for why President Obama says \u201cISIL\u201d instead of \u201cISIS\u201d? He and his team started using it at one point and have stuck with it long enough that it would be awkward (and somehow perceived as weak) if he started saying \u201cISIS\u201d now.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like how Obama insisted on using the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d before finally giving in and accepting that everyone was going to call it \u201cObamacare\u201d no matter what he did. And we\u2019ve all seen how well that turned out.\n\nWatch video below, via TheBlaze:\n\n[Photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beck agrees that the group should be called \u201cISIL\u201d and not \u201cISIS,\u201d but he thinks it should be called \u201cISIL\u201d as a \u201cwarning,\u201d which is apparently not what", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-15-at-12.29.21-PM.png", "title": "Glenn Beck Knows Why Obama Prefers \u2018ISIL\u2019 to \u2018ISIS\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beck agrees that the group should be called \u201cISIL\u201d and not \u201cISIS,\u201d but he thinks it should be called \u201cISIL\u201d as a \u201cwarning,\u201d which is apparently not what President Obama is doing.", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-15-at-12.29.21-PM.png", "title": "Glenn Beck Knows Why Obama Prefers 'ISIL' to 'ISIS'", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "columnists,online", "date": "2014-09-15T16:05:29+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "When Obama uses the term \u201cISIL,\u201d Beck sees it as a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to Israel.\nBeck accepts that the group should be called \u201cISIL\u201d and not \u201cISIS,\u201d but he thinks it should be called \u201cISIL\u201d as a \u201cwarning,\u201d which is apparently not what President Obama is doing.\n\u201cSo if I\u2019m ISIS, and I hear the president say \u2018you\u2019re really ISIL\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m kind of wishy-washy on that whole Israel thing,\u2019 you\u2019re on my side,\u201d Beck concluded.\n\u201cThere is no more Israel if it\u2019s ISIL,\u201d Beck declared, ominously.\nBeck agrees that the group, which calls itself simply \u201cthe Islamic State,\u201d should be called \u201cISIL,\u201d but not for the reasons Obama is using."}
