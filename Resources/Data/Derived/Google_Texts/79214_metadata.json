Department of Transportation estimated it needed about $1.4 billion a year for the next 20 years to not only maintain but also improve and expand South Carolina\u2019s roads.\n\n\u201cWe have dug ourselves into a hole,\u201d said House Minority Leader Rep. Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to start funding government needs.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot going on next year. The Senate returns to tackle a House bill that in its current form would increase the gas tax and motorist-related fees to raise an estimated $800 million a year for the state\u2019s roads.\n\nAssistant Majority Leader Rep. Gary Simrill, R-Rock Hill, lamented Wednesday the bill\u2019s lack of traction in the Senate. Simrill, the bill\u2019s chief sponsor, said if it would have passed during the 2015 legislative session, the state\u2019s situation would have been difficult, \u201cbut we\u2019d be at least ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what this proves is that you can never be too prepared,\u201d Simrill said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re really behind on what we need times two.\u201d\n\nThat effort was blocked through a three-week filibuster by Beaufort Republican Sen. Tom Davis, who argued the state\u2019s roads agency should be reformed to ensure it\u2019s not mismanaging taxpayer money.\n\nDavis stressed he\u2019s never signed a no-tax-increase pledge and that he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to raising the gas tax if necessary. But that\u2019s only after lawmakers have ensured that taxpayer money isn\u2019t being misspent.\n\n\u201cUnless you put into place reforms that make a difference, you should never go back to the taxpayer and ask for more money,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI am going to insist on this being a revenue and expenditure discussion.\u201d\n\nEducation lawsuit\n\nIn addition to fixing the state\u2019s roads, lawmakers are also facing a daunting, 22-year-old task. The Supreme Court ordered the Legislature find a way to provide adequate education to the state\u2019s children living in poor, rural areas. The landmark ruling by the court came after the case was first filed in November 1993.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that several have argued the Legislature put off during the last session; while House Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Hartsville, created a task force that quickly began meeting to tackle the issue, the Senate\u2019s panel has barely met.\n\nThe attorney representing the school districts that sued the state, Carl Epps, said that despite everything that\u2019s going on, none of it should distract from the state\u2019s needs in rural districts.\n\n\u201cI do not see this as being an impediment to the state\u2019s ability to fund its needs,\u201d Epps said. \u201cThe primary objective is to do it right so that it addresses the children\u2019s needs, and then have a stable source of funding to continue the programs over a long period of time.\u201d\n\nSen. Wes Hayes, R-Rock Hill, who co-chairs the Senate\u2019s panel, said legislators are working with diligence to come up with a solution, but they\u2019re still trying to figure out what needs to get done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the roads bill in special order first up,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cJust to get that and the budget done this year will be a challenge in the Senate. Plus, trying to get a major education bill done ... it\u2019s going to be a challenging year.\u201d\n\nHayes noted it\u2019s also the second half of the Legislature\u2019s two-year session. That means that any bill they come up with during the 2016 session has to pass or it gets scrapped, and lawmakers have to start all over again in 2017.\n\nElection-year politics\n\nNot only do lawmakers have to get a lot done in 2016, they also have to do it with members of both chambers under election-year pressure. That complicates things, Hayes said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got not only the scrutiny of people running for office being looked at closely, but just taking time away to campaign,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nSimrill argued lawmakers need to focus on governing, and the elections will take care of themselves. But history hasn\u2019t been kind to lawmakers who make gutsy calls on election years. Some have already been threatened by constituents and interest groups with challengers after this summer\u2019s Confederate battle flag vote.\n\nChances are, however, that lawmakers will move on an infrastructure bill, said Scott Buchanan, political science professor at The Citadel. It\u2019s just too early to tell what the bill will look like.\n\nBut education wise? That\u2019s a trickier issue; Palmetto State Republican lawmakers are \u201clukewarm at best toward public education,\u201d Buchanan said. Politically, there\u2019s not much of an incentive to move on the issue during an election year.\n\n\u201cNormally legislators don\u2019t like to do anything big in an election year,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cWell, they had their chance to do it in \u201915. Didn\u2019t do it. Now they\u2019re going to have to deal with it in some form, shape or fashion in \u201916.\u201d\n\nReach Cynthia Roldan at 708-5891.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Session 2016: A rough year ahead for South Carolina legislators, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLegislature, \r\nState Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Carl Epps,Columbia,education lawsuit,Election 2016,Gary Simrill,Jay Lucas,legislature,roads,Scott Buchanan,The Citadel,Todd Rutherford,Tom Davis,Wes Hayes", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are gearing up for what\u2019s going to be a \u201cchallenging\u201d and busy legislative session.", "title": "Session 2016: A rough year ahead for South Carolina legislators", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151018/151019427/session-2016-a-rough-year-ahead-for-south-carolina-legislators", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151018/PC1603/151019427/AR/0/AR-151019427.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151018/PC1603/151019427/AR/0/AR-151019427.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are gearing up for what\u2019s going to be a \u201cchallenging\u201d and busy legislative session.", "title": "Session 2016: A rough year ahead for South Carolina legislators", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151018/PC1603/151019427/AR/0/AR-151019427.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151019427}}, "keywords": "Session 2016: A rough year ahead for South Carolina legislators , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLegislature, \r\nState Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Carl Epps,Columbia,education lawsuit,Election 2016,Gary Simrill,Jay Lucas,legislature,roads,Scott Buchanan,The Citadel,Todd Rutherford,Tom Davis,Wes Hayes", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-18T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-16T18:15:00Z", "author": "Cynthia Roldan"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are gearing up for what\u2019s going to be a \u201cchallenging\u201d and busy legislative session."}, "article_summary": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are gearing up for what\u2019s going to be a \u201cchallenging\u201d and busy legislative session.\n\u201cI am going to insist on this being a revenue and expenditure discussion.\u201dEducation lawsuitIn addition to fixing the state\u2019s roads, lawmakers are also facing a daunting, 22-year-old task.\nLawmakers are expected in 2016 to no longer ignore the state\u2019s already weakened infrastructure, which took a beating during recent floods.\nPlus, trying to get a major education bill done ... it\u2019s going to be a challenging year.\u201dHayes noted it\u2019s also the second half of the Legislature\u2019s two-year session.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the roads bill in special order first up,\u201d Hayes said."}
