New Jersey\u2019s said $600 million. In Pennsylvania, the tally is $700 million. Those Wall Street fees paid by public workers\u2019 pension systems have kicked off an intensifying debate over whether such expenses are necessary. Now, a report from an industry-friendly source says those huge levies represent only a fraction of the true amounts being raked in by Wall Street firms from state and local governments.\n\n\u201cLess than one\u2010half of the very substantial [private equity] costs incurred by U.S. pension funds are currently being disclosed,\u201d says the report from CEM, whose website says the financial analysis firm \u201cserve(s) over 350 blue-chip corporate and government clients worldwide.\u201d\n\nCurrently, about 9 percent \u2014 or $270 billion \u2014 of America\u2019s $3 trillion public pension fund assets are invested in private equity firms. With the financial industry\u2019s standard 2 percent management fee, that quarter-trillion dollars generates roughly $5.4 billion in annual management fees for the private equity industry \u2014 and that\u2019s not including additional \u201cperformance\u201d fees paid on investment returns. If CEM\u2019s calculations are applied uniformly, it could mean taxpayers and retirees may actually be paying double \u2014 more than $10 billion a year.\n\nPublic officials are overseeing this massive payout to Wall Street at the very moment many of those same officials are demanding big cuts to retirees\u2019 promised pension benefits.\n\n\u201cWith billions of public worker and taxpayer dollars put at risk in the highest-cost, most opaque investment schemes ever devised by Wall Street for a decade now, investigations that hold Wall Street profiteers accountable are long, long overdue,\u201d said former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Ted Siedle.\n\nPrivate equity firms have argued that their fees are worth the expense, because they supposedly deliver returns for investors that beat low-fee index funds which track the broader stock market. But those private equity returns are typically self-reported by the firms over the life of those longer-term investments, meaning there are few ways to verify whether the returns are real. Indeed, a recent study from George Washington University argued that private equity firms are using their self-reporting authority to mislead investors into believing their returns are smoother and more consistent than they actually are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Private equity firms are raking in cash from municipal governments, and SEC officials are finally taking notice", "title": "Wall Street owns our cities: The secret pension travesty threatening American workers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Private equity firms are raking in cash from municipal governments, and SEC officials are finally taking notice", "title": "Wall Street owns our cities: The secret pension travesty threatening American workers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/26/wall_street_owns_our_cities_the_secret_pension_travesty_threatening_american_workers_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_152295734.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Private equity firms are raking in cash from municipal governments, and SEC officials are finally taking notice", "title": "Wall Street owns our cities: The secret pension travesty threatening American workers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_152295734.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, SEC, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca319\"", "article_summary": "Those Wall Street fees paid by public workers\u2019 pension systems have kicked off an intensifying debate over whether such expenses are necessary.\nTopics: California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, SEC, Wall Street, Business News, Politics NewsCalifornia\u2019s report said $440 million.\nNow, a report from an industry-friendly source says those huge levies represent only a fraction of the true amounts being raked in by Wall Street firms from state and local governments.\nPublic officials are overseeing this massive payout to Wall Street at the very moment many of those same officials are demanding big cuts to retirees\u2019 promised pension benefits.\nBut those private equity returns are typically self-reported by the firms over the life of those longer-term investments, meaning there are few ways to verify whether the returns are real."}
