That\u2019s because the winner of the 8-vs.-9 matchup faces a No. 1 seed.\n\nGood thing Colorado\u2019s players don\u2019t feel that way.\n\nThe Buffaloes (23-11) are seeded eighth in the South Regional and will open tournament play Thursday at the Amway Center in Orlando, Fla., against No. 9 seed Pittsburgh (25-9), with the winner all but certain to face top-seeded Florida on Saturday.\n\nThe NCAA Tournament selection committee granted Florida (32-2) the overall No. 1 seed among the 68-team field.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re the best, you have to play the best,\u201d Colorado junior guard Askia Booker said. \u201cTo be honest, when I saw \u2018Florida\u2019 pop up, I wanted us to pop up on there too.\u201d\n\nBuffs players watched the \u201cSelection Sunday\u201d telecast at the home of CU coach Tad Boyle, and everyone erupted into cheers when \u201cColorado\u201d flashed on the screen.\n\nThey did not have to wait long. Colorado vs. Pittsburgh was the second matchup announced, following Florida vs. the winner of Tuesday\u2019s \u201cFirst four\u201d game in Dayton, Ohio, between Albany and Mount St. Mary\u2019s that will determine the 16-seed in the South Regional.\n\n\u201cWhen your name is called in the first 60 seconds, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIt was like a weight was lifted off our shoulders. Now it\u2019s time to get down to business.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time Colorado has qualified three consecutive years for the NCAA Tournament in men\u2019s basketball.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I came here, to go to the NCAA Tournament,\u201d CU freshman forward Dustin Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s a credit to Coach (Tad) Boyle.\u201d\n\nThe No. 8 seed was higher than the projections of ESPN and USA Today. Both had pegged Colorado for a No. 10 seed.\n\nBoyle said he figured the Buffs\u2019 seeding would fall in the 8-10 range.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not at the point where we can go begging for a high seed \u2014 not yet, anyway,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cBut one day I hope this program can become that. Orlando is a good place to go this time of year.\u201d\n\nBoyle said he had not seen much of Pittsburgh on television.\n\n\u201cBut I know they have a heck of a coach in Jamie Dixon,\u201d Boyle said.\n\nIn their first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Panthers were seeded fifth in league tournament and eliminated North Carolina 80-75 in the quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Virginia 51-48 in Saturday\u2019s semifinals.\n\nPittsburgh is led by a pair of seniors: 6-foot-5 guard Lamar Patterson (17.6 points per game) and 6-9, 230-pound forward Talib Zanna (12.9 points, 8.8 rebounds). Zanna was named to the all-ACC Tournament team.\n\n\u201cI know Pittsburgh is usually a physical team,\u201d said Wesley Gordon, CU\u2019s redshirt freshman forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing physical teams in the Pac-12, so I think that\u2019s gotten us ready to play a team like Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nDixon said he needs to do a lot of research on Colorado.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about (CU), but I know they change defenses a bit,\u201d Dixon told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. \u201cThey are skilled, they pass the ball real well and they seem to have a real good balance as a team. And Tad Boyle has done a really good job.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nA look at the Panthers\n\nPITTSBURGH (25-9, 11-7 ACC)\n\nLocation: Pittsburgh\n\nConference: Pitt played its first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference after a longtime alliance with the Big East, joining that conference in 1982.\n\nCoach: Jamie Dixon is finishing his 11th season as coach of the Panthers.
