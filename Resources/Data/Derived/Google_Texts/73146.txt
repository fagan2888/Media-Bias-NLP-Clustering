Former Colorado State athletic director Jack Graham has steadfastly maintained he was fired because of disagreements over fundraising issues for an on-campus football stadium.

University president Tony Frank has said repeatedly his decision to exercise the “termination for convenience” clause in Graham’s contract last Friday was not related to fundraising.

A harsh third-party performance evaluation Graham received this summer helps put Frank’s decision in perspective.

The evaluation, overseen in late June by Tim Athey, an affiliate professor in CSU’s psychology department, paints a picture of an athletic director with marginal support among his immediate staff as well as his peers and colleagues.

There were 23 people surveyed — nine direct reports, 10 peers/colleagues and four “others.”

While Graham was given relatively high marks for communicating “a compelling vision” of CSU athletics and “establishing high standards of performance for self and others,” his overall review score was 2.34 on a scale of 1-5. And, morale was low within the department, according to the survey, the findings of which were obtained through a Colorado Open Records request.

In 17 of the 31 survey questions, Graham was rated at the lowest levels — “one, not at all” or “two, to a limited extent” on a five-point scale — by a majority of his direct reports/senior staff.

In the following categories, a majority of his direct reports/staff, five of nine rated him with the lowest score of “one, not at all”:

• Readily adjusts own leadership style to meet the needs of different people and situations;

• Effectively manages and develops the employees within the department;

• Creates a work environment that builds trust;

• Motivates his/her employees to feel enthusiastic about their work;

In the following categories, four of nine of his direct reports/staff gave Graham the lowest score:

• Collaborates effectively with colleagues and staff to accomplish important goals;

• Acts as a trustworthy steward for the department’s people and resources;

• Exercises self-control in terms of personal behavior, time management and work-life balance;

• Balances short-term results with long-term priorities and outcomes;

• Employs effective and efficient management practices;

• Confident in this individual’s ability to lead the department.

Colorado State released only the numeric performance ratings resulting from the “360 feedback” report.

It will not release the remainder of the review without Graham’s consent.

The Fort Collins Coloradoan first reported on the findings.
