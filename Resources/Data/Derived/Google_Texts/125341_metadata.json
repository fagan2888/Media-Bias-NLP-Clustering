After enduring the agony of watching their son pass away, Eckhardt's parents have vowed to make sure their son\u2019s death won\u2019t be in vain, and will devote their time to informing every parent that will listen about the dangerous effects associated with the designer drug sometimes marketed as \u201cSpice\u201d or \u201cK2.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a moment of peer pressure, he gave into that, thinking that was OK, it was somehow safe, and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,\u201d Eckhardt's father, Devin Eckhardt, told KTLA.\n\nThe Eckhardts\u2019 harrowing journey began on July 11 when a single hit of synthetic pot turned the teen and his family\u2019s life inside out. Shortly after his seemingly innocent decision, Eckhardt slipped into a coma before suffering from severe swelling of his brain due to a lack of oxygen. On July 16, five days after smoking synthetic marijuana, Eckhardt passed away at the age of 19. The next day, his family complied with his wishes by donating his organs.\n\nDevin and Veronica Eckhardt have decided to turn their story of heartache into a cautionary tale for all parents who fear their children may be experimenting with the dangerous drug made of chemically sprayed herbs. \u201cOur son did not die in vain,\u201d Connor\u2019s mother told KTLA. \u201cHe was a light when he was alive, and that light will continue on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, synthetic marijuana is sold under a variety of names including Spice, K2, fake weed, Yucatan Fire, and Skunk, which can be bought legally at gas stations and so-called head shops. They usually contain dried, shredded plant material that is sprayed with chemical additives that induce a mind-altering effect. Although the designer drug\u2019s packaging often claims it is derived from \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients, that could not be farther from the truth.\n\nPart of what makes the drug so hazardous is that users can\u2019t be sure what they\u2019re getting, considering its manufacturers rarely test it for safety. Common side effects experienced by Spice users include nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, hallucination, spike in blood pressure, and in some cases, heart attack. In 2010, two years prior to President Obama signing the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act, over 11,000 people visited emergency rooms after using synthetic marijuana, 59 percent of which showed no signs of any other drug use.\n\n\u201cOur son is gone forever from one hit of SPICE!!!\u201d the Eckhardts wrote on a Facebook page devoted to their son's memory. \u201cWhich is legal. How can that be? So many people have messaged me that their loved ones died too. My son is gone forever. One picture is of him with his little sister that we adopted from Ethiopia and his other baby sister who now does not want to finish her senior year of high school because of her terrible grief. Something has to be done!!!
