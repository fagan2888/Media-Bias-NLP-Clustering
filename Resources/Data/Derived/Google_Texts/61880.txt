Black community leaders in St. Louis say they are conducting a symbolic grand jury next month to look at the evidence in the Michael Brown shooting and decide for themselves whether former Officer Darren Wilson should be criminally charged.

Activists connected to the Leadership Coalition for Justice and the African People’s Socialist Party announced Friday that they will convene Jan. 3-4 to look over the evidence presented to the St. Louis County Grand Jury, a local Fox affiliate reported.

They also say they will call Darren Wilson, County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles and Governor Jay Nixon to testify, the station reported.

“What it does is educates and informs our people that two bodies came together, examined the same set of evidence, and were able to come to different conclusions,” said Omali Yeshitela of the African People’s Socialist Party.

“Therefore, the only thing standing between us and our ability to carry out the will of the people is to change this relationship that exists between us and the armed state apparatus that controls us,” he told the station.

The group organizing the symbolic grand jury is called the International People’s Democratic Uhuru Movement, according toSt. Louis public radio. The grand jury’s findings will have no legal bearing on the case.
