Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert for their work assisting military surviving families at their annual Honor Guard Gala on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is just what families do,\u201d said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS President and Founder. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a tragedy, we come together. We hold each other close, even when it\u2019s across the miles. TAPS is America\u2019s family of all those who selflessly serve and die. We truly love each other because we have shared the most intimate human experience. It\u2019s about life and death, love and loss.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey presented a keynote address, after a special introduction by Landon and Liam Gilbert -- the young surviving sons of Navy Lieut. Craig Gilbert.\n\n\u201cYou started the organization around your kitchen table in Alaska and somehow, incredibly and profoundly, it still feels that way,\u201d Dempsey said to Carroll in his brief address. \u201cThat is such an incredible gift you have.\u201d\n\nDempsey also brought the audience to their feet while singing two Irish melodies, \"Red is the Rose\" and \"The Irish Pub.\"\n\n\u201cOur nation is freer and our world is more peaceful because of the tremendous sacrifices made by the men and women who have bravely answered the call to serve,\u201d President Barack Obama wrote in a letter to gala attendees. \u201cBy providing survivors with unwavering support and compassionate care, TAPS helps our nation fulfill its sacred promise to our military families.\u201d\n\nThe gala dinner drew together more than 850 attendees, including family members of fallen soldiers, TAPS staff, and service members from all branches of the military. Actor Eric Dane (Grey\u2019s Anatomy, The Last Ship) also attended.\n\n\u201cAs a marine corps officer, I\u2019ve seen and experienced the heartache of losing young members of the military,\u201d said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), while introducing survivor Pat Bye as recipient of a TAPS Award. \u201cIt\u2019s the leadership and commitment of people like Pat that enable all of us as military families to get through such difficult times.\u201d\n\nSeveral other members of Congress also attended, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Reps. Corrine Brown (D-FL),Tom Graves (R-GA), Sam Johnson (R-TX), Billy Long (R-MO), Pete Visclosky (D-IN) and Steve Womack (R-AR), among many others.\n\nTAPS is a program dedicated to providing care for the families of fallen service members to help them through their grief. Coming alongside loved ones in their grief, TAPS organizes Good Grief Camps for children who\u2019ve lost parents, hosts seminars for all ages to support family members of all relationships through their grieving processes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors honored Rep.
