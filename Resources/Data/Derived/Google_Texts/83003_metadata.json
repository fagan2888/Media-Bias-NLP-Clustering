Koti shot a police officer during a parking ticket dispute in which no one was killed. He is now in his late 80s and suffers from asthma and a neuromuscular disorder. He doesn\u2019t hear so well, either. Yet Koti, a well-known peacemaker behind prison walls, was denied parole every two years beginning in 2005 because New York State still considered him a risk to public safety. The state did this despite the fact that it costs, on average, twice as much to lock up a stooped grandfather with digestive problems as it does to hold a healthy young man\u2014and can sometimes cost as much as five times more. It was only last month, after many denials, that Koti was finally granted parole. He will re-enter the population just a few years shy of his ninetieth birthday. Gloria Rubero, 64, was lucky enough to avoid this fate. She got released from prison before she became so old and infirm that her story took on the absurdist warp of Koti\u2019s case. But she quickly found that life on the outside as an aging ex-inmate had its own challenges. When she was sentenced to twenty-to-life for murder and robbery, we still called the Internet ARPANET; there were no smartphones or digital cameras, and CDs were considered cutting edge. Twenty-six years later she was released into an unfamiliar, wireless world. She had no driver\u2019s license, no birth certificate, no idea how to use a subway card, and the people who might once have helped her navigate these novelties\u2014friends and neighbors\u2014had disappeared. In the lonely chaos of the free world, she often found herself longing for the security of prison. [...] All across the United States, prison populations are graying, growing old and infirm behind bars. Between 1995 and 2010, the number of people in prison who are older than 55 quadrupled, and the numbers keep increasing. Today, nearly 16 percent of this country\u2019s 2-plus million prisoners are over the age of 50, or \u201celderly,\u201d as defined by the National Institute of Corrections. By 2030, a third of all inmates will be elderly\u2014and many prisons may look a lot like nursing homes. [...] This is a man-made crisis that tracks back to the nation\u2019s long obsession with retribution, which peaked in the 1980s and 1990s. That\u2019s when the \u201ctough on crime\u201d and \u201cwar on drugs\u201d ideologies reigned supreme, spawning mandatory minimum sentences and \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws, among other things. Now, several decades later, people sentenced during this wave of aggressive incarceration are hitting their 50s and 60s\u2014and the full meaning of \u201ctwenty-five-to-life\u201d is becoming clear. \u201cThe sheer number and the specialized needs of the aging prison population have begun to surpass correctional facilities\u2019 capability to provide effective and humane care,\u201d the Osborne Association and Florence V. Burden Foundation warn in a recent report titled \u201cThe High Costs of Low Risk.\u201d [\u2026]\n\nAt The Nation, Kate Cox writes By 2030, American Prisons Will Be Filled With Grandmas and Grandpas\n\nBlast from the Past. At Daily Kos on this date in 2013\u2014Harvard or not, Chris Christie is much smarter than Ted Cruz. Do Republicans care?:\n\nTed Cruz always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. Jason Zengerle wrote in GQ that the senator from Texas \"has come to the reluctant but unavoidable conclusion that he is simply more intelligent, more principled, more right\u2014in both senses of the word\u2014than pretty much everyone else in our nation's capital.\" A roommate from Harvard Law School said Cruz announced he'd only study with students who'd graduated from Harvard, Yale or (like he did) Princeton. New Jersey's Gov. Chris Christie graduated from the University of Delaware, and got his law degree at Seton Hall. I'll bet Christie thinks he's pretty smart too, whatever Sen. Cruz thinks of his pedigree. In recent days we've seen these two men, two of the leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, take diametrically opposed paths in doing their respective jobs. Earlier in the week, Christie threw in the towel in his fight against marriage equality in New Jersey. The State Supreme Court had issued a unanimous ruling that allowed same-sex marriages to go forward while waiting to hear the Christie administration's appeal, and stated therein that the appeal had little \u201creasonable probability of success.\u201d Christie then decided to drop the appeal (one aide called it a \"fool's errand\"), and the fight was over. Let's compare how Christie handled this matter to the Ted Cruz-led strategy carried out by tea party Republicans in Congress, a strategy that led to a two-week long government shutdown, threatened to force a default on our national debt obligations, and which cost our country, according to Standard & Poor's, about $25 billion. Remember, the goal of the shutdown and the default threat was to blackmail President Obama into defunding his signature legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nTweet of the Day\n\n@EricKleefeld 50 years ago today, Ronald Reagan gave a speech on freedom, for a presidential candidate who endorsed Southern resistance of desegregation.\n\nOn today's Kagro in the Morning show : Chris Christie has 2nd thoughts about having 2nd thoughts about quarantine.(who it turns out is a doctor) note the Libertarian silence.
