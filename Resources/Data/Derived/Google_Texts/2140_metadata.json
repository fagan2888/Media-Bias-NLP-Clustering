Well, if you were wondering how much you had to swipe for some medical condition to arise, a case study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has you covered.\n\nThe man, a 29-year-old living in California, visited the doctor with \u201cchronic left thumb pain and loss of active motion\u201d from playing (unsurprisingly) Candy Crush Saga \u2014 that addictive, wildly popular game that rewards players for matching small pieces of candy. The man told doctors he had been playing the game \u201call day for six to eight weeks,\u201d and that while \u201cplaying was a kind of secondary thing\u2026 it was constantly on,\u201d according to Live Science.\n\nA physical exam and MRI scan on the man\u2019s hand discovered the source of his pain was a ruptured tendon \u2014 the one involved with moving the thumb. The man needed surgery to fix the condition.\n\nWhile it would have made sense for the man to realize his pain (and the fact he had a torn tendon) sometime during that six to eight weeks, a peculiar detail in this case is that he didn\u2019t notice pain at all while playing. This should have applied even more to this man, as the tear occurred in one of the tendon\u2019s thickest points \u2014 most tears occur at thinner points. Speaking to Live Science, Dr. Andrew Doan, co-author of the report, said the game could have acted like a natural painkiller, as advancing in the game triggered the release of feel-good chemicals in the brain comparable to a \u201crunner's high.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be aware that certain video games can act like digital painkillers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be very cognizant that that can be abused.\u201d\n\nWhile the man said he wasn\u2019t addicted to the game; that he was only playing it to pass time while in between jobs, video game addiction is a very real thing. In fact, video games are designed to repeatedly trigger the release of those feel-good chemicals, such as dopamine, by challenging players and rewarding them once they\u2019ve accomplished their goal. Then they do it all over again.\n\nThough there are social and emotional benefits to playing video games for an hour or less a day, Doan said, people should still try to limit their game time to about 30 minutes. Anything more and gaming can have the opposite effect, he said.\n\nSource: Gilman L, Cage D, Horn A, Bishop F, Klam W, Doan A. Tendon Rupture Associated With Excessive Smartphone Gaming.
