As a result, she is missing a portion of her brain, scalp, and skull. Most babies born with anencephaly do not survive long after birth.\n\nThe diagnosis was an \u201ceye opener\u201d for the National Football League fullback, who is currently a free agent, and his wife. Neither had heard of the disease prior to their daughter\u2019s diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWith that being said, medically her chances of her survival are almost nonexistent,\u201d Evan Rodriguez told the Daily Signal. \u201cIt was hard on us, hearing that our child won\u2019t live. It was like a heavy weight [was dropped] on our chest.\u201d\n\nAt first in shock, the couple ultimately found comfort in one another, and selected \u201cSky\u201d as their daughter\u2019s middle name\u2013a \u201cperfect fit\u201d for a little girl they say is heading straight to Heaven.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely felt like a roller coaster ride emotionally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe both have gotten better with the support of family, friends, and parents who have been through it or currently going through it now, and of course our faith in trusting the man upstairs.\u201d\n\nAlong with the diagnosis, the couple\u2019s doctor gave them the option of terminating their pregnancy. After seeking out a second opinion, they made the decision to carry Layla Sky to term.\n\n\u201cAfter much prayer I saw clearly, and I knew it was the will of God to carry [Layla Sky] to term,\u201d Evan said. Olivia felt the same way.\n\nEvan and Olivia are now focusing on spreading awareness of the neural tubal defect plaguing their daughter, hoping that dispersing information about the disorder (for example, folic acid intake before conception can decrease chances of anencephaly by up to 70 percent, Evan said) might spare another family this tragedy.\n\nThey are also in the process of raising money for anencephaly research at Duke University and will take part in a research study being conducted there.\n\nThis past weekend the couple was able to connect with other parents raising money for the study. Evan says it is important for parents in this position to know they are not alone.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight for your baby,\u201d Evan said, adding that \u201clife is compatible with love no matter the length of time.\u201d\n\nThe Rodriguezes continue to pray for Layla\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cWe ask God to show the world a miracle and the power he has,\u201d Evan said. \u201cWe want the best for our daughter and however long she is here we are going to cherish those moments.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Evan Rodriguez's wife Olivia will carry their daughter to term despite a rare birth defect diagnosis.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Evan Rodriguez's wife Olivia will carry their daughter to term despite a rare birth defect diagnosis.", "title": "NFL's Evan Rodriguez and Wife Carrying Baby to Term", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150903_Rodriguez.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1O0SpLe"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Evan Rodriguez's wife Olivia will carry their daughter to term despite a rare birth defect diagnosis.", "title": "NFL's Evan Rodriguez and Wife Carrying Baby to Term", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150903_Rodriguez.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-09-04T10:25:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Evan Rodriguez, NFL, anencephaly, Fight, Layla Sky, birth defect, life"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8e1\"", "article_summary": "For Evan and Olivia Rodriguez, the birth of their daughter Layla Sky Rodriguez in December should be a time of joy and love.\n\u201cWith that being said, medically her chances of her survival are almost nonexistent,\u201d Evan Rodriguez told the Daily Signal.\n\u201cAfter much prayer I saw clearly, and I knew it was the will of God to carry [Layla Sky] to term,\u201d Evan said.\nAfter seeking out a second opinion, they made the decision to carry Layla Sky to term.\nThe diagnosis was an \u201ceye opener\u201d for the National Football League fullback, who is currently a free agent, and his wife."}
