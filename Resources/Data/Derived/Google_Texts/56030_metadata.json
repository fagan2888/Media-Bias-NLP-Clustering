(Pete Souza/The White House)\n\nPresident Obama on Friday appointed longtime White House aide Kristie Canegallo as deputy chief of staff for policy implementation, to oversee issues that include the continuing rollout of the Affordable Care Act and better integration of technology in classrooms.\n\nThe move, which comes three days before senior White House health-care adviser Phil Schiliro will step down, aims to institutionalize some of the changes chief of staff Denis McDonough made in the wake of the health-care law\u2019s botched debut last fall.\n\nIn an interview, McDonough said Canegallo, 34, will ensure the president is following through on some of the major policies set in motion during his first term. Her portfolio will include reforming how the federal government procures technology, veteran\u2019s affairs and immigration policy, as well as national security topics such as data privacy and the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe president, when we go through a formative experience or a big event, he wants us to make sure we capture the lessons learned \u2014 in this case, health care \u2014 so we do not make the same mistakes,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cHe has directed that we maintain senior-level focus on implementation and execution in the White House.\u201d\n\nUnlike many of Obama\u2019s top advisers, who came to their jobs through politics, Canegallo started as a civilian Pentagon official on detail to the White House when Obama came into office in 2009. Trained as a credit derivatives analyst at Goldman Sachs, she served as director in the National Security Council\u2019s Defense Policy and Strategy Directorate for two years before becoming senior adviser to McDonough, who was then the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser.\n\nThomas E. Donilon, who served as national security adviser during Obama\u2019s first term, said in an interview that Canegallo has a \u201ctremendous breadth of experience\u201d and rose through the ranks because of her political management skills.\n\n\u201cShe ran the deputies meetings at the NSC, which is really the principal management tool that NSC uses for implementing policy,\u201d he said.\n\nJim Miller, a former undersecretary of defense who worked with Canegallo at the Pentagon, said she possesses \u201ca rare combination of strategic thinking and being detail-oriented.\u201d\n\nCanegallo worked at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan in 2007 and served in Iraq in 2008 as a governance and budget adviser to the Anbar provincial government. Miller said the stints gave her \u201ca granular view of how to get things done on the ground.\u201d\n\nCanegallo is comfortable with the long hours required of senior White House officials; Donilon recalled that Canegallo\u2019s mother \u201cwould come by the staff office pretty frequently\u201d to visit her.\n\nCanegallo helped salvage the federal online health insurance marketplace after it experienced massive technical problems when it went live on Oct. 1.\n\nChris Jennings, who served as a senior White House health-care adviser during the rollout, said Canegallo \u201cmonitored every piece of data that came in\u201d in the weeks following the launch of HealthCare.gov and helped her colleagues sort it out when they were \u201cdrowning in conflicting information\u201d about the system\u2019s performance.\n\nOn April 1, when the White House released a photo of a small group of staffers informing the president that enrollment under the law had surpassed 7 million, White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri tweeted, \u201cThat\u2019s Kristie Canegallo, Denis\u2019 secret ACA weapon, briefing \u00adPOTUS on numbers. Right 4 her to be in center of pic.\u201d\n\nMcDonough said Canegallo will coordinate preparation for the next enrollment period, upcoming policy announcements related to the law and \u201cmaking sure insurers understand the rules of the road\u201d as the system moves forward.\n\nMiller said that while Canegallo will face difficult terrain in her new post, he is confident she understands both the possibilities and the limitations.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t serve in Iraq and Afghanistan without being, or becoming, a realist,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a realist and has an understanding of what it takes to get stuff done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kristie Canegallo will also oversee issues ranging from classroom technology to Afghan withdrawal", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Kristie Canegallo will also oversee issues ranging from classroom technology to Afghan withdrawal", "title": "President names Kristie Canegallo as new White House staffer overseeing health care, other issues", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-aide-named-by-obama-to-oversee-health-care-law-other-priorities/2014/05/16/33aad592-dd10-11e3-8009-71de85b9c527_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/02/Others/Images/2014-04-02/13563211545_80499b6876_o%20(1)1396448231.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-aide-named-by-obama-to-oversee-health-care-law-other-priorities/2014/05/16/33aad592-dd10-11e3-8009-71de85b9c527_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kristie Canegallo, VA Obama, Obama veterans, affordable care act, health care obama, obama immigration reform, obamacare, denis mcdonough, phil schiliro, john podesta", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "33aad592-dd10-11e3-8009-71de85b9c527", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kristie Canegallo, VA Obama, Obama veterans, affordable care act, health care obama, obama immigration reform, obamacare, denis mcdonough, phil schiliro, john podesta"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7ab\"", "article_summary": "The move, which comes three days before senior White House health-care adviser Phil Schiliro will step down, aims to institutionalize some of the changes chief of staff Denis McDonough made in the wake of the health-care law\u2019s botched debut last fall.\n(Pete Souza/The White House)President Obama on Friday appointed longtime White House aide Kristie Canegallo as deputy chief of staff for policy implementation, to oversee issues that include the continuing rollout of the Affordable Care Act and better integration of technology in classrooms.\nOn April 1, when the White House released a photo of a small group of staffers informing the president that enrollment under the law had surpassed 7 million, White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri tweeted, \u201cThat\u2019s Kristie Canegallo, Denis\u2019 secret ACA weapon, briefing \u00adPOTUS on numbers.\nKristie Canegallo, center, is seen in the Oval Office on April 1, 2014, as President Obama gets an update about the Affordable Care Act.\nMiller said the stints gave her \u201ca granular view of how to get things done on the ground.\u201dCanegallo is comfortable with the long hours required of senior White House officials; Donilon recalled that Canegallo\u2019s mother \u201cwould come by the staff office pretty frequently\u201d to visit her."}
