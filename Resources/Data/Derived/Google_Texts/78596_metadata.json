Not only will we be the ones to take care of them for various issues; we can also refer to specialists when necessary.\"\n\nDr. Johnny Shen will oversee primary care at AFC/Doctors Express Cherry Creek. With his extensive background in urgent care and experience as a family physician, Dr. Shen was the perfect candidate to lead the new clinic, Shideh Kerman explains.\n\n\"He has been working in this area and at this clinic for a while now, so he already has existing patients but is also open to accepting new patients,\" Shideh Kerman says. \"He is board certified in family medicine, which is very important. All of our doctors and physicians are certified so we can provide our patients with the best care possible.\"\n\nDr. Shen will also begin accepting new patients starting in November. People interested in enrolling as a new patient should call now, as slots are limited.\n\n\"If people currently don\u2019t have a primary care provider or aren\u2019t happy with their current one, they should contact us,\" Kerman says. \"It should not be a burden to have a primary care provider; people should see it as an advantage to have someone as their primary care provider -- especially someone with whom they can have a good relationship, good communication.\"\n\nOffering primary care will allow Doctors Express Cherry Creek to develop an even better relationship with its patients, boosting patient satisfaction and improving the quality of care significantly.\n\n\u201cAccording to recent research, people who have a strong relationship with their primary care provider report greater satisfaction with their care and enjoy better health,\" Kerman says. \"Good communication and collaboration with the doctor that oversees your care ensures that everything necessary gets done with ease.\u201d\n\nAbout AFC/Doctors Express Cherry Creek\n\nAFC/Doctors Express Cherry Creek has a physician on-site seven days a week.
