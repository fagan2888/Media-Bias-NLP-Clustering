Of course craft and artistry matter, but those are difficult qualities to measure in the moment, and any number of masterpieces went unnoticed upon their creation. \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d and \u201cVertigo\u201d were flops; Franz Kafka and Herman Melville died as unknowns. Sometimes, being important is about hitting at the right moment. Nobody\u2019s going to confuse Gillian Robespierre\u2019s likable rom-com \u201cObvious Child\u201d with the best of Howard Hawks and Ernst Lubitsch, but for many women who see it \u2013 and quite a few men too \u2013 it will instantly become a landmark moment in cultural history.\n\n\u201cObvious Child\u201d is often scabrously funny in a post-Lena Dunham, post-Woody Allen New York comedy vein, and finds a star performance in the thoroughly unlikely personage of Jenny Slate, a standup comic and actress best known for her TV roles on \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cHouse of Lies.\u201d (She was briefly a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member, several seasons ago.) Slate is not conventionally beautiful; during a comedy routine in the movie, she makes fun of her own appearance by suggesting that she resulted from a sexual union between Natalie Imbruglia and a menorah. (Except that she doesn\u2019t say it quite that way.) But she\u2019s a veritable dark star of crazy-sexy screen energy as foulmouthed, acerbic and frequently intoxicated comic Donna Stern, a character pretty close to Slate\u2019s own life experience.\n\nThis full-length version of \u201cObvious Child\u201d is based on a 23-minute short that Robespierre made with Slate in 2009, and it has much of that authenticity people responded to in the first season of \u201cGirls,\u201d and perhaps grittier than that. It\u2019s a movie made by people who understand the grind of the New York comedy scene from the inside, and who have done their time in crappy shared apartments in the less hip, fringier neighborhoods of Brooklyn. David Cross of \u201cArrested Development\u201d plays a brief but significant role, and Gabe Liedman, a writer on \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d plays Donna\u2019s comic mentor and self-aware gay best friend. Her slightly overamped, righteous-feminist female best friend is the terrific Gaby Hoffmann, an occasional cast member of \u201cGirls\u201d and the frequently naked star of the weird and underappreciated indie \u201cCrystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus.\u201d\n\nBut if all those things help explain that \u201cObvious Child\u201d is a romantic comedy with a hangover and dirt under its nails, one that steers away from easy stereotypes and gives us a screwed-up heroine who\u2019s easy to root for, they don\u2019t explain the strong reaction the film provoked at its Sundance premiere, and ever since. There\u2019s no point wussying around with spoiler alerts here, since virtually the entire potential audience for this movie knows the deal. Donna gets abruptly dumped by her boyfriend in the unisex bathroom of a comedy dive-bar (to be fair, she has just used the decline of their sex life as fodder for a routine), and a few nights later she goes home with a total stranger, an ultra-square, ultra-goy business-school type. It\u2019s just sex: He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but one who wears loafers and an Oxford shirt. She doesn\u2019t really know him, and has no plans to change that.\n\nSo the radical premise of \u201cObvious Child\u201d \u2013 at least, it\u2019s radical in the world of rom-coms, and there are still numerous people in the real world who profess to disbelieve it \u2013 is that sometimes women use men just to get laid, without thinking much about emotions or the wedding registry or even \u201cWill he call me tomorrow?\u201d Donna sneaks out of bed in the morning, panties in hand, and doesn\u2019t particularly want Max (Jake Lacy) to call her. When he stops by the dying Greenwich Village bookstore where she works \u2013 by the way, out-of-towners, Unoppressive Non-Imperialist Bargain Books really exists \u2013 she totally blows him off. Oh, she\u2019s really busy at the store and a friend has been sick and maybe she\u2019ll have to go to L.A. for a TV thing and so on. Max gets the message and moves on. Donna does not plan to tell him that she got pregnant from their one night together, and is having an abortion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This indie comedy hit, built around the irresistible Jenny Slate, blasts through pop culture's abortion taboo", "title": "\u201cObvious Child\u201d: An abortion rom-com makes history", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "This indie comedy hit, built around the irresistible Jenny Slate, blasts through pop culture's abortion taboo", "title": "\u201cObvious Child\u201d: An abortion rom-com makes history", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/05/obvious_child_an_abortion_rom_com_makes_history/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/obvious_child_potw.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This indie comedy hit, built around the irresistible Jenny Slate, blasts through pop culture's abortion taboo", "title": "\u201cObvious Child\u201d: An abortion rom-com makes history", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/obvious_child_potw.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comedy, Editor's Picks, gillian robespierre, jenny slate, Movies, obvious child, Our Picks, Our Picks: Movies", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Comedy, Editor's Picks, gillian robespierre, jenny slate, Movies, obvious child, Our Picks, Our Picks: Movies, Entertainment NewsWhat makes a movie, or any other cultural work, \u201cimportant\u201d?\nNobody\u2019s going to confuse Gillian Robespierre\u2019s likable rom-com \u201cObvious Child\u201d with the best of Howard Hawks and Ernst Lubitsch, but for many women who see it \u2013 and quite a few men too \u2013 it will instantly become a landmark moment in cultural history.\nDonna does not plan to tell him that she got pregnant from their one night together, and is having an abortion.\nThis full-length version of \u201cObvious Child\u201d is based on a 23-minute short that Robespierre made with Slate in 2009, and it has much of that authenticity people responded to in the first season of \u201cGirls,\u201d and perhaps grittier than that.\nThere\u2019s no point wussying around with spoiler alerts here, since virtually the entire potential audience for this movie knows the deal."}
