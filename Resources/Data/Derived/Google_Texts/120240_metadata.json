Woo-hoo! It\u2019s been a fun ride, one that\u2019s going great for the Republicans.\n\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\nTo mark the occasion, Anderson Cooper had Rep. Raul Labrador \u2014 one of the Republican congressmen responsible for the shutdown \u2014 on his show last night. When Labrador kept insisting that the American people don\u2019t want Obamacare, Cooper shot back by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re nullifying two presidential elections and you\u2019re nullifying the vote of Congress because you don\u2019t like it.\u201d When Labrador complained about Cooper being hard on him, the Silver Fox gave him the rhetorical slap in the face he was virtually begging for.\n\n\u201cThis is the way it works in journalism,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not on Fox News, you get contentious interviews. When you\u2019re not on MSNBC and a liberal, you get contentious interviews. My job is to ask you questions that are different than you think.\u201d\n\nLove u, Anderson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anderson Cooper gave Rep.
