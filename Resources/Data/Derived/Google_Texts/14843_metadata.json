(AP) - It's the ultimate cure for senioritis - a free car.\n\nToyota of Tampa Bay promised a free car to a senior with perfect attendance in the first or second semester of the last school year.\n\nMore than 350 Hillsborough graduates recently participated in the giveaway to win a 2014 Scion XB worth nearly $19,000.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times (http://tinyurl.com/ndwlky4) reports 12 car keys were put in a bowl. Only one unlocks the Scion's door. Students were randomly selected one at a time to pick a key and try to open the door.\n\nJose Sanchez-Flores, a 19-year-old Plant City student from Strawberry Crest High School, took a key and unlocked the door. He hasn't missed a day of school in two years.\n\nSanchez-Flores will attend Hillsborough Community College to become a nutritionist.\n\nInformation from: Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Fla.), http://www.tampabay.com.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
