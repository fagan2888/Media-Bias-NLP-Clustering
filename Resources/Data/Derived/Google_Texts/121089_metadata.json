According to a trade group survey, 40 percent of clinic operators were planning to expand their operations in 2013, and other predictions foretell that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance expansion could double the number of retail clinics by 2015.\n\nUrgent-care clinics generally are freestanding physicians\u2019 offices with extended hours that treat common injuries and illnesses, and perform screenings and some imaging. Evidence has shown that care delivered at these sites is less expensive and of comparable quality to hospital emergency departments (ED). Studies have estimated that the cost of care at urgent-care centers are $228-$414 less than the ED for similar cases, possibly saving the U.S. healthcare system $4.4 billion annually.\n\nThe American Medical Association and other physician groups, though, have contended that walk-in health clinics provide a lower quality of care and contribute to fragmentation of the U.S. healthcare system. However, many health systems are entering into joint ventures or establishing retail health clinics themselves.\n\nCVS-based MinuteClinic has created clinic partnerships with health systems in 19 markets, including the Cleveland Clinic and UCLA Health System in Los Angeles. Health-system physicians serve as medical directors for the retail clinics and collaborate on patient education and disease management initiatives. MinuteClinic also electronically shares medical histories and visit summaries with its partners. MinuteClinic chief executive officer Andrew Sussman said last year the company was exploring a similar arrangement in North Texas.\n\nMichael Slubowski, president and chief executive officer of Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System in Denver, predicted at the Dallas Southwest Transactions Conference in May that only about half of a hospital system\u2019s future revenue will come from \u201cpopulation health,\u201d which he defined as public insurance programs, small employers, and health-exchange customers. He called the remainder \u201cretail health,\u201d driven by price sensitivity because of high deductibles, demand for e-visits and people with chronic conditions seeking value based on price and outcomes.\n\nPrimaCare chief executive officer Don Dillahunty said his company will continue to do business under its current name. He said NextCare, which has 85 clinics nationwide, was eager to enter the North Texas market. He noted that North Texas is a very competitive market and growing because of favorable demographics.\n\nDillahunty said urgent care and retail clinics chase the same market: affluent women he called \u201csoccer moms,\u201d who tend to be household healthcare decision makers.\n\nAnd there\u2019s plenty of room for growth. As of Aug. 1, North Texas has 1.7 clinics per 100,000, compared with 4.9 clinics in Louisville, 4.5 in Nashville, and 2.0 in Houston, according to Tom Charland, chief executive officer of Merchant Medicine and publisher of the newsletter The ConvUrgent Care Report.\n\nBoutique private equity firm HealthCap made a significant investment in Colleyville-based Urgent Care for Kids, which had after-hours pediatric care clinics in DFW and Houston. Brian White, co-founder and chief executive officer, said the clinics generally double their growth annually for the first three years of operation. He said the company plans to open 4 or 5 more clinics in 2014 and 2015 in North Texas, Houston, and Austin.\n\nWhite called the growth of freestanding emergency departments in DFW \u201cinsane,\u201d and believes consumers are becoming more sophisticated about the costs and services of those, compared with urgent-care offerings.\n\n\u201cRetail health is going to have to change dramatically to meet the demand [created by the ACA],\u201d said Zach Wooldridge, co-founder of Elm Creek Partners, which recently bought a majority stake in urgent-care provider Millennium Healthcare Management. \u201cWe are going to have to find ways to solve the [access] problem. The average middle-class family is going to do what they have to do to get convenient and cost-effective care when they need it, regardless of whether it is paid for [by insurance].\u201d\n\nCharland agreed, saying high-deductible health plans and lack of primary-care access are giving walk-in clinics \u201cthe best opportunity in a generation to reduce their dependence on health insurance revenue streams.\u201d\n\n\u201cUrgent care operators are taking advantage of the primary-care shortages,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of injuries and sudden illnesses, they now take appointments for preventive care and have a more typical menu of primary-care services. At first, urgent care and retail clinics did not want to talk about [those services] because they did not want to be seen as disrupting medical homes. That\u2019s changing with physician shortages.\u201d\n\nWooldridge said Elm Creek would like to do additional urgent-care acquisitions, although his firm is approached frequently about divesting the Millennium clinics.\n\n\u201cWe get calls every week asking whether they are for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a fun business to be in because it is in such demand.\u201d\n\nSteve Jacob is founding editor of D Healthcare Daily and author of the book Health Care in 2020: Where Uncertain Reform, Bad Habits, Too Few Doctors and Skyrocketing Costs Are Taking Us.
