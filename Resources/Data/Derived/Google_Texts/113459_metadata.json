State officials trace the beginnings of the backlog to a computer system switch. Sources who worked on the information technology project for the state and its contractor, Accenture, agreed on condition of anonymity to give Heartland Health Monitor partner KHI News Service documents and interviews to shed light on the problems that put it years behind schedule and tens of millions of dollars over budget.\n\nState officials called a news conference when they inked a $188 million contract in the summer of 2011 for a new high-tech Medicaid enrollment system with Accenture, a Dublin-based multinational professional services giant.\n\nThey said the new Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System, or KEES, would replace a clunky paper-based enrollment system that sometimes took up to 45 days. The new system, they said, would allow Kansans who provided the correct information through an online portal to enroll within a day or two.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nAfter years of missed deadlines, cost overruns and interagency squabbles, KEES still isn\u2019t working as advertised. Medicaid applications are sometimes taking far longer than they did under the old system \u2014 some up to five months \u2014 and thousands of poor Kansans are being mistakenly denied coverage because of glitches in the system.\n\nLegislators who were frustrated by the delays ordered an audit that was published in December and revealed Accenture had promised more than it could deliver.\n\nAaron Dunkel, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said it\u2019s important to put the KEES rollout in context. Medicaid is exceedingly complicated, he said, and the system programmers had to adjust the software on the fly as state and federal rules changed mid-project.\n\n\u201cFor the size of the project it is and for the complexity of what it has to determine and what it has to do, I think the project overall has been very successful,\u201d Dunkel said.\n\nBut most nursing homes rely heavily on Medicaid and have been hit particularly hard financially as residents struggle to get and maintain coverage.\n\nCindy Luxem, chief executive of the Kansas Health Care Association, said her organization wants to know what went wrong.\n\n\u201cWhere did the train go off the tracks?\u201d Luxem said. \u201cIt seemed like there was a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of \u2018he said, she said\u2019 kind of issues. That shouldn\u2019t be. An online system is something that we\u2019re all used to and that we all use every day. Why was it so difficult here in Kansas to get that figured out?\u201d\n\nInternal emails and documents provided by a source who requested anonymity provide more details about how miscommunication, personality conflicts and staffing problems dogged the project from the beginning.\n\nInternal strife\n\nWhen the KEES project began in August 2011, the objective was to combine two computer systems: one for KDHE to process Medicaid applications and one for the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (now the Kansas Department for Children and Families) to process applications for other social services like cash assistance.\n\nTensions surfaced almost immediately between the two agencies\u2019 information technology leaders.\n\nBob Hasslinger was serving as KDHE\u2019s interim IT director, having been brought into the fold after working as a consultant on an earlier state IT project.\n\nIn a September 2011 email to several colleagues, Hasslinger responded to concerns that he was steering Accenture\u2019s subcontractor, Oracle, toward building KEES on a different software platform without informing the rest of the KEES team.\n\n\u201cThis is absolute Baloney (sic),\u201d Hasslinger wrote.\n\nHasslinger\u2019s email was mainly directed to Ben Nelson, then the chief of information services for SRS.\n\nHe wrote that he was tired of Nelson \u201ccomplaining behind everyones (sic) back\u201d and wanted to set the record straight about \u201cthe secret meetings you (Nelson) are referring to that are not true.\u201d\n\nHasslinger said he was only trying to ensure that Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s executive committee members had information about the pros and cons of various software platforms and that everyone on the KEES team knew that.\n\nHasslinger also took issue with Nelson filing a formal request under the Kansas Open Records Act for information on the meetings in question.\n\nHe said he\u2019d never met with Oracle or Accenture without inviting the other team members.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on the fundamentals of getting this project launched and worry about an on time, in budget delivery,\u201d Hasslinger wrote. \u201cIf in the future, you still choose to make inaccurate accusations, please do it to my face and be advised that I can document every statement I have made above.\u201d\n\nNelson, who left his state job in May 2013 and has since moved to Florida, did not respond to a request for comment sent through his profile on the social networking website LinkedIn.\n\nHasslinger died in December 2012.\n\nA former Accenture employee who worked on KEES and spoke on condition of anonymity said differences between the two agencies involved \u2014 mainly about the design and functions of the program \u2014 continued to dog the project after Hasslinger and Nelson left.\n\nChanging deadlines\n\nGlen Yancey took over for Hasslinger as chief information officer of KDHE in December 2011.\n\nHe previously worked for the Department of Revenue, where he was involved in a Department of Motor Vehicles computer system switch that didn\u2019t go smoothly. Problems with the rollout caused long lines at DMV offices in several Kansas counties.\n\nYancey worked on KEES for more than a year and was named the project\u2019s executive director in March 2013.\n\nBy then the team had successfully implemented an online web portal for Medicaid information slightly ahead of schedule. But Accenture was struggling to work the kinks out of the eligibility determination software that was scheduled to go live before the end of the year.\n\nAn independent evaluation by a firm named Software Engineering Services the previous year reported that the project deadlines were unrealistic from the start and a lack of communication between state officials and Accenture risked putting things further behind schedule.\n\nAccenture\u2019s \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d software also required far more modifications than the company or the state anticipated.\n\nTo buy time, company officials came up with a solution: Change project deadlines, apparently without notifying high-ranking state officials.\n\nIn an email sent shortly before he became the project\u2019s executive director, Yancey recounted a conversation between Mark Dugan, then the assistant secretary of KDHE, and Darin Bodenhamer, the state\u2019s director of Medicaid eligibility.\n\nWhen Dugan asked about delays in the KEES project, Bodenhamer said the state was hitting all of its deadlines and he didn\u2019t know what Dugan was talking about.\n\nIn his email, Yancey warned other KEES team members that what Bodenhamer said was \u201cfactually incorrect.\u201d Yancey attached a spreadsheet to the email showing that Accenture had changed deadlines to make it appear they were being met.\n\n\u201cLook at the delta between when stuff was originally supposed to be done and how the dates just keep changing,\u201d Yancey wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to hit a deadline if you just keep changing it until you are actually there.\u201d\n\nAccenture\u2019s history\n\nWithin weeks after signing the contract to develop KEES, Accenture agreed to pay $63.7 million to settle a federal lawsuit alleging the company committed fraud and took kickbacks on other government IT projects.\n\nBy then Kansas officials were locked into a partnership that promised Accenture almost $200 million.\n\nSome of the funding for KEES went to pay state workers. But the majority was earmarked for Accenture.\n\nKEES originally was projected to cost $138 million to build and another $50 million over five years to maintain once it was up and running. Federal grants would be used for 85 percent of the build costs and 75 percent of the maintenance costs, in part because the system was intended to communicate with the federal insurance marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe state\u2019s auditors later determined that KEES would be about $46 million over the budget from the original contract and unlikely to produce the $300 million in savings over 10 years that state officials projected.\n\nThe state\u2019s auditors also concluded that project management improved in the years after Yancey took control of KEES.\n\nBut internal emails show that the initial transition was rocky.\n\nSoon after Yancey took over, he distributed a revised organizational chart that he said illustrated a \u201cpivot\u201d in KEES development. Some state workers saw their roles on the project change, some were moved to other buildings and some, like Bodenhamer, were dropped entirely.\n\nIn a series of messages to Yancey, Bodenhamer criticized Yancey\u2019s leadership style and questioned his assertion that team morale was high.\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid of you, so I have no doubt they are telling you what you want to hear,\u201d Bodenhamer said. \u201cWhen you cancel people\u2019s meetings and demean them constantly, they become afraid.\u201d\n\nIn another email Bodenhamer sent to Yancey and then-Medicaid Director Susan Mosier, who is now the KDHE secretary, Bodenhamer said the changes would result in a workforce going from being passionate about the project to \u201cjust being happy to have a job.\u201d He predicted troubles ahead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like what has happened here,\u201d Bodenhamer said, \u201cand I think that this whole \u2018pivot\u2019 has been handled very poorly.\u201d\n\nTesting reveals problems\n\nYancey had about five months from the time he took the lead to get KEES up and running by the initial October 2013 deadline.\n\nBut emails show that throughout those months, IT workers from KDHE and DCF were raising alarms about the program\u2019s inability to communicate well with the state\u2019s Medicaid Management Information System, or MMIS.\n\nKEES was built to determine Medicaid eligibility, but the MMIS is the computer system that actually sends eligible Kansans their Medicaid cards and cuts checks to their Medicaid providers. So even if KEES worked perfectly as a standalone system, it would be functionally useless to the state if it could not transfer applications deemed eligible to the MMIS with a high rate of accuracy.\n\nState workers testing the system were finding that too many applications were getting lost along the way.\n\nEmails describe pressure to roll out the system anyway, with multiple state workers pushing back by asking whether it was better to be on time or to have a product that worked.\n\nThe rollout was postponed and the October 2013 deadline passed.\n\nAbout three months after the missed deadline, Yancey appeared before the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee to explain the delay.\n\nHe cited the challenges of getting KEES to interface with the federal ACA exchange but said he was confident the system would be up and running in a matter of \u201cweeks or months\u201d rather than years.\n\nHe also told the committee his team would not go live until it could \u201chold Kansans harmless\u201d during the transition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use KEES when we can provide benefits timely and accurately to Kansans,\u201d Yancey said.\n\nYancey then went back to his team and instituted a new strategy for testing the system.\n\nThe results, however, remained problematic.\n\nThe original terms and conditions of the contract Accenture bid on called for KEES to have an error rate of no more than 0.1 percent in processing and delivering applications. By April 2014, emails show Yancey was willing to settle for 1 percent.\n\nBut emails sent in the wake of the new testing protocols show that the system wasn\u2019t meeting those lowered expectations.\n\nOne email outlined about 16,000 errors in a monthly \u201cfix\u201d file of test applications that didn\u2019t make it through the system \u2014 a rate of about 7 percent \u2014 and \u201cfixes\u201d for those errors that caused new problems.\n\nAnother broke down the monthly file in precise numbers: 15,248 errors out of 236,663 records received \u2014 an error rate of about 6.4 percent.\n\nState IT staff worked with Accenture employees to develop upgraded versions of the software \u2014 called \u201cbuilds\u201d \u2014 with patches that were supposed to fix the bugs.\n\nBut a May 6, 2014, email from Jenifer Telshaw, a KDHE employee who was the KEES business support manager, shows there were setbacks.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to give you a heads up,\u201d Telshaw wrote to Yancey in an email that was carbon copied to several other KDHE employees. \u201cMy staff is reporting that the last two builds (18 & 19) are not very good. They are finding that defects that were fixed are broken again.\u201d\n\nAround that same time, California health officials were reporting a major Medicaid application backlog after rolling out a similar computer program, also developed by Accenture.\n\nAccenture offshores KEES work\n\nSpreadsheets from the testing period show that Accenture and the state were mitigating dozens of \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d software defects each week in early 2014. In mid-May the number of defects fixed began to wane. Throughout July and August, it dropped off even more noticeably.\n\nThat also was when Accenture began a major shift in staffing for the KEES project. Personnel records show that testers, developers and other staff in Topeka were being rolled off the project and replaced by employees in India.\n\nThe shift coincided with a new phase of KEES. Yancey reported to federal officials that the system was built and tested, but the agency needed time for a pilot program to \u201cverify system functional capacity\u201d and train the state workers who would be using the program.\n\nIn the new phase, Accenture relied more on foreign labor. Twenty-four Topeka-based employees \u2014 including seven testers \u2014 were rolled off the project and only five were added. Twenty-eight India-based employees \u2014 including 21 testers \u2014 were added.\n\nAnother former Accenture employee who worked on the project and spoke on condition of anonymity said during that phase of KEES, some of his colleagues were sent to India to train the workers being added to the project. Management\u2019s attitude, the former employee said, was that if employees overseas got it wrong several times, it still would be cheaper than paying U.S.-based employees to get it right the first time.\n\nJoe Dickie, a spokesman for Accenture, disputed that characterization, saying that the global company\u2019s staffing is geared around matching the right skills to each phase of the job.\n\n\u201cThis is a very complex program and over the course of the program lifecycle, different levels of expertise and skill sets are required,\u201d Dickie said of KEES via email. \u201cAt any given time on the program, we may have people in a project location roll-on or roll-off and there isn\u2019t necessarily a correlation in those changes.\u201d\n\nBy the summer of 2014, the KEES team had eliminated most of the \u201ccritical\u201d defects \u2014 showstoppers that could grind the whole program to a halt. But more than 100 \u201chigh\u201d defects remained that would require workarounds, and they were being mitigated more slowly.\n\nRollout pressure grows\n\nIn October 2014, Telshaw emailed Yancey to let him know that it had become obvious to her that her team did not have the staff it needed to oversee the software fixes and get state workers ready to use the system with workarounds.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the team is struggling to complete all of the necessary preparation for Go-Live and it is an even greater hardship if even one person takes off or is sick,\u201d Telshaw wrote. \u201cIt is a major setback when someone leaves the project.\u201d\n\nBy then the system was a year delayed and frustration was building among legislators \u2014 even those usually sympathetic to the Brownback administration.\n\nAt a January 2015 hearing, Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook, a Shawnee Republican who then was chairwoman of the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee, requested Yancey provide detailed data about implementation dates and bug fixes.\n\nYancey said at the time that there still were too many correspondence errors between KEES and the MMIS and the state\u2019s workforce also was not ready to use KEES.\n\nBut amid the state\u2019s budget crisis, lawmakers scraping for every dollar were irritated that they had spent millions on the program with little to show for it.\n\nIn March 2015, legislators voted to audit KEES.\n\nThat same month, KDHE officials approved a substantial rewrite to the contract that extended Accenture\u2019s partnership for five years of operations help while also adding language outlining the penalties for failing to remediate defects.\n\nIn late June, the system went live and began processing Medicaid applications.\n\nWithin months, organizations that serve Kansas Medicaid populations began reporting long waits.\n\nThen came what KDHE Division of Health Care Finance director Mike Randol would later call a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d\n\nAn administration reorganization plan in January 2016 funneled all Medicaid applications through a single \u201cKanCare Clearinghouse\u201d in Topeka \u2014 including some applications for elderly and disabled Kansans that previously were handled by DCF workers throughout the state.\n\nThat created a bottleneck at the same time the ACA\u2019s open enrollment period was flooding the system with about 13,000 new applications.\n\nKEES was not equipped to handle it, and a backlog burgeoned.\n\nMedicaid applications have slowed since open enrollment ended. But state employees say KEES remains ponderous to use and even when applications are completed, the system is not guaranteed to process and send them to the MMIS correctly.\n\nA daily fix file for February provided by KDHE showed that the system filed 97 percent of applications without error on its best day and 88 percent on its worst day \u2014 far from the 99.9 percent envisioned in the original contract.\n\nIn their bid for the contract, Accenture officials wrote that they were \u201cproposing a fully integrated eligibility system with an online application and presumptive eligibility screening tool that increases customer satisfaction as it provides higher availability, reduces keying errors, and expedites the eligibility determination process.\u201d\n\nThe legislators\u2019 auditors determined that Accenture overpromised and under-delivered, agreeing to an unrealistic timeline to develop KEES and promising features that never panned out.\n\nAccenture\u2019s spokesman said it has not violated the contract.\n\n\u201cWe have been and are continuing to deliver according to the contract, which includes updates and amendments,\u201d Dickie said.\n\nYancey, Telshaw and Bodenhamer did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nCassie Sparks, a KDHE spokeswoman, said the state is working with Accenture to improve application processing times and has added employees and redeployed others to pare down the Medicaid application backlog.\n\nThe state has not assessed any financial penalties against Accenture but is withholding its final acceptance payment of $1.85 million for the project.\n\nAt a recent meeting, Randol said the backlog of applications that have been pending more than 45 days in violation of federal guidelines has been reduced from nearly 7,800 to about 7,300.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ve kind of turned the corner, so to speak, and we\u2019re moving downward in a positive direction,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, Randol couldn\u2019t provide lawmakers with a target date for eliminating the backlog.\n\nWhen asked about KEES at a recent news conference, Brownback declined to evaluate how well the program was managed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had difficulties with it,\u201d Brownback said. \u201cWe are working on them. We are working on getting it out and implemented. And we\u2019re going to stay on top of it. But it\u2019s been difficult.\u201d\n\nJim McLean contributed to this story.\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.
