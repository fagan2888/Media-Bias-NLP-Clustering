The annual event is a spring festival with ancient Hindu roots, and although primarily celebrated in India, its popularity has spread to Asia, Europe and parts of North America.\n\nThe highlight of the afternoon is when willing participants gather in a large group and begin flinging, tossing, rubbing, blowing, and throwing, in every direction, various pastel powders until all involved resemble walking art. The thrown powder hangs in the air and slowly rains down as the energy of the crowd borders on a full-frenzy and participants chase one another.\n\nThe event was organized by the Louisville Hindi School and included participation from area schools like Manual High, North Oldham High and Meyzeek Middle. Hindi School teacher Prateek Gupta explained, \"We would like to grow the festival each year to include more and more of the community and someday even have it on the Belvedere. The city of Louisville is ready to help us with that goal when we reach that point.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Gw8rYv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Large group at Holi Mela fling, toss, and throw various pastel powders until all are walking art", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Large group at Holi Mela fling, toss, and throw various pastel powders until all are walking art", "title": "Festival of Colors crowd borders on fun frenzy", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/04/26/festival-colors-crowd-borders-fun-frenzy/26426497/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Large group at Holi Mela fling, toss, and throw various pastel powders until all are walking art", "title": "Festival of Colors crowd borders on fun frenzy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a4889705c53bd4025b2ed25de50a5888ce53da7/c=600-0-3000-2400&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Art Walk", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Art Walk", "title": "Festival of Colors crowd borders on fun frenzy", "author": "Marty Pearl Special to Courier-Journal", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/763a55ec1083d667fcd4e91eb1e9c61d53e85595/c=900-0-2700-2400/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/396bcec6d0023e44491786a5fc6af98e171302c6/c=600-0-3000-2400/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9069670426708ad3057b2316b7f1f8b6f5fc643d/c=200-0-3400-2400/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/156de41a29fee42113b7a6eb5ffe6a1778e07369/c=0-188-3600-2213&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-26T20:56:59.123000-04:00", "shorthed": "Festival of Colors attracts many participants", "articleid": 26426497, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9442ebff27aa307914bc3eee8e6714ec80d9b732/c=0-188-3600-2213/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de98b858909f597a471d57f2328a4b336c0dda6d/c=1125-0-2475-2400/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/04/26/B9316920630Z.1_20150426190206_000_G15AK251G.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Holi Mela, Festival of Colors, Hindu, Hindi School, Marty Pearl, Courier-Journal,"}, "article_summary": "Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share The Holi Mela 2015, Festival of Colors event is a spring festival with ancient Hindu roots where participants paint each other with colored powder.\nBuy Photo Kevin Lin and Tanya Gupta make sure the camera participates in the Festival of Colors at the Hindu Temple of Kentucky on Sunday afternoon.\n4/26/15 (Photo: Marty Pearl/Special to The C-J)Buy PhotoHoli Mela 2015\u2014or the Festival of Colors\u2014took place at the Hindu Temple of Kentucky on Sunday afternoon.\nThe annual event is a spring festival with ancient Hindu roots, and although primarily celebrated in India, its popularity has spread to Asia, Europe and parts of North America.\nThe thrown powder hangs in the air and slowly rains down as the energy of the crowd borders on a full-frenzy and participants chase one another."}
