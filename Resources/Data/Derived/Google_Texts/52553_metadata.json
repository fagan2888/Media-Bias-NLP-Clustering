(AP) - After years of hemorrhaging millions of dollars, Ashland\u2019s hospital is turning around its finances and boosting services after a merger with Asante Health System.\n\nThe struggling independent hospital had been on the brink of closure before it merged to create Asante Ashland Community Hospital in 2013. Asante\u2019s operations include the Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford and Three Rivers Medical Center in Grants Pass.\n\nAshland Community Hospital suffered a more than $4.2 million net loss for the fiscal year that began in 2012, then another $3.6 million loss in 2013.\n\nAfter the merger, the hospital\u2019s losses were reduced to an estimated $1.5 million for the fiscal year that began in October 2013 and ended this September, according to Asante figures.\n\nThe hospital hopes to have a positive operating margin of $100,000 to $200,000 for the current fiscal year that began in October, according to Ashland hospital CEO Sheila Clough, who was brought on board in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re budgeted to have a positive operating income for the first time in seven years,\u201d she said. \u201cTo turn operations around in 12 to 18 months is pretty cool. I expected three years. It really is tremendous.\u201d\n\nClough said there is still room for improvement in the Ashland hospital\u2019s finances. Highly successful hospitals have a 4 to 7 percent operating margin. For a hospital of Ashland\u2019s size, that would equal positive revenue of $1.5 million to $2 million, she said.\n\nAshland City Councilor Dennis Slattery, who helped with merger negotiations, said he is impressed with the hospital\u2019s financial turnaround.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely fine performance considering where the hospital was,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving it toward break-even and then a positive track takes a lot of work. That improvement in one year is actually excellent.\u201d\n\nSlattery, an accounting professor at Southern Oregon University, said the hospital is now on a sustainable track.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a terrific marriage. They\u2019ve done a wonderful job,\u201d Slattery said. \u201cWe have a functioning hospital that is getting better by the day.\u201d\n\nThe hospital is one of Ashland\u2019s largest employers and has the highest average pay.\n\n\u201cPeople understand we saved a whole lot of jobs and peripheral jobs by keeping the hospital in place,\u201d Slattery said.\n\nEmergency Room Supervisor Rick Landt said the hospital has improved since the merger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become evident to me we\u2019re part of a very professional organization that strives for excellence. It\u2019s more than just lip service,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was apprehension and fear of the unknown before the transition, said Landt, who is also an Ashland Parks and Recreation commissioner.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve experienced what that change has meant, in reality most of the fears were unfounded,\u201d he said.\n\nTo shore up the hospital\u2019s finances for the long term, Clough said Asante put in a new computer system. The Ashland hospital now uses correct insurance codes so it gets paid for the procedures it performs.\n\nThe hospital was caring for patients in a way that was more costly than at comparable hospitals. Certified nursing assistants now handle more tasks, such as helping patients to the bathroom, freeing up nurses for higher-level tasks, such as managing medications, Clough said.\n\nWhen support staff members leave their jobs, the hospital evaluates whether they should be replaced. That has led to a reduction in support staff but an increase in nursing staff, she said.\n\nUsing the Asante system\u2019s bulk discount buying power, the Ashland hospital is paying less for supplies and equipment, Clough said.\n\nAshland\u2019s hospital can use Asante staff for human resources, marketing, information technology support, risk management and other duties, rather than having to duplicate those jobs, she said.\n\nAsante ended a pay freeze at the hospital. Employees who qualified for raises received them in fall 2013 and fall 2014. The hospital also aligned its pay and benefits with the Asante system, which increased pay and benefits as well, Clough said.\n\nWith the hospital stabilized, more doctors are having their patients give birth at the hospital, Clough said.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t sure we would even be open. Their trust in and relationship with the hospital wavered,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve established we\u2019ll be here and are investing in the building, training and staff, their confidence in our facility is returning.\u201d\n\nThe hospital is promoting its unique services, including water birth and vaginal-birth-after-Caesarean options. A doctor and anesthesiologist remain on standby during the entire labor process in case a VBAC birth doesn\u2019t work and a C-section is needed, Clough said.\n\nThe hospital hopes to attract pregnant women who prefer the care of midwives, or who want to give birth at home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand to using midwives. Additional births could be done at the hospital,\u201d Clough said, noting midwives could be backed up by physicians and the hospital\u2019s equipment if something went wrong.\n\nUrology and sports medicine are other areas where the hospital hopes to expand services.\n\nThe hospital has recruited additional doctors and nurse practitioners to the area and formed new partnerships with local doctors and surgeons.\n\nAdded services include breast reconstruction for cancer survivors and pediatric dental procedures done in an operating room under anesthesia.\n\nEarly on, Asante recognized the Ashland hospital\u2019s surgical capacity was underused.\n\nSince the merger, inpatient surgeries are up 3 percent and outpatient surgeries increased 6 percent, Clough said.\n\nUse of the emergency room has shot up 20 percent, she said.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act is providing subsidized health insurance to people, but many are still going to emergency rooms - which are required to treat patients - rather than establishing relationships with primary care doctors, Clough said.\n\n\u201cAs patients come to the ER, we steer them after discharge into primary care,\u201d she said.\n\nThat eventually should help reduce costs for the hospital and the health care system overall, she said.\n\nMany patients who would like to avoid costly emergency rooms end up going there or to urgent care clinics because their doctors don\u2019t offer same-day appointments for immediate medical problems.\n\nAsante Physician Partners, Asante\u2019s clinic branch, is addressing that problem by offering more same-day appointments for urgent medical care, Clough said.\n\nOn the technology front, Asante is investing $3.5 million to move the hospital to an electronic medical records system. Doctors can access patient records wherever the patient goes, reducing duplication of testing, the chance of medication errors and other problems, Clough said.\n\nPatients can also access their own medical records, she said.\n\nAsante replaced an archaic nurse call system that frequently broke down. At one point during a weeklong breakdown, patients were using hand bells to summon nurses, Clough said.\n\nNurses now carry responders and can receive calls from patients, even if they are away from the nurses\u2019 station. The call system is also connected to alarms in patient rooms, she said.\n\nThe hospital continues to use volunteers to augment services, including the Pink Ladies organization. The hospital took over that group\u2019s administrative tasks, freeing them up to do their volunteer work.\n\nClough said the community, hospital staff, Asante and local health care providers are showing their commitment to Asante Ashland Community Hospital.\n\n\u201cOne year ago, people were concerned whether Ashland Community Hospital could continue to operate,\u201d she said. \u201cIn one short year, I believe we\u2019ve made sure the hospital can operate and can operate effectively. We will be here for the future of the Ashland community.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe original story can be found on the Mail Tribune\u2019s website: http://bit.ly/1GMidDF", "article_metadata": {"description": "After years of hemorrhaging millions of dollars, Ashland's hospital is turning around its finances and boosting services after a merger with Asante Health System.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After years of hemorrhaging millions of dollars, Ashland\u2019s hospital is turning around its finances and boosting services after a merger with Asante Health System.", "title": "Merger stabilizes Ashland hospital\u2019s finances", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/20/merger-stabilizes-ashland-hospitals-finances/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/18/cb3322bb917e8931680f6a7067003936.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/18/cb3322bb917e8931680f6a7067003936.jpg", "description": "After years of hemorrhaging millions of dollars, Ashland's hospital is turning around its finances and boosting services after a merger with Asante Health System.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Merger stabilizes Ashland hospital\u2019s finances"}, "Author": "VICKIE ALDOUS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1135\"", "article_summary": "It really is tremendous.\u201dClough said there is still room for improvement in the Ashland hospital\u2019s finances.\nClough said the community, hospital staff, Asante and local health care providers are showing their commitment to Asante Ashland Community Hospital.\nThe Ashland hospital now uses correct insurance codes so it gets paid for the procedures it performs.\nThe struggling independent hospital had been on the brink of closure before it merged to create Asante Ashland Community Hospital in 2013.\nAshland City Councilor Dennis Slattery, who helped with merger negotiations, said he is impressed with the hospital\u2019s financial turnaround."}
