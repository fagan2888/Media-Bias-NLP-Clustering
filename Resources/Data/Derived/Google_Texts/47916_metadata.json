ISIS and other Islamist extremists are waging genocide, the most egregious of all human-rights atrocities, against Christians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, and other defenseless religious minorities, whom the administration, apart from last year\u2019s airstrikes to help the Yazidis, has failed. This religious genocide is distinct from but simultaneous with the region\u2019s wars. Similar to Jews under Nazi domination during World War II, the Christians and other minorities in the Middle East today are facing, in addition to the wartime privations suffered by the general population, a relentless and deliberate extermination campaign being carried out in the name of Islamic purification.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2014, ISIS launched its caliphate from Mosul by marking Christian homes with the red letter \u201cN,\u201d for \u201cNazarene,\u201d before confiscating them and exiling their owners. Since then, it has pursued Christians and the other minorities with a systematic intensity intended to delete every trace of their ancient presence. Solely for their religion, Christians and Yazidis have been beheaded, enslaved, abducted and sold, forcibly converted to Islam, and stripped of all their property. Their houses of worship and their cultural artifacts have been expropriated or demolished, including the fifth-century monastery in Qaraytain and Nineveh\u2019s fourth-century Mar Behnam monastery.\n\n\n\nOn a separate topic, I'm curious to know if the Pope is aware of President Obama's pro-infanticide, extreme abortion stance, or is he too focused on climate change to notice?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nope. .05/26/2016 2:06:19AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Nope.", "title": "During Meeting With Pope at The White House, Obama Claims To Defend Religious Freedom", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/09/23/during-meeting-with-pope-obama-claims-to-stand-for-religious-liberty-n2055881", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/266/c29abf7d-37f6-4f69-9a34-fe9b9faa29af.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Nope.", "title": "During Meeting With Pope at The White House, Obama Claims To Defend Religious Freedom", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/09/23/during-meeting-with-pope-obama-claims-to-stand-for-religious-liberty-n2055881", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/266/c29abf7d-37f6-4f69-9a34-fe9b9faa29af.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "During Meeting With Pope at The White House, Obama Claims To Defend Religious Freedom, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd289\"", "article_summary": "President Obama met with Pope Francis at the White House Wednesday morning and claimed that his administration stands in defense of religious liberty.\n\"We stand with you in defense of religious freedom,\" Obama said.\nExcept when of course:1) The Obama administration is suing the nuns of Little Sisters of the Poor and forcing them into contraception mandates, violating their faith and taking away their religious freedom.\n\"Today the 10th Circuit ruled that government can force the Little Sisters to either violate their faith or pay massive IRS penalties,\" lead attorney Mark Rienzi said in a statement.\nSolely for their religion, Christians and Yazidis have been beheaded, enslaved, abducted and sold, forcibly converted to Islam, and stripped of all their property."}
