Israel described the meeting between U.S. lawmakers in the delegation, AIPAC officials, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister asked us to work together to ensure that this strategy of going to the ICC does not succeed,\u201d the congressman told the Post. \u201c[Netanyahu] wants the US to use all the tools that we have at our disposal to, number one, make sure the world knows that war crimes were not committed by Israel, they were committed by Hamas. And that Israel should not be held to a double standard.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nDuring a meeting at The Hague on Tuesday of this week, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki told prosecutors at the International Criminal Court that \u201cclear evidence\u201d of war crimes by Israel against the people of Gaza exists.\n\n\u201cEverything that has happened in the last 28 days is clear evidence of war crimes committed by Israel, amounting to crimes against humanity,\u201d Malki said. \u201cThere is no difficulty for us to show or build the case. Evidence is there for people to see and collect. Israel is in clear violation of international law.\u201d\n\nPrior to his trip, Rep. Israel released a statement announcing, \u201cI have always been one of Israel\u2019s strongest supporters in the U.S. Congress, and I will always stand up for its needs.\u201d Recently, during the height of the conflict the congressman was among lawmakers who signed a letter to the United Nations calling on it to \u201ccondemn Hamas\u2019 use of civilians as human shields, which is a direct violation of international law.\u201d That the Hamas government \u201cuses human shields\u201d in Gaza is a familiar Israeli government talking point, but no independent evidence exists to support the accusation and the claim is widely dismissed as straight propaganda by agencies and experts on the ground in Gaza.\n\nDespite Congressman Israel\u2019s characterization of the conflict in Gaza\u2014and the consistent defense by Netanyahu and other Israeli officials that its military\u2019s behavior in the Strip was and is justified\u2014global indignation and condemnation has resulted from the fact that while three civilians and just over 60 soldiers were killed on the Israeli side during the fighting, official estimates on the Palestinian side put the death toll at 1,865 people killed, including 429 children under the age of 18; 79 people over the age of 60; and 243 women.\n\nThe Israeli government continues to repeat that it killed \u201c900+ terrorists\u201d during what it called Operation Protective Edge, but it offers no convincing argument on how it distinguishes an adult Palestinian male sleeping in his bed, seeking shelter, or fleeing hostilities from someone acting in a military or offensive capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, Amnesty International on Thursday announced that is has seen mounting and \u201calarming\u201d evidence that the IDF launched what it called \u201capparently deliberate attacks\u201d against hospitals and health professionals in Gaza during Israel\u2019s incursion.\n\n\u201cSuch attacks are absolutely prohibited by international law and would amount to war crimes,\u201d aid Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. \u201cThey only add to the already compelling argument that the situation should be referred to the International Criminal Court.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Human Rights Watch said it has now documented cases in which Israel fired on civilians who were fleeing the violence and stated that \u201cdeliberate attacks on civilians who are not participating in the fighting are war crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe horrors of war are bad enough for civilians even when all sides abide by the law,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cBut it\u2019s abhorrent that Israeli forces are making matters even worse by so blatantly violating the laws of war designed to spare civilians.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday evening, as he addressed an informal meeting of the United Nation\u2019s General Assembly, the head of the UN Ban Ki-Moon said the utter destruction of Gaza and the humanitarian crisis that continues there has both \u201cshocked and shamed\u201d the global community.\n\nSpeaking from Gaza, Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) office there, said that 90 of the agency\u2019s premises were hit during the conflict. He said that UNRWA has asked for investigations to be carried out regarding the attacks on agency-run schools that had been sheltering displaced Gazans.\n\n\u201cPerhaps nothing symbolized more the horror that was unleashed on the people of Gaza,\u201d said Ban, \u201cthan the repeated shelling of United Nations facilities harbouring civilians who had been explicitly told to seek a safe haven there. These attacks were outrageous, unacceptable and unjustifiable.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published in Common Dreams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As calls grow for additional investigation and possible prosecution, nation's prime minister looks to allies in US Congress for support", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "As calls grow for additional investigation and possible prosecution, nation's prime minister looks to allies in US Congress for support", "title": "Netanyahu Urges US Lawmakers To Defend Israel Against ICC \"War Crimes\" Prosecution", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/netanyahu-urges-us-lawmakers-defend-israel-icc-war-crimes-prosecution/195117/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ben_16x9-795x446.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-08T14:22:38-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As calls grow for additional investigation and possible prosecution, nation's prime minister looks to allies in US Congress for support", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ben_16x9-795x446.jpg", "title": "Netanyahu Urges US Lawmakers To Defend Israel Against ICC \"War Crimes\" Prosecution", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "war crimes", "published_time": "2014-08-09T05:00:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T14:22:38-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf3c\"", "article_summary": "Netanyahu Urges US Lawmakers To Defend Israel Against ICC \u201cWar Crimes\u201d ProsecutionAs calls grow for additional investigation and possible prosecution, nation's prime minister looks to allies in US Congress for supportAccording to U.S.\n\u201cEverything that has happened in the last 28 days is clear evidence of war crimes committed by Israel, amounting to crimes against humanity,\u201d Malki said.\n\u201cSuch attacks are absolutely prohibited by international law and would amount to war crimes,\u201d aid Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.\n\u201c[Netanyahu] wants the US to use all the tools that we have at our disposal to, number one, make sure the world knows that war crimes were not committed by Israel, they were committed by Hamas.\n\u201cThe prime minister asked us to work together to ensure that this strategy of going to the ICC does not succeed,\u201d the congressman told the Post."}
