MADISON - The No. 1 ranked Ellsworth High School wrestling team amassed the biggest margin of victory in the WIAA State Team Wrestling Tournament so far with a 65-6 demolition of Evansville/Albany in the Division 2 state semifinals Saturday morning at the University of Wisconsin Field House.

Jens Lantz got the Panthers, 19-3 overall, going with a pinfall of the Blue Devils' Chas Katzenmeyer in 3:22 at 126 pounds. E/A's only chance to stay in the dual was to get a pinfall from their state individual meet runner-up Jordan Meyer at 132 against Brad Cain. Meyer nearly got a second period pinfall but Cain held on before the buzzer and scored a takedown in the third period to rob Meyer of even a major decision. Meyer won 7-2 but Ellsworth now had a clear path to a big win.

The Purple won 11 of the next 12 matches. Getting pins were Tristen Mueller at 138 in 1:25; Gabe Frandsen at 160 in 3:53; Brandon VanderMarliere in 2:55 at 182; Brock Steldt at 195 in 1:36; Brodey Kemmerer in a minute at heavyweight; Andrew Swanson in 1:14 at 106; Gabe Mancino at 113 in :20 seconds and Anders Lantz in 5:50 after trailing 6-2 in the second period at 120.

Also winning for EHS were Josh Hines 14-6 over the Blue Devils' Nick Lehman at 152; Logan Kemmerer by a 16-5 major over E/A's Tyler Grant after the match was tied 4-4 at the end of the first period and Anders Lantz.

EHS, 19-3 overall, will face No. 6 Pewaukee (21-5) in the state finals this afternoon. The Pirates upended No. 2 Wittenberg-Birnamwood (17-2) 28-19 in the other semifinal. Evansville/Albany wrestled in its first-ever state team tournament and concluded its season with a 21-5 overall record.
