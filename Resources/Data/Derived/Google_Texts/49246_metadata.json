Health care providers and policymakers are working on ways to attract new talent, but many medical students are reluctant to take up the call.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Association of American Medical Colleges, 59 percent of psychiatrists are 55 or older, the Associated Press reported, making them the fourth oldest group of doctors practicing in 41 medical specialties. Consequently, it is very likely that many will soon retire or accept fewer patients.\n\nIn the 18 years between 1995 and 2013, the total number of adult and child psychiatrists in the US rose by just 12 percent, from 43,640 to 49,079, while the number of physicians grew by 45 percent. During that time, however, the US population increased by about 37 percent, the Association\u2019s statistics show. In addition, millions of Americans have become eligible for mental health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any part of the country where it is easy for our members to find psychiatrists,\u201d Charles Ingoglia, a vice president of the National Council for Behavioral Health, told AP. The council coordinates a network of 2,300 not-for-profit clinics nationwide that provide psychiatric help.\n\nAcross much of US, a serious shortage of psychiatrists http://t.co/a0QdLJDKuWpic.twitter.com/8jzoSkHjXV \u2014 Fox News Health (@foxnewshealth) September 8, 2015\n\nAccording to federal health authorities, there are about 4,000 areas nationwide where there is only one psychiatrist for every 30,000 patients, and with the colossal paperwork requirements imposed by Medicare and private insurance companies, doctors have less time than ever for treating patients.\n\n\u201cThat interferes with our ability to have the time to sit with our patients,\u201d Dr. Renee Binder, president of the American Psychiatric Association, told AP. \u201cWe need to decrease the administrative burden and increase the compensation.\u201d\n\nAccording to AMN Healthcare, a health care staffing company, the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut and New York have more than 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 people, while Wyoming, Texas, Iowa, Mississippi, Indiana, Nevada and Idaho have fewer than six.\n\nREAD MORE: Computer can predict if you'll develop psychosis with 100% accuracy \u2013 study\n\nThe government has been trying to fill the gaps by trying to encourage more students to specialize in psychiatry. In Texas, lawmakers recently voted to forgive the student loans of those who are willing to work as child psychiatrists and pay the loans of those choosing to work in poorer areas.\n\nHowever, there are at least two major concerns that seem to prevent the younger generation from choosing psychiatry. While they might be interested in scientific developments in psychiatry, the profession\u2019s lack of prestige and lower annual wage compared to other fields are demotivating factors \u2013 the mean annual wage for a psychiatrist is $182,700, or 28 percent lower than that of surgeons. Some specialists are switching to a cash-only practice.\n\n\u201cThere remain issues of stigma around mental disorders,\u201d Dr. Darrell Kirch, president of the Medical Colleges Association and a psychiatrist by training, told AP. \u201cThe people who suffer most from that are the patients, but we still see cases where psychiatry is devalued by some in the medical profession.\u201d\n\n\u2018Super-smart mice\u2019 might help cure Alzheimer\u2019s and schizophrenia \u2013 study http://t.co/gSLeDu7Ogwpic.twitter.com/fdl0GBPXKh \u2014 RT (@RT_com) August 15, 2015\n\nMental health experts see two major solutions that can help improve the situation quicker than others.\n\nOne is to embrace technology and make psychiatric telemedicine a wider practice. That would help psychiatrists to practice in larger regions, and give them better access to patients with limited mobility. Several states, including South Carolina, North Carolina and Michigan, use extensive telepsychiatry programs. Though there are concerns about the lack of face-to-face interaction, doctors practicing in the program say it has more pros than cons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same for psychiatrists,\u201d Dr. Sy Saeed, a leader of North Carolina\u2019s program, told AP. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve engaged in the visit for a few seconds, I also forget that it\u2019s occurring via telepsychiatry.\u201d\n\nAnother option is collaborative care in which non-psychiatrists would receive specialized training in mental health and practice based on their expertise.\n\nMajority of seriously mentally ill youth do not receive treatment \u2013 study http://t.co/djB0ndGw5xpic.twitter.com/poPIFxj3xs \u2014 RT (@RT_com) May 29, 2015\n\nThere is also a question about whether trained psychologists, who are not medical doctors, should have the authority to prescribe psychiatric medication. This practice is currently allowed in only three states: Illinois, Louisiana and New Mexico.\n\nThis idea, however, was met with fierce criticism from psychiatric groups, which have blocked such moves in other states.\n\n\u201cMedications for psychiatric illness are really powerful ... people can die from these,\u201d Binder said. \u201cYou need a medical background to prescribe them effectively.\u201d\n\nPsychologist Daniel Abrahamson, who heads the American Psychological Association\u2019s state advocacy office, has challenged that argument, saying that it is \u201cnot based on the facts.\u201d Abrahamson cites the lack of problems in the three states where it is permitted as evidence.\n\n\u201cIt would behoove everybody to work together,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the old issues keep getting in the way and people try to protect their turf.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The majority of US states face a shortage of psychiatrists, while the need for specialists is growing.
