And it is the latest in what has been rapid expansion for Meridian. The Wall-based hospital system said last month it is moving forward with plans to merge with Raritan Bay Health Services Corp., which has hospitals in Old Bridge and Perth Amboy.\n\nThe agreement with Hackensack was first announced in October. And it still requires state and federal regulatory approval, which could take six months to a year.\n\nMeridian CEO John K. Lloyd and Hackensack CEO Robert C. Garrett will be co-chief executive officers for 21/ 2 years. Garrett then would become the sole CEO. They spoke with the Asbury Park Press Tuesday afternoon and explained what's in store.\n\nWhat does the merger mean for patients?\n\nThe merger would give Meridian patients access to Hackensack's specialists in cancer care and neuroscience without needing to go to New York or Philadelphia, Lloyd said.\n\nMeanwhile, it would help Hackensack follow Meridian's lead and provide more care outside the traditional hospital setting, Garrett said.\n\n\"We want to provide access to care,\" Garrett said. \"That's one of the goals of this merger \u2013 provide better access to residents we serve.\"\n\nWhat does the merger mean for employees?\n\nMeridian is the Shore's biggest employer with 12,000 employees. Hackensack is about the same size.\n\nThe new company could lay off workers who have similar jobs, but employees involved in patient care would see little impact, Lloyd said.\n\nThe company hasn't settled on a location for a new headquarters, but it expects the site to be close to the midway point between Wall and Hackensack, the executives said.\n\n\"As we get closer to final approval, we're looking at nonclinical areas to see if there's a potential savings, but at this point it's very premature to say if we would or wouldn't have reductions,\" Lloyd said.\n\nWhat does the merger mean for your pocketbook?\n\nHospital consolidation typically results in higher prices because it gives hospitals more clout in their negotiations with insurance companies, according to a 2012 report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a Princeton-based research group.\n\nBut hospital executives said the landscape has changed. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, has forced hospitals to work more closely with insurance companies to deliver care more efficiently.\n\n\"I think things have changed dramatically,\" Lloyd said. \"Health insurance companies are looking for value. Even if you're a large health system, they're looking for the same thing.\"\n\nMERIDIAN-HACKENSACK MERGER AT A GLANCE\n\n\u2022Wall-based Meridian operates five hospitals in Monmouth and Ocean counties: Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune; Ocean Medical Center in Brick; Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank; Bayshore Community Hospital in Holmdel; and Southern Ocean Medical Center in Stafford. It is expected to take over Raritan Bay Medical Center's two hospitals in Old Bridge and Perth Amboy. Additionally it operates K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital in Neptune.\n\n\u2022Hackensack University Health Network is the largest health care system in northern New Jersey. It operates four hospitals, including HackensackUMC in Hackensack; HackensackUMC Mountainside in Monclair; HackensackUMC at Pascack Valley in Westwood; and Palisades Medical Center in North Bergen. Additionally it operates Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital in Hackensack.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Hf2DFT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Meridian Health and Hackensack University Health Network have reached the next step in their plan to merge.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Meridian Health and Hackensack University Health Network have reached the next step in their plan to merge.", "title": "3 questions for Meridian, Hackensack hospital merger", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/money/business/2015/05/12/meridian-hackensack/27170087/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Meridian Health and Hackensack University Health Network have reached the next step in their plan to merge.", "title": "Meridian, Hackensack push hospital merger", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed8ef705f56a3aa30fe452de505fd5eff9da26dd/c=368-0-2383-2015&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/12/AsburyPark/B9317311112Z.1_20150512220859_000_GI9AOOMEH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Meridian Health, Hackensack University Health, Jersey Shore University Medical, Riverview, Ocean Medical, Bayshore Community Hospital, Southern Ocean Medical Center"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce126\"", "article_summary": "The new company, to be called Hackensack Meridian Health, will have 25,000 employees and 11 hospitals, stretching from southern Ocean County to Bergen County.\n(Photo: Mark R.
