It\u2019s been a mixed bag, to say the least. Ever since, we\u2019ve had trouble figuring out what that word \u201cliberty\u201d is supposed to mean, in the American context. And even if we set aside the use of \u201cmen\u201d as a 19th-century convention, the proposition that all of them are created equal was a gigantic rhetorical dodge, even in Abe Lincoln\u2019s day. Women and enslaved African-Americans and Native Americans driven off their lands and white men of all classes stand equal and naked before the Lord, in other words, but not before the law or anywhere else this side of heaven.\n\nIt\u2019s Fourth of July weekend in the second decade of the 21st century, and our backyard cookouts, beach getaways and fireworks displays are somehow meant to symbolize our fealty to the ideals of the American Revolution. As we are now dimly and uncomfortably aware, that globe-rattling 18th-century event was shot through with hypocrisy and contradiction. It\u2019s difficult to feel any national unity when we can\u2019t agree on what ideals we\u2019re talking about, which version of the revolutionary narrative we like best or exactly why it was worth bothering about. Were the Founding Fathers building a Christian nation or a monument to Enlightenment reason? (In either case, they papered over some big problems.) Do we prefer the soaring democratic rhetoric of noted slave-rapist Thomas Jefferson, or the pragmatic cynicism of proto-Wall Streeter Alexander Hamilton?\n\nAs I wrote last year after a visit to the living-history park at Colonial Williamsburg, no one amid a crowd of hundreds had any answer for the actor playing infamous turncoat Benedict Arnold, when he rode into Virginia\u2019s colonial capital at the head of a Redcoat regiment. (That actually happened, in 1781.) You losers threw away British security over a few pennies in taxes, Arnold scoffed \u2013 what was that all about? There was some mumbling and booing among the masses. \u201cReligious freedom!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re taxed too much!\u201d said someone else. Tithe to the Church of England and you may worship as you please, Arnold retorted. And your taxes under the Continental Congress are many times higher than the Crown ever dreamed of imposing. No one said much after that; you got the feeling people knew there must be a bigger answer than God and taxes, but they couldn\u2019t come up with it.\n\nPolitical and cultural divisions go back to the birth of our republic, and well before that: Colonial Williamsburg vividly conveys the sense that even in open rebellion Virginia considered itself English, in a way Massachusetts did not. (That Anglocentric historical sense colors the character of the Old Dominion to this day.) We\u2019ve certainly had periods of political paralysis and intractable conflict before; Lincoln\u2019s greatest speech, the one I misquoted above, came at the climax of one such episode. He was, of course, trying to build a sense of unity and shared national identity out of the chaos of the Civil War and the shameful compromises of the decades before that. In effect, Lincoln argued that American history up to that point had been a faulty prelude or a dress rehearsal for the real thing. Consecrated by the \u201chonored dead\u201d of Gettysburg, the nation would have \u201ca new birth of freedom,\u201d and those highfalutin Fourth of July phrases in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence \u2013 so flowery compared to Lincoln\u2019s blunt, brief address \u2013 would finally start to mean what they said.\n\nI don\u2019t need to recite the succeeding 150 years of tumultuous American history to convince you that it wasn\u2019t quite that simple \u2013 not for women, not for African-Americans, not for Native Americans and not for the generations of immigrants who were only beginning to become part of the American fabric. Not for anybody, really. But Lincoln\u2019s genius lay precisely in the fact that he saw the American republic as a work in progress, and did not delude himself that redeeming its promise could happen overnight. His words were and remain seductive and prophetic, not least because he speaks to our desire for narrative fulfillment, our BBQ-flavored, Fourth of July yearning to believe that the American enterprise has a sacred purpose and was not fatally undermined by its initial clusterfuck of compromises.\n\nI\u2019m aware of the attitude I\u2019m supposed to hold in order to be a decent 21st-century liberal, which is that America is crawling in its imperfect fashion toward the realization of Lincoln\u2019s vision of liberty and equality. There are absolutely things to celebrate on our national holiday, even if they come with asterisks. Racism and sexism linger on, but old-school open discrimination is broadly illegal. Gay people can get married in more and more places (soon nationwide, no doubt), and the helpless apoplexy of Rick Santorum and Antonin Scalia at that fact is pleasant to contemplate. Blow a doobie on the streets of Seattle or Denver, and the beat cop will wish you good morning. (That particular struggle for liberty will take longer to go nationwide, for peculiar political reasons.) We elected a black president, who couldn\u2019t have anointed himself as Lincoln\u2019s heir or the fulfillment of his prophecy any more obviously.\n\nTo paraphrase Martin Luther King, Jr., who was himself paraphrasing the 19th-century Unitarian minister Theodore Parker, we are to take comfort in the idea that the arc of the moral universe has a long-ass bend, but one we can see slowly bending toward justice. I\u2019m not much of a good American liberal, as it happens \u2013 personally and professionally, I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s always going to tell you the glass is slightly less than half-full \u2013 but I believe that too. I\u2019m less convinced that the United States of America is the divine instrument of that long arc, or that our country will be around to see it touch down one blessed day, or whether that even matters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Obama's dreams of being a second Lincoln ruined by a new civil war, how long can our paralyzed country last?", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With Obama's dreams of being a second Lincoln ruined by a new civil war, how long can our paralyzed country last?", "title": "Liberty, equality and Lincoln\u2019s legacy: Is America doomed?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/05/liberty_equality_and_lincolns_legacy_is_america_doomed/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/lincoln_obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Obama's dreams of being a second Lincoln ruined by a new civil war, how long can our paralyzed country last?", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/lincoln_obama.jpg", "title": "Liberty, equality and Lincoln\u2019s legacy: Is America doomed?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Liberty, equality and Lincoln\u2019s legacy: Is America doomed?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abraham Lincoln, American Revolution, Barack Obama, Christian Right, Civil War, Colonial Williamsburg, Democracy, Editor's Picks, Fourth of July, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Hobby Lobby, Jeb Bush, Neo-Confederate, Politics, Rick Santorum, Supreme Court, Ted Cruz, U.S. Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1331\"", "article_summary": "Ever since, we\u2019ve had trouble figuring out what that word \u201cliberty\u201d is supposed to mean, in the American context.\nI\u2019m aware of the attitude I\u2019m supposed to hold in order to be a decent 21st-century liberal, which is that America is crawling in its imperfect fashion toward the realization of Lincoln\u2019s vision of liberty and equality.\nWe elected a black president, who couldn\u2019t have anointed himself as Lincoln\u2019s heir or the fulfillment of his prophecy any more obviously.\nPolitics, Politics NewsEleven-score and 18 years ago, our forefathers brought forth on this continent \u2013 OK, they weren\u2019t our actual forefathers, in most cases \u2013 a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n(That particular struggle for liberty will take longer to go nationwide, for peculiar political reasons.)"}
