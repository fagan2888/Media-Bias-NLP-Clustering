The available plans often strap enrollees with hundreds or even thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\nFortunately, federal regulators just stepped in to address this shortcoming in the Affordable Care Act. They have issued a new ruling that ensure enrollees in New Jersey's insurance exchange plans get the protection they deserve and the medication they need.\n\nAcross the country, people were unknowingly enrolling in insurance plans that conceal the exorbitant out-of-pocket costs they will have to pay for medications. That's because these medicines come with unaffordable \"co-insurance,\" which requires patients to pay a set slice of the product price -- no matter how high it is.\n\nThe costs are particularly unaffordable for people with chronic conditions, such as cancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS.\n\nRather than pay these exorbitant sums, some patients will simply skip their medications. By not taking prescriptions, though, they increase their risk of acute illnesses that require even more expensive treatments.\n\nThis new ruling from federal officials will address many of these shortcomings and ensure that Affordable Care Act plans don't skimp on drug coverage.\n\nFirst, the rule advises insurance companies to base their coverage of particular drugs on the recommendations of expert panels and other objective criteria. Doing so inhibits insurers from making decisions that discriminate against people with certain illnesses.\n\nThe rule also increases plan transparency. Plans are now required to publish full, up-to-date formularies online. That will allow patients to shop for plans based on their medication needs and avoid unexpected out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIf patients need a medication not covered by their plan, they can apply for an exception. Now, thanks to the new rule, insurers must respond to those patients within three days.\n\nThese reforms are a good start. But there's still more federal authorities can do to ensure the exchanges actually fulfill their mission of extending affordable health coverage to vulnerable patients.\n\nAt the very least, regulators should outright prohibit insurers from offering plans that impose large out-of-pocket payments for key medications.\n\nRegulators also ought to ban co-insurance altogether for lower-income individuals eligible for subsidized ACA plans. These people simply can't afford huge and unexpected co-insurance payments.\n\nThis new ruling will greatly improve the quality of care afforded New Jersey residents enrolled in our state's exchange. Federal regulators deserve credit for making these improvements to the Affordable Care Act. But there's still more work to be done.\n\nLisa Schill is vice president of RASopathies Network USA.\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @starledger.
