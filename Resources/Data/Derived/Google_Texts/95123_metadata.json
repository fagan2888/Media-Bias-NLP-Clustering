The median price for the first half of the year was $155,000, up 9.2 percent from a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe market is really strong,\u201d said Karen Becker, CEO of the Realtor group, which covers 11 counties in the southeast corner of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s been consistently good in our area primarily because of the employment situation.\u201d\n\nThe state has added 41,602 jobs since June 2014, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED). Rochester saw a big bump in the number of jobs in the last month, said Cameron Macht, regional analysis and outreach manager for DEED. Job growth for Rochester grew 1.4 percent between May and June 2015.\n\nThe $6 billion redesign of downtown Rochester for the Destination Medical Center is expected to draw more home buyers and job seekers to the region as the center creates about 30,000 jobs and billions in new tax revenue. The Mayo Clinic already employs more than 34,000 people in the city, which has a population of about 110,742.\n\nThe medical center has already pushed up commercial real estate prices, as investors from around the world are betting on the Mayo Clinic\u2019s massive expansion. The clinic has pledged to bring in $2 billon in private investments to shape the city into a destination with new shops, restaurants and hotels to entice medical professionals to the area.\n\nA strong June and first half Home sales statistics for June and the first half of 2015, compared to the same period a year ago June Percent change YTD 2015 Percent change Median sales price: $167,000 7.7% $155,00 9.2% Closed sales: 773 18.7% 2,993 21.6% Pending sales: 589 8.9% 3,483 23.9% New listings: 755 -6.9% 4,257 +5.8% Days on market: 77 -3.5% 92 -7.1%\n\nChristopher Galler, CEO of Minnesota Association of Realtors, expects DMC will continue to push up home prices as well in the Rochester area.\n\n\u201cThere is so much development that\u2019s going to occur with the medical center,\u201d he said.\n\nThe southeast median sale prices are higher than the state. According to the state\u2019s June report, Minnesota saw a 7 percent increase in median sale prices. Affordability is going down for the whole state, Galler said.\n\nIn southeast Minnesota, homes sold more quickly, even as prices rose. Homes were on the market an average 77 days in June, down 13.5 percent from a year ago. There were 773 closed sales during the month, up nearly 19 percent from last June. Another 589 sales were pending.\n\nNew listings fell 6.9 percent to 755. Inventory levels fell 19 percent to 2,158 homes for sale. That leaves the area with 4.3 months\u2019 supply, compared with 6.1 months a year ago.\n\n\u201cFinancing is available and affordable,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThis is a great time whether you are a buyer or seller.\u201d\n\nRochester real estate agent Lori Mickelson said when she is selling houses under $250,000, she has two buyers for every seller. She said there is a shortage of homes on the market.\n\n\u201cMost sellers are getting close to their asking price if not over the asking price for their homes,\u201d Mickelson said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Home prices in the Rochester area are hitting peaks not seen in years, driven by strong employment and continued low interest rates.", "title": "Rochester home sales kick into fast lane", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/rochester-home-sales-kick-into-fast-lane/317041961/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143726302635721.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143726302635721.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Home prices in the Rochester area are hitting peaks not seen in years, driven by strong employment and continued low interest rates.", "title": "Rochester home sales kick into fast lane", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/rochester-home-sales-kick-into-fast-lane/317041961/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143726302635721.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143726302635721.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Home prices in the Rochester area are hitting peaks not seen in years, driven by strong employment and continued low interest rates."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f55\"", "article_summary": "The median price for the first half of the year was $155,000, up 9.2 percent from a year ago.\nThe southeast median sale prices are higher than the state.\nAccording to the state\u2019s June report, Minnesota saw a 7 percent increase in median sale prices.\nIn southeast Minnesota, homes sold more quickly, even as prices rose.\nHome prices in the Rochester area are hitting peaks not seen in years, driven by strong employment and continued low interest rates."}
