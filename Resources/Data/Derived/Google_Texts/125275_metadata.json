I needed something different to do -- and believe me this is different,\u201d said Wood. \u201cI thought, 'Is this really real? Am I really doing this.'\u201d\n\nWood, one of the most popular students on campus, said she likes her \u201cGranny Franny\u201d nickname.\n\nThat's because students a quarter her age gravitate toward her because, for someone who said she was so down, always manages to inspire others.\n\n\u201cStudents feel loved by her. She's kind of like a grandma away from home,\u201d said student Konner McIntire.\n\nAs a result, students honored Wood during homecoming week. In fact, three students asked the 82-year-old to escort them to the dance and game.\n\nWhile the three-to-one group date was a treat, the standing ovation Wood received really made the night stand out. And then Wood received a special place in homecoming court. She was crowned \"homecoming granny.\"\n\n\u201cI could never have imagined all of this,\u201d said Wood.\n\nHowever, she did pass on some words of wisdom to her dates that night: get real girls.\n\n\u201cYes, she did say that we need to get real girls that are potential wives,\u201d said Dylan Aebersold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An octogenarian student who students say inspires everyone she meets received a special honor during the homecoming festivities at a university in Kansas.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "An octogenarian student who students say inspires everyone she meets received a special honor during the homecoming festivities at a university in Kansas.", "title": "Students: 82-year-old \u2018homecoming granny\u2019 inspires", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2013/10/20/homecoming-granny/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/dlookyc8ukm-fb9h4xmdoxojbro-i4w89.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/dlookyc8ukm-fb9h4xmdoxojbro-i4w89.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2013-10-20T15:18:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T15:18:58+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "keywords": "national, news, education schools and teachers", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2524\"", "article_summary": "While the three-to-one group date was a treat, the standing ovation Wood received really made the night stand out.\nAnd then Wood received a special place in homecoming court.\nAs a result, students honored Wood during homecoming week.\n'\u201dWood, one of the most popular students on campus, said she likes her \u201cGranny Franny\u201d nickname.\n\u201cI thought, 'Is this really real?"}
