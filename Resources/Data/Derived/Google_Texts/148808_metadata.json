TASC places people in drug-rehab programs and monitors their progress.\n\nRodriguez said she believes the number of narcotics offenders diverted to \u201cdrug school\u201d or community-based treatment could double to more than 12,000 a year because the policy. Alvarez says Medicaid and the Affordable Health Care Act will pay for the additional treatment.\n\nAlvarez is getting ready to send a memo to prosecutors outlining how they are supposed to carry out the policy. Daly said drug-case dismissals will begin \u201csoon,\u201d possibly as early as next week.\n\nAlvarez\u2019s office has been meeting with judges and the public defender\u2019s office and plans to reach out to suburban police chiefs, Daly said.\n\nAbout half of the people TASC assists have a primary substance abuse problem involving marijuana, Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cTheir treatment is very much focused on behavioral change and self-management,\u201d she said.\n\nBut heroin is a huge problem, too.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the longest lasting love affairs with heroin addiction in Cook County and Chicago,\u201d Rodriguez said. For heroin users, \u201cwe have medications to treat the addiction and there are effective behavioral interventions.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, 259 people out of every 100,000 people in Chicago visited emergency rooms for heroin use, compared with 145 per 100,000 in New York City, according to the latest federal statistics. Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin is scheduled to oversee a hearing this week on ways to curb heroin abuse in Cook County.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Shoplifting and other petty crime associated with narcotics abuse could decrease because of Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez\u2019s new", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/when-prosecutors-start-tossing-drug-cases-could-thefts-go-down/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "When prosecutors start tossing drug cases, could thefts go down?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/when-prosecutors-start-tossing-drug-cases-could-thefts-go-down/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "When prosecutors start tossing drug cases, could thefts go down?"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin is scheduled to oversee a hearing this week on ways to curb heroin abuse in Cook County.\nWhen prosecutors start tossing drug cases, could thefts go down?\nAbout half of the people TASC assists have a primary substance abuse problem involving marijuana, Rodriguez said.\n\u201cWe have one of the longest lasting love affairs with heroin addiction in Cook County and Chicago,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nUnder the policy announced last week, Alvarez\u2019s office will no longer prosecute most misdemeanor marijuana cases and will send nonviolent offenders charged with low-level felony heroin, marijuana and cocaine possession to drug treatment instead of jail."}
