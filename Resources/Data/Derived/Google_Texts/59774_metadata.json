You will not face the tax/penalty for going uninsured.\n\nIf you live in a state that is \u201cexpanding Medicaid\u201d, then you could apply for Medicaid. See Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s List of States Medicaid Expansion Decisions as of September 16, 2013. You would qualify for Medicaid based upon your income and assets, such as savings accounts.\n\nIf your state is not expanding Medicaid and your income is less than 133% of Federal Poverty ($15,282 for a single person), then strangely enough you cannot go to your state\u2019s health insurance exchange (or \u201cmarketplace\u201d) and get subsidies to buy a plan. This gap came about when the Supreme Court made it optional for states to expand Medicaid. Lots of people are expected to fall into this gap \u2013 too poor to qualify for subsidies to buy health insurance. Not to worry \u2013 the tax/penalty won\u2019t apply to you. You will easily fall into another exception: if the lowest cost plan costs more than 8% of your income, you are not faced with the penalty.\n\nThis still leaves you without insurance, depending upon what state you live in. Before you need medical help, ask your student health center for a list of sliding-scale and free clinics. In an emergency situation, a hospital cannot turn you away. You would, however, be responsible for your emergency room bills.\n\nBest wishes on finding a job (with benefits) in 2014!\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "I'm an unemployed college student with no financial aid and no income...What are my options?
