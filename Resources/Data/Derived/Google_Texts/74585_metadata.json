Flames reached through the partially collapsed roof and a high column of smoke darkened the winter sky. This fire had been burning for some time.\n\nThe fire station is two minutes from the Teresa Moda garment factory, on the edge of the main industrial zone of Prato, a town outside Florence. The zone was developed for Italian textile manufacturers in the 1980s but now is predominantly Chinese.\n\nThe first squad arrived around 7 a.m. Priority No. 1 was the arm in the window. A firefighter raced up a ladder, cut through the bars and pulled out the slight, smoke-black body of a man. The operation took less than five minutes.\n\nEach second mattered.\n\nIt was near dawn on a Sunday morning, but firefighters knew they would find more people inside. There were always people inside the Chinese factories.\n\nThe fire that destroyed the Teresa Moda factory on Dec. 1, 2013, was the deadliest in living memory in Prato. It exposed the true cost of cheap clothes, laying bare the consequences of years of failed law enforcement and the pursuit of profit over safety.\n\nPrato is the epicenter of a thriving, illicit Chinese economy that has grown in the wake of Chinese immigration. More than 40,000 Chinese live in the city \u2014 some 15,000 of them illegally. Many migrants have replicated the habits of home and created a kind of outsourcing. Merchandise isn\u2019t exported; China itself is.\n\nThousands of people have been smuggled into Italy, finding work at factories that ignore basic safety standards, while billions of euros are smuggled back to China, police investigations show. The savings on tax and labor costs have given businesses that don\u2019t follow the law a crushing competitive advantage.\n\nMany say illegal factories such as Teresa Moda are part of larger criminal networks in China and Italy. Police and prosecutors said they lack the tools to fully tackle the flow of migrants and money that fuel Prato\u2019s black economy. The two countries do not cooperate closely in criminal investigations.\n\nFire chief Vincenzo Bennardo, a stocky, bald man whose phone ring mimics a siren, arrived after the body from the window was brought to the ground and was covered. He found two Chinese women outside the factory, crying, but untouched by smoke.\n\nThe younger one spoke some Italian and acted as translator. Prato has one of the highest concentrations of Chinese in Europe, but not a single Chinese firefighter.\n\nThe fire was eating through the building fast. Bennardo needed to know how many more people were inside and where to look for them.\n\n\u201cAre there other people?\u201d he asked the women. \u201cDo you know how many?\u201d\n\nThey kept gesturing, agitated, at the factory, but said little. Bennardo tried a different tack. He asked if they knew the dead man. They said yes. Then they hedged. They told Bennardo they were neighbors and thought the man worked in the factory.\n\nMaybe the women needed to see the dead man\u2019s face. A paramedic pulled back the sheet. The man looked like he had been cooked.\n\n\u201cWho is this? Do you know him or not?\u201d Bennardo said.\n\nThe women cried harder now. They wrote down the dead man\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cDo you know exactly how many people were inside?\u201d Bennardo pressed. How many people did his men need to find?\n\nThis time younger woman answered: \u201cThere\u2019s a little boy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMADE IN ITALY\n\nBennardo got into the fire business because he wanted to connect with people, out on the streets. Two years ago, he signed up for a free Mandarin course offered by the local government. If you want to understand people, Bennardo figured, you have to grasp how they think. But he didn\u2019t get past six lessons. \u201c\u2018Ni hao,\u2019 I think that means, \u2018Ciao,'\u201d Bennardo said.\n\nHe grew up in Turin, an integrated, multiethnic city, unlike Prato. On one side of Prato\u2019s old stone walls, people stroll through piazzas, past renowned frescoes and striated marble churches. On the other side, slot machines, massage parlors and Chinese graffiti offering jobs, shared rooms and paid female companionship punctuate the plain streets of Chinatown.\n\nThe Teresa Moda factory sat on a short street with scraggly trees, in a grid of blind corners and dead ends called Macrolotto 1.\n\nEvery Tuesday and Friday night, the dim streets of this industrial zone blaze with headlights as buyers load cheap, trendy clothes onto trucks. Many are headed for other towns in Italy, France or Germany, while 4 percent of Prato\u2019s clothing exports, which totaled 551 million euros ($696 million) last year, finds its way to the United States, according to Italy\u2019s National Institute for Statistics.\n\nThe factory churned out cheap \u201cfast fashion\u201d garments for sale across Europe. In an industry that thrives on speed, factories such as Teresa Moda have the advantage of being close to their main market. They also can trade on the cachet of the \u201cMade in Italy\u201d brand, though their clothes are made by Chinese workers in Chinese factories.\n\nIn the 1980s, Chinese immigrants began moving to Italy from the area around Wenzhou, a city famous for its entrepreneurs. Prato offered Chinese migrants ample subcontracting work, a steady stream of buyers and an existing industrial infrastructure. Many of those migrants have gone on to found businesses.\n\nDespite the global financial crisis, the number of individually-owned Chinese businesses in Prato grew 35 percent from 2008 to 2013, while the number of European ones shrank, according to the Italian Chambers of Commerce.\n\nCritics say that growth was possible because migrants brought a cultural disregard for regulations that do not maximize profit. Prato authorities have raided over 1,900 Chinese factories in the past 6 1/2 years, closing 909 for gross safety and labor violations, and seized 33,427 sewing machines that were not up to code.\n\nAuthorities spent months trying to prove that a woman named Lin You Lan was in charge of Teresa Moda and that the legal owner was a front. Chinese companies often open and close quickly to avoid tax and regulatory scrutiny, according to officials, and prosecutors said Teresa Moda was the fourth company that Lin and her sister had run out of the same building.\n\nLin\u2019s defense lawyer, Gabriele Zanobini, contests both points. He said she was an employee, responsible for supplier relationships and administration, and that neither Lin nor her sister ever owned a business at the address.\n\nTo the Italian brothers who owned the factory building, Lin You Lan was \u201cMonica.\u201d To the workers, prosecutors said, she was \u201cboss.\u201d To Bennardo, she was the face of a problem he had not been able to solve.\n\nHe kept a fire safety booklet, translated into Chinese, in his office, part of his community outreach tools. He realized a booklet wouldn\u2019t change a culture, but he wanted Prato\u2019s Chinese to know that fire extinguishers could be thought of as a good investment. At the least, maybe they\u2019d learn what number to dial when there was a fire. Bennardo only got a call when things went really wrong.\n\n___\n\nTEN MINUTES\n\nTen minutes before the fire station got the call about the Teresa Moda fire, Lin You Lan\u2019s cellphone rang. It was her sister, Lin Youli, who managed the daily operations of the factory with her husband, Hu Xiaoping. They lived at the factory with their 5-year-old son, Giorgio.\n\nBennardo could have used those 10 minutes.\n\nThe first call to the fire department came at 6:55 a.m. Over the next 22 minutes, the fire department would receive 27 more calls about the fire. Only one came from a Chinese person.\n\nTeresa Moda\u2019s workers had been up until nearly 2 a.m. sewing. Like many Chinese workers in Prato, they slept at the factory, in violation of Italian law, in a two-story row of bedrooms adjacent to a makeshift kitchen.\n\nChen Changzhong had been working there for seven months. According to court documents, he put in 13 hours to 17 hours a day for 2 euros to 3 euros an hour. It was a fraction of Italy\u2019s legal minimum wage, but more than he was likely to earn back home. He and five co-workers were in Italy illegally. He said he paid for his 1,500-euro flight from Beijing himself.\n\nIt is not clear how poor Chinese migrants afford their plane tickets. Some pay smugglers thousands of euros to come to Italy, where they are exploited as low-cost labor to pay off their debt, according to Italy\u2019s National Antimafia Directorate.\n\nThere was no fire alarm at the Teresa Moda factory. The heat finally startled Chen awake.\n\nHis room wasn\u2019t far from the bathroom. He thought he could douse himself before running through the flames, but he never made it to the shower. He couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nThere are trade-offs in making shirts that wholesale for less than 5 euros. In Teresa Moda\u2019s case, this meant forgoing not just a fire alarm, but also adequate fire extinguishers and emergency sprinklers, investigations would show. No one had bothered to bring the heavy front door up to code, either. Prosecutors said it was too hard to slide open.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fire exposes illegal Chinese factories in Italy", "title": "Fire exposes illegal Chinese factories in Italy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fire exposes illegal Chinese factories in Italy", "title": "Fire exposes illegal Chinese factories in Italy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/18/fire_exposes_illegal_chinese_factories_in_italy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/italy-factory-fire.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fire exposes illegal Chinese factories in Italy", "title": "Fire exposes illegal Chinese factories in Italy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/italy-factory-fire.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erika Kinetz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ba7\"", "article_summary": "Many say illegal factories such as Teresa Moda are part of larger criminal networks in China and Italy.\nThey also can trade on the cachet of the \u201cMade in Italy\u201d brand, though their clothes are made by Chinese workers in Chinese factories.\nIn an industry that thrives on speed, factories such as Teresa Moda have the advantage of being close to their main market.\nThe fire that destroyed the Teresa Moda factory on Dec. 1, 2013, was the deadliest in living memory in Prato.\nPrato offered Chinese migrants ample subcontracting work, a steady stream of buyers and an existing industrial infrastructure."}
