 Steamboat Springs School District technology director Tim Miles remembers the very first time he saw a computer.

It was the mid-1980s when the bulky piece of equipment was rolled into his high school. Nothing groundbreaking had hit the shelves yet, but even the biggest, clunkiest tech devices were building a foundation for incredible electronic advancements decades later.

Likewise, district Superintendent Brad Meeks lets out a chuckle thinking about the then-and-now of technology. The boxy Commodore PET — a relic machine since 1982 — was the up-and-coming tool in Meeks’ days as a 1978 high school senior, right alongside the newly introduced graphing calculator.

Meeks now oversees a school district with 2,467 students in dozens of classrooms equipped with technological learning tools that didn’t even exist five years ago, let alone in the 1980s and ’70s.



Miles, meanwhile, is the captain that steers the district ship as it navigates through currents of the advancing electronic landscape. As the technology director for eight years, Miles has worked with arguably the biggest technological advancements in education, particularly in the past four years.

More than ever before, Steamboat students in kindergarten through 12th grades are studying with iPads in their hands, Chromebooks on their desks and Smart Boards on their classroom walls. These technological tools are not only changing the way students born into today’s digital age keep up with modern curriculum, but also how their teachers make learning fun, interesting and, most of all, interactive.

“I tell people, you go into the schools today, and they’re not like they were when we were growing up,” Meeks said. “I remember going through my teacher prep stuff, and you’d have to learn how to just run the film through the projector and all that stuff.”

STARTING SMALL, THEN KEEPING UP

Handing a first-grader an iPad and expecting the student to stay on track with the lesson plan doesn’t spark the chaos you’d imagine.



Walk into teacher Niki Struble’s first-grade class at Soda Creek Elementary School on a Friday, and there’s a buzz in the air.

The class looks just like any class from the past decade or so — well, almost. Books are stacked on shelves, personal belongings are stowed safely away in cubbies and the 20 students sit around six round tables.

But there’s a catch. These students aren’t drawing on construction paper with colored pens or pencils. They each have an assigned iPad in their hands with the “Explain Everything” application open on their screens, steadily working on a science research project.

Looming above the room is a flat-screen television programmed with an Apple TV device that allows the 20 iPads in the room to display the children’s work for everyone to see.

Soda Creek technology director Scott Furgueson leads the youngsters through the very basics of the app, such as saving a photo from the Internet onto the iPad’s hard drive, or how to take that photo and insert it into an interactive slideshow, one they can record their voices onto, and in about three months, sync those voices into a video slideshow.

The youngsters’ eyes light up when even the simplest tasks are achieved.



Using iPads with 6- or 7-year-olds isn’t uncommon at either Soda Creek or Strawberry Park elementary schools, nor is it a way to simply fill the students’ class day with games — far from it.

“It’s about using this to enhance what they’re already doing in the classroom,” Furgueson explains. “As we talk about it with the kids, it’s a tool, not a toy. We battle that all the time, because at home, it’s considered a toy to them.”

The first-graders start small, Struble says. Soda Creek’s designated iPad cart, which carries 25 devices room to room upon request, makes regular appearances in her room, but not in every room.

For a year now, teachers district-wide have been required to complete 15 hours of tech training, which often is facilitated by the district’s designated “Google, iPad or Smart mentors,” group leaders who themselves have voluntarily embarked on extra training, which qualifies them to train their colleagues.

“We introduced this last year,” Miles said. “Training can happen in staff development days or in those committee groups.”

The teacher resources are there, and more training sessions are being introduced each year. The Northwest Colorado Board of Cooperative Educational Services has offered iPad classes for teachers the past few summers — classes that teachers like Mrs. Struble frequent.

Teachers throughout the district have chosen to attend tech conferences on a volunteer basis after seeing more devices introduced to their students and realizing they need to be brought up to speed on the latest technology. Miles said he gets a lot of insight from the monthly tech conferences — the Technology Leadership Forum — held for school district tech directors from across Colorado.

“I go to those and listen to what other districts are dealing with,” Miles said. “Most of it is, ‘What are your challenges?’ You gain knowledge from schools who have done different things and carved the trail in some aspects.”

Even with added training for teachers, it’s the students who don’t need to look much farther than their peers next to them for the assistance they may need.



Not only are iPads and Chromebooks changing the way students learn, they are creating an entirely new dynamic in the teacher-student relationship.

“Once the teacher adopts (more technology), they’re not the smartest person in the room,” Miles said. “What they become is the classroom manager. When there is a tech issue with one of these devices, they have to accept that little Johnny is going to help Sarah because they can figure it out quickly. They’re very adaptive.”

FROM 30 iPADS TO 600

Four years ago, when Apple first released the iPad, the Steamboat Springs School District didn’t join those lining up days in advance, eager to get the devices into their classrooms.

“I hesitate to simply rely on a salesperson,” Curriculum Director Marty Lamansky said. “We talk to other districts with these things, look at other trends across the country. We don’t want to be the people to line up for a week to get the latest version just because it’s the latest version.”

But the district doesn’t ignore the latest tech trends, either. When the iPad was introduced in April 2010, Steamboat Springs Middle School teachers got the first trial run as a pilot initiative, Miles said.

Four years ago, the district introduced 30 iPads to the middle school. Today, there are almost 600 of the devices in use, and every district teacher has been given one of their own.

It was an add-on, Miles said, not a substitute for the desktop models that currently fill district computer labs. The technology director spent the first part of his eight years on the job refurbishing outdated computers and updating software to be more sustainable, so there was no way iPads suddenly were going to replace the desktops.

Struble is an example of how the devices can help teachers enhance student learning.

“I went to a couple of trainings three years ago and had an iPad from the school,” Struble said. “I came back and had to turn it in. I was like, ‘I really need that back if you want me to try this.’ That’s when I think it became really apparent to people in administration that we needed to have these tools in our hands to use them effectively and efficiently with our children.”

Funding for technology like iPads, Chromebooks and Smart Boards comes almost entirely from the Steamboat Springs Education Fund Board, which receives grant requests each year and ultimately decides how much each of Routt County’s three districts will receive.

With its grant money, Steamboat always purchases the iPads in packages of 10 and receives a small $20 discount per device, which reduces the cost to about $379 apiece. Nearly every model is an iPad 2, except the most recently purchased tablets, which are iPad 3s because Apple no longer produces the second-generation model. To protect the five-days-per-week constant use from students, Miles said the district invested in $70 robust cases with screen shields for each iPad.

Do they last? Absolutely, he says.

“They’ve been very reliable,” Miles says. “Extremely reliable. We’ve had a handful of those 600 every year that need to get replaced. We have some local contacts in town that can fix things like screens and stuff, but electronically they have never failed.”

CHROMEBOOKS HERE TO STAY

This time last year, there wasn’t a single Chromebook in the Steamboat Springs School District.

But as is the case with a lot of newly introduced devices in the district, an immediate need was there as the Colorado Department of Education began phasing in a digital-only online state testing system.

At the same time, the district was exploring the Google Apps for Education program, Miles rolled out 100 Chromebooks — small laptops manufactured by Google — at the high school.

Google Apps for Education is free for school districts and comes with applications such as Google Docs, which act as online Word documents, and Google Calendar, a program that often is used in schools’ checkout systems for teachers renting the iPad and Chromebooks.

With Google Apps, students can work on group projects purely online with one another from outside locations, where all work is saved to the Cloud. Students also have their own Gmail login, another way for their instructors to communicate instantly with them, whenever from wherever.

Other districts moved to Google Apps a long time ago, Miles said. But until last year, the need simply wasn’t there yet in Steamboat. A complete overhaul wasn’t feasible at the time.

“It’s changing education,” Miles says. “We purposely held off. Other districts had gone to it three or four years ago. It just wasn’t there for our needs. I see this time next year, 100 percent of our students, or close to it, will be into that product.”

The 100 Chromebooks, originally purchased for state testing use, went to a pilot group of teachers to introduce into their class curriculum.

“They were ecstatic,” Miles says.

As a result, Miles bought nearly 300 more of them.

In Meghan Hanson-Peters’ freshman world geography course at Steamboat Springs High School, Chromebooks are a mainstay.

After wrapping up a roundtable discussion regarding China’s one-child policy with the help of an interactive Smart Board, students are instructed to pair up and grab a Chromebook.

With the small laptop, the freshmen are asked to gather data from the Population Reference Bureau and plot their findings regarding such things as birth rates, infant mortality and life expectancy from various countries. In doing so, they plot the data on a printed-out spreadsheet, joining the new and old styles of classroom learning.

Hanson-Peters said she’s careful to know exactly when to hand out things like iPads and Chromebooks to 13- and 14-year-olds and when to get their eyes off a screen and shift the room into a class discussion.

“I’ve learned the hard way a few times where I made the mistake of handing students things like iPads as they walk into class,” Hanson-Peters said. “Then I’m screwed because my first 10 minutes they’re multitasking, and I’ve already lost them.”

Like Soda Creek’s Struble, Hanson-Peters has bought into the district’s technology shift. She was one of a small group of teachers who took part in Google training the district held in March. She also has taken part in iPad training before the start of school.

Like so many district teachers, who range in age from their late 20s to well past retirement age, Hanson-Peters recognizes the struggle of constantly evolving technology seeping into prep school curriculum, where the digital age is alive and well.

You can’t ignore the influx of the tech-heavy classrooms, she says, nor can you replace the old way of doing things.

“I don’t want to use technology as a substitute,” Hanson-Peters says. “I want to use it to extend or enhance. I’m always wrestling with that.”

ONE-TO-ONE COULD BE ON THE HORIZON

It’s hard to pinpoint where the district might be in the future as it continues to roll out more devices and explore options that fit well with schools of its size.

Above all else, district officials say, they’re being meticulous in their decision-making process.

In April, the Los Angeles Unified School District suspended a proposal for the largest technology rollout of its kind — a one-to-one iPad ratio for each student in the enormous district.



Among other reasons, the Los Angeles rollout, a $1 billion initiative, hit a snag at the beginning of last school year when handfuls of students bypassed security protocols to get into their social networking profiles and other blocked websites, the Los Angeles Times reported.

“We try to be a lot more thoughtful and cautious,” district Curriculum Director Marty Lamansky says.

Although Steamboat is much smaller than the Los Angeles Unified School District, the local administrators keep a close eye on what other districts are doing nationwide and statewide.

Manitou Springs School District near Colorado Springs is one of the first school districts in Colorado to adopt the one-to-one system with iPads, Miles said.

“I went down and visited them and talked to some students,” Miles said. “At the very beginning they said it was very distractive. They had something they could do school work on and/or screw around on. They had to make a decision.”

Students fell noticeably behind in their work during the first few weeks of the rollout, Miles said, and as their grades began to slip, an overwhelming conscious decision was made to use their iPads to stay on track rather than cave to the lure of games and the Internet. “The first few weeks they got really behind in their schoolwork. They then had to make a choice and discipline themselves.”

And even though every student in the Manitou Springs School District — which is slightly smaller than Steamboat — now has their very own iPad, only about 10 percent were broken or stolen, Miles said.

“It turned out most of them had the same products of their own at home anyway,” he said.

Miles said the next few months will be telling as to whether or not the Steamboat Springs School District will begin phasing in something similar to what Manitou Springs implemented. There’s also the option of BYOD (bring your own device), which has its own set of benefits and drawbacks.

Though legalities can complicate BYOD — who is responsible for the device should something happen, the owner or district? — Miles is confident the one-to-one, BYOD or both could work locally.

“I think a BYOD would work great here because we have an affluent community,” Miles said. “I’ve had calls this year that I’ve never had before. ‘I’m looking to buy my kid something, what should I buy?’ I’ve never had that call in eight years.”

No matter the affluence of families in the region, students growing up in today’s digital age are the most comfortable engineers of things like iPads and Chromebooks.

Their teachers? Well, not as much, but they’re learning. And the more technology the Steamboat Springs School District continues to introduce into its classrooms en route to a possible one-to-one implementation, the more the teachers must adapt.

“It actually wasn’t mandatory for teachers to adopt” one-to-one, Miles said about districts that implemented it. “Every student would have a device, so then it was managed more so by the peer pressure. ‘This teacher over here is doing something and I’m not, so I better catch up or I’m gone.’” ●
