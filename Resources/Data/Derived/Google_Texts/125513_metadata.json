As I have written before, Roberts has repeatedly decried perceptions that polarization in the political branches will \u201cspill over\u201d and undermine the court\u2019s stature. As recently as February 4, he has insisted, \u201cWe don\u2019t work as Republicans or Democrats,\u201d and that \u201cpeople don\u2019t have a really good understanding of what the Court does.\u201d But now Republicans have drawn his Court into the middle of the biggest political fight of the decade.\n\nRoberts has criticized Senate obstructionism before. In his 2010 annual report on the judiciary, he wrote, \u201cEach political party has found it easy to turn on a dime from decrying to defending the blocking of judicial nominations, depending on their changing political fortunes. This has created acute difficulties for some judicial districts.\u201d If Roberts is serious about such laments, there is much he can do to mitigate this crisis.\n\nWhat should his strategy be? To simply do his job. Or rather, his two jobs: like his colleagues, to be a conscientious jurist by respecting precedent, anchoring decisions in the text and history of the Constitution and laws, and consistently applying principles and reasoning he himself has endorsed; and, as chief justice, summon the judicial statecraft and discipline necessary to protect the federal judiciary\u2019s role in the constitutional scheme and the values that drove the framers to design that role.\n\nPundits are predicting an unbroken skein of 4-4 partisan stand-offs in the numerous politically charged cases on the Court\u2019s 2015-16 docket. But if Roberts stays true to his own precedents and principles\u2014even if doing so yields a few rulings that will spark Republican outrage\u2014the Court will defy those cynical forecasts. That scenario will be the most persuasive, if temporary and not by itself conclusive, antidote to perceptions that political polarization has crossed First Street N.E., from the Capitol Building to the Court.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Senate Republicans plan to paralyze the nomination process.
