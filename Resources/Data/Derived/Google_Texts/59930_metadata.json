Richards\u2019 article, \u201cProtecting and Expanding Access to Birth Control\u201d is dated March 3, 2016 and listed under the heading \u201cPerspective.\u201d\n\nRichards does not mention abortion in the article, though her group does more abortions than any other business in the U.S. However, she repeatedly emphasizes women\u2019s access to \u201call forms of birth control,\u201d some of which may cause abortions.\n\nTouting the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, Richards writes: \u201cNow, political attacks against women\u2019s health care are threatening access to critical services that allow women to choose and readily obtain the birth control methods that are best for them. It is essential that we protect and continue to expand access to all forms of birth control.\u201d\n\nThough not mentioned in the article, Planned Parenthood launched a vicious fight against the Hobby Lobby craft chain after its owners objected to the Obamacare HHS Mandate forcing them to cover abortion-causing drugs in their employee health insurance plans. Fortunately, Hobby Lobby won protections against the mandate in a U.S. Supreme Court case. Richards and her abortion business also have been vocally attacking a group of nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, who also are being forced to pay for birth control and abortion-causing drugs through Obamacare. Their case is scheduled to be heard in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on March 23.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nRichards claims that the birth control Planned Parenthood offers is responsible for reduced teen pregnancy rates, among other things. However, the Rev. James Harden, chief operations officer and founder of the Commission for Reproductive Health Service Standards and president/CEO of CompassCare Pregnancy Services, said the evidence does not support Richards\u2019 claim.\n\nHarden told LifeNews that Richards failed to present any meaningful evidence in her case for broader contraception access. He pointed out that statistics from New York state, \u201cAmerica\u2019s abortion capital,\u201d are evidence against Richards\u2019 claims. Harden said New York saw an 18-percent reduction in the number of abortions from 2008 to 2013, though the state did not see abortion clinics close or pro-life legislation enacted.\n\n\u201cTranslation: Women are still getting pregnant but simply not choosing abortion,\u201d Harden said. \u201cIt is hard to imagine a more reckless usury of women for political power. But, we have come to expect this from the prevailing political establishment. However, we should expect more from [the New England Journal of Medicine].\u201d\n\nRichards\u2019 article continues with criticisms against pro-lifers for trying to defund Planned Parenthood:\n\nUnfortunately, politicized attacks against women\u2019s health care are threatening to undermine the progress achieved to date. We have seen an unprecedented number of federal and state attacks on women\u2019s health in the past year, including nine congressional votes to cease reimbursing Planned Parenthood for care provided to patients who depend on public health programs. Politicians with extreme views on reproductive health are trying to cut public funding for family-planning services through programs such as Medicaid and Title X, which have been critical in reducing costs and expanding access for low-income women to the birth-control method of their choice. In fact, women who visit a health care provider that receives state Medicaid family-planning funding have access to a wide range of methods and are almost twice as likely to choose highly effective forms of birth control as women who visit similar providers that do not receive such funds.5 When these funds are threatened, women\u2019s access to the full range of birth-control methods is restricted, and their risk of unintended pregnancy is elevated.\n\nRichards even mentions a bogus Texas study that claimed to show that a Texas law de-funding Planned Parenthood hurt women and led to more welfare babies being born. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nProfessor Michael New explained in an article at LifeNews how the study was deeply flawed. Texas state Sen. Jane Nelson also pointed out that the study was biased because it was funded by a Planned Parenthood supporter, the Susan T. Buffett Foundation. She said the study was flawed because it did not look at women who received contraception through other programs.\n\nRichards\u2019 conclusion makes it clear that her piece is nothing more than a free advertisement for Planned Parenthood to praise itself and attack pro-lifers who are trying to end its heinous abortion practices.\n\nRichards writes: \u201cTexas stands as a cautionary tale for politicians in other states who are targeting health care at Planned Parenthood. Many have claimed repeatedly that Planned Parenthood patients can simply go to other health care providers \u2014 but tragically, that is not the case. Instead, women are left out in the cold.\u201d\n\nIt is interesting that the journal would give Richards\u2019 space, not only because her background is in politics, not science or medicine, but also because Planned Parenthood is embroiled in scandal and under investigation in several states and the U.S. Congress for selling aborted babies\u2019 body parts.\n\n\u201cNew England Journal Medicine has apparently lost its soul,\u201d Harden said. \u201cA scientific journal ought to constitute thoroughgoing analysis by way of research, analysis, and peer review. In this case the context is medicine, the purpose of which is to heal and maintain the health of an individual. The publication of Cecil Richards\u2019 slanted Planned Parenthood love prose violates the purpose of a journal while insultingly ignoring the purpose of medicine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New England Journal of \u201cMedicine\u201d Just Published an Article From Non-Doctor Cecile Richards", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "She isn't a doctor, and her background is in politics, not medicine.
