Today, with the job market recovering at a slower pace than expected, resum\u00e9 fraud is only getting worse. Thirty-three percent of hiring managers said that more job applicants are lying about their credentials now than before the recession.\n\nSome of the most common lies are related to embellished skill sets, embellished job responsibilities, wrong dates of employment, or outright false claims of academic achievement.\n\nMeanwhile, some industries report a higher rate of lies on resum\u00e9s than others \u2013 including financial services, leisure and hospitality, and information technology.\n\nMore than half of hiring managers, or 51 percent, said they would automatically dismiss a candidate if they caught the person lying on a resum\u00e9, while 7 percent said they\u2019d be willing to overlook the lie if they liked the candidate enough.\n\nRelated: 10 Cities with Booming Job Growth\n\nIncreasingly \u2013 and thanks to the Internet \u2013 companies are also catching lies after people have been vetted and hired.

He told The New York Post, \u201cNothing I say can justify what happened. I am deeply sorry for what happened, because people were hurt. My players, Manhattan College, my staff, South Florida, fans, alumni, so many people were hurt by an irresponsible decision I made at 22 years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to enhance your resum\u00e9, it\u2019s better to focus on playing up tangible examples from your actual experience,\u201d Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder, said in a press release. \u201cYour resum\u00e9 doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the perfect fit for an organization, but it needs to be relevant and accurate.\u201d\n\nHarris Poll surveyed more than 2,000 hiring managers and human resource professionals online for CareerBuilder between May 13 and June 6.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Have you ever claimed on your resum\u00e9\u00a0to be the assistant to the prime min", "title": "Lie on a Resum\u00e9 and You May Lose More Than a Job", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/07/Lie-Resume-and-You-May-Lose-More-Job", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10222013_Waiting_Phone_Interview.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/07/Lie-Resume-and-You-May-Lose-More-Job", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10222013_Waiting_Phone_Interview.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Have you ever claimed on your resum\u00e9\u00a0to be the assistant to the prime min", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1fe\"", "article_summary": "More than half the employers surveyed, or 58 percent, said they\u2019ve caught a lie on a job applicant\u2019s resum\u00e9.\nThirty-three percent of hiring managers said that more job applicants are lying about their credentials now than before the recession.\nToday, with the job market recovering at a slower pace than expected, resum\u00e9 fraud is only getting worse.\nRelated: How to Find a Job Without Looking for a JobThese two examples are among the most memorable resum\u00e9 lies ever caught by employers, according to a CareerBuilder\u2019s survey released first thing Thursday.\nOr maybe you included some amazing job experience on your resum\u00e9 that was actually your dad\u2019s \u2013 thinking it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal since you both have the same name."}
