It will take at least 10 years for the resulting increase in production to filter through to gross domestic product.\n\nOrders for autos increased 10.2 percent, a sign of firming manufacturing activity, after declining 1.3 percent in June. Excluding the volatile transportation category, durable goods orders fell 0.8 percent after rising 3.0 percent in June.\n\nNon-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.5 percent last month. The decline, however, followed an upwardly revised 5.4 percent advance in June. So-called core capital goods orders remained consistent with expectations of a steady economic growth clip in the third quarter.\n\nCore capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 3.3 percent in June.\n\nCore capital goods shipments increased 1.5 percent in July. Shipments of core capital goods are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement.\n\n--By Reuters", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods surged in July to a record high thanks to a jump in aircraft purchases, government data showed on Tuesday.", "news_keywords": "US economy, durable goods, orders, business, spending, manufacturing", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods surged in July to a record high thanks to a jump in aircraft purchases, government data showed on Tuesday.", "title": "US durables rocket to record high in July", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/26/us-durable-goods-orders-rose-226-in-july-vs-75-estimate.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/26/101947313-170554439.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods surged in July to a record high thanks to a jump in aircraft purchases, government data showed on Tuesday.", "title": "Fly durables fly!
