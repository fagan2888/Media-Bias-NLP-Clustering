Powerful business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers might say they ardently support the Export-Import Bank, but other Republican positions on low taxation and light regulation will keep them from exacting a price on Republican lawmakers for the bank\u2019s death. That is one reason Republican presidential hopefuls like Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, who once supported the bank, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin have recently joined Senators Cruz, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida in embracing its demise.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a top priority for the chamber, and we\u2019ve made that very clear,\u201d said Blair L. Holmes, a spokeswoman for the group. \u201cBut we are not a single-issue organization. Our \u2018How They Voted\u2019 scorecard is based on a cross section of congressional votes on issues important to the business community.\u201d\n\nStill, the chamber, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Aerospace Industries Association and 46 other business associations assembled the Exporters for Ex-Im Coalition. The coalition flew in more than 650 small-business leaders, suppliers and local chambers of commerce members for 400 meetings with representatives, senators, staff members and committee aides on Capitol Hill on Feb. 25.\n\nOn Jan. 28, Representative Stephen Fincher of Tennessee introduced legislation to reauthorize the bank for five years, gathering 57 Republican co-sponsors. Heritage Action responded last month with automated telephone calls in the districts of 31 of those Republicans, blasting them for supporting \u201ca slush fund for corporate welfare.\u201d\n\nBusiness groups and the bank\u2019s biggest beneficiaries, like Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar, have hired lobbyists and consultants. Conservative groups like the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity are rallying the Tea Party grass roots.\n\nStarting this month, Americans for Prosperity has committed to spending \u201cwell into the six-figure range\u201d to kill the bank, said Levi Russell, a spokesman for the group. That will go for television and digital advertising, phone banks, direct mail and activist visits to lawmakers\u2019 Capitol Hill and district offices. The targets are 93 House Republicans who they see as willing to block action on the bank\u2019s reauthorization, enough to commit a majority of the Republican majority to the bank\u2019s demise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBefore, there were two kinds of people: people who didn\u2019t know it exists and people who love it because they use it,\u201d Mr. Russell said of the bank. \u201cThis year, the education component is done. We\u2019re now in position to ramp up the grass roots side.\u201d\n\nSo will Club for Growth, a well-financed conservative political action committee, which vowed on Wednesday to back any members of Congress who opposed the Ex-Im Bank if they were attacked by any establishment groups.\n\nOn the day of the pro-bank \u201cfly-in,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bank, wrote a letter to all Republican members proclaiming his opposition to its reauthorization and, in effect, telling them not to listen to the business leaders at their doors. Less than 1 percent of 1 percent of small businesses benefit from Export-Import Bank, he wrote, while American taxpayers\u2019 money goes \u201cto help foreign corporations, including businesses that are owned by the governments of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way to level the playing field for American exporters and manufacturers is not with taxpayer subsidies, guarantees and politically driven lending, but instead with more opportunity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA pro-growth agenda \u2014 including fundamental tax reform, American energy independence, cutting burdensome red tape and reducing abusive lawsuits \u2014 will do more to help our exporters, manufacturers and small businesses than the Export-Import Bank ever could.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe business leaders who use the bank say they are baffled at such vehemence. The bank operates on fees it charges its users and, so far, has made money for the government. More important, it has created jobs \u2014 many of them. The bank contends that through its export financing, it has helped maintain 1.2 million private sector jobs since 2009.\n\nAcrow Corporation of America makes the modular, prefabricated bridges that helped win World War II and now proliferate in developing nations. But customers in countries like Cameroon and Zambia cannot readily get private bank loans for large infrastructure projects without backup. European and Chinese competitors have their own government-backed export credit agencies. Acrow, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., has the Export-Import Bank, said Paul Sullivan, the company\u2019s director of international business development.\n\n\u201cWe are already hearing from customers that our competitors are in their offices saying, \u2018You cannot rely on an Acrow bridge deal because their financing mechanism is not likely to stay alive,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sullivan said. He suggested that the death of the bank would cost 200 jobs, many at Acrow\u2019s manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania. \u201cFor us to pull another arrow out of our quiver, it\u2019s irrational, it\u2019s terrifying and it\u2019s inappropriate when one considers the reality of the global marketplace today.\u201d\n\nMr. Barsalou of BCH Trading uses the Export-Import Bank differently. To finance lumber exports, his company needs upfront cash that customers in Greece and Egypt will not provide, nor will his Wells Fargo Bank, without the Export-Import Bank\u2019s guarantee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey say banks should do that,\u201d he said, referring to opponents of the Export-Import Bank. \u201cWell, banks don\u2019t do that, and that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nTo the bank\u2019s opponents, such opinions are almost beside the point. Supporters might trot out small-business owners like Mr. Barsalou, but the bank\u2019s big efforts are on behalf of big companies. It is, after all, derisively called the Bank of Boeing.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt Boeing, G.E. and Caterpillar will continue to thrive as great American companies if Ex-Im goes away,\u201d Mr. Needham, of Heritage Action for America, said.\n\nMr. Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has taken to posting the \u201cEgregious Ex-Im Bank Deal of the Day,\u201d like one aiding mining projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which he said one human rights group had labeled the \u201crape capital of the world.\u201d\n\nMr. Russell, of Americans for Prosperity, said, \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re the beneficiary of something that\u2019s helping your business, you personally, it\u2019s hard to look at something objectively.\u201d", "article_metadata":
