Now it\u2019s turning to Big Tech. On Tuesday the right-wing news site is launching Breitbart Tech, a new section of its website focused on technology.\n\nThe man in charge of the effort is Milo Yiannopoulos, a British journalist and provocateur who co-founded the Kernel tech site before moving to Breitbart. The site has hired six full-time staffers dedicated to subjects such as e-sports and free speech on the Internet. Expect not to see much coverage on, say, the economics of venture capital, but a lot on the simmering culture wars that happen in the far corners of Reddit. There will also be plenty of Yiannopoulos himself. His writing generally casts him as the protagonist, and his articles tend to start off with phrases like, \u201cI\u2019m a slut, and I have been shamed,\u201d or \u201cI am always right.\u201d A Fusion profile referred to him as the \u201cultimate troll.\u201d\n\nTo judge by Yiannopoulos\u2019s writing for Breitbart so far, the biggest issue in tech isn\u2019t government spying or overvalued startups. It\u2019s women. Most of Yiannopoulos\u2019s tech reporting for Breitbart has focused on Gamergate, the yearlong controversy over gender in gaming. The mainstream media has mostly covered the movement as a semi-organized campaign of harassment against prominent women in video games (Bloomberg Businessweek ran a cover story on the controversy last November). On Monday, organizers of the South by Southwest conference canceled two panels on gender in gaming, citing unspecified threats of violence.\n\nYiannopoulos rejects the view that women in gaming are under siege. He claims that harassment comes from trolls looking to ruin any online conversation, and dismisses any threats of real-life violence as noncredible. To him, Gamergate devolved into an example of how the politically correct mores of mainstream American society infringe upon free speech. \u201cGamergate is the culmination of every other fight you\u2019ve ever heard of on the Internet,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cEvery big controversy on the Internet is about libertarians vs. authoritarians.\u201d\n\nHe mostly sees technology companies as hamstrung by their own progressive ideologies. Feminists are attacking tech and gaming companies because the awkward men who run them are easy targets, Yiannopoulos said. He stresses that he loves women but maintains they are underrepresented in tech because of basic differences between the sexes.\n\nHis views on another hot-button issue\u2014immigration\u2014are much closer to the standard Silicon Valley line, albeit in more bombastic language. He proposes unlimited immigration for high-skilled tech workers: \u201cInstead of hollowing out the middle class by importing millions of cheap, unskilled workers, America should focus on the top talent of foreign countries,\u201d he wrote on Breitbart earlier this month. \u201cTough luck for China and Russia if they can\u2019t offer an American level of quality of life for geniuses.\u201d\n\nYiannopoulos is against net neutrality, offers a general unease with government spying, and says the basic underlying theme of the site\u2019s coverage is supporting the right of people to say whatever they want. \u201cWe\u2019re totally going to get into this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBreitbart is going to be free-speech central.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joshua Brustein", "description": "The right-wing site is launching a tech section to\u00a0combat progressive opinions about technology and Internet culture.", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXbV3pdNfwBk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The right-wing site is launching a tech section to\u00a0combat progressive opinions about technology and Internet culture.", "title": "Breitbart News Is Preparing to Troll Tech", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-27/breitbart-news-is-preparing-to-troll-tech", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXbV3pdNfwBk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The right-wing site is launching a tech section to\u00a0combat progressive opinions about technology and Internet culture.", "title": "Breitbart News Is Preparing to Troll Tech", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-27/breitbart-news-is-preparing-to-troll-tech", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXbV3pdNfwBk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "fb": {"status": "The right-wing site is launching a tech section to\u00a0combat progressive opinions about technology and Internet culture."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-title": "Breitbart News Is Preparing to Troll Tech", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NWWAOG6JTSE901", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "parsely-author": "Joshua Brustein", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "date": "2015-10-27T20:09:52.385Z", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-27T20:09:52.385Z", "parsely-tags": "Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-27/breitbart-news-is-preparing-to-troll-tech"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb73e\"", "article_summary": "On Tuesday the right-wing news site is launching Breitbart Tech, a new section of its website focused on technology.\nMost of Yiannopoulos\u2019s tech reporting for Breitbart has focused on Gamergate, the yearlong controversy over gender in gaming.\nThe man in charge of the effort is Milo Yiannopoulos, a British journalist and provocateur who co-founded the Kernel tech site before moving to Breitbart.\nFeminists are attacking tech and gaming companies because the awkward men who run them are easy targets, Yiannopoulos said.\nHe stresses that he loves women but maintains they are underrepresented in tech because of basic differences between the sexes."}
