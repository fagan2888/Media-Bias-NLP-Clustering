Police released photos of a man accused of stealing a purse from a classroom on the Oklahoma City Community College (OCCC) campus.

According to police, the incident happened at about 9 a.m. on Saturday, February 13. Officers later tracked the suspect on video surveillance to a vehicle in the parking lot, where he got into a black Ford F-150 extended cab with chrome running boards. The suspect then left the campus.

Later in the day, an unknown female returned the victimâ€™s purse to the school and said she had found the purse.

The victim said she immediately canceled her credit and debit cards. But she later learned that someone had attempted to use her debit card at two separate locations. The first location was a convenience store at 5920 S. Western, and the second attempt was a few minutes later at a convenience store at 1301 S.W. 44th Street.
