The city switched to an appointment-only system because of long lines that had swamped enrollment centers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could find a better case of apples and oranges,\u201d de Blasio said of a comparison of the faulty Obamacare website.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very important initiative that will ultimately, I think, reach tens of thousands, and over time probably hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. But the demand we saw on the first day was in the thousands. It wasn\u2019t like healthcare.gov where you had to deal with millions and milion of people.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio said the appointment system at nyc.gov/idnyc would be fixed.\n\n\u201cWe're going to fix the website situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a high demand dynamic. That's a good thing. But we're going to fix that situation. That's going to be back up and running soon.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the site was still not allowing visitors to schedule appointments.\n\nIn the meantime, people interested in getting a card can show up in person at an enrollment center to make an appointment for a later time to apply, de Blasio said.\n\nThe municipal IDs, which launched Monday, are intended to help undocumented immigrants, the homeless, and others who have trouble getting government identification. They're available to all New Yorkers.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2074965.1448076202!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/card.jpg", "description": "The rollout of the city\u2019s municipal ID program won\u2019t turn into a debacle like Obamacare enrollment, Mayor de Blasio promised Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The rollout of the city\u2019s municipal ID program won\u2019t turn into a debacle like Obamacare enrollment, Mayor de Blasio promised Wednesday.", "title": "De Blasio: Municipal ID enrollment won't flop like Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/de-blasio-municipal-id-enrollment-won-flop-obamacare-blog-entry-1.2077749", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2074965.1448076202!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/card.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rollout of the city\u2019s municipal ID program won\u2019t turn into a debacle like Obamacare enrollment, Mayor de Blasio promised Wednesday.", "title": "De Blasio: Municipal ID enrollment won't flop like Obamacare", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/de-blasio-municipal-id-enrollment-won-flop-obamacare-blog-entry-1.2077749", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2074965.1448076202!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/card.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-14T15:31:38-0500", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.title": "De Blasio: Municipal ID enrollment won't flop like Obamacare", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "nydn_section": "dailypolitics", "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The rollout of the city\u2019s municipal ID program won\u2019t turn into a debacle like Obamacare enrollment, Mayor de Blasio promised Wednesday.", "viewport": "width=1070, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The rollout of the city\u2019s municipal ID program won\u2019t turn into a debacle like Obamacare enrollment, Mayor de Blasio promised Wednesday.\nAnthony Delmundo/New York Daily News Mayor de Blasio holds up his new Municipal ID card on Monday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could find a better case of apples and oranges,\u201d de Blasio said of a comparison of the faulty Obamacare website.\nDe Blasio insisted the city could cope with demand for the cards after the website set up to let New Yorkers make appointments to get an ID crashed Wednesday.\nThe municipal IDs, which launched Monday, are intended to help undocumented immigrants, the homeless, and others who have trouble getting government identification."}
