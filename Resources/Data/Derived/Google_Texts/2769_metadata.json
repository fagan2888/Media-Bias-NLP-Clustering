This issue\u2019s Q&A profilesLisa Carlson,executive director of planning and regulation for Sanford Health Plan.\n\nQ:How did you become interested in your field?\n\nA: \u201cAfter undergrad, I worked at Central Plains Clinic here in Sioux Falls and was at a crossroads of whether I wanted to work in the clinical field or take some other business track. While working in the occupational medicine department, I learned about the working relationships with patients, nurse case managers, insurance companies and employers to support the effective management of each patient case. I enjoyed this and felt it was a good mix of both patient care and business development. So I quickly enrolled at the University of Kansas for its master\u2019s program knowing I wanted work somewhere on the business side of health services to support patient care.\u201d\n\nQ:What do you enjoy most about your work?\n\nA: \u201cEach day is different, and there hasn\u2019t been a dull moment since the Affordable Care Act was passed. Constant changes in laws and the rules we have to follow are disruptive, but it also creates opportunities to look for a better way of doing things, especially when it comes to building access to health care to those most in need.\u201d\n\nQ:Do you have a charity or organization that\u2019s especially close to your heart?\n\nA: \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been educating my kids on the value of the Children\u2019s Home Society and the Children\u2019s Inn and how important those organizations are to create safe environments for kids to develop and grow.\u201d\n\nQ:What has been your most rewarding experience in the past year?\n\nA: \u201cPersonally, my son and the hockey team his father coaches won their way to the Squirt Internal Championship game in Fargo. I was very proud of all the boys on the team making it that far against the odds. For my career, it\u2019s been seeing the growth in the health plan and knowing I helped contribute to that growth by pursuing a couple large government contracts. Winning these contracts resulted in us providing health insurance to tens of thousands of people, some of which have never had insurance before in North Dakota, due to the Medicaid expansion that has occurred there.\u201d\n\nQ:What do you think are the best and worst things about living in Sioux Falls?\n\nA: \u201cSince the Denny Sanford Premier Center opened up, there\u2019s certainly more entertainment to go to, which I\u2019ve enjoyed. Sioux Falls is a wonderful community with great schools and career opportunities. I\u2019d say the only downfall is that bitter cold we have to endure a couple months out of the year, but I look forward to the changes in season.\u201d\n\nTHE CARLSON FILE\n\n\u2022Name: Lisa Carlson\n\n\u2022Title: Executive director, planning and regulation, Sanford Health Plan\n\n\u2022Hometown: Born in Minneapolis but moved to the Brandon area in 1980\n\n\u2022Age: 39\n\n\u2022Background: Graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree from Creighton University and a master\u2019s degree in health services administration at the University of Kansas; worked in occupational medicine and academic research before joining the Sanford Health Plan 15 years ago\n\n\u2022Family: Husband, Matt; and two boys, Zach and Alex\n\n\u2022Interests and hobbies: \u201cI enjoy riding bike, taking walks, taking care of my potted flowers and any outdoor activities since I\u2019m in the office all day.
