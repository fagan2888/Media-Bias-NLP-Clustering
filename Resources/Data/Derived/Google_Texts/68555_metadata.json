It saved more than $3.5 billion in 2013, before it was suspended. The report estimated that it would save an estimated $24 billion over the next five years.\n\n\u201cMedicare is plagued with the highest reported amount of improper payments of any federal program,\u2019 the report said. The government doled out about $46 billion in improper payments last year alone.\n\nRelated: Government Blatantly Wastes $30 Billion This Year\n\nThe group also recommends getting rid of the Rural Utilities Service, which provides broadband Internet access to small communities across the country. That would save about $9.5 billion the first year alone.\n\nIt also takes aim at several federal agencies\u2014including the Denali Commission\u2014established in 1998 to provide grants to build infrastructure in Alaska. The group says completely eliminating the commission could save $10 million this year alone. Similarly, it recommends eliminating the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, which it says would save about $335 million over the first year.\n\nOf course, many of the group\u2019s recommendations face fierce opposition\u2014especially by those benefitting from the programs and projects it\u2019s pushing to eliminate. Still, it says its report can act as a road map for lawmakers looking for places to slash spending.\n\n\u201cThe November 2014 elections gave the Republican Party control of the Senate and a larger majority in the House,\u201d the report said. \"Hanging over Capitol Hill during this shift in power is the nation's record $18.2 trillion national debt, which is a constant reminder of profligate spending in Washington. By following the blueprint provided by CAGW's Prime Cuts 2015, wasteful government spending can be cut and the nation can start on a path toward fiscal sanity.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While Congressional Republicans push for cuts to entitlements like Medicare and Medica", "title": "600 Ways to Cut Government Spending and Save $640B", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/06/600-Ways-Cut-Government-Spending-and-Save-640B", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112012_Congress_Spending_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/06/600-Ways-Cut-Government-Spending-and-Save-640B", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112012_Congress_Spending_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While Congressional Republicans push for cuts to entitlements like Medicare and Medica", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: 5 Most Egregious Examples of Government Waste This YearThis year\u2019s full report targets most of the government\u2019s largest programs\u2014including the billions of improper Medicare payments made each year.\nThe government doled out about $46 billion in improper payments last year alone.\n\u201cMedicare is plagued with the highest reported amount of improper payments of any federal program,\u2019 the report said.\nWhile Congressional Republicans push for cuts to entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid to reduce government spending and balance the budget over the next decade, a nonprofit organization is offering lawmakers its own proposal to cut spending and reduce the deficit.\nThe report estimated that it would save an estimated $24 billion over the next five years."}
