There are two searches going on at Colorado State — for an athletic director to replace Jack Graham and a football coach to succeed Jim McElwain — and the school is using the same search firm, DHR International, as consultant for both.

Interim AD John Morris said at the Thursday news conference following McElwain’s departure that there would be no search committee for the coaching opening. “President Tony Frank will be leading the search for for our head football coach and I will be intimately involved in that with him,” Morris said.

Morris said of using a search firm: “We’re still finalizing details on that.”

Frank, who had a whirlwind Friday in securing the approval of the CSU Board of Governors to move forward with the on-campus stadium project, confirmed that CSU decided to use DHR in the coach search as well.

Frank appointed a 21-member search committee in August for the AD job, with Loren Crabtree, a retired longtime CSU administrator who also was chancellor of the University of Tennessee, as chair. But the AD hiring was put off until a decision on whether to proceed with the on-campus stadium project was made, so presumably that search now will move forward too.

CSU is working with DHR’s Glenn Sugiyama and Pat Richter.

Sugiyama works out of DHP’s Chicago office.

Richter, based in the firm’s Lansing, Mich., office, was a two-time All-America end at Wisconsin and played nine seasons in the NFL with the Washington Redskins. After his retirement from football, he was an attorney in a Madison law firm and then an executive at Oscar Mayer before serving as Wisconsin’s athletic director from 1989-2004.
