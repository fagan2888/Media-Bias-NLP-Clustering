A key issue is whether policies were clear that Allstate would reimburse the providers under a fee schedule from the Medicare program, which includes limits on payments for services.\n\nThe providers argued that the policies were \"ambiguous\" on the issue, and a majority of a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of Appeal agreed.\n\nThe PIP system requires motorists to carry minimum levels of coverage to help pay medical bills after accidents.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not set a date for oral arguments.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take up an appeal by Allstate Insurance Co. in a dispute about fees paid to health providers who treat", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/justices-agree-take-pip-fee-dispute", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201308/stock_gavel_and_stethoscope_legal_lawsuits.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take up an appeal by Allstate Insurance Co. in a dispute about fees paid to health providers who treat", "title": "Justices Agree To Take Up 'PIP' Fee Dispute"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 171, "dc": {"title": "Justices Agree To Take Up &#039;PIP&#039; Fee Dispute"}, "nid": 13328, "datePublished": "2016-01-21", "story_id": 463806540, "keywords": "personal-injury protection, PIP, Allstate Insurance, Florida Supreme Court, 4th District Court of Appeal", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The ruling, which involved 32 consolidated cases, involves the state's personal-injury protection, or PIP, insurance system.\nThe PIP system requires motorists to carry minimum levels of coverage to help pay medical bills after accidents.\nThe Supreme Court has not set a date for oral arguments.\nJustices issued an order saying they will hear the case, which comes after the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled in August in favor of medical providers.\nThe Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take up an appeal by Allstate Insurance Co. in a dispute about fees paid to health providers who treat patients injured in auto accidents."}
