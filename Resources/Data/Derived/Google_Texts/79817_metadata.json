And why don't we have those resources readily available to us?\"\n\nWilson was referring to pieces of rusty scrap metal and bullet-proof glass -- \"hillbilly armor\" -- soldiers had to scrounge through the local dumps to mount on their vehicles for protection against roadside bombs and other dangers in Iraq.\n\nRumsfeld's callous, arrogant answer to this and to a related question was, \"You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.\"\n\nIn a piece on this issue -- after lamenting the wrongfulness of addressing troops who are about to go into combat, some of who would sacrifice life and limb, in such a manner -- I said, \"If you are going to embroil the nation in an elective war, a 'war of choice' -- which the Iraq war certainly was -- why not first make sure that you have the army you need, fully trained, fully supported, and fully protected, before you go to war.\"\n\nMr. McConnell: Had your party done its job during the past six years, instead of doing nothing at best and obstructing and obfuscating at worst, we would have a Congress the president could work with, we would have the functioning government the American people wish and deserve, we would have a much better America now, not later.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to The Huffington Post, incoming Senate Majority Le...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-11-14 21:02:37 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "According to The Huffington Post, incoming Senate Majority Le...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dorian-de-wind/mcconnell-to-obama-you-ha_b_6155858.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2257414/images/o-MITCH-MCCONNELL-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2257414/images/o-MITCH-MCCONNELL-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to The Huffington Post, incoming Senate Majority Le..."}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-13 21:02:37 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6155858", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "gop obstructionism,Sen.
