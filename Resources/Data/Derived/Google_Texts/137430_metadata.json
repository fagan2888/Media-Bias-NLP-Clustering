AbbVie has said a deal would allow it to drop its effective tax rate to about 13 percent by 2016, from about 22 percent now.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Company Yet to Ditch the U.S. for Tax Reasons\n\nAlthough the federal corporate tax rate is touted as the world\u2019s highest at 35 percent, data from the Government Accountability Office show that corporations paid an average effective tax rate of roughly 17 percent last year. That doesn\u2019t include state or local taxes, which few overseas corporations pay. And that\u2019s done little to keep companies from looking for more attractive tax rates overseas.\n\n\u201cCorporations don\u2019t want to pay the taxes and (inversion) is a way they are getting out of it,\u201d Kenneth Thomas, a professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis\u2019 Center for International Studies, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss of revenue to the government that\u2019s going to have to be made up through cutting programs, taxing other people or taking on more debt. It\u2019s got to be one of the three.\u201d\n\nAn AbbVie takeover of Shire would represent the 48th domestic company to reincorporate overseas through inversion in the last decade and the 77th overall since 1983, according to data from House Ways and Means Committee Democrats. Mylan, a Pennsylvania-based maker of generic drugs, also announced Monday that it has agreed to buy the generics business of Abbott Laboratories for $5.3 billion, with the combined companies to be organized in the Netherlands. And Walgreen Co. is considering reincorporating abroad as well.\n\nRelated: Walgreens Moving to Europe for a Tax Break? It\u2019s the American Way\n\nWhether these inversions are a sign of oppressive tax rates or a loophole that needs closing, they\u2019re happening \u2014 and the trend will deprive the U.S. of billions of dollars if it\u2019s allowed to continue. Calculating just how much the U.S. government stands to lose is made difficult by the murky nature of corporate tax reporting and other factors. But researchers for Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation earlier this year estimated that a bill to curtail tax inversions and could raise roughly $20 billion over the next decade. That estimate does not include the latest announced or potential inversion deals.\n\nRelated: Dems\u2019 Proposal on Tax Avoidance Misses Real Problem\n\nThe continuing flow of such deals highlights the urgency of congressional action, said Edward Kleinbard, a law professor and tax policy expert at the University of Southern California who served as the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation from 2007 to 2009. \u201cThe inversions demonstrate the need for fundamental corporate tax reform,\u201d Kleinbard said. \u201cIn that sense, they are a canary in the coal mine. On the other hand, (if Congress waits) to get around to corporate tax reform, there won\u2019t be a corporate tax base left to reform.\u201d\n\nFor now, the ongoing merger wave in the health care sector only adds pressure on companies to explore moving overseas. \u201cAt this point, corporate directors are going to feel that they are chumps for doing nothing,\u201d Kleinbard said. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous place from a policymaker\u2019s point of view and for corporate America. (Tax) revenues will start hemorrhaging faster and faster. Once structures are inverted, it\u2019s extremely difficult to recapture them.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The hottest trend in corporate America could prove to be extremely costly for the United States.", "title": "Corporate Tax Inversions Will Cost U.S. Billions \u2014 and We\u2019ll All Pay", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/16/Corporate-Tax-Inversions-Will-Cost-US-Billions-and-We-ll-All-Pay", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06112012_Uncle_Sam_Storm_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/16/Corporate-Tax-Inversions-Will-Cost-US-Billions-and-We-ll-All-Pay", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06112012_Uncle_Sam_Storm_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The hottest trend in corporate America could prove to be extremely costly for the United States.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Calculating just how much the U.S. government stands to lose is made difficult by the murky nature of corporate tax reporting and other factors.\n\u201cThe inversions demonstrate the need for fundamental corporate tax reform,\u201d Kleinbard said.\nRelated: The Biggest Company Yet to Ditch the U.S. for Tax ReasonsAlthough the federal corporate tax rate is touted as the world\u2019s highest at 35 percent, data from the Government Accountability Office show that corporations paid an average effective tax rate of roughly 17 percent last year.\nBut researchers for Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation earlier this year estimated that a bill to curtail tax inversions and could raise roughly $20 billion over the next decade.\nAbbVie has said a deal would allow it to drop its effective tax rate to about 13 percent by 2016, from about 22 percent now."}
