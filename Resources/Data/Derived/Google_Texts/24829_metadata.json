It shows you the level of honesty people have come to expect of our liberal friends. Now, liberals are applauded for not lying through their teeth about something.\n\nWhat are they supposed to say? This Obamacare website is fantastic! And really, haven't you already read all the magazines in your current doctor's office anyway?\n\nThe New York Times has described Obama's repeated claim that you could keep your insurance plan and keep your doctor under Obamacare as a mere slip of the tongue: \"Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that.\"\n\nMisspoke? How exactly does one misspeak, word for word, dozens of times, over and over again?\n\nThat wasn't misspeaking -- it was a deliberate, necessary lie. Even Democrats couldn't have voted for Obamacare if Americans had known the truth. It was absolutely vital for Obama to lie about people being able to keep their insurance and their doctors.\n\nOf course, it was difficult for voters to know the truth because every time Republicans would try to tell them, the White House and the media would rush in and call the critics liars.\n\nThe White House posted a specific refutation of the \"disinformation\" about not being able to keep your doctor or insurance plan. That claim, the website said, was being disseminated by Republicans \"to scare people.\"\n\nTheir proof consisted of a video of Obama clearly stating, \"If you have insurance that you like, then you will be able to keep that insurance. If you've got a doctor that you like, you will be able to keep your doctor.\"\n\nA video of someone asserting the very fact in dispute does not rise to the level of \"evidence,\" but it was more than enough for MSNBC.\n\nEven when pretending to be critical of Obamacare, liberals lie about the real problems. They tell us they're worried about the percentage of young people signing up for Obamacare. The mix of young and old people in Obamacare is completely irrelevant. It won't help if a lot of young people sign up because their premiums are negligible.\n\nTo keep the system afloat, what Obamacare really needs is lots of healthy people, preferably healthy older people. Their premiums are astronomical -- and they won't need much medical treatment.\n\nPremiums are set by your age, not your health. It doesn't matter if you never go to the doctor. Obamacare punishes you for having a healthy lifestyle. The Obamacare tax is a massively regressive poll tax on the middle-aged and the middle class.\n\nApart from those who are subsidized, everyone pays the exact same amount in penalties or insurance premiums for his age group. It doesn't matter if you don't make as much money as Bill Gates. Any 58-year-old male who doesn't qualify for a subsidy will pay the same Obamacare tax as Gates.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher tried to impose the same tax per person, as a \"community charge,\" there were riots in the street.\n\nOur extremely progressive tax system, where nearly half the country pays no income tax at all, and the other half pays about 40 percent of their income, may not be fair. But most people also don't think it's fair to tax a guy making $80,000 a year the identical amount as one making $80 million a year. That's exactly what Obamacare does.\n\nWith Obamacare, the Democratic Party has foisted the most regressive tax possible on America. This ruthless assault on the middle class is all so we can have a health care system more like every other country has.\n\nUntil now, the United States has had the highest survival rates in the world for heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Cancer comparisons are the most useful because all Western countries keep careful records for this disease.\n\nFor all types of cancers, European men have only a 47.3 percent five-year survival rate, compared to a 66.3 percent survival rate for American men.\n\nEuropean women have only a 55.8 percent chance of being alive five years after being diagnosed with any type of cancer, compared to 62.9 percent of American women.\n\nAmerican survival rates for breast, prostate, thyroid and skin cancer are higher than 90 percent. Europeans do not have a 90 percent survival rate for one of those cancers.\n\nThe European rates are even worse than they sound because many cancers are not discovered until the victim's death -- twice as many as in the U.S. All those cancers were excluded from the study.\n\nCanadian cancer survival rates aren't much better than the European rates -- and they've been able to sneak into to the U.S. for treatment! Women in the U.S. have a 61 percent survival rate for all cancers, compared to a 58 percent survival rate in Canada. Men in the U.S. have a 57 percent survival rate compared to 53 percent in Canada.\n\nThat's why your insurance premiums have to go through the roof and your Obamacare tax is the same as Bill Gates'. So across the world, we'll all be equal, dying of cancer, heart disease and diabetes as often as everyone else.\n\nIt's not that Obama doesn't believe in American exceptionalism; it's that he wants to end it.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "And our health.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "And our health.", "title": "ObamaCare's Ruthless Assault on the Middle Class", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/219272/obamacares-ruthless-assault-middle-class-ann-coulter", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:46:54-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/219272/obamacares-ruthless-assault-middle-class-ann-coulter", "description": "And our health.", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare's Ruthless Assault on the Middle Class"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-19T19:15:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:46:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb034\"", "article_summary": "Women in the U.S. have a 61 percent survival rate for all cancers, compared to a 58 percent survival rate in Canada.\nFor all types of cancers, European men have only a 47.3 percent five-year survival rate, compared to a 66.3 percent survival rate for American men.\nThe Obamacare tax is a massively regressive poll tax on the middle-aged and the middle class.\nThis ruthless assault on the middle class is all so we can have a health care system more like every other country has.\nThat's why your insurance premiums have to go through the roof and your Obamacare tax is the same as Bill Gates'."}
