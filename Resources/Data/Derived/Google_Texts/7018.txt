Donald Trump's speech Monday night in Iowa after his surprising loss in the caucuses was perhaps most noteworthy for its graciousness.

"I want to congratulate Ted, and I want to congratulate all of the incredible candidates," Trump told supporters inWest Des Moines, saying he was "honored" to finish second.

Was this the beginning of a kinder, gentler Trump? Well.....

"Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it," Trump tweeted Wednesday morning in the opening salvo of a series of tweets eviscerating Cruz.

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016

The impetus for Trump's fraud accusation appeared to be an erroneous claim from Cruz's campaign Monday night during the caucuses that Ben Carson was poised to drop out of the race. Cruz later apologized for spreading the incorrect information.

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016

But Trump didn't stop there as he leveled other claims against Cruz, including that the Texas senator falsely suggested he supported Obamacare.

And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016

He concluded by calling for a redo of the caucuses or for Cruz's win to be ruled invalid.

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016

Needless to say, holding the Iowa caucuses for a second time seems rather unlikely, but these latest broadsides should only intensify the increasingly contentious battle between Trump and Cruz.
