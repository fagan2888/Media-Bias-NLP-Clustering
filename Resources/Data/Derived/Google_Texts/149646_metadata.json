This deal isn\u2019t the move of confident job creators seeking the best outlet for their brawny creativity. Instead, it\u2019s a move from weakness, made by two mature companies responding to private-sector cost controls by shifting their emphasis from engineering to financial engineering.\n\nThe real problem for medical-device companies is that they are getting squeezed hard by the long-running push to contain health-care costs, which only accelerated with the Affordable Care Act. Lobbyists for the industry, and companies like Boston Scientific BSX, +0.76% said during last fall\u2019s budget fight that they wanted repeal of the ACA\u2019s 2.3% excise tax on medical devices because prices for what they sell were falling.\n\nIn other words, hospitals were consolidating to meet their own cost-containment requirements, and their size let them bargain harder with companies like Medtronic MDT, +0.12%\n\nU.S. expats give up citizenship to flee taxes (20:31)\n\nBut capitalism \u2014 remember capitalism? \u2014 has always offered a neat answer to that dilemma: innovate. Build products so compelling they can command above-market margins. Device makers used to do this effectively \u2014 that\u2019s why their profit margins before interest, taxes and non-cash charges (but after R&D spending, which is only 5% of Covidien\u2019s sales and 9% of Medtronic\u2019s) are still nearly 10 percentage points higher than those of the S&P 500 companies as a group. Even with all their complaining, device makers\u2019 margins run about 34% of sales, compared with 24.5% for the S&P 500, Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ said last year.\n\nThis can be done even in today\u2019s climate \u2014 if the product is good enough. The most obvious example is Gilead Sciences GILD, -1.41% whose $84,000 hepatitis C drug has taken over its market in less than a year since winning U.S. regulatory approval. Its gross margins are 90%-plus.\n\nA shortage of innovation, combined with skepticism about price and value, has led the whole medical-device group to underperform the S&P 500 badly since 2009. That means Medtronic wants to raise its dividend \u2014 which, at an annual yield of 1.9%, is right about at the S&P 500 average, but not high enough to compensate for weakening growth prospects.\n\nTo deliver competitive returns, Medtronic needs to do one of two things. It plans to raise its dividend \u2014 and to meet its target of returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, it would sure help to repatriate the offshore part of Medtronic\u2019s $14 billion cash reserve without paying taxes.\n\nOr Medtronic and Covidien each could merge with another player to get bigger, and regain bargaining power with hospitals. That would help profits, driving shares higher.\n\nOr both.\n\nWhich is what they did.\n\n\u201cSure, there is more cash flexibility, and we will use that to our advantage,\u201d Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said on a conference call Monday. \u201cBut the strategic element of this deal is extremely important, and that was a primary driver.\u201d\n\nSo, please, let\u2019s skip the blather about lost U.S. jobs or competitiveness. This deal had nothing to do with that.\n\nBoth companies will keep their operational headquarters in the U.S. Covidien, which is already based in Ireland legally, has three of its 41 factories there and 19 in the U.S., generating 82% of the dollar value of Covidien\u2019s production. Its top execs live near Boston. Covidien (like Medtronic) will keep jobs near where customers and labor\u2019s needs are.\n\nThe trick for both policy makers and investors is to watch the balls that really matter. For policy makers, that means jobs \u2014 and they\u2019re staying in the U.S. For investors, that means sales and profits \u2014 the lion\u2019s share of those are staying here too.\n\nWashington, which has a budget to kinda-sorta balance over time, may eventually tighten the tax loophole that enabled this deal. It should. The loss of innovation shifting to paper entrepreneurialism hurts the economy far more than nominal U.S. corporate tax rates of 35% \u2014 which, after our unusually generous deductions, produce tax bills at or below developed-nation averages.\n\nIf you believe Medtronic\u2019s deal says anything about U.S. competitiveness, look harder at the numbers. If you can still sell the idea that the corporate tax is why companies succeed or fail, you may yet forge a career convincing in-demand engineers and corporate executives to move to countries like Ireland, with an unemployment rate twice as high and incomes 40% lower than in the United States.\n\nTim Mullaney writes on the economy, health care and technology.
