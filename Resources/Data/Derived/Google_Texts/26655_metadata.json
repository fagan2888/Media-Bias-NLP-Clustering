The administration released preliminary data on insurers that have indicated they want to participate next year in the insurance exchanges, where the federal government subsidizes premiums for millions of people.\n\nSo far, it said, the number of insurers, also known as issuers, is up to 315 next year, from 252 this year. For the 36 states served by the federal marketplace, it said, the number is up almost 30 percent, to 248 next year, from 191 this year.\n\nFourteen states ran their own exchanges, and half have reported the number of insurers expected in 2015. The number in these states and the District of Columbia is expected to increase by about 10 percent, to 67, from 61, the administration said. A three-month open-enrollment period begins Nov. 15.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, disclosed the numbers of insurers in a speech at the Brookings Institution, where she said the data showed that \u201cthe Affordable Care Act is working.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDuring the last open enrollment,\u201d she said, \u201cconsumers could choose from an average of nearly 50 plans. Today, we\u2019re able to announce that in 2015 there will be a 25 percent increase in the total number of issuers selling health insurance plans in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are generally consistent with reports by some insurers, which have said they are moving into additional states because they see the government-subsidized market as a business opportunity.\n\nHowever, the numbers came with several qualifications.\n\nMany states have more than one insurance market or rating area. An insurer is counted as participating in a state if it is in just one local market. Consumers in an urban area may have additional choices next year, but that does not guarantee the same options for people in rural areas who had more limited choices this year. The administration did not disclose the number of plans in each rating area in a state.\n\nMoreover, administration officials said, if an insurer offers its products on the exchanges of three states, that is counted as three insurers.\n\nThe numbers, through Sept. 4, do not reflect a decision last week by PreferredOne, the largest provider of coverage on Minnesota\u2019s insurance exchange, to pull out of the state\u2019s online marketplace.\n\nFederal officials said they were pleased to see increases in states with few options this year. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, the federal exchange had just one private insurer this year, officials said. The number is expected to increase to five in New Hampshire and two in West Virginia.\n\nLikewise, officials said, in Alabama, Maine, Mississippi and North Carolina, the number of insurers will rise to three in 2015, from two this year. In Alaska and Wyoming, the number will remain at two.\n\nIn Arkansas and Montana, officials said, the number of insurers on the federal exchange will rise to four, from three this year. The number will be unchanged at three in Delaware, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nAmong the states showing substantial increases were Indiana, where the number of insurers is rising to nine, from four, and Missouri, where the number is doubling, to eight, officials said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140923210239, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration released preliminary data on insurers that have indicated they want to participate next year in the insurance exchanges.", "title": "Under Affordable Care Act, 25 Percent Increase in Health Insurers Is Predicted", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/under-affordable-care-act-25-percent-increase-in-health-insurers-is-predicted.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003134273"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/under-affordable-care-act-25-percent-increase-in-health-insurers-is-predicted.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003134273", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/under-affordable-care-act-25-percent-increase-in-health-insurers-is-predicted.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "25 Percent Increase in Insurers on Health Marketplaces Is Predicted for Next Year", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 23, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Obama  Barack", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Obama administration released preliminary data on insurers that have indicated they want to participate next year in the insurance exchanges.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The Obama administration released preliminary data on insurers that have indicated they want to participate next year in the insurance exchanges.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-09-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2014-09-23", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "24health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140924111543, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/under-affordable-care-act-25-percent-increase-in-health-insurers-is-predicted.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration released preliminary data on insurers that have indicated they want to participate next year in the insurance exchanges.", "title": "Under Affordable Care Act, 25 Percent Increase in Health Insurers Is Predicted"}, "pdate": 20140923, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003134273, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Under Affordable Care Act, 25 Percent Increase in Health Insurers Is Predicted", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Moreover, administration officials said, if an insurer offers its products on the exchanges of three states, that is counted as three insurers.\nSo far, it said, the number of insurers, also known as issuers, is up to 315 next year, from 252 this year.\nIn Arkansas and Montana, officials said, the number of insurers on the federal exchange will rise to four, from three this year.\nFederal officials said they were pleased to see increases in states with few options this year.\nFourteen states ran their own exchanges, and half have reported the number of insurers expected in 2015."}
