Surprisingly, there appears to be a market for it \u2014 from body builders to experimental cooks \u2014 and Hudson made $4,750 by selling it online in just one year.\n\nAccording to ITV\u2019s This Morning, Hudson said she had found it difficult to produce milk when her daughter Milly was born 10 weeks premature, but soon it arrived \u201cin bucket loads,\u201d she noted. Since her daughter was too small to be fed more than 3 ounces per week, Hudson began filling up all of her hospital and home milk storage space, not wanting to throw the breast milk out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to pour it away because it takes a lot of work to produce breast milk. It takes energy and time,\u201d she told This Morning.\n\nInspired by several women she found online who were selling their breast milk, Hudson thought, \u201cif I can make money for my children, I don\u2019t see the harm,\u201d she told This Morning.\n\nIn the past, there have been the occasional males who believe drinking breast milk provides adults benefits. For example, discussion threads on Bodybuilding.com often center around breast milk as a form of health supplement \u2014 with men claiming it gives them energy and keeps them from getting sick. But while breastfeeding has been shown to provide infants with crucial nutrition and boost their immunity against diseases, no scientific evidence has proven that adults can benefit from the nutrients in breast milk.\n\nWhile it may not exactly offer any of these health benefits some men rave about, breast milk has been used in various foods in the past \u2014 such as ice cream. Known as \u201cBaby Gaga,\u201d an ice cream flavor developed by London\u2019s Icecreamist uses breast milk from up to 15 different women, and is flavored with vanilla and lemon zest. Store founder Matt O\u2019Connor notes that \u201cIt\u2019s pure, it\u2019s natural, it\u2019s organic, and it\u2019s free range \u2014 and if it\u2019s good enough for our kids, it\u2019s good enough to use in our ice cream,\u201d he told British TV.\n\nHudson now has regular clients, and she harbors no judgment against the adult males who drink it for protein purposes, or the cooks who use it in their experimental dishes: \u201cWhat they do with the milk is up to them, I\u2019m not going to discriminate,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "breast milk, breastfeeding, selling breast milk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One mother decided to make some extra cash by doing something unusual \u2014 selling her own breast milk to a market of bodybuilders and cooks.", "title": "British Mother Sells Her Own Breast Milk For $20 A Bottle", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/british-mother-sells-her-own-breast-milk-20-bottle-making-4750-one-year-313596", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/09/breastfeeding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One mother decided to make some extra cash by doing something unusual \u2014 selling her own breast milk to a market of bodybuilders and cooks.", "title": "British Mother Sells Her Own Breast Milk For $20 A Bottle", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/british-mother-sells-her-own-breast-milk-20-bottle-making-4750-one-year-313596", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/09/breastfeeding.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/09/breastfeeding.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-09T13:15:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-09T13:15:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One mother decided to make some extra cash by doing something unusual \u2014 selling her own breast milk to a market of bodybuilders and cooks."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to pour it away because it takes a lot of work to produce breast milk.\nWhether you want some breast milk for body building or \u201csexual preferences\u201d \u2014 one British woman can sell it to you for $20 a bottle, and she isn\u2019t going to judge you for it.\nIn the past, there have been the occasional males who believe drinking breast milk provides adults benefits.\nKnown as \u201cBaby Gaga,\u201d an ice cream flavor developed by London\u2019s Icecreamist uses breast milk from up to 15 different women, and is flavored with vanilla and lemon zest.\nWhile breast milk is known to be full of nutrients for infants, some adults enjoy buying it off the Internet for body building and health purposes."}
