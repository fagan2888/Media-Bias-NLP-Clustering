That means they pay more than men do for the same item.\n\nAlso known as the \u201cPink Tax\u201d, the problem has even become a legislative issue in France, where the government is considering legal action related to the fact that French women are charged much more than French men for toiletries and clothing. But the problem exists in the United States as well, and extended to something a bit pricier than deodorant: Health care.\n\nIn 2010, Consumer Reports did a study of everyday purchases for men and women in the United States, and determined that women can pay as much as $1,300 more than men annually for similar purchases of toiletries, clothing and services. Packages of identical razors, for example, were priced almost $1 differently based solely on color (pink for women, blue for men). Deodorants targeted for women can cost as much as $3 more than deodorants targeted for men, with identical ingredients (although the fragrance may be different).\n\nThe same is true of dry cleaning charges. Two shirts made of the same material and differing only in how they are buttoned (buttons on the right versus buttons on the left) can be charged differently by as much as $1.\n\nWomen are also charged differently based on their body type. Some companies charge more to plus-sized women for the same piece of clothing offered to smaller women, but extra-large sizes for men cost the same as regular sizes of the same item.\n\nIn California, New York City and Miami-Dade County in Florida, gender pricing is illegal. When California banned gender pricing in 1996, it found that on average women spent an extra $13.51 per year in extra costs for regular purchases.\n\nNow the National Women\u2019s Law Center has discovered yet another example of a pink tax, and it is a hefty one. For many insurance policies, a non-smoking woman often pays a higher premium than a smoking man of the same age. The NWLC said women pay $1 billion more on annual health care costs than men.\n\nWhile some states have banned such practices, and the Affordable Care Act makes such pricing illegal if a state adopts the ACA, many other insurance plans charge women more.\n\nIt is true that healthy women visit the doctor more often than men. Not only are there gynecological reasons for a woman to see a doctor that men do not deal with, but women are more likely to visit the doctor for regular checkups. Multiple surveys have found that women are as much as three times more likely to see a doctor at least once a year and are more likely to have a regular doctor.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pink tax, Consumer Reports, University of Central Florida, California, gender pricing", "description": "When women pay more than men do for the same item, that's known as the Pink Tax."}, "article_summary": "Now the National Women\u2019s Law Center has discovered yet another example of a pink tax, and it is a hefty one.\nPackages of identical razors, for example, were priced almost $1 differently based solely on color (pink for women, blue for men).\nAlso known as the \u201cPink Tax\u201d, the problem has even become a legislative issue in France, where the government is considering legal action related to the fact that French women are charged much more than French men for toiletries and clothing.\nThe NWLC said women pay $1 billion more on annual health care costs than men.\nBut the problem exists in the United States as well, and extended to something a bit pricier than deodorant: Health care."}
