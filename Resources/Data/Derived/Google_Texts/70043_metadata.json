Colorado came back to take a 3-2 lead after two periods, then collapsed in the third.\n\nIn Roy\u2019s case, it probably was an attempt to avoid the perception of panic, rather than a case of truly believing his postgame statement that the loss to an 0-8 team neither embarrassed nor angered him.\n\nRoy has been publicly angry and critical of his players after previous losses in what has become a 2-4-1 start, but that didn\u2019t happen Saturday night, when he essentially said that kind of play and effort would win on many nights.\n\nAmong the problems, though, was that kind of play and effort wasn\u2019t good enough to beat the worst team in the league. The Blue Jackets came in with an 0-8 record, and with new coach John Tortorella in his second game behind the bench and still learning to match names with faces after taking over for the fired Todd Richards earlier in the week.\n\nAfter a day off, the Avalanche will practice Monday before heading out on a three-game road trip to Florida on Tuesday, Tampa Bay on Thursday and Carolina on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter right now to manage our game a little bit better,\u201d Roy said after the game. \u201cAnd I think that could make the big difference between losing and winning. Because we\u2019re doing a lot of good things out there.\u201d\n\nHe repeated, \u201cWe need to just learn to manage our game a little bit better, and I think we\u2019re going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche was 0-1-1 in the homestand, also losing to struggling Carolina 1-0 in overtime Wednesday.\n\nAvalanche captain Gabe Landeskog chose his words carefully.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a matter of analyzing the game and looking at the video and seeing what we would do better,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cAt times, we definitely put pressure on the goalie (Sergei Bobrovsky) and made it hard on him. I do think that we somehow made it a little too difficult in the neutral zone, and our backcheck has to be better.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cA couple of games ago, we weren\u2019t playing well enough defensively. We made sure we corrected that, and I think we had a solid defensive game against Carolina, and now it seems like we\u2019re making it a little bit too hard on ourselves getting through the neutral zone. For us, like I said, it\u2019s a matter of just kind of ignoring the past and obviously correcting what we can do to make us better. \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to lose two at home, no doubt about that, but there\u2019s no time for us to feel sorry for ourselves. It\u2019s late October, and we have to make sure that when March comes, we have to make sure that these points matter and we pick up as many points as we can. We have to start doing that right now.\u201d\n\nNathan MacKinnon, making the adjustment to playing center \u2014 his natural position \u2014 in his third NHL season, had a power-play goal at 17:12 of the second period that gave the Avalanche the 3-2 lead. He was critical of himself for his lapse on the Blue Jackets\u2019 fourth and tiebreaking goal, scored by Brandon Dubinsky at 6:43 of the third period, when Columbus defenseman David Savard was in the rush going the other way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty frustrating, what we\u2019re doing in our third periods,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where it starts. It\u2019s just overall defensive awareness. I thought it was a 3-on-2, getting back, and it was a 3-on-3, and I have to know that my D-man\u2019s behind me. \u2026 I got a little too excited getting back. It\u2019s just little things like that. We need to be better. I need to be better.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a first-line center, I definitely need to be better defensively, especially in the third period. We definitely need to close out games. Against Carolina, our offense wasn\u2019t there. Tonight it was. Tonight it was a little bit opposite. We gave up (36) shots tonight, so it\u2019s definitely tough.\u201d\n\nGoing into Sunday\u2019s games, the Avalanche already was five points out of what would be the final wild-card playoff spot in the imbalanced Western Conference. Chicago was in that spot, and in fifth in the Central Division, with 10 points. Pacific Division leader San Jose also had 10, but each division is guaranteed three spots in the playoff field.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boos and seeming denial among the responses to Avalanche loss", "title": "Boos and seeming denial among the responses to Avalanche loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/25/boos-and-seeming-denial-among-the-responses-to-avalanche-loss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151025__patrick-roy-avsp1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151025__patrick-roy-avsp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-25T19:20:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:41:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a first-line center, I definitely need to be better defensively, especially in the third period.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter right now to manage our game a little bit better,\u201d Roy said after the game.\nWe definitely need to close out games.\nIt\u2019s late October, and we have to make sure that when March comes, we have to make sure that these points matter and we pick up as many points as we can.\nAnd what at least came off as denial from Avalanche coach Patrick Roy."}
