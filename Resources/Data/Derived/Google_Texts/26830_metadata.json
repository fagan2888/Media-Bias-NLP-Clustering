He said that working parents should be able to know their children are safe, have flexibility when needed and not have to turn down an opportunity out of the worry that it could negatively impact the family.\n\nThe president signed a Presidential Memorandum instructing all federal government agencies to broaden work schedule flexibility and allow employees to request it if needed.\n\nObama also appealed to Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, making sure that pregnant women don\u2019t have to compromise their health for the sake of their jobs. He pointed out that America is the only developed nation that does not have paid maternity leave.\n\nThe president listed some examples of companies who offer family-friendly policies, like JetBlue, Google and Cisco. After increasing paid leave for parents to five months, Google had half as many women leave the company, Obama said. He also gave an example of how much money Cisco saves by allowing telecommuting, an estimated $275 million a year.\n\nSupporting working parents has economic impact as well, according to the president. He said that the economy relies on maximizing America\u2019s talent, something that\u2019s hard to do without moving some workplace obstacles out of the way.\n\nObama wrote that making it easier for all employees to contribute their best is the \u201ckey to staying competitive in the global economy.\u201d\n\nThe White House Summit on Working Families featured speakers such as actress Christina Hendricks, Old Navy vice president, Lynn Albright and Care.com CEO, Sheila Marcelo.\n\nTo read more about the event or contribute an opinion, use #FamiliesSucceed on social media.\n\nGet Free Updates!
