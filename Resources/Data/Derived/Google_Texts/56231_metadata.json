They need education.\"\n\nTEANECK \u2014 People ask every day about Obamacare at the Korean Medical Program at Holy Name Medical Center.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to push,\u201d Kyung Hee Choi, vice president of the program, said. \u201cOur phones are ringing off the hook.\u201d\n\nHer challenge is getting more navigators to help enroll the estimated 13,000 Korean-Americans in New Jersey. So Choi worked with Rep. Bill Pascrell to bring 25 navigators to the hospital Tuesday, at an event that drew about 200 people looking to get health insurance before a March 31 deadline.\n\nMany Korean-Americans don\u2019t speak English fluently, Choi said. Many of the people at the event declined interviews for that reason. The language barrier, along with the technical problems that have plagued Healthcare.gov, have kept many from signing up.\n\n\u201cIn our case we anticipated that and we\u2019ve been inviting bilingual navigators to Holy Name every single day since October last year,\u201d Choi said.\n\nWhile enrolling each person can take about an hour, the hospital has signed up about 1,200 people in that time, Choi said.\n\nThere is also an education gap, she said. Many Korean-Americans fear they can\u2019t afford healthcare and don\u2019t know about the government subsidies that can help them pay for it.\n\nJae Chun, a private insurance agent, has held 40 seminars in four months on the Affordable Care Act with Korean-American audiences.\n\n\u201cPeople do not know what Obamacare is, how they enroll,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need education.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, navigators and translators huddled with enrollees at computers in a conference room at Holy Name. The hospital served sushi.\n\nPascrell said it was the biggest crowd he\u2019d seen at an enrollment event. He blamed Chris Christie and other governors who failed to spend the federal money they were given to help the uninsured get medical coverage.\n\n\u201cIf the governors would have spent the money allowed to them to educate people in their states, it would have been a lot easier,\u201d Pascrell said.\n\nChoi hoped Pascrell would send more navigators to a March 25 event at the hospital, just a week before open enrollment ends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can enroll 100 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at least for those who are calling us I hope to help them out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "teaneck, news", "title": "Obamacare enrollment event targets Bergen County Koreans as deadline looms", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare enrollment event targets Bergen County Koreans as deadline looms\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/03/obamacare_enrollment_event_targets_bergen_county_koreans_as_deadline_looms.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/bergen/photo/14515814-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12462965\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-19T00:01:21Z\", \"author\": \"Myles Ma | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"teaneck\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/bergen/photo/14515814-large.jpg", "creator": "@MylesMaNJ", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "About 200 people attended an event at Holy Name Medical Center to sign up for health insurance"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, March 18, 2014,  8:01 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/bergen/photo/14515814-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mylesdma\", \"author_nickname\": \"Myles Ma | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"10332871\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Bergen County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "About 200 people attended an event at Holy Name Medical Center to sign up for health insurance", "title": "Obamacare enrollment event targets Bergen County Koreans as deadline looms", "url": "http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/03/obamacare_enrollment_event_targets_bergen_county_koreans_as_deadline_looms.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/bergen/photo/14515814-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/BergenCountyNJ"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, March 18, 2014,  8:00 PM", "article_author": "Myles Ma | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "About 200 people attended an event at Holy Name Medical Center to sign up for health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde96\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur phones are ringing off the hook.\u201dHer challenge is getting more navigators to help enroll the estimated 13,000 Korean-Americans in New Jersey.\nChoi hoped Pascrell would send more navigators to a March 25 event at the hospital, just a week before open enrollment ends.\nTEANECK \u2014 People ask every day about Obamacare at the Korean Medical Program at Holy Name Medical Center.\nPascrell said it was the biggest crowd he\u2019d seen at an enrollment event.\nMany Korean-Americans fear they can\u2019t afford healthcare and don\u2019t know about the government subsidies that can help them pay for it."}
