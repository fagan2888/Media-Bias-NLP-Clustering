What began as speculation grew roots when his agent became engaged in a shouting match with Vikings representatives at the NFL combine. An uneasy relationship became exposed and crawls toward divorce.\n\nThe Vikings continue to maintain that Peterson can return and anchor their offense. That is hard to envision. These types of feuds don\u2019t end well. Peterson met with commissioner Roger Goodell in New York this week to seek reinstatement. Peterson deserves the right to work and is seeking a new chance in a new city. That is reasonable. What is not is the explanation. Peterson doesn\u2019t believe the Vikings showed enough support after the allegations surfaced that he excessively disciplined his son.\n\nIf ever a situation presented itself not to play the victim, this is it. There is a victim in this case: his son. The Vikings made a decision based on business and values. Punishing a child is viewed differently across the United States, cutting across geographical lines. What Peterson said was a learned behavior was not seen this way in the state of Minnesota.\n\nWhen major sponsor Radisson pulled its sponsorship of the Vikings, Peterson wasn\u2019t returning to the field. Minnesota turned to the league and Peterson landed on the commissioner\u2019s list, an unknown trapdoor that opened as the league embarrassingly scrambled to deal with issues of violence last season.\n\nPeterson stewed in disbelief. It stung, no doubt. He deserved the right to appeal during the season. But it was a league matter at that point, not the Vikings\u2019 problem. And did I mention that Minnesota paid him last season? Peterson can\u2019t throw his hands in the air with the \u201cwoe is me\u201d attitude when he never missed a check. The reality of the situation is that the NFL lacks credibility when disciplining players. It is the definition of arbitrary. Don\u2019t try to find logic over the past 18 months, because it\u2019s absent.\n\nPeterson, of course, can take exception, can be upset. But ultimately he put himself in this position. It was never the Vikings\u2019 responsibility to rationalize his behavior. They can show compassion without understanding and tried to walk a jagged line.\n\nWhich brings us back to Peterson. Let him go. He desires an exit. Minnesota should grant his wish. It won\u2019t be easy in a league where every good team has a solid running back but no club wants to pay a premium for one. Where he will play is a mystery, because the Vikings don\u2019t want to give him away. The Cowboys, Cardinals and Jaguars all make sense.\n\nIt is the irony of the situation. Peterson played the victim, making it difficult to trade him. Other teams are wise. They will wait until the Vikings blink, knowing that Peterson could threaten to hold out. I wonder if the Vikings are upset that Peterson didn\u2019t show them respect when they didn\u2019t cut him or bury him in the press. It\u2019s a two-way street.\n\nPeterson deserves a fresh start. But he needs a fresh outlook: Humility would serve him well. Footnotes. The Broncos\u2019 players can\u2019t hide their delight in the defensive switch to a 3-4 alignment. T.J. Ward told me what others are thinking: Last year\u2019s defense was too vanilla. Wade Phillips is old in years, but young in vision. If he doesn\u2019t turn this defense into a frothing pack of blitzers, it will be a surprise. \u2026 Last week, the Broncos worked out CSU-Pueblo defensive lineman Josh Bredl, a former high school star at Horizon. Bredl might not make it, but it\u2019s latest sign of how powerful the Thunderwolves\u2019 program has become. CSU-Pueblo quarterback Chris Bonner has a chance to get drafted.\n\nTroy E.
