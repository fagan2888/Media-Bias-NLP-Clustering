(Acura/Wieck)\n\nAcura\u2019s best-selling MDX luxury SUV is getting much more than a facelift for its Big Apple debut next week, including changes like \u201cadded luxury comfort and convenience features, and advanced new powertrain technology,\u201d as well as the new grille first seen on the Precision Concept in Detroit. Whatever changes they make, it\u2019ll have to be pretty drastically bad to keep the MDX from continuing to sell like hotcakes\u2026 or whatever else is selling like hotcakes apparently used to these days.\n\nThe \u201cnew\u201d Subaru Impreza\n\nThe big story here is that the new Impreza lineup will be the first model to use the new Subaru Global Platform. (Subaru)\n\nWe know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cGosh, that teaser photo sure does look like the front end of the current Impreza!\u201d Turns out, you\u2019re probably right. Subaru has already shown us a few Impreza concepts, but now it\u2019s time for the real deal in New York. The big story here is that the new economy car will be the first model to use the new Subaru Global Platform, the Japanese automaker\u2019s first foray into the ever-popular world of modular architecture. That may sound like a whole lot of mumbo-jumbo, but don\u2019t worry: it\u2019ll still have standard all-wheel-drive.\n\nA(nother) Nissan GT-R refresh\n\nThis gif shows the GT-R's iconic taillight design, leading us to believe Nissan could unveil a new generation at the 2016 New York Auto Show. (Nissan)\n\nEveryone was wondering earlier this week if Nissan was about to drop the microphone at Javits by showing an all-new GT-R supercar. As we\u2019ve recently found out though, it\u2019s just the final refresh for the aging Godzilla. But you know what? After almost 10 years on the market, the GT-R is still one of the fastest and best-value supercars you can buy. We don\u2019t care if it\u2019s just a facelift, keep Godzilla around!\n\nHyundai\u2019s Genesis \u201cNew York Concept\u201d\n\nThe teaser shot from Hyundai indicates it could be a midsize sedan to be unveiled in New York. (Hyundai)\n\nHyundai is getting very serious about its new Genesis global luxury brand, and now they\u2019re attempting to grab some of the spotlight in New York. The aptly-named \u201cNew York Concept\u201d is supposed to be a preview of what their upcoming BMW 3 Series-fighting sedan will look like, but judging by the photo, it looks a heck of a lot like the Aston Martin Lagonda ultra luxury sedan. Even the logos look similar! Well, you know what they say: imitation is the sincerest form of trying to score some cool factor.\n\nThe new Honda Civic Hatchback (finally!)\n\nThe sharp Civic Hatchback certainly defied all our expectations, even with its handsome contemporaries in the Civic coupe and sedan. (Nick Kurczewski)\n\nHonda showed us a very sexy concept in Geneva of what a Civic Hatchback could (and will) look like, and they\u2019re bringing the real deal to NYC. The all-new Civic has been lauded as a return to form for Honda, who seemed to have lost their way a bit with previous generations of the top-selling economy sedan. Now, though, you can have a Civic in sedan, coupe, or hatchback form, and the hotter and more fun Si and Type-R models are on their way in the coming years too.\n\nA Mazda MX-5 Miata Coupe or Hardtop?\n\nJoy: Pure, unadulterated, and absolute. That describes what you feel when driving the all-new, completely redesigned 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata. (Mike Ditz)\n\nWhether it\u2019s a true coupe or a power folding hardtop, more Miata is never a bad thing, especially considering its recent win as our most fun car of the year. Enthusiasts have been clamoring for an MX-5 coupe forever, and it could be high time that Mazda finally delivers. Either that, or they\u2019ll carry on the power retractable hard top model from the last generation, but seeing as the new Miata is all about saving weight, that may not be practical. Just tell us already, Mazda!\n\nThe not-a-coupe Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class \u201cCoupe\u201d\n\nMercedes-Benz first introduced us to the GLC Coupe concept in April 2015. (Mercedes-Benz)\n\nThe Germans have a funny way of pretending certain vehicles are coupes when they actually aren\u2019t. It started with BMW, and has spread to Mercedes-Benz too, but the trend carries on and we\u2019ll be getting another coupe-like SUV in New York in the form of the GLC-Class Coupe. While it won\u2019t be a massive \u2018Bahn-burner like the GLE450 AMG Coupe, the GLC version promises to be a more city-friendly, stylish rival to the BMW X4. We don\u2019t know why we like it, but we do.\n\nSome kind of Toyota Prius\n\nCould Toyota be planning some sort of hybrid small crossover? We'll find out next week. (Toyota)\n\nToyota has us guessing with this photo. They claim it\u2019s an addition to the 2016 Prius lineup, and while it could be a successor to the Prius c or v, it seems like something bulkier. Could Toyota be planning some sort of hybrid small crossover? That would be interesting, considering the RAV4 Hybrid just came out. All we know is that our interests are piqued.\n\nThe most affordable Porsche ever\n\nThe Macan is our favorite entry luxury SUV, and it just got even more entry-level with a turbocharged 4-cylinder option. (Porsche)\n\nOur award-winning entry luxury SUV just got even more intriguing with a lower base price and smaller, turbocharged engine. Porsche made an excellent package even more intriguing by announcing a more affordable Macan for New York. While it\u2019s not dirt cheap at $55,450, nor economical with a highway rating of 23 mpg, it will stand as the cheapest entry point into the Porsche owner\u2019s club this side of a rusty 924.\n\nA badass, supercharged Camaro\n\nThe 2017 ZL1 is a supercharged, 640-horsepower middle finger to the rest of the performance car world. (Chevrolet)\n\nAh yes, the one that\u2019s got everyone all hot and bothered. The previous generation ZL1 was a supercharged monster, so it\u2019s expected that Chevrolet was not about to let their muscle car crown be held for too long by the Challenger Hellcat. Meet the 2017 ZL1, a 640-horsepower middle finger to the rest of the muscle car world \u2013 and the performance car world in general, for that matter.\n\nDid you find this article helpful?
