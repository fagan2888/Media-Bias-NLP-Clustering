Zeller, who started in 1993, had worked for the State Patrol\u2019s executive security unit since 2008, where his duties included handling the more than 300,000 visitors who come to the Capitol every year.\n\n\u201cThe Colorado State Patrol is a little less today because we\u2019re losing you,\u201d Major Matt Packard told Zeller.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a hole in our ranks,\u201d said Sgt. Shawn Dominguez. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good guys.\u201d\n\nZeller made news earlier this year when he and trooper trooper Carin Lawrence helped out a homeless man who had his shoes stolen in the middle of a freezing night. They talked to state Sen. Randy Baumgardner, R-Hot Sulphur Springs, who remembered he had a pair of tennis shoes in his trunk and handed them over to the troopers. Baumgardner joined Capitol staffers, State Patrol employees and friends and family to say good-bye to Zeller.\n\nLaughs ensued when Zeller\u2019s colleagues noted he\u2019s as skinny now as the day he entered the academy. They also talked about his ever-present smile, no matter what was happening at the Capitol, including protests and festivals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good ride,\u201d an emotional Zeller said. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure it forever.\u201d\n\nColonel Scott Hernandez, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said the happiness at the event made up for the \u201crough\u201d morning. Thousands attended the funeral of cadet Taylor Thyfault. He was killed and a trooper seriously injured on May 23 while trying to stop a fleeing car near Longmont.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado State Patrol,Kent Zeller,Scott Hernandez,Taylor Thyfault", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Colorado State Patrol on Friday buried a cadet and said happy trails to a 22-year-veteran known as the \"ambassador of the Capitol.\"", "title": "Colorado State Patrol says farewell twice on Friday", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/05/29/colorado-state-patrol-mourns-reminisces-at-events-friday/120765/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/03/SenatorTroopers.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Colorado State Patrol on Friday buried a cadet and said happy trails to a 22-year-veteran known as the \"ambassador of the Capitol.\"", "title": "Colorado State Patrol mourns, reminisces at events Friday", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/05/29/colorado-state-patrol-mourns-reminisces-at-events-friday/120765/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/03/SenatorTroopers.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Colorado State Patrol on Friday buried a cadet and said happy trails to a 22-year-veteran known as the \"ambassador of the Capitol.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2df0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ll treasure it forever.\u201dColonel Scott Hernandez, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said the happiness at the event made up for the \u201crough\u201d morning.\n\u201cThe Colorado State Patrol is a little less today because we\u2019re losing you,\u201d Major Matt Packard told Zeller.\nBaumgardner joined Capitol staffers, State Patrol employees and friends and family to say good-bye to Zeller.\nHe was killed and a trooper seriously injured on May 23 while trying to stop a fleeing car near Longmont.\nThey talked to state Sen.
