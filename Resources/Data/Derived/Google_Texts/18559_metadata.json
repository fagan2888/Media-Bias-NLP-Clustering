She and other Zara workers rallied in late July outside the company\u2019s flagship store on 42nd Street.\n\n\u201cWe want predictable and regular schedules, job security, yearly raises,\u201d she told the loud crowd crammed onto the busy sidewalk next to the store. \u201cIf Zara really respected us like the image they project, they would work with us.\u201d\n\nSantos is a member of the Retail Action Project, a division of the Retail Workers (RWDSU). RAP has been fighting for \u201cJust Hours\u201d for five years, even confronting employers with poster-sized \u201cUnderemployment Claims,\u201d but the issue of erratic schedules is finally getting some traction nationally.\n\nThe New York Times followed a San Diego Starbucks barista trying to raise a young son with catch-as-catch-can hours. Hundreds of readers responded, many writing about similar struggles. Starbucks vowed to change its scheduling practices.\n\nAnd big media took note when Maria Fernandes, a 32-year old woman with three part-time jobs at various Dunkin\u2019 Donuts outlets in New Jersey, died of fumes from sleeping in her car between the shifts in her crazy-quilt schedule.\n\nMost retail workers can relate. Fast food strikers and Walmart workers have made predictable schedules and adequate hours a top demand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s now an emerging national movement around fair work schedules,\u201d said Gordon Mar with San Francisco Jobs with Justice, where they\u2019re pushing a Retail Workers Bill of Rights.\n\nPro-labor legislators have introduced bills federally, and while those have little chance of moving, San Francisco activists expect their Board of Supervisors will vote in their proposal in November. New York City\u2019s comptroller also said he will move on the issue.\n\nWALMART PATTERN\n\nWalmart pioneered just-in-time scheduling, and now most fast food and clothing chains use computer programs that continually recalculate staff needs based on past patterns, the weather, or expected deliveries. Workers bend to the program\u2019s dictates, ending up with short shifts, no shifts, or surprise shifts.\n\nErratic schedules show up in fluctuating pay. Iris Velasquez said she supports her mother and sister by working at Zara. Between shifts that get cut, and shifts where she gets sent home early, \u201cI can\u2019t save any money towards my aspirations,\u201d she said.\n\nHer hours were reduced to three days a week, usually six to seven hours a day, at $10.50 an hour. \u201cI have worked other retail, it doesn\u2019t have to be this bad,\u201d she said at the rally.\n\nBut it is this bad for most retail workers. \u201cShort Shifted,\u201d a study released in August, surveyed 200 New York retail workers at stores with over 100 employees. Only 40 percent reported they have set, minimum hours per week.\n\nA quarter of the surveyed workers said they are scheduled for \u201con-call\u201d shifts\u2014and most of those don\u2019t know until two hours before their shift if they\u2019ll be working. This causes havoc in scheduling childcare and other necessities, not to mention straining social and family connections.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, retail workers say that while they are trying to get more hours, their employers are hiring new workers\u2014who then suffer from the same half-a-job they do.\n\nSince these jobs rarely have benefits, employers bear no extra cost hiring a large, hours-starved workforce. Bosses want minimal staffing but maximum availability if they suddenly need more people. The goal is to \u201cmaintain a pool of workers they can shift around at their whim,\u201d said Mar.\n\nNew Yorkers have some protection, because the state requires most employers to pay at least the minimum wage for four hours if a worker shows up for a shift, effectively eliminating shorter shifts. Nine other states have a minimum \u201creporting pay,\u201d so called because if someone reports for work, but there is none, they get paid something anyway. Federal labor law is silent on the subject.\n\nEmployers are also evading paying for benefits. The Affordable Care Act mimics private insurance in not requiring coverage for part-timers, defined by ACA as workers with fewer than 30 hours a week. Walmart announced October 7 that it would no longer offer insurance to these workers. Most couldn't afford it anyway, but 30,000 will be affected.\n\nRETAIL BILL OF RIGHTS\n\nIn San Francisco, Mar said, when activists talked to workers about raising the minimum wage, \u201cthey said even $15 is not enough for them to achieve economic security\u2026 they needed full-time work and fair work schedules.\u201d\n\nThe proposed Retail Workers Bill of Rights would relieve the main hardships of computer scheduling. Before hiring more people, chain retailers, restaurants, hotels, cell phone stores, and banks would be required to offer full-time jobs to their existing part-time workers.\n\nThese businesses wouldn\u2019t be allowed to pay part-timers less for the same work. When companies changed hands, workers would be retained for 90 days.\n\nBut the most impact would come from this provision: Workers who weren\u2019t told their schedules with proper notice would get premium pay. For example, said Mar, \u201cIf there\u2019s less than 24 hours\u2019 notice, which actually happens a lot, they\u2019d have to pay for four hours if the shift is cancelled.\u201d Suddenly-added shifts would carry a premium, like overtime pay.\n\nUnionization is an obvious solution to terrible schedules, but that seems far away in most cases. However, between 2007 and 2011, RWDSU activists organized dozens of New York-area H&M stores, the world\u2019s second-largest clothing retailer. The Swedish company was mostly neutral during the effort and 1,500 area H&M clerks are now union.\n\nTheir contract says their schedules must be posted a week in advance and can\u2019t be changed without the worker agreeing.\n\nSimilarly, 250 New York bike-share workers recently unionized with Transit Workers Local 100. Their company maintains 6,000 bicycles for commuters to rent at 330 stations around the city. One of the workers\u2019 main complaints was inconsistent scheduling and short notice, problems that are \u201ceasily resolvable\u201d at the bargaining table, said Local 100 President John Samuelson.\n\nHOURS EVAPORATE\n\nThe demand for \u201copen availability\u201d is another problem, workers say. Walmart workers report that if they add a job or try to take classes, their Walmart hours can evaporate.\n\nTiffany Beroid, a Walmart worker from Laurel, Maryland, testified in July at a hearing on the proposed federal Schedules that Work Act.\n\nBeroid said she asked Walmart for schedule changes so she could take classes part-time: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for anything crazy, just for tiny modifications.\u201d For not being available 24/7, Walmart punished her by cutting her hours.\n\n\u201cIt was so bad that I couldn\u2019t pay for school anymore and I needed to drop out halfway through a semester,\u201d Beroid said. \u201cI lost all the credits and the money I spent.\u201d When she joined with other members of OUR Walmart to denounce the practice, Walmart fired her.\n\nOUR Walmart is the group responsible for several one-day strikes, including during the post-Thanksgiving shopping spectacle known as Black Friday. It was started by the Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW)\u2014parent union of RWDSU\u2014to stem Walmart\u2019s low-road business model that has been undercutting supermarkets where UFCW members work. Walmart\u2019s entry into the Southern California grocery market cost grocery workers an estimate $2.8 billion a year in lowered wages and lost benefits.\n\nIn some cases, the policies seem less like cost-cutting and more like a system to trap people in low wage work.\n\nRecalling her experience trying to attend college, Beroid said, \u201cWalmart did everything it could to keep us in poverty and keep me from getting an education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bac\"", "article_summary": "Walmart workers report that if they add a job or try to take classes, their Walmart hours can evaporate.\n\u201cShort Shifted,\u201d a study released in August, surveyed 200 New York retail workers at stores with over 100 employees.\nHer hours were reduced to three days a week, usually six to seven hours a day, at $10.50 an hour.\nFast food strikers and Walmart workers have made predictable schedules and adequate hours a top demand.\nMost retail workers can relate."}
