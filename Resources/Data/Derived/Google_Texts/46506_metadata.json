Chaudry, 31, of Piscataway.\n\nThe woman told the man that she worked for a financial company and his home was in foreclosure. She told the man she could drive him to the bank to make a cash withdrawal and give the money to her to save his home. The man complied and gave Chaudry $4,000 cash.\n\nA few days later, the woman again contacted the man and said more money was needed to avoid having the home go into foreclosure. The woman, who was accompanied by a second woman, drove the man to a local bank, where he withdrew $5,000 and gave it to the women.\n\nThe man's family eventually reported the incident to police. Detective Kenneth Mikolajczyk conducted an investigation and an arrest warrant was issued for Chaudry, who was arrested on Sept. 25 and later released on a summons.\n\nPolice said this scam may be occurring in the Asian Indian community and advised other victims to come forward and report any similar incidents to their local police department.\n\nStaff Writer Suzanne Russell: 732-565-7335; srussell@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1FwKtjr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Police warn this scam may be occurring in the Asian Indian community", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Police warn this scam may be occurring in the Asian Indian community", "title": "Linden man scammed out of $9,000", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/2015/09/28/linden-man-scammed-out-9000/72971364/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police warn this scam may be occurring in the Asian Indian community", "title": "Linden man scammed out of $9,000", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d732739609157f407bba921b53a614715013f1eb/c=0-33-186-219&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/28/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635790391382909336-Mahwish-N.-Chaudry.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Mahwish N.
