Macy, Emmy Rossum, Ben Schwartz, Larenz Tate, and more.\n\nSome of those stars were apparently impressed with Bell's size \u2013 a photo shows Macy using a tape measure on Kristen's baby bump.\n\nIn addition to the red T-shirt that seemed to be the day's uniform, Bell kept out of the sun with a brown cowboy hat and sunglasses.\n\nReady to pop: Bell kept busy on the job, even though her large stomach may have gotten in the way\n\nAlthough looking like she might be ready to pop, 34-year-old Bell was seen to be hard at work putting up siding on one of the seven homes being built for low-income families in the Habitat for Humanity project.\n\nOther stars were involved with roofing and painting, according to the Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles website, but those were probably not jobs given to an expectant mother like Bell.\n\nThe only other project Kristen has been busy at this year - besides her pregnancy - is season four of House Of Lies.\n\nSafety concerns: Bell worked on siding one of the houses in the project, a safer activity for a pregnant woman than many in construction\n\nThis current pregnancy is the second for Bell with her husband, actor Dax Shepard, 39 \u2013 their daughter, Lincoln Bell Shepard, is 18 months old.\n\nA political couple devoted to causes, Kristen and Dax refused to get married until California legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nWorking with Habitat for Humanity would make sense for an activist-oriented actor like Bell.\n\nHow big?

Macy measured Kristen's sizable bump when the Shameless and House Of Lies stars worked together", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Kristen,Bell,helps,build,house,Habitat,Humanity,Los,Angeles", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2808026/Kristen-Bell-helps-build-house-Habitat-Humanity-Los-Angeles.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Kristen Bell's rather advanced stage of pregnancy didn't stop her from chipping for the charity Habitat for Humanity on Saturday.", "title": "Kristen Bell helps to build a house for Habitat For Humanity", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2808026/Kristen-Bell-helps-build-house-Habitat-Humanity-Los-Angeles.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/25/1414274008270_wps_117_LYNWOOD_CA_OCTOBER_25_Kri.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2808026/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2808026/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "keywords": "Kristen,Bell,helps,build,house,Habitat,Humanity,Los,Angeles", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2808026, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-10-25T22:55:46.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Laurel+Brown+for+MailOnline", "section": "TV&Showbiz", "modified_time": "2014-10-25T23:05:39.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Kristen Bell helps build house Habitat Humanity Los Angeles"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Kristen Bell's rather advanced stage of pregnancy didn't stop her from chipping for the charity Habitat for Humanity on Saturday.", "title": "Kristen Bell helps to build a house for Habitat For Humanity", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2808026/Kristen-Bell-helps-build-house-Habitat-Humanity-Los-Angeles.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/25/1414274008270_wps_117_LYNWOOD_CA_OCTOBER_25_Kri.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "Celebrities,Entertainment,TV,Tv&Showbiz", "description": "Kristen Bell's rather advanced stage of pregnancy didn't stop her from chipping for the charity Habitat for Humanity on Saturday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0203\"", "article_summary": "Kristen Bell's rather advanced stage of pregnancy didn't stop her from chipping for the charity Habitat for Humanity on Saturday.\nWilliam H.
