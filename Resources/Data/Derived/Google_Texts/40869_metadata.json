We had planned a space, but have to confirm it will be available. We would hope to be as close to (Keokuk Area Hospital) as possible.\u201d\n\nDuane Fitch of Keokuk Area Hospital and owner of Fitch Healthcare, said a new dental clinic would be an asset to the hospital and the community.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about their success in getting the grant,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cThe hospital and community health center have been longtime partners. We\u2019ll try to find a spot on campus for them. (Community Health Centers) are on-site now. We\u2019re going to work with them to find a space.\u201d\n\nThe dental clinic will start up with a dentist and hygienist, and in the second year, another hygienist will be added, and so on. Kemp anticipates getting two to three dentists and two hygienists as the center grows.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what demand we\u2019ll have,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a start. You grow around the underserved population. We have eight (dental chairs) in Burlington and we need to expand.\u201d\n\nDr. Ed Kircher, whose dental practice is on the hospital campus, believes the addition of the clinic will result in a net benefit to the community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how this will affect existing dental offices,\u201d Kircher said. \u201cSome good, some bad. However, I do know that there are a lot of people on Medicaid that can\u2019t get into a dental office for treatment. This should be a great help to this segment of the population.\u201d\n\nThe Keokuk dental clinic will see underserved people of all ages and circumstances \u2013 children and adults, Kemp said. Charges will be on a sliding scale based on ability to pay or will be billed to Medicaid.\n\nKemp said public health pushed for CHC to get the funding.\n\n\u201cI recall we wrote a letter of support for it,\u201d said Julie Schilling, administrator of the Lee County Health Department. \u201cIt is something we have worked on, recruiting dental staff for Keokuk.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased. This will allow people with managed care organizations to have dental care, to go to dentists who accept Medicaid.\u201d\n\nPeople have had to travel to the dental clinic in West Burlington, but soon will be able to get treatment in Keokuk and not worry about finding transportation.\n\nHHS expects the award and resulting clinical space to impact approximately 3,360 new patients.\n\nThe funding comes from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Community Health Center Fund, which was extended with bipartisan support in the Medicare Access and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa City, is a staunch supporter of community health centers and their work.\n\n\u201cDoctors in Iowa are second to none in the quality of health care they provide, and community health centers play a vital role in providing access to care,\u201d he said. \u201cThese funds will help the health professionals at Community Health Centers of Southeastern Iowa expand while continuing to offer the highest quality of care. I am excited to see the new clinic that will be built using this investment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Gate City, Keokuk, Iowa", "description": "The Keokuk area will have better access to dental care soon, said Ron Kemp, CEO of Community Health Centers of Southeastern Iowa.", "title": "$1M federal tooth fairy grant to build Keokuk dental center", "url": "http://www.dailygate.com/article_94efe30a-13a1-11e6-90b8-27a8677bc04f.html", "image": {"width": 566, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/dailygate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/42/042f462a-13a2-11e6-b17d-e3173a25ebc0/572cbcfe5321a.image.jpg?resize=566%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DailyGateCity", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Keokuk area will have better access to dental care soon, said Ron Kemp, CEO of Community Health Centers of Southeastern Iowa.", "fb": {"app_id": 176402672418420}, "keywords": "featured", "news_keywords": "featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7d4\"", "article_summary": "U.S. Rep.
