The recall petition was submitted by Randy Stagner, Francis O. McCargar and Jimmy McCargar, according to Parsell.\n\nFrancis McCargar worked at the sheriff\u2019s office for more than 19 years, serving as a lieutenant where he oversaw Maketa when he was a deputy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to definitely get out there and get some petitions signed,\u201d McCargar said. \u201cI believe that the people of El Paso County deserve better than that for sheriff.\u201d\n\nMaketa, who is term-limited, has roughly seven months left in his term.\n\nEfforts to reach the sheriff were unsuccessful.\n\nThe petition comes a day after Maketa\u2019s wife, who has stayed out of the public eye since the scandal erupted, rallied with other supporters, holding a sign that read \u201cCitizens for Terry.\u201d\n\nVicki Maketa, who has been married to the sheriff nearly 28 years, gathered with supporters, including the sheriff\u2019s brother, in front of the sheriff\u2019s office for the rally. Tiffany Huntz, a sheriff\u2019s office dispatch employee who is accused of having an affair with the sheriff, came out of the office and gave his wife a hug.\n\nAlthough Vicki Maketa spoke to other media, she refused to speak to The Gazette, which reported the original story about the allegations, saying, \u201cYou\u2019d better get away from me.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook page \u201cCitizens for Sheriff Terry Maketa,\u201d launched less than a week ago, has a June 7 post attributed to Vicki Maketa, in which she said her husband \u201cmade a terrible mistake during a rough patch in our marriage 5 years ago.\u201d It was during that time text messages from Maketa suggest he was having sex with a woman he promoted.\n\nDavid Philipps of The Gazette contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Group gains petition approval to recall Sheriff Terry Maketa", "title": "Group gains petition approval to recall Sheriff Terry Maketa", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/group-gains-petition-approval-to-recall-sheriff-terry-maketa/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140606__maketap1.jpg", "height": 516}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140606__maketap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T16:12:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:49:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe52e5\"", "article_summary": "COLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 A group seeking to oust embattled El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa from office gained approval for a petition to seek his recall Friday.\nThe recall petition was submitted by Randy Stagner, Francis O.
