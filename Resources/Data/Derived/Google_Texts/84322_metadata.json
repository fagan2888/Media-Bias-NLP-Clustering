Sarah Copeland-Hanzas, D-Bradford, vice chair of the committee said the proposed statute would help the public understand \u201chow our health care system works.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of principle we want to ensure our health care dollars go toward the actual provision of care,\u201d Copeland-Hanzas said.\n\nSpending on pharmaceuticals has grown dramatically in Vermont, said Copeland-Hanzas, even as the overall growth in health care spending has slowed.\n\n\u201cWe just need to get a handle on how much of our pharmaceutical spending actually is going to provision of care versus administrative overhead,\u201d she said.\n\nThat overhead includes marketing, administrative fees and, ultimately, corporate profits for the benefits managers, who act as third-party administrators for prescription drug programs.\n\nThe amendment, submitted by committee chairman Rep. Mike Fisher, D-Lincoln, would require pharmacy benefit managers to report the percentage or dollar amount they pocket on each claim charged to an insurer in addition to what is paid to pharmacies for filling and dispensing prescriptions.\n\nIt would also require the benefits managers to report an aggregate dollar amount they make for all claims to health insurers. Both would be required for companies to hold contracts in Vermont.\n\nA recent analysis of Vermont\u2019s health care spending by the Green Mountain Care Board shows that 12 percent \u2013 or $629 million \u2013 of the state\u2019s $5.2 billion in health care costs went toward prescription drugs and nondurable medical goods that require a prescription.\n\nVermonters paid $135 million in out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and supplies in 2012.\n\nThat\u2019s the second-largest out-of-pocket health care expense for residents, surpassed only by spending at hospitals, which totaled $170 million in 2012, the most recent year for which the Green Mountain Care Board has data.\n\nThe board\u2019s spending analysis shows that overall health care spending rose $142 million, or 2.7 percent, from 2011 to 2012. Prescription drug spending accounted for 16 percent of that growth at $23 million.\n\nRoughly 65 percent of the growth in prescription drug spending was borne by the private sector, the analysis shows.\n\nSt. Louis-based Express Scripts is the pharmacy benefit manager for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state\u2019s largest health care insurer and the third-party administrator for the Vermont State Employees Association\u2019s health plan.\n\nExpress Scripts, one of the largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country, reported $27.4 billion in revenue for the last quarter of 2013, according to the St. Louis Business Journal, and netted $1.3 billion in profits in 2012.\n\nRhode Island-based CVS Caremark, another of the largest pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S., reported $32.8 billion in revenue last quarter, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nExpress Scripts and CVS Caremark are numbers 24 and 13, respectively, on CNN Money\u2019s Fortune 500 list.\n\n\u201cAre they making too much money?\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but this is about transparency.\u201d\n\nLobbyists for both companies expressed concern about the proposals and said their clients oppose the amendments.\n\n\u201cTransparency takes time \u2026 and in this business the more time you spend doing those administrative tasks, the more money it costs the insurer,\u201d said CVS Caremark lobbyist Will Smith with the Northfield firm Miller and Smith.\n\nSmith\u2019s firm received $20,000 in lobbying fees from CVS Caremark during the most recent reporting period, which ended Jan. 25, according to lobbying reports filed with the Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\n\nExpress Scripts paid Montpelier lobbying firm KSE Partners $20,000 during that same reporting period. KSE lobbyist Chuck Storrow said his client had deferred comment to Express Scripts\u2019 corporate communications office.\n\nA spokesman for Express Scripts characterized the transparency amendments as onerous and anti-competitive.\n\nWithout guarantees of confidentiality, the reporting called for in Fisher\u2019s proposal could expose proprietary information on a the company\u2019s profits to its competitors, said David Whitrap, director of communications.\n\n\u201cIf a (insurance) plan wants certain financial information disclosed, they can negotiate it into the terms of their contract,\u201d Whitrap said. \u201cThis legislation would ultimately stifle competition among PBMs.\u201d\n\nCVS Caremark does not have any current contracts in Vermont, but they have had contracts here in the past and are likely to again in the future, Smith said. He urged lawmakers not to go forward with the transparency amendment on their behalf.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont received a bid for benefits management from a company that built in transparency measures, and it came in $3.5 million over Express Scripts\u2019 winning bid, Smith said.\n\nBCBS is going to release a proposal request this summer for another three-year contract, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you are to build this language in, you would see what that would cost,\u201d Smith warned.\n\nHe said that if the state passes the amendment it should consider adding language that would make it apply to contracts entered into after the law takes effect.\n\nThe Senate-passed version of the health care reform bill contains a provision calling for a study and report on Vermont acting as its own pharmacy benefits manager for Green Mountain Care, the state\u2019s planned universal health care program.\n\n\u201cFrom the testimony I\u2019ve heard, I don\u2019t think it makes sense for us to be our own pharmacy benefit manager,\u201d Copeland-Hanzas said.\n\nLarge pharmacy benefits managers, such as CVS Caremark and Express Scripts, use their purchasing power to negotiate affordable rates for bulk purchases from the major drug manufacturers.\n\nEven if all 620,000 Vermonters were in the same risk pool \u2013 which is unlikely to happen because there are populations that will get their primary coverage elsewhere \u2013 the state wouldn\u2019t have nearly the leverage to negotiate fair prices with drug makers, she said.\n\nCopeland-Hanzas has pushed for greater regulation of pharmacy benefits managers in the past, working to pass legislation last session that restricted auditing practices by large pharmacy benefit managers that were hurting Vermont\u2019s small pharmacies.\n\nShe\u2019s introduced additional amendments to the health care bill that would require pharmacy benefits managers to furnish pharmacists with the maximum allowable costs for the prescriptions they cover and prevent the companies from imposing higher copayments than are included in the insured\u2019s health plan.\n\nIn addition, the amendments would require pharmacy benefits managers to pay out claims within two weeks. That provision is to protect small pharmacists from long waits for compensation that can hurt their profit margins.\n\nVermont needs to look out for the small Main Street pharmacist that is working hard to keep its doors open and serving its customers, Copeland-Hanzas said.\n\nSmith said the two-week provision was the only proposal CVS Caremark finds palatable and suggested they would not oppose that language.\n\nWhitrap, the Express Scripts spokesman, however, said a two-week turnaround is unrealistic, when the national norm is closer to 30-60 days.\n\nHe suggested that the 14-day window would ultimately require companies to drive up prices for Vermonters.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "blue cross blue shield, vermont legislature, vermont state employees association, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "The proposal would require pharmacy benefits managers to report an aggregate dollar amount they pocket for all claims to health insurers.", "title": "House lawmakers look to take on prescription drug companies in push for transparency | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110519_prescriptionDrugs.jpg", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2014/04/13/house-lawmakers-look-take-prescription-drug-companies-push-transparency/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The proposal would require pharmacy benefits managers to report an aggregate dollar amount they pocket for all claims to health insurers.", "creator": "@true_morgan", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110519_prescriptionDrugs.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "title": "House lawmakers look to take on prescription drug companies in push for transparency | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "CVS Caremark, Vermont Legislature, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Express Scripts, Vermont State Employees Association", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont State Employees Association", "published_time": "2014-04-13T11:17:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0130\"", "article_summary": "The board\u2019s spending analysis shows that overall health care spending rose $142 million, or 2.7 percent, from 2011 to 2012.\nThat overhead includes marketing, administrative fees and, ultimately, corporate profits for the benefits managers, who act as third-party administrators for prescription drug programs.\nIn addition, the amendments would require pharmacy benefits managers to pay out claims within two weeks.\nSpending on pharmaceuticals has grown dramatically in Vermont, said Copeland-Hanzas, even as the overall growth in health care spending has slowed.\nProposed amendments to an omnibus health care reform bill under consideration in the House Health Care Committee would require pharmacy benefits management companies to disclose how much of the money they charge stays in their pockets."}
