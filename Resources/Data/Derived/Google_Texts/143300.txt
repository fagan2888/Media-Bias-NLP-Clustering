An illegal marijuana-growing operation was discovered and subsequently destroyed in Eagle County earlier this month.

Jessie Mosher, a spokeswoman for the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, said a hunter happened upon the grow and reported it to authorities on Oct. 1.

Deputies found about 1,000 marijuana plants and an elaborate irrigation system near mile marker 14 on Cottonwood Pass Road in unincorporated Eagle County. There was also a nearby campsite.

Investigators did surveillance of the area, but didn’t find any suspects. They continue to investigate.

Last month, hunters discovered an illegal growing operation worth as much as $8 million in the White River National Forest north of Aspen. In that case, hunters smelled the operation, and reported it to authorities, who destroyed the 2,600-plus mature plants.
