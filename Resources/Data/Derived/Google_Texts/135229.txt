You’ll be sure to want to catch the NBC Nightly News tonight; apparently the HealthCare.gov site is plagued with some serious technical problems that go way beyond “glitches,” and people are having trouble signing up after 10 days, let alone 10 minutes. No, really.

We're looking at the ObamaCare computer glitches on @nbcnightlynews – tech experts say the problems are very serious, few ppl able to enroll — Tom Costello (@tomcostellonbc) October 10, 2013

?! QUICK, someone take a pic, screen grab, anything. RT @tomcostellonbc We're looking at the #ObamaCare computer glitches on @nbcnightlynews — Brandon (@Brand_Allen) October 10, 2013

@tomcostellonbc @jimgeraghty @nbcnightlynews At that point it isn't a glitch right? This seems to be a total design error. — Ben (@BenK84) October 10, 2013

@tomcostellonbc Are you going to mention it cost taxpayers $634 million and they had 3 years to get it right?@jimgeraghty @nbcnightlynews — Chelie in TX (@ChelieinTX) October 10, 2013

MSNBC was among the first networks to run up against these glitches, with a reporter giving up in frustration during a live-on-air demonstration. Trying to sign up has become a recurring segment on “Hannity.” And Twitchy has compiled hundreds of tweets from citizens who can’t log in successfully, like these folks.

@tomcostellonbc @nbcnightlynews I have tried every day since last Wednesday and get same error message. Account can't be set up–Florida — Katie Healy (@khealy8834) October 10, 2013

@tomcostellonbc @nbcnightlynews Ask them to fix the "success url" bug. That's the latest hurdle I'm stuck behind. #Obamacare — Jenny P (@jennyinDC) October 10, 2013

Ah yes, the completely blank “success page” glitch. If there’s a better metaphor for the success of Obamacare, we can’t imagine it.
