America's Most Wanted

Roxann "Roxi" Tolson went missing in Post Falls eight years ago. Now, a retired FBI agent in Coeur d'Alene is reinvigorating the search for the 47-year-old woman.



Eight years ago Roxann "Roxi" Tolson went missing from a duplex in Post Falls. The 47-year-old mother, with a history of mental illness, disappeared under suspicious circumstances on Aug. 14, 2005. According to press reports, her husband, Bill, and his son, Larry, were arrested in 2006 on charges of possessing a controlled substance for filling Roxann's prescriptions.

Now, according to this morning's Coeur d'Alene Press, the case of Roxi Tolson is being pursued by retired FBI agent Diane Drake, who worked for the agency's Coeur d'Alene office.

"I want her found. I feel strongly that we should keep looking for her," the Pressquoted Drake.

In an initial interview with police, Bill Tolson said his wife told him to go to a Goodwill Industries store, but when he returned, she was gone. That was the last time Tolson cooperated with police, and Bill—who now lives in Washington state—remains a person of interest in the case, according to Post Falls police.

The Press reports that Roxi Tolson is described as 5-foot-2-inches tall, 110 pounds and has brown eyes and brown hair with blonde highlights. She has not filled her prescriptions since she went missing, according to police. America's Most Wanted adds that she may be going by the last names Baker, Lamonte and/or Luper.
