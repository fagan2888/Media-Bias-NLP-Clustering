Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u201cwith something terrific.\u201d\n\nWhat to do with an estimated 11 million immigrants currently living in the country illegally? \u201cWe\u2019re going to have plenty of time to talk about it,\u201d he told reporters during a recent trip to the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nAs Trump pushes ahead with an establishment-bucking campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, the real estate developer and former reality TV star\u2019s decidedly unconventional approach to politics includes forgoing \u2014 so far \u2014 any substantive discussion of public policy.\n\nIdentifying problems and presenting preferred solutions is usually standard operating procedure for candidates for office at any level, perhaps none more so than president. Developing policy is a key role of campaign staff, and the resulting work is touted in speeches and rollouts designed to win headlines and voters alike.\n\nMost of the other candidates for president in 2016 have records of public service, having cast votes as lawmakers or executed policy as governors. Those who lack such time in office, such as retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have still staked out clear positions on issues that include health care and managing the economy.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign website provides a detailed account of his many real estate holdings and successful television show, but has no mention what he would seek to accomplish if elected president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to release some policy positions here in the near future,\u201d campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told The Associated Press. \u201cMr. Trump has looked at them and has decided that he\u2019s ready to release some of them.\u201d\n\nBut Lewandowski won\u2019t say when that might happen, other than \u201cin the very near future.\u201d He declined to discuss the policy areas Trump would address, adding, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nThat leaves only Trump\u2019s comments as a candidate and his many books as a preview of what\u2019s to come. They suggest his approach will largely be about setting broad-based goals, with little to no roadmap for reaching them, and he may lack consistency in both approach and ideology.\n\nOn his early calling-card issue of immigration, for example, Trump has advocated for the building of an impenetrable wall across the length of the border with Mexico. He insists he will force the Mexican government to pay for its construction, but won\u2019t say how he\u2019ll accomplish such a feat of diplomacy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said that they\u2019re going to pay for the wall, and they will pay for the wall,\u201d he recently told Fox News when pressed for details.\n\nAfter refusing to answer questions about what he would do with the millions of people already in the country illegally, Trump recently said during an interview he would deport them all, sort them into groups of \u201cgood ones\u201d and \u201cbad ones,\u201d and then allow those deemed good to re-enter the country via an \u201cexpedited\u201d process.\n\nHe and his campaign staff, however, have not yet outlined details such as how a Trump administration would locate those individuals, the criteria for determining good and bad, and how much the plan would cost.\n\n\u201cThe idea of large-scale deportations followed by selective re-admissions doesn\u2019t seem like a well-developed approach,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the Immigration Policy Program at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. \u201cAre you going to go knocking on doors and checking IDs? What is that going to look like?\u201d\n\nThe lack of specificity, and Trump\u2019s shifting positions over time, also make it hard to predict what his approach might be to an issue of passionate importance to many Republican voters: the fate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump said the U.S. needed universal health care and pointed to Canada\u2019s single-payer system as a shining example. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative on most issues, but a liberal on this one,\u201d he wrote. A decade later, in 2011\u2019s \u201cTime to Get Tough,\u201d Trump eviscerated what he now termed \u201csocialized health care\u201d as a jobs and business killer.\n\nNone of this concerns Trump\u2019s most faithful supporters, who dismiss concerns about his lack of policy specifics or the changes in his ideology over time.\n\nMichael Dunbar, who launched a \u201cDraft Trump\u201d campaign in 1987, said in an interview that he had no idea at that time what platform Trump would run on \u2014 or even what party he was registered with.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much policy positions,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe my sense was that he could just make it happen.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jeff Horwitz in Washington and Thomas Beaumont in Iowa contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2014 Donald Trump's position on health care?
