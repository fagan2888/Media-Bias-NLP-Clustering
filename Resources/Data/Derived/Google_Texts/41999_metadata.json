But what if he did? And what about the concussion risks of other sports?\n\nHappily, our regular CommonHealth contributors, Drs. Gene Beresin and Steven Schlozman, Massachusetts General Hospital child psychiatrists and excellent mental health communicators, have just created their first \u201cWhat\u2019s On Your Mind?\u201d podcast. And their five-minute conversation addresses this very topic: Should my kid play contact sports? The podcast series is part of their public outreach mission at the new Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds.\n\nListen to the full podcast here. How often do you get to hear one psychiatrist call another \u201ca shrimp\u201d? But mainly, the information comes from solid sources \u2014 the CDC, concussion experts \u2014 and the upshot is clear: Kids shouldn\u2019t start contact sports until age 14, according to the latest recommendations, because neck muscles get much stronger in adolescence and that helps protect the brain from impact. And the biggest takeaway: If a child take a significant head hit \u2014 if he \u201cgets his bell rung,\u201d as Dr. Schlozman\u2019s football coach used to put it \u2014 he should be sure to sit out at least the rest of the game. Every concussion raises the risk for another concussion. When can he get back in? \u201cLeave it up to their physician,\u201d Dr. Schlozman says.\n\nBut all these new findings and warnings about concussions do not mean kids should avoid sports altogether. \u201cThey\u2019re a huge part of growing up,\u201d says Dr. Schlozman, who, at age 12, wandered over and sat on the opposing team\u2019s bench after his own bell had been rung. \u201cAnd as long as we\u2019re careful, there\u2019s no reason not to have fun.\u201d\n\nFrom the blog post that accompanies the podcast:\n\nThat brings us back to the magic age 14 as a cut-off. Contrary to what most people think, 14 isn\u2019t set aside for any major reason other than the fact that it\u2019s the age where most boys have at least begun puberty. This is the recommendation of Dr. Cantu and Mark Hyman in their book, Concussions and Our Kids: America\u2019s Leading Expert on How to Protect Young Athletes and Keep Sports Safe. In fact, the authors even suggest ignoring the age, and looking instead for signs of puberty in the child. That\u2019s because puberty correlates strongly with having a stronger neck, and the stronger the neck, the less sloshing around your brain does when you take a hard hit. The neck absorbs the blow, and the brain stays steadier; the end result is protection against concussion. Think of this in evolutionary terms: we\u2019re born with huge heads relative to other species\u2014that\u2019s because of our huge brains. However, our bodies tend to catch up to those heads around the onset of biological adolescence. Hence, 14 is the arbitrary cut-off, but it is based on the fact that most 14-year-old bodies can handle the brain that sits on top of them. All of this brings us back to the initial controversy. What do you do if your child \u201cgets her bell rung\u201d in soccer or takes \u201ca hard hit\u201d to the head in football? Here\u2019s what the CDC has advised: it\u2019s better to miss a game than a whole season. That is, in fact, the key message of a campaign by the CDC aimed at sports-related concussions. The CDC notes that the short-term effects of a concussion can generate additional problems that may plague a person throughout life. When young athletes have a flawed memory, they can have difficulty concentrating in school, relating to other kids, or sleeping well, and these problems therefore have long-term, devastating consequences. Right now, as we wander through the gray zone of unclear official recommendations, the biggest danger occurs when athletes go back to the game before they fully recover from a concussion. In such a case, even a mild blow can cause second-impact syndrome, which can lead to brain swelling, brain damage, and even death. This is, of course, quite rare\u2014high school football players aren\u2019t dying in droves. But why take the risk?\n\nParents, what are you seeing?
