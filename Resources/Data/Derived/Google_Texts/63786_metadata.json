Democrats do it again in 11 days.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTRUMP LAWSUIT THREAT BACKFIRES: POLITICO\u2019s Isaac Arnsdorf reports: DONALD TRUMP's threats to sue just sparked a bigger legal fight. Charlie Spies, the Republican campaign-finance whiz who counsels PACs supporting JEB BUSH, is alleging that Trump illegally mixed business and politics when his corporate attorney warned the billionaire's opponents that attack ads could trigger defamation lawsuits. The claim comes in a complaint filed Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission that was obtained exclusively by POLITICO.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, FedEx'ed bombastic cease-and-desist letters on company letterhead to the Club for Growth, the Right to Rise leadership PAC, and Mike Fernandez, one of Bush's biggest donors. Spies is alleging that Trump crossed a line by using corporate resources to do his campaign's \"dirty work.\"\n\nIn a snarky return salvo, Spies quipped about Trump's bankruptcies, reality show fame, plan to build a wall on the Mexican border and past donations to Democrats. He also questioned Garten's grasp of election law, noting that he addressed his threat to the Right to Rise leadership PAC, which contributes to candidates but doesn't make ads, instead of the well-funded super PAC by the same name.\n\nSpies called on the FEC to investigate immediately and to make a referral to the Justice Department. A Trump campaign spokeswoman didn't immediately answer a request for comment. Read more at POLITICO http://politi.co/1QfUw08\n\nHappy Wednesday evening, here\u2019s your 2016 Blast. Henry C.

BERNIE SANDERS lights up Google\u2019s algorithms. DONALD TRUMP gives the Hill heartburn. TED CRUZ consolidates evangelicals, MARCO RUBIO has some Iowa issues, JEB BUSH offers a guarantee and MIKE HUCKABEE makes a credulous claim about his rap skills.\n\nTHE DAILY CLINTON\n\nAVERTING INVERTING: The Wall Street Journal: HILLARY CLINTON on Wednesday rolled out a plan that promises \u201cto use executive authority, if needed, to crack down on corporate maneuvers that shift profits out of the U.S. Her aim ... is to punish companies that engage in what\u2019s known as 'earnings stripping,' a common tactic by companies after they move their tax addresses outside the U.S. through so-called inversions. These tax benefits aren\u2019t available to U.S.-based companies.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1luWkpv\n\nA PLAN: She chose to roll out in \u2026 Iowa, naturally.\n\nMINER PROBLEM: The Associated Press: \u201cAs secretary of state, HILLARY CLINTON intervened in a request forwarded by her son-in-law on behalf of a deep-sea mining firm to meet with her or other State Department officials after one of the firm's investors asked Chelsea Clinton's husband for help setting up such contacts, according to the most recently released Clinton emails. The lobbying effort on behalf of Neptune Minerals Inc. came while Clinton \u2014 now the leading Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 was advocating for an Obama administration push to win Senate approval for a sweeping Law of the Sea Treaty.\u201d http://fxn.ws/1NUP2rl\n\nTAKE THE QUIZ: Building on an effort to tie Republicans to DONALD TRUMP, HillaryClinton.com is running a \u201cTrump or Not\u201d quiz that challenges visitors to determine whether it\u2019s something the Republican front-runner or one of the other GOP contenders said: http://bit.ly/1QwsyLZ\n\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\n\nGOOGLE BERNS: The Washington Post looks at how Google subtly steers you toward BERNIE SANDERS. \u201c[L]ike any information source, Google's algorithm-driven search results aren't 100 percent neutral. Its search engine produces more favorable results for some candidates than others, new research has found.\u201d http://wapo.st/1lOZd3K\n\nHOLLYWOOD MARVEL: Fox looks at BERNIE SANDERS' celebrity appeal and notes that while \u201cHILLARY CLINTON is extremely popular in Hollywood, having raised millions of dollars and been invited to the homes of Christina Aguilera, Tobey Maguire and Barbra Streisand ... another group of A-listers including Will Ferrell, Danny DeVito and Mark Ruffalo are backing her rival, Vermont Senator BERNIE SANDERS.\u201d http://fxn.ws/1Y2O9MO\n\nTRUMP ON THE STUMP\n\nWHAT A DRAG: POLITICO\u2019s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer report Republicans on the Hill fret that DONALD TRUMP could undo years of hard won gains in the House and Senate. \u201cWith the Iowa caucuses just 55 days away, Republicans are beginning to see Trump as a dire threat to their majorities on Capitol Hill. And they\u2019re warning that the GOP poll leader, who this week called for a ban on Muslims entering the country, will cause irreparable harm to the party. From vulnerable senators to top party officials, the fear is palpable and bursting into public view.\u201d http://politi.co/1NGC3rk\n\nGLOBAL LEADER: The New York Times looks at global reaction to DONALD TRUMP\u2019s call to stop Muslims from entering the United States, which included, \u201ca mix of befuddlement and despair. How is it, many wondered, that the same nation that twice put the black son of a Kenyan in the White House could now be flirting with Mr. Trump and his divisive, exclusionary stances?\u201d http://nyti.ms/1lPEaOw\n\nBIBI MEETING: POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass reports DONALD TRUMP will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Israel later this month. http://politi.co/1U3fs9m\n\n\u2018WILL. NEVER. LEAVE.\u2019: In an interview from earlier this month with The Washington Post, DONALD TRUMP pledges not to get out of the presidential race, no matter the circumstances. \u201cAre you ready? [He waves one arm over his head, as if to clear away everything and remove all doubt.] I. Will. Never. Leave. This. Race.\u201d http://wapo.st/1READiO\n\nCONSERVATIVE TREPIDATION: Washington Post looks at conservatives who have generally praised DONALD TRUMP \u2014 but seem to be dancing around him now that he has proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. \u201cThey've call him 'the leader' on immigration. They've said he adds 'immeasurably' to GOP debates. They've drawn parallels between Trump and their own campaigns. But after DONALD TRUMP suggested temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States, some of Washington's most conservative lawmakers who had previously expressed support for the GOP front-runner are saying something else: Absolutely nothing.\u201d http://wapo.st/1XWPiL6\n\n** A message from Qualcomm: The car of the future will be full of exciting and useful technology.

Tim Scott said of the Texas senator\u2019s organization, going on to add, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to help my friends who are serving with me, but the truth is the truth. He\u2019s done a really good job laying the foundation for a really long time.\u201d\n\nREAGAN-ESQUE?: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports: \u201cRichard A. Viguerie is endorsing Ted Cruz for president and asks other conservatives why they haven\u2019t yet. \u2018To conservatives who continue to window shop I say, 'What are you waiting for? In TED CRUZ conservatives have a candidate that\u2019s everything we want,\u2019 the Conservative Headquarters chairman said ... the Texas senator is the \u2018best presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1U4oPFP\n\nBLURRED LINES: The Wall Street Journal: \u201cA Wednesday fundraising luncheon for Republican presidential hopeful TED CRUZ\u2019s campaign will have an unusual co-host: the head of a super PAC backing the Texas senator \u2026 Kellyanne Conway, a Republican strategist who is heading Keep the Promise I \u2014 one of four super PACs backing Mr. Cruz. Ms. Conway\u2019s husband is also a co-host.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1PZn8L2\n\nRUBIO\u2019S RACE\n\nIOWA DIVIDE: National Review: Looks at MARCO RUBIO\u2019s early state problems. \u201cIn a place where retail politicking remains paramount, conservative and evangelical leaders are complaining that the Florida senator hasn\u2019t given them enough attention since launching his White House campaign. While he has begun to attend their events and engage with their constituents, they say his team has not followed up to deepen relationships or organize additional meetings with them. Establishment Republicans, meanwhile, have the same concerns about Rubio\u2019s organization, but worry that Rubio is flirting too aggressively with Iowa\u2019s social conservatives.\u201d http://bit.ly/1QfyfPV\n\nOOF: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like he really wants to win Iowa,\u201d says Craig Robinson, the state party\u2019s former executive director, who is now editor of The Iowa Republican. \u201cOf all the campaigns, he\u2019s probably done the least of getting around the state.\u201d\n\nCOMMONWEALTH ELIGIBLE: Washington Post: \u201cWith the filing deadline looming, Sen. MARCO RUBIO of Florida on Wednesday will become the last major GOP presidential contender to submit signatures to qualify for the Virginia ballot. Rubio will submit more than 9,300 signatures \u2014 far more than the 5,000 necessary and all of them collected by volunteer signature gatherers, according to his campaign.\u201d http://wapo.st/1XWzHLv\n\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\n\nFEDERALIZED: Washington Times: JEB BUSH \u201con Wednesday rolled out his plan to shift more power from Washington back to the states \u2026 'The federal government is amassing power at the states\u2019 expense, despite the fact that state leaders are closer to the schools our children attend, the hospitals that care for our sick and the water we drink. HILLARY CLINTON is offering more of the same,' the former Florida governor said in an op-ed article published on the Fox News website. 'As a former governor, I know that many problems, even some that are of national scope, do not call for federal solutions.'\" http://bit.ly/1OTry2V\n\nRIGHT CALL: Bloomberg: In an interview, JOE BIDEN says of his decision to take a pass on the 2016 race, \u201cMy decision, I know, was the right decision.\u201d He said he \u201cbelieved I could win, but that\u2019s not enough.\u201d http://politi.co/1NiP3zL\n\nPAGING POLITIFACT: In People\u2019s new 2016 focused spread, MIKE HUCKABEE offers this when asked his secret talent: \u201cI'm a gifted rap artist \u2026 and I make amazing chili with deer that I kill.\u201d Another take away: Most of the presidential candidates eat some form of egg for breakfast; CHRIS CHRISTIE tends to skip it. http://bit.ly/1NVGXTh\n\nCARSON CARE: Time: BEN CARSON \u201creleased a brief health care plan Wednesday, which promises to allow people to return to their pre-Affordable Care Act plans, constrains Medicare, and moves Medicaid from the federal government to the states. The plan hinges on repealing Obamacare and creating individual health care accounts for each citizen at birth. The value of those accounts could accumulate over time and be transferred to others as if they were checking accounts.\u201d http://ti.me/1OTRgnX\n\nRUSSIA BRAG: BuzzFeed: JOHN KASICH said he would have no problem shooting down a Russian jet if it violated a no-fly zone in Syria. \u201cI\u2019d create a no-fly zone, is what I would do, and I would provide sanctuaries and have people that want to be there be protected. I think in that case you should probably get the Kurds to protect them,\u201d said Kasich on FM NewsTalk 97.1. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would do.\u201d http://bzfd.it/1ORdNDJ\n\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\n\nHILLARY CLINTON raises money in New York.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS is in Washington.\n\nMARCO RUBIO campaigns in Iowa.\n\nDONALD TRUMP has a rally in New Hampshire.\n\nJOHN KASICH and CARLY FIORINA hit New Hampshire, too.\n\nTHE DAILY NUMBER\n\n63. That\u2019s the percentage of Hispanic voters who say they\u2019re still open to voting for a Republican candidate \u2014 hope for the GOP and perhaps a warning sign for HILLARY CLINTON. http://politi.co/1ORe3Cy\n\nFOLLOW @POLITICO\u2019S politics team: @PoliticoCharlie, @POLITICO_Steve, @PoliticoAlex, @anniekarini, @GlennThrush, @EliStokols, @katieglueck, @shreckreports, @gdebenedetti, @Hadas_Gold, @ec_schneider, @kyledcheney , @theodoricmeyer, @MarcACaputo, @PoliticoKevin,@mikeallen, @dlippman, @Danielstrauss4, @henrycjjackson , @shanegoldmacher,@KristinPolitico, @PoliticoScott\n\n** A message from Qualcomm: When will the future arrive?
