BOSTON (AP) â€” The editorial board of The Boston Globe is using a satirical front page to express its uneasiness with a potential Donald Trump presidency.

The newspaper has printed a satirical front page for its Sunday "Ideas" section. The page is dated April 9, 2017, and features a large photo of Trump below dominant headline that reads "Deportations to Begin." The accompanying story has Trump calling on Congress to fund a deportation program amid protests.

Another article focuses on a plunging stock market. Some jokes are included, such as a mention of Yellowstone National Park being renamed for Trump.

In an editorial (http://bit.ly/20qYqoH ), the Globe calls the satire "an exercise in taking a man at his word."

The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
