But if they believe they\u2019ve signed up for a plan but their 834 is a garbled mess \u2014 or, even worse, clear but wrong \u2014 it could mean chaos when they actually go to use their health insurance. For that reason, inside the health-care industry, the 834 problems are the glitch that is causing the most concern.\n\nThe problems appear to have persisted even as the website itself has gotten much easier to use for consumers. The Post reported earlier this week:\n\nThe errors cumulatively have affected roughly one-third of the people who have signed up for health plans since Oct. 1, according to two government and health-care industry officials. The White House disputed the figure but declined to provide its own. The mistakes include failure to notify insurers about new customers, duplicate enrollments or cancellation notices for the same person, incorrect information about family members, and mistakes involving federal subsidies. The errors have been accumulating since HealthCare.gov opened two months ago, even as the Obama administration has been working to make it easier for consumers to sign up for coverage, the government and industry officials said.\n\nAdministration officials say the Post is wrong, but haven\u2019t been willing to provide correct figures.\n\nThe New York Times has similarly reported on the problems:\n\nThe issues are vexing and complex. Some insurers say they have been deluged with phone calls from people who believe they have signed up for a particular health plan, only to find that the company has no record of the enrollment. Others say information they received about new enrollees was inaccurate or incomplete, so they had to track down additional data \u2014 a laborious task that will not be feasible if data is missing for tens of thousands of consumers.\n\nThe Times has a graphic showing all the ways enrollment can go wrong.\n\nLate yesterday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and two insurance trade groups issued a statement saying they are working on the problem and pledged to report publicly on their progress.\n\nBut the issue has proved contentious, dominating daily media calls CMS is holding. Some tweets yesterday conveyed the frustration:\n\nWorking theory: CMS evasion about 834 errors an elaborate ploy to build camaraderie among health policy journos. \u2014 Adrianna McIntyre (@onceuponA) December 4, 2013\n\nNext time a reporter asks for 834 error rate, CMS spox will respond, \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid!\" \u2014 Philip Klein (@philipaklein) December 4, 2013\n\nBREAKING but not really: #CMS won't say how many \"834\" transmissions they've sent to insurers or what proportion had errors. #obamacare \u2014 Alex Wayne (@aawayne) December 4, 2013\n\nTwo reporters - @aawayne from Bloomberg and @louiseradnofsky at WSJ - asked for the 834 error rate today. No answer again. \u2014 Sarah Kliff (@sarahkliff) December 4, 2013\n\nI'm sure this sounds naive, but it really seems like CMS would actually benefit from being transparent about http://t.co/3A5ZwNpb6s \u2014 Kate Pickert (@katepickert) December 4, 2013\n\nCMS official declines to comment on specific number of 834 transaction errors-no matter how many times or different ways she is asked \u2014 Brianna Ehley (@Briannaehley) December 4, 2013\n\nCMS spox refuses to quantify scope of 834 problems but claims theyre fixed. Says \"insurers now testing fixes to make sure that they agree.\" \u2014 devindwyer (@devindwyer) December 4, 2013\n\nKliff summarized yesterday\u2019s call in a piece for the Post\u2019s Wonkblog:\n\nHealth reporters still want more 834 data. Three reporters, including myself, made another attempt to get information on errors effecting the 834 transmissions, the files the exchange sends to insurance plans when someone signs up for their plan. We know there have been some problems with these transmissions, but don\u2019t have a great sense of how many problems \u2014 or how quickly those problems are getting fixed. \"I can appreciate the frustration,\" [CMS spokeswoman Julie] Bataille told Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Wayne when he brought up the issue. \"We believe the vast majority of the fixes are now in place.\" Louise Radnofsky from The Wall Street Journal followed up, asking for a reason why the error rate would not be shared. \u201cAs I just mentioned, we are actively working with issuers to assess the fixes and validate the numbers,\u201d Bataille said. \"We\u2019ve heard numbers like 80 percent [of the errors were from one bug],\" Radnofsky pressed. \"There must be a number out there.\" \"What we\u2019ve reported on there was that we believed there to be a transaction issue causing those inaccuracies,\" Bataille responded. \"As we validate the assessment of the fixes, we will report on our progress.\" \"So it\u2019s a validation issue?\" Radnofsky asked. Medicare spokesman Richard Olague cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to move on to the next question,\u201d he said.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This post is adapted from Ornstein\u2019s \u201cHealthy buzz\u201d blog.
