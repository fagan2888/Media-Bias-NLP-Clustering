Who knows where those four were headed with all that meth.\n\nArrest records show they claim to be from Arizona, but now they are all in custody at the Oklahoma County Jail.\n\nCourt records show they were driving eastbound along I-40 last week, when an officer with the drug interdiction team noticed them failing to signal as they changed lanes. The officer pulled over the blue Chevy Trailblazer near the Rockwell Ave. exit. But when he started asking questions, things just didn't add up.\n\n\"He started speaking with them, the driver started getting nervous,\" said Mark Myers with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. \"He didn't even have a driver's license.\"\n\nThat officer happened to have a K-9 with him that hit on the car when he started sniffing.\n\n\"After the deputy was able to secure everyone, he went ahead and searched the vehicle,\" said Myers. \"And he did find a pretty large load of methamphetamine.\"\n\nIt was more than 34 pounds to be exact, all wrapped up in 20 plastic bundles.\n\n\"We're just glad he was able to get that off the streets,\" said Myers.\n\nThis seizure is just one of the latest drug busts done by the Central Oklahoma Metro Interdiction Team, or COMIT, which consists of officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and Oklahoma County DA's office.\n\nMyers says these officers specifically look for drug traffickers traveling along the Oklahoma interstates.\n\n\"We see a lot of drug trafficking coming up from the Mexico border, up I-35 north,\" said Myers. \"And then east to west along I-40 that runs from California to the Carolinas. We do see a lot of drugs being transported along those corridors.\"\n\nRight now all four of those people who were arrested are being held on a $25,000 bond, accused of aggregated trafficking. Two of them have a hold with Immigration.\n\nThe Oklahoma County Sheriff's office says the street value of all that meth is about $20,000 a pound, or around $680,000.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "More than 30 pounds of drugs are now off the streets; discovered on an interstate many of us drive every day.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24844164/pounds-of-meth-discovered-during-traffic-stop-4-arrested", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24844164_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More than 30 pounds of drugs are now off the streets; discovered on an interstate many of us drive every day.", "title": "Pounds Of Meth Discovered During Traffic Stop, 4 Arrested"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24844164_SA.jpg", "description": "More than 30 pounds of drugs are now off the streets; discovered on an interstate many of us drive every day.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pounds Of Meth Discovered During Traffic Stop, 4 Arrested"}, "wnreadableurl": "pounds-of-meth-discovered-during-traffic-stop-4-arrested", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/02/27", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,methamphetamine,crime,arrests,traffickling,adrianna iwasinski,kwtv,news9.traffic stop, K9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,methamphetamine,crime,arrests,traffickling,adrianna iwasinski,kwtv,news9.traffic stop, K9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d70\"", "article_summary": "The Oklahoma County Sheriff's office says the street value of all that meth is about $20,000 a pound, or around $680,000.\nArrest records show they claim to be from Arizona, but now they are all in custody at the Oklahoma County Jail.\nThis seizure is just one of the latest drug busts done by the Central Oklahoma Metro Interdiction Team, or COMIT, which consists of officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and Oklahoma County DA's office.\n\"He started speaking with them, the driver started getting nervous,\" said Mark Myers with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office.\nOfficers discovered over 34 pounds of meth, all wrapped up in 20 plastic bundles."}
