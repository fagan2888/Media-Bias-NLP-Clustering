With 17 offers to choose from and a few more pending, Ashley Ridge quarterback Steven Duncan had no shortage of college options.

The 6-5, 230-pound senior made his decision on Saturday, verbally committing to Western Kentucky of Conference USA.

The reason -- Duncan is a quarterback, and Western Kentucky loves to throw the football. The Hilltoppers averaged 374.3 passing yards per game last year, second in the nation in FBS.

“It’s just such a great place to be as a quarterback, a great atmosphere,” said Duncan, who also had offers from Appalachian State, Western Carolina, Towson and Cornell, as well as interest from Yale and Harvard.

“They are one one of the top passing teams in the country, and to be able to sling the ball around 45 times a game is a dream come true.”

Western Kentucky’s coach is former Louisville quarterback Jeff Brohm. Under his tutelage, WKU quarterback Brandon Doughty passed for 4,830 yards and 49 touchdowns, and was named MVP of Conference USA.

At Western Kentucky, Duncan will be able to play against his stepbrother, Vanderbilt tight end Kyle Anderton. The two teams will play each other in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

“That was another big reason,” Duncan said. “Western Kentucky plays big Division I schools all the time. We play Alabama my freshman year, have a three-year deal with Vandy and play Indiana and LSU.”

Duncan threw for 2,589 yards and 29 touchdowns for Ashley Ridge last season, and said he wanted to make his commitment before his senior season.

“I wanted to commit and be able to focus on being the best quarterback, the best teammate and best overall player I can be,” he said. “This is my last year in high school, and I want to try to do great things for this team, be be best teammate I can for these guys.”
