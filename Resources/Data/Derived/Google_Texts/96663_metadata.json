When the government is involved.\n\nAs the proposed End of Life Option Act gallops through the California Legislature like a headless horseman, we should carefully think through the consequences of creating a right for terminally ill people to receive fatal medication for use at a future time.\n\nSupporters of the bill point to Oregon\u2019s 1997 Death with Dignity Act (DWDA) as a model for California, but a close look at Oregon\u2019s data tells a troubling story.\n\nOregon\u2019s Public Health Division says 1,327 people have received DWDA prescriptions since the law was passed, and 859 patients have died from ingesting the drugs.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s population is 10 times that of its neighbor to the north. How many people will obtain these drugs and not take them? What if the drugs are stolen? The proposed law would allow the deadly medication to be delivered to patients by UPS, FedEx or the U.S. Postal Service. If identities can be stolen from tax forms and allergy medicine can be used to make meth, how risky is it to mail out drugs intended to kill people?\n\nBut the greatest risk is not from thieves.\n\nThis is a dangerous time to allow government bureaucrats to implement an aid-in-dying law. The Affordable Care Act has changed everything, and more people than ever have health insurance through the government. In Oregon, 150,000 new enrollees were added to the state\u2019s Medicaid program in 2014, projected to rise to 257,000 in 2016. In California, the numbers are in the millions and the cost is in the billions.\n\nPrior to 2014, Oregon residents with government insurance made up only 35.5 percent of the patients who requested DWDA prescriptions. In 2014, that number jumped to over 60 percent.\n\nCoincidence? Or cost-cutting? Are patients with government insurance receiving more persuasive counseling toward suicide than patients with private insurance?\n\nPerhaps we\u2019re seeing a hint of future coaxing in one recent change to the California bill, softening the disclosure that lethal medicine may not be fast-acting.\n\nThe original bill included language identical to the Oregon law, which requires patients to sign a statement saying they understand that \u201calthough most deaths occur within three hours, my death may take longer and my physician has counseled me about that possibility.\u201d\n\nCalifornia lawmakers replaced the unpleasant \u201cmay take longer\u201d than three hours with \u201cmay not be immediately upon the consumption of the medication.\u201d But Oregon\u2019s grim statistics document that death has taken as long as 104 hours, and six people regained consciousness after taking the drugs.\n\nOregon\u2019s statistics also reveal that concern about pain was cited by less than a third of patients as the reason for seeking aid-in-dying. Over 90 percent cited \u201closing autonomy,\u201d with \u201cless able to engage in activities making life enjoyable\u201d and \u201closs of dignity\u201d mentioned nearly as often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy have lawmakers chosen this moment to legalize fatal drugs instead of expanding treatment for depression or support for assisted living? Is it because Medi-Cal is in financial trouble and a quick death costs less than end-of-life care?\n\nIt\u2019s painful to think of bureaucratic forms and procedures that would matter-of-factly offer suicide as an option to patients still in shock from the news of a devastating diagnosis. For fragile and vulnerable people, the \u201coption\u201d explained in a \u201ccounseling\u201d session could too easily be taken as a recommendation, seen as a responsibility or felt as an obligation.\n\nFor the 30 percent of Californians now on Medi-Cal, the results of the End of Life Option Act could be barbaric. We have to do better. This is not the time to legalize assisted suicide.\n\nSusan Shelley is a San Fernando Valley author, a former television associate producer and twice a Republican candidate for the California Assembly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When is an option not really optional?
