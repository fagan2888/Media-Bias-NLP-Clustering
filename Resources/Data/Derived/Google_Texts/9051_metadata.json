Given our experience with HealthCare.gov, we have determined we need more senior-level focus on implementation and execution,\" White House chief of staffsaid in a statement.\n\nMcDonough hailed Canegallo as always \"the most prepared person in the room\" and said she \"earns the respect and confidence of everyone she works with \u2014 no matter the complexity of the task at hand.\"\n\n\"She will now be in a position to help implement and execute the administration\u2019s priorities across the government,\" McDonough said.\n\nIn her role as an adviser to McDonough, Canegallo \"spearheaded\" ObamaCare implementation efforts, including \"synthesizing technical, operational, and policy work,\" according to a White House aide.\n\nIn addition to healthcare issues, Canegallo's portfolio will include information technology reform and education policies, such as the president's initiative to link all school classrooms and libraries to high-speed internet.\n\nShe'll also oversee national security matters, including the wind-down to the war in Afghanistan, and privacy and technology policy such as changes to National Security Agency surveillance. A White House official said Canegallo would help implement comprehensive immigration reform if legislation passed Congress.\n\nCanegallo is a veteran of the National Security Council staff. Working as an adviser to McDonough, she led an internal task force responding to the disclosures made by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nEarlier in her career, Canegallo was a director in the Defense Policy and Strategy Directorate, responsible for Pentagon reviews of budgets, defense posture and missile defense policy.\n\nShe came to the White House from the Defense Department, where she worked as a governance and budget adviser to the Anbar provincial government in Iraq. Before entering government, she worked for Goldman Sachs & Co as a credit derivatives analyst.\n\nCanegallo's appointment comes days after White House deputy chief of staff Ron Nabors was reassigned to lead a review into the Department of Veterans Affairs's patient policies and procedures. Nabors, who focuses primarily on domestic and economic policy at the White House, was dispatched amid reports that veterans hospitals were keeping secret lists to hide delays in patient care.\n\nOn Friday, White House press secretary Jay Carney described Nabors\u2019s assignment as \"temporary.\"\n\n\"He will be coming back and returning to his responsibilities as deputy chief of staff here when that assignment is finished,\" Carney said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Kristie Canegallo will keep tabs on ObamaCare and a host of other policy issues.", "description": "Kristie Canegallo will keep tabs on ObamaCare and a host of other policy issues.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Justin Sink", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Kristie Canegallo will keep tabs on ObamaCare and a host of other policy issues.", "title": "White House adds new chief of staff position", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/206358-white-house-adds-new-chief-of-staff-position", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/206358-white-house-adds-new-chief-of-staff-position", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-16T15:16-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Denis McDonough,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T15:16:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/206358-white-house-adds-new-chief-of-staff-position", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Kristie Canegallo will keep tabs on ObamaCare and a host of other policy issues.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House adds new chief of staff position"}, "dcterms.title": "White House adds new chief of staff position"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8358\"", "article_summary": "Given our experience with HealthCare.gov, we have determined we need more senior-level focus on implementation and execution,\" White House chief of staffsaid in a statement.\nThe White House is elevating longtime aide Kristie Canegallo to a new position as deputy chief of staff for policy implementation, a role that will include keeping tabs on ObamaCare.\nOn Friday, White House press secretary Jay Carney described Nabors\u2019s assignment as \"temporary.\"\nCanegallo's appointment comes days after White House deputy chief of staff Ron Nabors was reassigned to lead a review into the Department of Veterans Affairs's patient policies and procedures.\nA White House official said Canegallo would help implement comprehensive immigration reform if legislation passed Congress."}
