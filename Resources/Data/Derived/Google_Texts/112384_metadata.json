But her effective coverage date was delayed due to numerous communication problems with Xerox, the company contracted by the exchange to conduct enrollment.\n\nThe delay became a serious problem for Rolain and her family after she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in January 2014.\n\nRolain\u2019s husband Robert has alleged that his late wife\u2019s tumor was treatable when it was discovered but became fatal after his wife was unable to receive medical attention for several months, the Review-Journal reported. (Facebook)\n\nRolain was unable to receive insured care until her coverage started in May, her family has claimed, because of the complications stemming from the enrollment snafu.\n\nRolain\u2019s husband Robert has alleged that his late wife\u2019s tumor was treatable when it was discovered but became fatal after his wife was unable to receive medical attention for several months, the Review-Journal reported.\n\nThe Rolains, along with 150 other Nevada residents who experienced serious problems with enrolling in insurance purchased through Nevada Health Link, ended up suing the state, they disclosed during a press conference last month.

We urge all Nevadans to verify that their insurance is active and in place in light of the many problems that hundreds, if not thousands, of Nevadans have gone through,\u201d Rolain\u2019s lawyers said in a June 19 statement.\n\nMatthew Callister (pictured), with the law firm of Callister, Immerman and Associates, is one of those working on a class-action lawsuit against Xerox, the contractor for Nevada Health Link. (KTNR)\n\nThe board of Nevada Health Link, which has been blasted for poor management of its exchange, voted in May to replace Xerox as its primary contractor.\n\nRepresentatives for Xerox and Nevada Health Link could not be reached for comment.\n\nCalls and emails to the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services, which was charged with implementing the law and helping to create the exchanges, weren\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
