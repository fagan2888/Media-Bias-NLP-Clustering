(AP Photo/Dylan Lovan)\n\nWhile Kentucky\u2019s health-insurance exchange experienced some glitches when it launched Tuesday, it seemed to perform better than many of its peers.\n\nState officials and outside experts attribute the smoother rollout to a variety of factors, including intensive testing of the system, a less-flashy but more-efficient website and strong coordination among state agencies involved in the effort.\n\nAs a result, Kentucky\u2019s exchange, dubbed Kynect, logged solid results in the first day and a half of operation. As of 4:00 p.m. Wednesday, 10,766 applications for health coverage had been initiated, 6,909 had been c\n\nompleted and 2,989 individuals or families had enrolled in new coverage.\n\nTo be sure, the rollout wasn\u2019t glitch-free. On Tuesday morning, the rush of online applicants overwhelmed the system, and users were soon prevented from setting up accounts. They could still browse the site and look at different plan options, but couldn\u2019t file an application.\n\nTechnicians responded by bringing two more servers online and adding processing power to computers. \u201cWe added 50% more horsepower,\u201d said Chris Clark, technology program manager for the exchange. By 3:00 p.m. Tuesday, the website was fully functional again, state officials said.\n\nOverall, though, the Kentucky exchange performed comparatively well. \u201cKentucky seems to have a smoother rollout than some other states,\u201d said Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation. When she visited various exchange websites Tuesday morning, she said, \u201cthe one I got through most easily on to get prices and comparisons was the Kynect site.\u201d\n\nThough Ms. Tolbert said she wasn\u2019t certain why the Kentucky site functioned more effectively, she speculated that one reason could be its somewhat pared-down design. It \u201cdoesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles that other states tried to incorporate,\u201d like interactive features, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very straightforward in allowing consumers to browse plans without first creating an account.\u201d\n\nJoel Ario, a managing director at Manatt Health Solutions and a former Health and Human Services official, cited another potential factor: the grouping of many key state agencies, including the Department for Medicaid Services and the exchange office itself within the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.\n\n\u201cThat may also be a virtue,\u201d Mr. Ario said. \u201cThey know each other well. They\u2019ve worked on a lot of projects together.\u201d\n\nState officials said the cabinet\u2019s technology staff had recent experience setting up other complex systems, such as a prescription-drug monitoring database. They also had some pre-existing systems, including one for document management, that could be folded into the health exchange.\n\nThe state tested Kynect extensively before the launch date, Mr. Clark said. Kentucky was among the first wave of states to test its system in conjunction with the federal data hub in June.\n\nThe trial runs helped identify problems early on. Among them were lengthy delays for the system to process an application for a household with a varied mix of earnings. It would sometimes take minutes for the range of eligibility options to pop up.\n\n\u201cWe spent an enormous amount of time making it more functional,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cNow we\u2019re able to provide [the information] in under 10 seconds.\u201d\n\nEager to sign up for coverage, Kendell Nash said she logged on to Kynect at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday. She and her 9-year-old son have insurance through her husband\u2019s job as a food-service worker, but his contribution is so steep\u2014more than $18,000 a year\u2014that it swallows almost his entire paycheck.\n\nAfter Ms. Nash, a 38-year-old director of a nonprofit organization in Louisville, filled out an application online, the website returned numerous options. They included gold-level and platinum-level plans that would run $575 to $775 a month for all three of them. That would mean savings of roughly $5,000 to $6,000 per year, accounting for coinsurance and other payments, she said.\n\nMs. Nash, whose total household income is about $78,000 a year, said she isn\u2019t sure whether they qualify for a subsidy. While the system said they did, the amount came in at zero\u2014a discrepancy she hopes to work out with a call to Kynect representatives. Given they will save money regardless, the only decisions left for her family to make are what plan to choose and whether her husband will keep his employer coverage or join her and her son buying a policy on the exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been counting down the days\u201d to this moment, Ms. Nash said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "While Kentucky\u2019s health-insurance exchange experienced some glitches, it seemed to perform better than many of its peers.", "title": "Why Kentucky\u2019s Health Exchange Worked Better Than Many Others", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/02/why-kentuckys-health-exchange-worked-better-than-many-others/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Why Kentucky\u2019s Health Exchange Worked Better Than Many Others", "description": "While Kentucky\u2019s health-insurance exchange experienced some glitches, it seemed to perform better than many of its peers.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "While Kentucky\u2019s health-insurance exchange experienced some glitches, it seemed to perform better than many of its peers.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-02T22:58:56-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/02/why-kentuckys-health-exchange-worked-better-than-many-others/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-40893", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "While Kentucky\u2019s health-insurance exchange experienced some glitches, it seemed to perform better than many of its peers.", "title": "Why Kentucky\u2019s Health Exchange Worked Better Than Many Others", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/02/why-kentuckys-health-exchange-worked-better-than-many-others/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-40893", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-02T23:50:55-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd967\"", "article_summary": "They also had some pre-existing systems, including one for document management, that could be folded into the health exchange.\nAs a result, Kentucky\u2019s exchange, dubbed Kynect, logged solid results in the first day and a half of operation.\n(AP Photo/Dylan Lovan)While Kentucky\u2019s health-insurance exchange experienced some glitches when it launched Tuesday, it seemed to perform better than many of its peers.\nOverall, though, the Kentucky exchange performed comparatively well.\n\u201cKentucky seems to have a smoother rollout than some other states,\u201d said Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation."}
