Morrison, sounds incredible.\n\n\n\nThe President, his wife, Michelle, their daughters, Malia, 16, Sasha, 13, and the rest of their guests will get to choose from banana cream, coconut cream, pumpkin, apple, pecan and cherry pies.\n\n(But really, why choose? Is six slices really too many?)\n\nBut will they really have room for pie after a Thanksgiving meal that includes thyme-roasted turkey, honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing, oyster stuffing, braised winter greens, macaroni and cheese, sweet potato gratin, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and dinner rolls. We hope they\u2019re wearing their comfy pants!\n\nOn Wednesday, the President decreed, in the White House\u2019s most baffling holiday tradition, that turkeys Mac and Cheese would be pardoned and, having been spared \u201cfrom a terrible and delicious fate,\u201d will live out long, healthy lives at Turkey Hill, a farm in Leesburg, Virginia.\n\n\u2014Amanda Michelle Steiner, @amandamichl\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obama thanksgiving, presidential thanksgiving, obama thanksgiving dinner, michelle obama dinner, michelle obama thanksgiving, barack obama thanksgiving, sasha obama, malia obama, sasha malia obama thanksgiving, white house menu, white house pastry chef, susan e Morrison white house, white house thanksgiving, turkey pardoned", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "People Great Ideas", "description": "You want dessert?
