From there, the deficit goes on a glide path higher to the point where it more than doubles the 2015 figure by 2022, the CBO estimates.\n\nThe trend will pose a policy headache for future members of Congress as well as the person who takes over the Oval Office from Obama when he exits in early 2017.\n\n\"Monthly budget updates suggest that the burgeoning U.S. expansion continues to improve the near-term fiscal outlook. Federal government revenues are outpacing last year's gait and federal discretionary spending continues to decline,\" economist Dana M. Peterson at Citigroup said in a report for clients.\n\n\"However, mandatory federal spending, especially for public retirement and health-care benefits, continued to expand unabated in the first three months of the fiscal year. Such rising mandatory expenditures foreshadow spiraling federal deficits and debt ahead.\"\n\nRead MoreIs Obama the only realist in Washington?\n\nPeterson said the late-year tax and spending agreement between Obama and Congress solved nothing, adding that \"media coverage of the nation's incipient fiscal challenges has been muted and measures of policy uncertainty are improving.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead is a \"fiscal firestorm\" fueled by \"unchecked\" growth in retirement and health-care spending, Peterson said. Medicare and Medicaid spending will surge from $68 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year to $84 billion in 2015; Social Security outlays will rise from $171 billion to $180 billion, and disability from $35.3 billion to $35.9 billion\u2014in total, 9 percent higher.\n\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act\u2014Obamacare\u2014subsidies are pegged at $5.4 billion, or more than half the total IRS spending of $9.3 billion.\n\n\n\n\"Worsening trends in mandatory expenditures on public health care and retirement entitlements point to deficit enlargement ahead. Insipient expansion of mandatory outlays continues to threaten to reverse the progress to date in narrowing the federal budget deficit and slowing the rise in public debt,\" Peterson said.\n\n\"Policymakers continue to focus on low-hanging fruit to reduce federal government debt and deficits, while avoiding necessary cuts to mandatory expenditures and tax reform,\" she added.\n\nPeterson concluded that a \"trifecta\" of concerns\u2014rising structural deficits, a growing share of debt to gross domestic product and \"a dysfunctional political process\"\u2014have been \"largely unaddressed\" in Washington.\n\nRead MoreState of the Union: 'Shadow of crisis has passed'\n\n\n\nIndeed, the debt remains and in fact is growing.\n\nThe federal government has a $16.6 trillion marker held by its various creditors around the world\u2014about $2.5 trillion combined to China and Japan alone\u2014and Obama can make no similar claim about that number \"shrinking.\"\n\nIn fact, according to the Federal Reserve, the government ended 2008, just before Obama took office, with a total debt of $7.9 trillion\u2014less than half its current level.\n\nAnd there was no sign of debt growth slowing, as the total grew 7.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "There's more to the story, and it's likely to become a significant headache for his successor.", "author": "Jeff Cox", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "There's more to the story, and it's likely to become a significant headache for his successor.", "title": "Kiss that 'shrinking' budget deficit goodbye", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/21/kiss-that-shrinking-budget-deficit-goodbye.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/21/102355941-barack-obama-state-of-the-union.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's more to the story, and it's likely to become a significant headache for his successor.", "title": "Kiss that 'shrinking' budget deficit goodbye", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/21/kiss-that-shrinking-budget-deficit-goodbye.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/21/102355941-barack-obama-state-of-the-union.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@JeffCoxCNBCcom", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "NetNet, NetNet, US: News, Barack Obama, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-01-21T12:07:10-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeff.cox.7528", "section": "NetNet", "modified_time": "2015-01-21T13:57:09-0500", "tag": "Barack Obama"}, "pageNodeId": 102355665, "news_keywords": "Obama, budget deficit, goodbye, shrinking, successor, more to story"}, "article_summary": "\"However, mandatory federal spending, especially for public retirement and health-care benefits, continued to expand unabated in the first three months of the fiscal year.\n\"Worsening trends in mandatory expenditures on public health care and retirement entitlements point to deficit enlargement ahead.\nInsipient expansion of mandatory outlays continues to threaten to reverse the progress to date in narrowing the federal budget deficit and slowing the rise in public debt,\" Peterson said.\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act\u2014Obamacare\u2014subsidies are pegged at $5.4 billion, or more than half the total IRS spending of $9.3 billion.\nThe 2016 number is expected to grow 18.6 percent to $556 billion, before a one-time drop to $530 billion the following year."}
