Gov. Peter Shumlin has appointed Sarah Hofmann to the Public Service Board. Hofmann will replace John Burke who is retiring. She will begin hearing cases at the board in March.

Hofmann is a former deputy commissioner and public advocate for the Department of Public Service. She currently serves as executive director of the New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners.

Shumlin said in a statement that Hofmann’s “institutional knowledge, innate fairness and good sense of public engagement will serve the Board very well.”

Hofmann worked for the department for 17 years and represented the state in cases before the Vermont Public Service Board, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in appeals to the Vermont Supreme Court.

“The utility world is changing and I want to help ensure that our choices are reasonable, affordable and sustainable,” Hofmann said in a statement.

Hofmann holds a bachelor’s degree from Rollins College and a juris doctorate from the University of New Hampshire Law School.

The three-member Public Service Board includes Jim Volz, the chair, and Margaret Cheney, a former lawmaker and wife of U.S. Rep. Peter Welch.

Burke was appointed to the board in 2000 by Gov. Howard Dean, and he was reappointed by Gov. Jim Douglas.

Burke was recently sanctioned by the Professional Responsibility Board for violating professional conduct standards in his practice as a private lawyer.

His term ends this year. In an interview, he told VTDigger his decision to leave the board was not related to the complaint.
