And a lack of affordable medicine plays a big part.\n\nAccording to CDC data published Monday, some 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV. Of this group, 30 percent are \u201cvirally suppressed,\u201d which means they are getting medication to reduce the function and replication of the virus. But 86 percent of the remaining patients were not undergoing any kind of medical treatment.\n\nPhoto: REUTERS\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Nacho Doce Previous Next\n\nMitchell Warren, executive director of HIV prevention nonprofit AVAC, told Bloomberg that, along with the social stigma, the coverage gaps in the American health care system are a major reason why people aren\u2019t receiving treatment -- which doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nHIV, which can lead to AIDS, requires lifelong medical treatment, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient. According to Healthline, a medical information site, a 15-day supply of a common HIV drug called Etravirine costs roughly $510, another drug, Efavirenz, costs about $863 for a 90-day supply. And with no generic versions available, the costs can add up fast.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn some cases, patients who can\u2019t afford to pay are eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. The CDC data, which is from 2011, doesn\u2019t show the impact of the Affordable Care Act, but there are still 21 states that aren\u2019t expanding these programs.\n\n\u201cIn states that do not expand Medicaid, many adults will fall into a coverage gap of having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for marketplace premium tax credits,\u201d says a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which also outlines how most of the uncovered people are likely to be racial or ethnic minorities, who are also much more likely to contract HIV.\n\nThe majority of HIV funding in the United States comes from the federally mandated Ryan White Program, which reaches more than 500,000 people who aren\u2019t able to pay for their care. In 2013, the program disbursed $631 million in \u201cemergency relief\u201d and more than $1 billion for HIV care.\n\nRecently, insurance companies Cigna and Coventry Health Care said they would put a $200 monthly cap on the amount Florida patients pay for common HIV drugs such as Atripla, Complera, Stribild and Fuzeon on the federal health care exchange. The move was a response to complaints from advocacy groups such as the AIDS Institute and the National Health Law Program.\n\nHowever, the policy only applies to patients in Florida. Advocacy groups such as the ONE Campaign are hailing the recent changes, but note that authorities still have a long way to go.\n\n\u201cOn the whole it is clear that increased overall resources to fight the disease, applied and targeted more effectively, have helped to accelerate progress at the global level,\u201d reads the organization's latest report. \u201cBut equally clear is the fragility of this progress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world aids day 2014, aids awareness, hiv awareness, u.s. aids stats 2014, american aids stats, american hiv, hiv treatment in u.s., hiv treatment in usa, americans not getting hiv treatment, hiv generic, hiv insurance, medicaid reform, affordable care act", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Coverage gaps in the U.S. health care system are a major reason why people aren\u2019t receiving treatment, which doesn\u2019t come cheap.", "title": "CDC Data: Many HIV-Positive Americans Aren\u2019t Getting Treatment", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/cdc-data-many-hiv-positive-americans-arent-getting-treatment-1732182", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/02/aids-patient.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coverage gaps in the U.S. health care system are a major reason why people aren\u2019t receiving treatment, which doesn\u2019t come cheap.", "title": "CDC Data: Many HIV-Positive Americans Aren\u2019t Getting Treatment", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/cdc-data-many-hiv-positive-americans-arent-getting-treatment-1732182", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/02/aids-patient.JPG", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/12/02/aids-patient.JPG"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Science", "published_time": "2014-12-02T16:37:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-02T17:42:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Coverage gaps in the U.S. health care system are a major reason why people aren\u2019t receiving treatment, which doesn\u2019t come cheap."}, "article_summary": "More than half of American HIV patients aren\u2019t getting treatment, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHIV, which can lead to AIDS, requires lifelong medical treatment, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient.\nIn 2013, the program disbursed $631 million in \u201cemergency relief\u201d and more than $1 billion for HIV care.\nBut 86 percent of the remaining patients were not undergoing any kind of medical treatment.\nAccording to CDC data published Monday, some 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV."}
