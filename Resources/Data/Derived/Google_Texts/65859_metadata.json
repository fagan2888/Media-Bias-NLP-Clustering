The cost difference would leave them with big medical bills that they\u2019d have to pay themselves.\n\nThat could undercut key financial protections in President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law that apply not just to the new health insurance exchanges, but to most job-based coverage as well.\n\nOthers say it\u2019s a valuable tool to reduce costs and help check premiums.\n\nSome federal regulators appear to be concerned. A recent administration policy ruling went to unusual lengths, acknowledging that the cost-control strategy \u201cmay be a subterfuge\u201d for \u201cotherwise prohibited limitations on coverage.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services said the practice \u2013 known as reference pricing \u2013 could continue. Plans must use a \u201creasonable method\u201d to ensure \u201cadequate access to quality providers.\u201d Regulators asked for public comment, saying they may publish additional guidance in the future.\n\nHHS spokeswoman Erin Shields Britt said in a statement that the administration is monitoring the effects of reference pricing on access to quality services and will work to ensure that financial protections for consumers are not undermined.\n\nOne way the new approach is different is that it sets a dollar limit on what the health plan will pay for a given procedure. Most insurance now pays a percentage of costs, and those costs themselves can vary from hospital to hospital. Now if you pick a more expensive hospital, the insurance still pays the same percentage.\n\nThe new strategy works like this:\n\nYour health insurance plan slaps a hard limit on what it will pay for certain procedures, for example, hospital charges associated with knee and hip replacement operations. That\u2019s called the reference price.\n\nSay the limit is $30,000. The plan offers you a choice of hospitals within its provider network. If you pick one that charges $40,000, you would owe $10,000 to the hospital plus your regular cost-sharing for the $30,000 that your plan covers.\n\nThe extra $10,000 is treated like an out-of-network expense, and it doesn\u2019t count toward your plan\u2019s annual limit on out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThat\u2019s crucial because under the health care law, most plans have to pick up the entire cost of care after a patient hits the annual out-of-pocket limit, currently $6,350 for single coverage and $12,700 for a family plan. Before the May 2 administration ruling, it was unclear whether reference pricing violated this key financial protection for consumers.\n\nSome experts are concerned.\n\n\u201cThe problem \u2026 from the patient\u2019s perspective is that at the end of the day, that is who gets left holding the bag,\u201d said Karen Pollitz of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Previously she was a top consumer protection regulator in the Obama administration.\n\nThe new pricing approach is not yet on consumers\u2019 radar, but it\u2019s gaining ground. The Mercer benefits consulting firm said 12 percent of the largest employers were using reference pricing last year, nearly double the 7 percent in 2012.\n\nThe approach has been pioneered in California by CalPERS, a giant agency that manages health and retirement benefits for public employees, and is the nation\u2019s second-largest purchaser of health benefits after the federal government.\n\nCalPERS started with knee and hip replacements in 2011, steering patients to hospitals that had been vetted for quality and charged $30,000 or less.\n\nAnn Boynton, CalPERS\u2019 health benefits director, said the program has been a success, with patients able to choose from about 50 hospitals.\n\n\u201cPeople do not feel like we went to bargain-basement hospitals where the quality is not good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe quality is the same, and in some instances, better.\u201d\n\nEconomist James C. Robinson of the University of California at Berkeley studied the CalPERS experiment and found not only that many patients shifted to lower-cost hospitals, saving money, but that expensive hospitals responded by cutting their prices.\n\nAlthough insurers don\u2019t appear to be using reference pricing on the new health exchanges, Robinson said he thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of people buying on the exchanges are price sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople, when they are spending their own money, tend to go for thinner benefits.\u201d\n\nHowever, the strategy appears to be suitable only for a subset of medical care: procedures and tests that are frequently performed, where the prices charged vary widely, but the quality of results generally does not. In addition to knee and hip replacements, that could include such procedures as MRIs and other imaging tests, cataract surgery and colonoscopies.\n\nRobert Berenson, a physician and health policy expert at the Urban Institute think tank, said he worries that advocates of reference pricing may be overlooking quality differences.\n\n\u201cThere are differences in MRIs and in how a hip replacement is done,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to say `Our judgment is better than your doctor\u2019s,\u2019 then you\u2019ve got to meet tests that you are actually assuring quality and safety.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration has given the go-ahead for insurers and employers to use a new cost-control strategy that puts a hard dollar limit on what health plans pay for some expensive procedures, such as knee and hip replacements.", "pubdate": 20140515, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration has given the go-ahead for insurers and employers to use a new cost-control strategy that puts a hard dollar limit on what health plans pay for some expensive procedures, such as knee and hip replacements.", "title": "Feds approve cost-control strategy for expensive health procedures", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5866567170_f886e09402_o.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/feds-approve-cost-control-strategy-expensive-health-procedures/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration has given the go-ahead for insurers and employers to use a new cost-control strategy that puts a hard dollar limit on what health plans pay for some expensive procedures, such as knee and hip replacements.", "title": "Feds approve cost-control strategy for expensive health procedures", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5866567170_f886e09402_o.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "health care"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22d5\"", "article_summary": "Before the May 2 administration ruling, it was unclear whether reference pricing violated this key financial protection for consumers.\nOne way the new approach is different is that it sets a dollar limit on what the health plan will pay for a given procedure.\nThe Mercer benefits consulting firm said 12 percent of the largest employers were using reference pricing last year, nearly double the 7 percent in 2012.\nAlthough insurers don\u2019t appear to be using reference pricing on the new health exchanges, Robinson said he thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time.\nMost insurance now pays a percentage of costs, and those costs themselves can vary from hospital to hospital."}
