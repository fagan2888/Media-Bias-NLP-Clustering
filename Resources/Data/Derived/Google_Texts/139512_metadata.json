Ted Cruz tried to compare his relationship with his favored grassroots Friday with the momentum that propelled Republican President Ronald Reagan into the White House.\n\nThe response to the economic malaise of the late 1970s was \u201cthe grassroots revolution,\u201d Cruz told a friendly crowd in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cThe Reagan Revolution.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore than 30 years later, Cruz is trying to ride his own grassroots movement, one built around the Texas Republican\u2019s opposition to President Barack Obama and his health care law. Cruz said the movement is dedicated to one word, \u201cgrowth.\u201d\n\nReagan\u2019s policies were the exact opposite of Obama\u2019s, Cruz told the crowd of about 600 Republicans at the Iowa GOP Reagan Dinner. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Gov. Terry Branstad attended the annual event.\n\nCruz\u2019s speech was all about the grassroots, something new to D.C. that \u201chas official Washington absolutely terrified,\u201d he said. \u201cThis new paradigm has been beta tested, unlike the Obamacare website.\" The paradigm\u2019s first run-through, Cruz said, was the 1980 election that swept Reagan into power.\n\nPart of the allusions to Reagan was likely as a unifying factor as Cruz and other speakers insisted that the \u201ccivil war\u201d in the GOP is a myth and that what is really happening in the party is a natural evolution.\n\nDeclarations that such a rift doesn\u2019t exist between the Republican establishment and others like the tea party were belied Friday by admonitions by Cruz and other speakers against some of the Republican leaders, especially in the Senate, who did not hold firm on Cruz\u2019s efforts to defund Obamacare.\n\nCruz\u2019s keynote speech was part of a two-day swing through Iowa for the freshman senator and is the third time he has travelled to the state of 3 million in the past three months. He received a warm welcome, with local speakers praising his \u201cprincipled leadership\u201d during the partial government shutdown.\n\nFor Cruz, that principle means running one direction and one direction only in elections. He admonished against wisdom that says Republicans run to the conservative right in primaries and then to the moderate left in the general election.\n\n\u201cWhat complete poppycock,\u201d Cruz said. Candidates who do that, he said, \u201cdestroy any reason someone has to show up and vote.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Friday\u2019s speech, Cruz will speak at Republican Rep. Steve King's 6th Annual Defenders of Freedom event in Le Mars, Iowa. Cruz will be King\u2019s guest at the congressman\u2019s Col. Bud Day Pheasant Hunt Saturday. Cruz goes hunting several times a year, he recently told the Des Moines Register.\n\nPresidential ambitions?\n\nCruz\u2019s frequent trips to Iowa, a crucial early Republican caucus state, have helped fuel speculation that he is planning a 2016 presidential bid. The former Texas solicitor general has repeatedly demurred on his intentions.\n\nAsked recently by CNN's Dana Bash when he plans to make his 2016 intentions known, Cruz said his focus is \"entirely on the U.S. Senate.\" The reason he travels to other states, he said, was to \"to energize and activate the grassroots of the American people.\"\n\nThe Iowa crowd and others like it have become Cruz\u2019s preferred audience as he continues to form his anti-establishment tea party credentials.\n\nRising poll numbers among conservative voters show Cruz already well on his way to firmly ensconcing himself as a man off the anti-Washington people, after helping push the government into a 16-day partial shutdown when he attached a bill defunding Obamacare with one funding the rest of the government.\n\nThe grassroots\n\nCruz\u2019s establishment detractors on both sides of the political aisle attacked him for the defunding maneuver, saying he knew all along the move would fail and would be completely untenable to Senate Democrats and President Obama, who vowed to veto anything harming his signature legislation.\n\nBut then, Cruz is in Iowa precisely because he\u2019s not appealing to the establishment but rather to the tea party and the Republican base. That\u2019s likely why he spent 21 hours on the Senate floor in the run-up to the government shutdown railing against Obamacare while lambasting Congress\u2019s failure to \u201clisten\u201d to the American people about the evils of the health care law.\n\n\u201c21 hours is a long time,\u201d Cruz told the crowd Friday.\n\n\u201cThat's almost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare website.\u201d\n\nThe number one reason the defund tactic failed, Cruz said after the shutdown ended, was that Senate Republicans failed to back up their colleagues in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Senate marathon was part of a series of populist maneuvers by Cruz before, during and after the shutdown.\n\nIn the months leading up to the shutdown, Cruz traveled the country railing against the ills of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. During the shutdown, Cruz was one of the more vocal detractors of the government gating off federal parks and memorials.\n\nAfter the shutdown ended, Cruz declared victory, lauding the 2 million people who signed a petition against Obamacare and saying that he has ruled out no strategy in his continuing efforts to dismantle the law, including another shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe accomplished a great deal,\u201d Cruz insisted of the shutdown Friday, elevating the national debate about the destructive impact of Obamacare.\n\nThe key to victory in the future, Cruz said, is to be bold. Playing it safe was why Republicans lost the elections of 2006, 2008 and 2012. The one real victory, of 2010, was because the party and grassroots didn\u2019t shy from its principles of growth and freedom, Cruz said.\n\nKeeping your head down, Cruz said, \u201cthat\u2019s not how you win races.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Sen.
