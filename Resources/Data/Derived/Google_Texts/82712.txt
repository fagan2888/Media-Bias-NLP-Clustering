There are times when investors and analysts don’t see eye-to-eye. This would be one of those moments.

Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch sees an opportunity for many of the nation’s major health insurers now that private exchanges appear to be catching on with some large employers, but investors cast down shares on all the big carriers Thursday.

In a note to clients, Borsch followed up on his Wednesday missive, issued after Walgreen Co. /quotes/zigman/245520 /quotes/nls/wag WAG became the third major employer to announce a shift to private exchanges. That came on the heels of announcements from International Business Machines Corp. /quotes/zigman/230066 /quotes/nls/ibm IBM and Time Warner Inc. /quotes/zigman/528906 /quotes/nls/twx TWX

Borsch said if there is a large-scale shift to private exchanges, it could bode well for insurers, but carriers’ shares all dropped Wednesday. Then on Thursday, he followed it up with another note outlining exactly how that could happen.

The so-called “Big Five” insurers — UnitedHealth Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/258846 /quotes/nls/unh UNH , WellPoint Inc. /quotes/zigman/362231 /quotes/nls/wlp WLP , Aetna Inc. /quotes/zigman/272706 /quotes/nls/aet AET , Cigna Corp. /quotes/zigman/222255 /quotes/nls/ci CI and Humana Inc. /quotes/zigman/229688 /quotes/nls/hum HUM — should realize a collective $1 billion in additional pretax earnings if 13 million people make the move by 2019.

Private exchanges are being set up at some companies, similar to the public clearinghouses being assembled now to get ready for President Obama’s health-care overhaul, or Obamacare. The private exchanges could bring a wider selection of players, since employer-sponsored health insurance is by far the most common form of coverage now obtained in the U.S.

Borsch says the insurers will lose some members, but that will be more than offset by the amount of revenue that goes directly to carriers. He adds that scenario may be overly conservative when figuring loss of members. If so, the additional profit could be as high as $2 billion.

That fell on deaf ears among investors. All five carriers were down 2% or more for the day, with Cigna taking the biggest hit. It was down more than 4% to $77.72, and off nearly 8% from the all-time high it reached on Monday when it closed at $84.27.
