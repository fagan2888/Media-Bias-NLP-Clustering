Courtesy, Skarstedt New York Ghost 11, 1992\n\nBy Carmel Melouney\n\nLike the reappearing spirit in their title, a series of David Salle works entitled \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d have reemerged after a decade of being hidden away in storage.\n\nThe 14 works were made in 1992 by Mr. Salle, a postmodernist painter who has been exhibiting since 1975 and is best known for helping to reestablish painting as an important artistic movement in the 1980s.\n\nThe \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d series wasn\u2019t exhibited until this summer, when it made its debut at the Arts Club of Chicago.\n\nThe works will be on show at Skarstedt Gallery on the Upper East Side from Friday until Dec. 21.\n\nThe 14 works comprise pre-digital photographs printed onto three contiguous linen panels and painted over with Mark Rothko-like panels of bright color.\n\nMr. Salle said the linen was imprinted with photographic emulsion, a liquid which transforms the fabric into a base for a photograph. The paintings depict a woman creating improvised movements under a white sheet, the same way children pretend to be ghosts each Halloween.\n\n\u201cI had some overall image of the way you make a ghost-like shape when you put a sheet over your head,\u201d said Mr. Salle of working with a model to create the pieces.\n\nHe said he had always been concerned with light and shadow, the interplay that lies at the heart of photography, but couldn\u2019t recall whether the inspiration had been drawn from his own childhood pretending to be a ghost under a white sheet.\n\nDavid Salle, VAGA, NY. Courtesy, Skarstedt New York Ghost 10, 1992\n\n\u201cIt might have happened \u2014 luckily there\u2019s no photographic evidence of it,\u201d Mr. Salle said and laughed.\n\nMr. Salle said there had been plans to exhibit the works in 1992 in Cologne, Germany, but the art market crashed and the show was never executed.\n\n\u201cFor one reason or another, we just let it go,\u201d said Mr. Salle, who lives and works in Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange moment in the international art world.\u201d\n\nPer Skarstedt, who opened his New York gallery in 1994 and specializes in works from artists of the late 20th century, said he felt lucky to be exhibiting the works after they had been stored away for so many years.\n\n\u201cI think I got lucky that they weren\u2019t shown before,\u201d said Mr. Skarstedt. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual that you find an entire series still in the hands of the artist, and it\u2019s important because they\u2019re so great. It would have been such a shame if they had just stayed in storage.\u201d\n\nMr. Skarstedt said he had been looking at exhibiting some of Mr. Salle\u2019s works before he knew the ghost series existed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly an artist I\u2019ve been looking at,\u201d said Mr. Skarstedt. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to the 80s artists, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, that whole generation, because that was when I started.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of historical shows here. David just mentioned [the ghost paintings] to me. I didn\u2019t know the paintings existed so I went to see them seven or eight months ago, and I thought they were wonderful.\u201d\n\nMr. Skarstedt said he liked the way the works merged photography, painting and performance art.\n\n\u201cFor me they\u2019re the perfect postmodernist work,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Salle said he was not surprised at the circularity of the art world, where works he completed long ago were being shown for the first time, but was pleased to see how \u201cfresh\u201d his work looked now hung in Mr. Skarstedt\u2019s gallery.\n\n\u201cThere is a poignancy about something made of a fabric that no longer exists,\u201d Mr. Salle said of the paintings. \u201cThis is extinct.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Like the reappearing spirit in their title, a series of David Salle works entitled \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d have reemerged after a decade of being hidden away in storage.", "title": "\u2018Ghost Paintings\u2019 Rise Again in Manhattan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/08/ghost-paintings-rise-again-in-manhattan/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI345_GHOST__G_20131108151238.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "\u2018Ghost Paintings\u2019 Rise Again in Manhattan", "description": "Like the reappearing spirit in their title, a series of David Salle works entitled \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d have reemerged after a decade of being hidden away in storage.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carrie Melago", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Like the reappearing spirit in their title, a series of David Salle works entitled \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d have reemerged after a decade of being hidden away in storage.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-08T20:23:36-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/08/ghost-paintings-rise-again-in-manhattan/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19029", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Like the reappearing spirit in their title, a series of David Salle works entitled \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d have reemerged after a decade of being hidden away in storage.", "title": "\u2018Ghost Paintings\u2019 Rise Again in Manhattan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/08/ghost-paintings-rise-again-in-manhattan/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI345_GHOST__G_20131108151238.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19029", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-08T20:24:09-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd487f\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d series wasn\u2019t exhibited until this summer, when it made its debut at the Arts Club of Chicago.\nDavid just mentioned [the ghost paintings] to me.\nCourtesy, Skarstedt New York Ghost 11, 1992By Carmel MelouneyLike the reappearing spirit in their title, a series of David Salle works entitled \u201cGhost Paintings\u201d have reemerged after a decade of being hidden away in storage.\n\u201cThere is a poignancy about something made of a fabric that no longer exists,\u201d Mr. Salle said of the paintings.\nCourtesy, Skarstedt New York Ghost 10, 1992\u201cIt might have happened \u2014 luckily there\u2019s no photographic evidence of it,\u201d Mr. Salle said and laughed."}
