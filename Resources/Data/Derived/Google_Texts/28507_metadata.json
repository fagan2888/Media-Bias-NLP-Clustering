The retired neurosurgeon-turned-Republican presidential frontrunner may be an excellent surgeon, but he\u2019s said some mind-blowing statements that ignore well-known fact. Below are 11 outlandish things the presidential candidate has said.\n\nWhen Carson lied about having any involvement with snake-oil seller Mannatech.\n\nCarson denies having any involvement with the Mannatech group, a company that came under a class-action lawsuit and investigation for illegally selling herbal supplements they said cured cancer and autism. Carson appeared on Mannatech\u2019s website, endorsed the product in speeches, and appeared in an interview with the company\u2019s founder.\n\nRegardless, the Republican frontrunner flat out lied about working with the company at the CNBC Republican primary debates. However, Carson still said Mannatech\u2019s herbal supplement was a \u201cgood product.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda,\u201d Carson said. \u201cI did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it\u2019s a good product.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Carson being interviewed by the CEO of Mannatech.\n\nOnce he said his prostate surgery was to save other people\u2019s lives.\n\nCarson said Mannatech\u2019s herbal supplement reduced his prostate cancer symptoms, but still decided to have his prostate surgically removed. He said he underwent the prostate surgery to set an example for others.\n\n\u201cI actually toyed with the idea of not having surgery done\u2026,\u201d Carson said at a Mannatech conference. \u201cBut then I began to realize that having a high profile, that if I did that, a lot of other people might follow that example, too, but they may not be quite as diligent about taking the product as I was, and there would be a lot of needless deaths, and I didn\u2019t feel as though I could have that on my conscience. So I went ahead and had the surgery done.\u201d\n\nWhen Carson said the Egyptian pyramids were built by the bible\u2019s Joseph to \u201cstore grain.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed dug up a 1998 Andrews University commencement speech where the retired neurosurgeon said that the pyramids weren\u2019t built by the Egyptians, but by biblical figure Joseph to store grain.\n\n\u201cMy own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,\u201d Carson said. \u201cNow all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs\u2019 graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019d just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s theory was popular in the Middle Ages, but the Egyptian pyramids were built at least 500 years before the time of Joseph, said Yale Egyptology Professor John C. Darnell to BuzzFeed News.\n\nOn Nov. 4, Carson told CBS that he still believes the pyramids were built by Joseph to store grain.\n\nSpeaking of history, Carson said he thinks advanced placement (AP) high school history courses convert students to ISIS.\n\n\u201cI think most people,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhen they finish [the AP history course] they\u2019d be ready to go sign up for ISIS.\u201d\n\nAnother time he said he\u2019d \u201crather be rich\u201d than live a Christ-like life.\n\nAt first, Carson wanted to be a \u201cnoble\u201d doctor, but when he turned 13, he decided he\u2019d rather go the greedy route.\n\n\u201cHaving grown up in dire poverty, I decided I\u2019d rather be rich!\u201d Carson said at a Mannatech gathering.\n\nCarson said he\u2019s obsessed with knives.\n\nIn the same strange Mannatech speech where he talked about stabbing someone, Carson professed his love of knives.\n\n\u201cI locked myself in the bathroom that day and started thinking about\u2026 knives,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson believes the big bang is a \u201cfairy tale\u201d and that evolution is the work of the devil.\n\n\u201cI personally believe that this theory that Darwin came up with,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWas something that was encouraged by the adversary.\u201d\n\nWatch Carson\u2019s talk about the big bang and evolution, courtesy of The Young Turks.\n\nCarson said ObamaCare is worse than slavery.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said at the 2013 Values Voter Summit. \u201cIn a way, it is slavery, because it is making all of us subservient to the government.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia should\u2019ve handed over Osama bin Laden.\n\nDisregarding the fact that the Saudis were enemies with bin Laden, Carson told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulous that if the U.S. was not dependent on Saudi oil, the Mideast kingdom would\u2019ve handed over bin Laden.\n\nCarson said prison makes people gay.\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, Carson said that being gay must be a choice because some people come out of prison gay.\n\n\u201cBecause a lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight, and when they come out they\u2019re gay. So did something happen while they were in there?\u201d Carson said.\n\nCuomo appeared a tad baffled by Carson\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cI am not denying that that\u2019s true, but I am denying that that\u2019s a basis of understanding homosexuality,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\nWhen he blamed the victims of Oregon\u2019s Umqua Community College shooting.\n\nCarson blamed the victims of the Umqua Community College when on air with Fox and Friends. He implied that the victims were cowardly and said if he was in their situation he would\u2019ve fought the shooter instead of waiting to be shot.\n\n\u201cIn a situation where you had a madman who was systematically assassinating people after asking them a question, and they\u2019re all there waiting their turn, I would not wait my turn. I would say let\u2019s do something,\u201d Carson said.\n\n[Image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson says some nutty things.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson says some nutty things.", "title": "11 Totally Crazy Things Ben Carson Said", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2549304/11-totally-crazy-things-ben-carson-said/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BenCarsonChurch-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-08T00:35:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-08T20:15:17+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BenCarsonChurch-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-11-08T00:35:27+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ben carson,carson,crazy,2016,republican,presidential,candidate,frontrunner,pyramids,mannatech,candidate.,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BenCarsonChurch-900x440.jpg", "width": 900, "height": 440}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson says some nutty things."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,\u201d Carson said.\nHe said he underwent the prostate surgery to set an example for others.\nOn Nov. 4, Carson told CBS that he still believes the pyramids were built by Joseph to store grain.\nOnce he said his prostate surgery was to save other people\u2019s lives.\nCarson appeared on Mannatech\u2019s website, endorsed the product in speeches, and appeared in an interview with the company\u2019s founder."}
