Some 41% said employers who had objections should have the same exemption as religious organizations. Around 6% said they were not sure.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments later this month from two companies, Hobby Lobby Inc. and Conestoga Wood, whose evangelical Christian and Mennonite owners say their religious freedom is being infringed by the requirement to include the morning-after pill in employees\u2019 insurance. They consider that form of emergency contraception to be a form of abortion. Some Catholic business owners also have broader concerns about other forms of birth control and have also brought cases against the requirement.\n\nThe administration says that it\u2019s given an opt-out for churches and offered a compromise arrangement for Catholic-affiliated universities, hospitals and charities but that for-profit companies should not be able to claim that their owners\u2019 moral beliefs allow them to sidestep the law.\n\nBig majorities of women, Democrats and voters in the Northeast appear to agree, suggesting that the issue could again be used by liberal candidates as a rallying cry in the 2014 elections. In 2012, Democrats accused Republicans from the presidential nominee Mitt Romney down to House candidates of engaging in a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nSome 65% of women voters between the ages of 18 and 49, 61% of voters in the Northeast, and 72% of voters who identified themselves as Democrats said they believed employers should not be exempt from covering prescription birth control.\n\nBut the issue might be used by some Republicans who have backed the for-profit companies. Among voters who say that religion is the single most important thing in their lives, 70% said that employers should be allowed an exemption.\n\nThe poll was conducted between March 5 and 9 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nQ&A Replay: WSJ\u2019s Aaron Zitner and Patrick O\u2019Connor on Obama\u2019s latest poll numbers and what they mean for 2014.
