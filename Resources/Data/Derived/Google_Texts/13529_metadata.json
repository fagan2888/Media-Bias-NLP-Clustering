But unlike a certain other much-chronicled, vastly better-known prospect, Maryland's two-term governor makes it no secret that, if not officially running for president, he is at least actively striding in that direction.\n\nFellow Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton says she hasn't decided whether to run, and neither, O'Malley says, has he. In the meantime, he is running one of the most vigorous noncampaign campaigns of any 2016 possibility in either party \u2014 raising money, stumping in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, traveling abroad to boost his foreign policy credentials and honing a message that might be characterized, for brevity's sake, as compassionate competence.\n\n\"People want problem-solvers,\" O'Malley, a former Baltimore mayor, said in a late-night interview after the first of two well-received speeches to Democratic activists in Des Moines. \"They want leaders that will bring people together to solve problems, not people that will take their ideology and try to beat round pegs into square holes.\"\n\nNoted for his data-driven approach to policy, starting when he used computer analysis to chart citizen complaints and fuel millions of dollars of new efficiencies in city government, O'Malley is a devout Roman Catholic grounded in the Jesuit emphasis on social justice. His religious faith, he suggests, informs his secular beliefs.\n\nHope drives belief. Belief drives action. And action achieves results. \u2014 Martin O'Malley\n\n\"The numbers aren't abstractions,\" he said of his reverence for statistics. \"The numbers are very real human beings and individual stories.\"\n\nLike many native to the information age, O'Malley is fluent in the language of entrepreneurship, multiplatforms and changing technologies. His numbers-crunching success fighting crime, cleaning Chesapeake Bay and shaping up Maryland's bureaucracy could be a model for the federal government, he says, though it may be a challenge translating that into a resonant rallying cry: At times O'Malley can sound like a walking PowerPoint slide, holding forth on \"silos of human endeavor\" and \"a cadence of accountability.\"\n\nPeople want problem-solvers. They want leaders that will bring people together to solve problems.... \u2014 Martin O'Malley\n\nHis record is one to make liberals swoon, even if he prefers the less-freighted \"progressive\" label.\n\nUnder O'Malley, Maryland has banished the death penalty, toughened gun laws, raised the minimum wage, and approved same-sex marriage, the use of medical marijuana and in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for people in the country illegally.\n\nHe has also, as Republicans are eager to point out, pushed through numerous tax hikes, including increases in Maryland's sales, gasoline and tobacco taxes as well a boost in the income tax on better-off residents.\n\nO'Malley parries criticism by touting the state's enviable record on job creation, income growth and other yardsticks of economic well-being.\n\n\"Hope drives belief. Belief drives action. And action achieves results,\" he said in his speech to delegates at the state Democratic convention, a mix of partisan exhortation, self-promotion and the maxims one might hear at a business administration seminar.\n\nShould he run for president, O'Malley's job performance, starting in 1991 as a member of the Baltimore City Council, would obviously be examined in great detail. A corruption, sex and drug scandal in Baltimore's city jail, which festered when he was governor, is a particularly troublesome part of the O'Malley record. More recently, his claims to competence have been undercut by Maryland's troubled Obamacare exchange, which failed at an estimated cost of well over $100 million.\n\nA lawyer by training, O'Malley has spent a lifetime steeped in politics. He grew up one of six children in the prosperous Maryland suburbs of Washington, where his parents met at national Democratic Party headquarters.\n\nO'Malley and his wife, Katie, met in similar fashion, on the campaign trail. The daughter of J. Joseph Curran Jr., the longest-serving attorney general in Maryland history, she is now a state district court judge.\n\nInformed opinion is divided over whether O'Malley will ultimately follow through and mount an uphill challenge to Clinton. (If she opts out, the Democratic contest will be thrown wide-open.)\n\nHe enjoys a good personal relationship with the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of State, whom he supported over Barack Obama in 2008, and said in the interview that he had \"a great deal of respect ... a great deal of admiration\" for Clinton.\n\nIowa, as he knows, would be an ideal testing ground for both.\n\nIn 1984, an upstart Gary Hart nearly wrestled the Democratic nomination away from former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, a commanding front-runner at the time, much as Clinton is today. The Colorado senator began with a surprisingly strong performance in the Iowa caucuses; one of his state volunteers was a young O'Malley.\n\nSeeing Hart's experience up close \"sort of demystified that a bit for me,\" O'Malley said of seeking the White House, \"and made me realize that real human beings offer themselves in this service.\"\n\nHe has not pressed the generational argument, but his appearance \u2014 vigorous, fit, handsome in a plain-vanilla way and just 51 years old, compared with Clinton, who is 66 \u2014 means he doesn't have to. Others draw the contrast for him.\n\n\"It's really about young, up-and-coming Democrats,\" said Rose Mary Pratt, 66, a retired state worker who turned out on a sunny Saturday morning to hear O'Malley address a group of Democratic canvassers in Beaverdale, one of Des Moines' most liberal neighborhoods. \"I'm Hillary's generation. I'm looking for who's our replacement material.\"\n\nDeciding whether to seek the White House, O'Malley said over the 10 p.m. din of a hotel lounge, involves a characteristically methodical approach: \"Multiple conversations. A lot of reading. A lot of listening. Some talking. But mostly listening.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Martin O'Malley warms up in Iowa for possible Democratic run in 2016", "date": "2014-07-12", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The visit had all the trappings of a full-fledged presidential campaign: a speech at the state Democratic convention, a pep talk to door-knocking volunteers, breakfast with labor leaders, appearances alongside the party's candidate for governor.", "title": "Martin O'Malley warms up in Iowa for possible Democratic run in 2016", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-martin-omalley-president-2016-20140713-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53c1f729/turbine/la-na-martin-omalley-president-2016-20140713", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Martin O'Malley, 2016 presidential campaign, Maryland governor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democratic", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80792407", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Martin O'Malley, 2016 presidential campaign, Maryland governor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democratic", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Maryland Gov.
