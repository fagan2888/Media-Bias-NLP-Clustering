Pictured is Charleston City Hall, located at the corner of Broad and Meeting street.\n\nAll of Charleston\u2019s seven mayor candidates agree the city is gentrifying too quickly \u2014 that its lower-income residents are being priced out at an unacceptable rate.\n\nOnline To stay up-to-date on the race for Charleston\u2019s next mayor, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android.\n\nThey also agree on the need to complete Interstate 526, that the city should be more involved in the public schools and that more police officers should wear body cameras.\n\nBut they disagree on a proposed bike lane over the Ashley River, spending levels on the city\u2019s fire and police departments and whether public restrooms should be built at White Point Garden.\n\nThose are the results of a 15-question survey The Post and Courier submitted to the candidates last week \u2014 a questionnaire designed to clarify where they stand on some of the major issues the city will face whoever is elected in November to replace longtime Mayor Joe Riley.\n\nWhile candidates were asked to give a one-word response to each question \u2014 with \u201cmaybe\u201d being an acceptable response \u2014 many expressed concern that such an approach oversimplified the nature of the job they\u2019re seeking.\n\nWhat follows is a look at their answers \u2014 and their thoughts on the complexities and nuance of some of these issues.\n\nWhere they agree\n\nWhile completing Interstate 526 \u2014 from Citadel Mall to the James Island Connector \u2014 remains one of the Lowcountry\u2019s biggest political hot potatoes, the city\u2019s next mayor can be counted on to continue supporting the project, just as Mayor Joe Riley does.\n\nFormer City Councilman Maurice Washington was one of the few to qualify his support, saying the road is needed but the city also must tackle over-development and pass a growth management plan.\n\nCity Councilman William Dudley Gregorie, another mayoral hopeful, called its completion \u201cimperative,\u201d saying it would address traffic congestion, growing commerce and evacuation routes.\n\nWhile public schools are run by the Charleston County School District \u2014 and while Riley has sought to support public schools \u2014 all seven candidates said they felt city government should do more to help schools within the city limits.\n\nGregorie said while Charleston has a world-class reputation, its schools are some of the state\u2019s best and worst. \u201cWe must take extraordinary steps to bring public education in Charleston to a standard of excellence for all children,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city already has 140 body cameras for its police officers and is seeking a grant for 150 more. Regardless of who is elected, the next mayor can be expected to continue support for this \u2014 which became a national issue after a North Charleston officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a fleeing Walter Scott earlier this year.\n\nThe candidates seem mostly against the city\u2019s controversial \u201cgathering place\u201d zoning, designed to foster more walkable, urban development in the city\u2019s suburbs. Only Toby Smith, a nonprofit consultant, said she supports it, while state Rep. Leon Stavrinakis said the zoning \u201cis obviously not working right now. But I wouldn\u2019t get rid of all elements of that zoning. I would find the right balance.\u201d\n\nGregorie also said he supports the intent of the gathering place zoning but would \u201cmake the necessary adjustments for connectivity, traffic and livability in the surrounding neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThey also agreed the city is gentrifying too quickly, so affordable housing and even wage scales might remain a hot topic during the next two months. Former City Councilman Paul Tinkler was the only candidate to answer \u201cmaybe\u201d to that question instead of yes.\n\nWhere they disagree\n\nThe next mayor could determine if the city of Charleston will continue to support plans to convert a lane of traffic on the T. Allen Legare Bridge for bike and pedestrian use.\n\nAnd candidates have a range of positions. Only Smith answered yes to the question of whether she supports the change.\n\nMost candidates answered no, but both businessman John Tecklenburg and Tinkler said they might support it.\n\nTecklenburg said he has concerns about closing off a lane on the bridge, though he supports the concept of improving bike access across the Ashley River. He said his ultimate support will hinge on a trial closure the county plans for early next year.\n\n\u201cI just want to see if the trial confirms what their reports say on paper,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re true and there\u2019s only a 10 second difference, I\u2019m for it. What if we have that test and it\u2019s a disaster? I don\u2019t predict that will be the case, but I just hate to lock myself in and all the facts aren\u2019t in.\u201d\n\nGinny Deerin, former CEO of WINGS for Kids, said the best solution is to replace the bridge with a new one. \u201cWe need a new bridge with plenty of room for cars to move quickly through, that also accommodates pedestrians, cyclists and public transportation,\u201d she said.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disagreement came over whether the city should build public restrooms at White Point Garden, where the city once had them but removed them a few decades ago. The lack of public restrooms there has been an issue for tourists and others for years.\n\nDeerin, Tecklenburg, Tinkler and Washington said they don\u2019t support adding restrooms there, while Stavrinakis and Gregorie do. Smith said \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important that we accommodate our visitors particularly in public spaces,\u201d Gregorie said.\n\nFour also said they would support splitting the city\u2019s Board of Architectural Review into two boards \u2014 one to review new buildings and the other to handle preservation projects \u2014 but Gregorie and Washington said no.\n\nStavrinakis said he might back such a plan. Earlier this year, architectural consultant Andres Duany recommended the change as a step the city could take to try to get better new buildings.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated\n\nSeveral campaigns expressed displeasure with the questionnaire and being confined to a simple yes-no-maybe choice.\n\nAnd perhaps the most angst was caused by the simple question: \u201cWould you ever raise taxes?\u201d \u2014 a sort of local version of the national Americans for Tax Reform pledge that 1,400 state and national officials have signed. Riley raised property taxes and other fees several times during his 40-year tenure.\n\nDeerin, Tecklenburg and Washington said no, while Tinkler, Stavrinakis, Smith and Gregorie said maybe.\n\nTinkler said he supports raising the state gas tax so a stable source of funding can be established for our crumbling roads \u2014 though the next mayor won\u2019t have a say in raising the state\u2019s gas tax.\n\nAs for city taxes, Tinkler said he answered \u201cmaybe\u201d because he can\u2019t speculate about the city\u2019s financial needs down the road.\n\nWhile Deerin answered no, she said she would work diligently to never raise taxes or fees, but she also supports raising the state gas tax to fix roads. Smith said she does, too, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need additional money to pay for infrastructure.\u201d\n\nGregorie said he is familiar with the city\u2019s current budget, \u201cand I see no need for a tax increase in the near future.\u201d\n\nStavrinakis noted he has \u201ca very strong record of not doing that (raising taxes), but I would never say never.\u201d\n\nCandidates also sought to clarify answers to other questions.\n\nFor instance, Tecklenburg said while he supports the formation of a citizens advisory committee for the police department, he met with Chief Greg Mullen and feels the committee\u2019s role should be advisory only.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for a citizens committee as long as it\u2019s an advisory committee. I\u2019m not in favor of a citizens committee that will set the policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still need the chief of police in charge of the police department.\u201d\n\nWashington said he doesn\u2019t support a citizens\u2019 review board because \u201cpolicies are a mayor and council responsibility.\u201d But he thinks it\u2019s a good idea to form a citizens\u2019 board to help improve the relationship between the police and the public.\n\nThe nonpartisan election is Nov. 3, and eligible voters must register by Oct. 3. If no mayoral candidate gets more than 50 percent, the top two vote getters will face off in a Nov. 17 runoff.\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771 or on Twitter at @RobertFBehre.
