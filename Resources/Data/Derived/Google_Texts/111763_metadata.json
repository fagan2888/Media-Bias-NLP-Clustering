They will work for agencies and organizations that serve people with developmental disabilities, mental illness or chemical dependency; victims of crime; individuals and families in crisis; and the elderly.\n\nThe program also prepares baccalaureate students for graduate-level human services degree curriculums.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a part of helping people that are in need,\u201d Hoose said.\n\nAn academic advisor at the college for 16 years, Hoose is interning as a child protection investigator with the Florida Department of Children and Families. Upon graduation, she hopes to continue to work with DCF.\n\n\u201cThere are so many opportunities out there for people with this degree, but DCF has a program where they pay for a master\u2019s degree,\u201d she said.\n\nFSCJ Associate Dean Dave Garner said the college began contemplating adding human services to its bachelor\u2019s degree offerings in 2010 during its annual review of regional workforce needs. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity estimates that the program could help fill about 90 Duval County jobs each year.\n\nLeaders of each of Jacksonville\u2019s colleges and universities participated in the program\u2019s development after determining the offering would not be duplicative. Meanwhile, representatives of River Region Health and Human Services, Clara White Mission and Hubbard House also signed up as industry partners.\n\nThe program has expanded from about 25 students to more than 170 \u2014 and counting \u2014 since beginning in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to filling a need in the community,\u201d Garner said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that health care and social assistance are expected to become the nation\u2019s largest employment sector by 2024, overtaking the state and local government sector professional and business services sector\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more integration of services and what we call wraparound services, partially due to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation,\u201d said FSCJ sociology professor Rebecca Ford.\n\nIn its marketing information about the human service degree program, FSCJ states that candidates for the degree need compassion, understanding, patience and a willingness to serve.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very empathetic and you have to be able to entertain boundaries,\u201d Ford said, but \u201cit\u2019s very easy to experience burnout.\u201d\n\nHuman services graduates also are problem solvers who tend to become involved in ensuring that proper policies are in place, she said.\n\nHoose said some life changes \u2014 a recent divorce and her children growing up \u2014 fueled her choice to return to college to pursue her career dream.\n\n\u201cI just decided it was time to do what I wanted to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen (the human services program) became available, it seemed like a perfect fit for me.\u201d\n\nFor most of the last two years, Hoose fit a full load \u2014 five classes at a time \u2014 around her work schedule. Now, she has one class and her internship left to complete.\n\nHoose points out that it wasn\u2019t until she began working in the field as an intern that she fully appreciated the value of what she learned in the classroom.\n\n\u201cIt all kind of fell into place,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as being prepared, I\u2019m right up there with master\u2019s degree students (participating in internships). That\u2019s because the professors are amazing.\u201d\n\nGarner, meanwhile said FSCJ is seeking additional agencies and organizations to serve as industry partners by providing internships to candidates for graduation.\n\nTo learn more about the FSCJ human services degree program, visit www.fscj.edu; e-mail bs.humanservices@fscj.edu; or (904) 766-6705.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In May, Sharon Hoose will have a whole new world in front of her.That\u2019s how the Hilliard resident says she will feel upon receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in human services from Florida State College at Jacksonville.Hoose will be among the first students to complete the new program, which school officials say was created to help fill an employment void in the community; some of her classmates graduated in December.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "The new Bachelor of Science in human services from Florida State College at Jacksonville will help students who want to work for community service agencies and organizations.", "title": "New FSCJ program to fill community needs", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/jobs/job-seeker/2016-01-15/story/new-fscj-program-fill-community-needs", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/15047501.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Job Seeker", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"msm-image150": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense150x111/15047501.jpg", "msm-image319": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense319x185/15047501.jpg", "articleid": 670699, "publishtime": "2016-01-15T21:09:26Z", "msm-image320": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense320/15047501.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef1b\"", "article_summary": "To learn more about the FSCJ human services degree program, visit www.fscj.edu; e-mail bs.humanservices@fscj.edu; or (904) 766-6705.\nThe human services program is for students who want to be social and community service managers or counselors.\nIn its marketing information about the human service degree program, FSCJ states that candidates for the degree need compassion, understanding, patience and a willingness to serve.\nThe program also prepares baccalaureate students for graduate-level human services degree curriculums.\nMeanwhile, representatives of River Region Health and Human Services, Clara White Mission and Hubbard House also signed up as industry partners."}
