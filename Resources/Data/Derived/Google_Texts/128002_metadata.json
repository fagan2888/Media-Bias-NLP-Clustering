While the proposal does not say that organizations must cover and refer for abortion, it could be easily interpreted that way, the groups told the government. The religious groups called on HHS to change the rule so that it \u201cstate(s) explicitly\u201d that religious groups cannot be forced to cover or refer for abortions.\n\nThe letter continues, \u201c\u2026 the regulations ought to have a religious exemption of proper scope. We believe that the changes urged in this letter are critical and that without them, the regulations are unlikely to survive scrutiny in the courts.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nPro-life and religious groups are very watchful of new rules handed down through the Obama administration, after investigations revealed that Obama lied about taxpayer funding for abortion in Obamacare. A 2014 non-partisan Government Accountability Office report showed that the health care law provides massive public funding for abortion.\n\nSigning the letter were the National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Family Research Council, World Vision, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Christian Legal Society, Christian Medical Association, Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance, Liberty Institute, and The National Catholic Bioethics Center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Obama Administration Rule Would Make Christian Groups Pay for Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Ten leading Christian organizations are calling on the Obama administration to change a proposed rule that could force religious groups to promote or pay for ab", "title": "New Obama Administration Rule Would Make Christian Groups Pay for Abortions", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/11/11/new-obama-administration-rule-would-make-christian-groups-pay-for-abortions/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/barackobama33.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "new obama administration rule would make christian groups pay for abortions", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Ten leading Christian organizations are calling on the Obama administration to change a proposed rule that could force religious groups to promote or pay for abortions.\nThe religious groups called on HHS to change the rule so that it \u201cstate(s) explicitly\u201d that religious groups cannot be forced to cover or refer for abortions.\nA 2014 non-partisan Government Accountability Office report showed that the health care law provides massive public funding for abortion.\nThe newly-proposed rule from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would expand so-called nondiscrimination policies regarding health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nThe proposed rule includes references to discrimination based on \u201ctermination of pregnancy,\u201d or abortion, according to the letter."}
