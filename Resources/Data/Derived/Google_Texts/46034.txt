Actor Stephen Fry has some choice words for God if he ever finds himself at the pearly gates.

The English actor, who played the Master of Laketown in the last two “Hobbit” movies, called the Christian God “capricious, mean-minded and stupid” while giving an interview for RTE One television in Ireland, Raw Story reported.

“The Meaning of Life” host Gay Byrne asked Mr. Fry what he would say if he was confronted by God upon his death.

“I think I’d say, ‘Bone cancer in children? What’s that about? How dare you! How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault? It’s not right. It’s utterly, utterly evil,’” Mr. Fry responded. “Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?”

“And you think you’re going to get in like that?” Mr. Byrne asked.

“No, but I wouldn’t want to. I wouldn’t want to get in on his terms. They’re wrong,” Mr. Fry said. “Now, if I died and it was Pluto, Hades, and if it was the 12 Greek gods, then I would have more truck with it. Because the Greeks were … they didn’t pretend not to be human in their appetites, and in their capriciousness and in their unreasonableness. They didn’t present themselves as being all-seeing, all-wise, all-kind, all-beneficent.

“The [Christian] God who created this universe — if it was created by God — is quite clearly a maniac. An utter maniac,” he continued. “Totally selfish. We have to spend our life on our knees thanking him? What kind of God would do that?

“It’s perfectly apparent that he is monstrous — utterly monstrous and deserves no respect whatsoever. The moment you banish him, your life becomes simpler, purer, cleaner and more worth living, in my opinion,” Mr. Fry concluded.
