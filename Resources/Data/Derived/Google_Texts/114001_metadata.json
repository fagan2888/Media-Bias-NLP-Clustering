There\u2019s no more cuts to make. It\u2019s really important that people understand that. We cannot have cuts just for the sake of cuts.\u201d\n\nThis is dishonesty on a galactic scale. It also provides an insight into why, short of the mandatory sequestration that went into effect last year when Congress could not come to any agreement on any cuts, the government continues to spend money in ways that are just short of criminal.\n\nIn July, a Rasmussen poll determined that 62% of likely voters thought the government should cut spending in response to the nation\u2019s economic problems. That percentage was actually down from the previous month\u2019s 65% and was the lowest support for reduced spending since August 2012.\n\nThat same month, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that 83% of Americans disapproved of the job performance of Congress. Approval of President Obama\u2019s job performance was closely divided between 45% approval and 50% disapproval.\n\nThere are any number of think tanks and citizen\u2019s organizations that keep tabs on government spending, but their periodic reports and news release seem to have no impact whatever. That\u2019s something that members of Congress and others inside the Beltway know.\n\nAt a time when Republicans and Democrats will lock horns over raising the debt ceiling and the President thinks that any effort to defund the Affordable Care Act is the result of the Republicans \u201cmessing with me\u201d and not a reflection of how widely disliked Obamacare is, it is instructive to look at just a few of the ways public funding is being regularly and routinely squandered in ways that are obscene.\n\nAs just one small example, one good way to save taxpayer dollars would be to shut down the National Science Foundation (NSF). It is spending $5.7 million on a project to develop card games, videos and other \u201ceducational\u201d programs \u201cto engage adult learners and inform public understanding and response to climate change.\u201d Or the Climate Change Educational Partnership (CCEP) was established by Congress in 2009 and, to date, it has already spent $46 million on the \u201cthreat\u201d of something that doesn\u2019t even exist, global warming.\n\nOne of the NSF\u2019s grants went to a study of what motivates workers, love or money? It cost $179,784. Another NSF grant, $2.25 million of your tax dollars on Tasmanian Devil facial tumors. This is an animal native to an island off the coast of Australia nowhere else. Part of another a half-million dollar grant was used to develop a video game the stimulated a high school prom. The NSF funded $350,000 to Purdue University to study how golfers could improve their game.\n\nThe NSF may take top honors for insanely wasteful programs and projects, but there is hardly a single department of the government that does not do the same thing.\n\nAll that whining and wailing about sequestration was really about having fewer dollars to waste and fewer people with which to waste it.\n\nFor example, the Transportation Security Administration lets 5,700 pieces of unused security equipment sit in storage in a Dallas, Texas warehouse. Worth $184 million, it costs the TSA $3.5 million annually to lease the space.\n\nAs Obamacare expands the role of the Internal Revenue Service and we learn how some of its administrators targeted, denying or delaying, a common tax-exempt status to conservative groups routinely granted to all manner of other kinds of organizations, let us not forget the $4.1 million the IRS spent in 2010 on a lavish conference for employees.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture awarded a $149,000 grant to researchers at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey to study how to eliminate the \u201cfreshman 15\u201d extra weight that these students pack on when they can eat anything and as much as they want.\n\nMorocco must have one heck of a good lobbyist because the Labor Department spent $1 million there to improve \u201cgender equality\u201d in the workforce there. The State Department spent $450,000 to develop \u201cgreen jobs.\u201d\n\nDave Ramsey, who advises people on radio, TV and in print on how to manage their personal finances, has said, \u201cThe fact is that government can get out of debt the same way you get out of debt. You quit borrowing money. You quit spending. You balance the budget. But to do all of that, you\u2019ll need to make some sacrifices.\u201d\n\nThe only reason sequestration went into effect was because a blue-ribbon panel of members of Congress could not agree to any reductions in spending.\n\nNow we must endure a few weeks of meaningless political haggling to increase the debt ceiling while the government continues its orgy of senseless spending on projects and programs like those noted above.\n\nc Alan Caruba\n\nAbout:\n\nAlan Caruba\u2019s commentaries are posted daily at \u201cWarning Signs\u201d his popular blog and thereafter on dozens of other websites and blogs.
