Australia is the sixth most expensive place in the world to live in, according to new research\n\nIn it for the long haul: Switzerland is the costliest place to live in the world after four years in second place\n\nAll nations were compared to the cost of living in New York.\n\nFor example, if a country has a consumer price index of 70 on movehub's infographic then on average its cost of living is 30 per cent cheaper than that of New York's.\n\nMovehub explains the cost of groceries took into account the price for meat, bread, rice, eggs, fruits, vegetables and alcohol.\n\nWhile, transportation costs included one-way tickets, monthly passes, taxi fares, petrol prices and other costs related to running a car based on the use of Volkswagen Golf.\n\nTop ten: The UK was 10th on the cost of living table which takes into account groceries and travel\n\nIndia comes out as having the lowest cost of living, with poor wages matched by poor living conditions\n\nMeal prices at expensive, mid-range and inexpensive restaurants were taken into account along with prices of coffee products, alcohol and water.\n\nElectricity, heating, water the internet were the utilities assessed.\n\nTherefore, the average cost of living for an Australian is almost one per cent cheaper than for someone living in the Big Apple.\n\nVenezuela's tightening financial situation has fanned market anxiety about a default, especially as oil slumps to near six-year lows.\n\nPresident Nicholas Maduro has vowed to pay bondholders and most economists doubt a default is coming in the near-term, but investors are getting skittish as the economic crisis worsens.\n\nVenezuela depends on oil for 96 per cent of its export revenue.\n\nThere were not many surprises where it comes to the countries with the lowest cost of living.\n\nIndia topped the pile in this regard, followed in by Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Algeria.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "U,S,affordable,cheaper,Australia,UK,France,cost,living,figures,show", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2915207/U-S-affordable-cheaper-Australia-UK-France-cost-living-figures-show.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "A survey reveals Australia is the sixth-most expensive state to live, and Britain the 10th, in 2015.
