Despite leading the country away from the abyss of the Great Recession, despite being instrumental in lowering the unemployment rate in Indiana (one of the nation\u2019s lowest at 3.8 percent, down from 20 percent seven years ago), and despite the fact that the jobs have returned to Elkhart, Ind., people there are turning away from President Obama and the Democratic Party and are considering voting for Donald Trump.\n\nIt continues to amaze me how people \u2014 especially women \u2014 vote against their best interests and continue to support the Republican Party. According to your article, while the folks in Elkhart are pleased as punch that they are all earning a comfortable wage and that there are so many job openings that employers are seeking workers from elsewhere, they are upset with the president over his stand on gun control. Please.\n\nI am a state representative in New Hampshire and a Democrat. When I was campaigning last year, I met an elderly disabled woman who lived in my ward. She gushed to me that since Obamacare came into being, she no longer had to pay any out-of-pocket costs for her monthly foot treatments at the local hospital.\n\nFiguring this was a sure vote for me and the Democratic Party, I told her that I was counting on her vote in November. She looked at me and said: \u201cOh no, dearie, I will be voting Republican. I always vote Republican.\u201d At first I thought she was pulling my leg, but when I realized she was dead serious, I asked her if she realized that if the Republicans had their way, they would repeal Obamacare in an instant. She looked at me and said, \u201cOh, they wouldn\u2019t do that, would they?\u201d\n\nLEN DiSESA\n\nDover, N.H.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160411032103, "twitter": {"description": "A Democratic state representative in New Hampshire is puzzled, and recounts a telling anecdote.", "title": "Why Do Some Vote Against Their Best Interests?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/opinion/why-do-some-vote-against-their-best-interests.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004310721"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/opinion/why-do-some-vote-against-their-best-interests.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004310721", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/opinion/why-do-some-vote-against-their-best-interests.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Why Do Some Vote Against Their Best Interests?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 11, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Labor and Jobs,Obama  Barack,Elkhart (Ind)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A Democratic state representative in New Hampshire is puzzled, and recounts a telling anecdote.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A Democratic state representative in New Hampshire is puzzled, and recounts a telling anecdote.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 11, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-04-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Elkhart (Ind)", "published": "2016-04-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "Elkhart (Ind)", "slug": "11Lindiana", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160411032706, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/opinion/why-do-some-vote-against-their-best-interests.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A Democratic state representative in New Hampshire is puzzled, and recounts a telling anecdote.", "title": "Why Do Some Vote Against Their Best Interests?"}, "pdate": 20160411, "des": "Labor and Jobs", "articleid": 100000004310721, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Why Do Some Vote Against Their Best Interests?", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "It continues to amaze me how people \u2014 especially women \u2014 vote against their best interests and continue to support the Republican Party.\nFiguring this was a sure vote for me and the Democratic Party, I told her that I was counting on her vote in November.\nShe looked at me and said: \u201cOh no, dearie, I will be voting Republican.\nI always vote Republican.\u201d At first I thought she was pulling my leg, but when I realized she was dead serious, I asked her if she realized that if the Republicans had their way, they would repeal Obamacare in an instant.\nShe looked at me and said, \u201cOh, they wouldn\u2019t do that, would they?\u201dLEN DiSESADover, N.H."}
