Conservatives have made that argument that for decades, and it has been a recent component of the debate over whether to keep extending long-term unemployment benefits that originated as an \u201cemergency\u201d measure five years ago in the midst of the Great Recession\u2019s massive job losses. It is, however, novel to see the Barack Obama White House embrace that effect as a feature of its central social-engineering program, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis week, the CBO issued a new report on the economic impact of the ACA, better known as Obamacare, and the new figures stunned observers. Previously, CBO estimated that the bill would reduce the workforce by 800,000 over its first decade. The new analysis tripled that impact, estimating that the ACA would depress the job market by 2.5 million \u201cfull-time-equivalents\u201d (FTEs) \u2014 wording that touched off a fact-check and claims war.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Will Result in 2 Million Fewer Workers\n\nRepublicans seized on the report to substantiate what they have argued all along \u2013 that the ACA would end up costing the economy jobs, and the cost would be enormous. On this point, the CBO also agreed, increasing the cost estimate by more than double , from its initial estimate of $848 billion over its first decade to more than $2 trillion. That alone shows that the claimed deficit neutrality of Obamacare was a myth, which the GOP has claimed all along.\n\nThe issue on FTEs is more subtle, however, than layoffs or job creation. The CBO carefully defined its findings not as a loss of job demand in the marketplace, but as a loss of job supply. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler pointed this out in a sharp rebuke, citing the specific language in the report.\n\nThe estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor, so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week).\n\nRelated: The Great Obamacare Workforce Exodus\n\nIn other words, the impact from the bill comes from a disincentive to work, thanks to the subsidies provided by Obamacare for purchasing the mandated insurance coverage. The White House loves this explanation, even though it has insisted that the same incentives do not apply on extending unemployment insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is about giving Americans more choices,\u201d said Gene Sperling, the director of Obama\u2019s National Economic Council to CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThese people who are working more than they want to simply for healthcare, some of them will have the option of working a little less.\u201d\n\nHowever, Democrats had a little difficulty keeping that talking point about FTEs and not equating actual jobs and people in line with this defense on \u201cchoice.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also argued that the report offers hope for people to become \u201cfree agents\u201d and avoid \u201cjob lock.\u201d Aaron Blake reported on Twitter that Reid\u2019s fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill associated that directly with the FTE figure from CBO: \u201cNew line from Dems on CBO report: It \"will enable more than 2 million workers to escape 'job-lock.'\u201d\n\nRelated: The Obamacare \u2018Shotgun Wedding\u2019 \u2014 Marry or Lose Your Home\n\nLater, he named Nancy Pelosi \u2013 who once argued that Congress had to pass the bill to discover what it contained \u2013 as the one pushing this new tack. \"Yesterday, the CBO projected that by 2021 the Affordable Care Act will enable more than 2 million workers to escape 'job-lock' \u2013 the situation where workers remain tied to employers for access to health insurance benefits,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office stated.\n\nSo, FTEs do equate to people after all.\n\nThe problem with the job-lock/free-agent argument is still the CBO report. The figure does not predict the number of \u201cfree agents\u201d or job-switchers. It projects the net reduction in hours worked in the American economy, and that\u2019s a big problem, especially for a system that relies on tax revenue for the subsidies that fuel the system.\n\nA reduction of 2.5 million FTEs from Obamacare would result in a reduction of $80.5 billion each year in gross compensation, even at the low-income average of $35,000 a year. That means less economic activity, and lower tax revenues, thanks to the decrease in income that the loss of 2.5 million FTEs entail \u2014 no matter how they disappear.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Aftermath \u2014 Fewer Doctors, Higher Costs\n\nBesides, if the argument in favor of cheering subsidized disincentives to work is to be offered, then we should know how those subsidies work and who benefits. The Obama administration has insisted that the Obamacare subsidy structure benefits middle and working-class families that most often feel the squeeze from government programs. A new study from the liberal Brookings Institute contradicts that claim. Instead, as the study shows, the redistribution comes from all but the bottom quartile of earners.\n\n\u201cOn net and under the broadest income measure, the gains and losses cause small proportional drops in income for Americans in the top three-quarters of the income distribution which offset the larger proportional gains obtained by Americans in the bottom quarter of the distribution,\u201d write Henry J. Aaron and Gary Burtless, and that is under a broader definition of income than the Census Bureau uses.\n\nWhen the study breaks down the distribution by tenths rather than quarters of the population, only the bottom 20 percent will see a net gain in income. In fact, the two steepest drops in average income come from the third and fourth tenths from the bottom, 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. The top tenth will only see a reduction of 0.3 percent in average income.\n\nObamacare, then, not only discourages work and reduces economic activity and tax revenue through the payment of subsidies \u2014 that redistribution impacts the working and middle class disproportionately. One could hardly make a better case for repealing Obamacare, no matter how much confused spin and happy talk emanate from the White House and Capitol Hill Democrats.\n\nAnd now that we all agree that subsidies discourage work, let\u2019s have a real discussion about extending \u201cemergency\u201d long-term unemployment benefits, too.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The argument that government subsidies from redistributed wealth is a disincentive to", "title": "Obamacare Jobs Plan\u2014Tune In, Sign Up, Drop Out", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/06/Obamacare-Jobs-Plan-Turn-Sign-Drop-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05102013_Obama_Solar_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/06/Obamacare-Jobs-Plan-Turn-Sign-Drop-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05102013_Obama_Solar_article.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The argument that government subsidies from redistributed wealth is a disincentive to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A reduction of 2.5 million FTEs from Obamacare would result in a reduction of $80.5 billion each year in gross compensation, even at the low-income average of $35,000 a year.\nThat alone shows that the claimed deficit neutrality of Obamacare was a myth, which the GOP has claimed all along.\nThis week, the CBO issued a new report on the economic impact of the ACA, better known as Obamacare, and the new figures stunned observers.\nAnd now that we all agree that subsidies discourage work, let\u2019s have a real discussion about extending \u201cemergency\u201d long-term unemployment benefits, too.\nRelated: Obamacare Aftermath \u2014 Fewer Doctors, Higher CostsBesides, if the argument in favor of cheering subsidized disincentives to work is to be offered, then we should know how those subsidies work and who benefits."}
