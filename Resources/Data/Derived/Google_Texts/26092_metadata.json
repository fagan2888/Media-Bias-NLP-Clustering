Marco Rubio.\n\nHis great achievement \u2014 helping to shepherd a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the Senate \u2014 proved pyrrhic. It immediately died in the House (though rumors of a piecemeal revivification abound) and its passage in the Senate thoroughly pissed off a conservative base that, in the grip of a profound racial panic, is obsessed with dreaded \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nThe blowback was so fierce that Rubio spent much of the remainder of the year artlessly veering to the far right, hoping to salvage his right-wing bona fides through a series of symbolic votes that did little more than make the likely presidential aspirant look like \u201ca walking press release announcing a no vote,\u201d as Jim Newell memorably put it.\n\nThe whole thing was kind of sad, really, and watching it evoked a feeling not unlike that brought on by reading the final pages of \u201c1984.\u201d By the time he was voting to prolong the government shutdown, breach the debt ceiling, and deny millions much-needed unemployment insurance, it was fair to say that Rubio had \u201cwon the victory over himself.\u201d He loved Big Brother.\n\nNo surprise, then, to see the once-and-future 2016 contender kick off the new year with yet another rebranding campaign, this one seemingly intended to mend fences with an establishment that had watched his earlier pandering with growing chagrin. Forget comprehensive immigration reform; in 2014, Marco Rubio has a new noble crusade on his mind. He\u2019s fighting a war on poverty.\n\nBut despite my strong desire to be a fair-minded, discerning and nonpartisan individual \u2014 a liberal, in the best sense of the word \u2014 I must confess that my reaction to Rubio\u2019s big speech on poverty has been far less sanguine than that of the New Republic\u2019s Jonathan Cohn. Like Salon\u2019s Alex Pareene, I\u2019m skeptical.\n\n\u201cRubio engaged in a conversation Republicans have shunned for too long,\u201d wrote Cohn. \u201cThat\u2019s progress.\u201d But I think Pareene was closer to the mark when he wrote that, for GOPers, feigning concern for the indigent is \u201cone way to help shake the correct impression voters have that Republicans are devoted solely to the further enrichment of the already wealthy.\u201d I\u2019m a glass half-empty kind of guy, I suppose.\n\nIn Cohn\u2019s defense, he acknowledges that just because Rubio has put forward some policy ideas, \u201c[t]hat doesn\u2019t mean they were good proposals.\u201d Indeed, from what Rubio has outlined thus far \u2014 his speech was, understandably, sketchy on the details \u2014 the senator\u2019s ideas for helping the poor are seriously problematic. And what are those ideas? 1) To replace the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) with a wage subsidy; and 2) to transform all of the federal government\u2019s existing anti-poverty programs into a big fund that D.C. would hand over to the states to handle on their own.\n\nNow, while there\u2019s definitely a good argument to be made in favor of wage subsidies, Rubio\u2019s decision to scrap the EITC in their favor is somewhat perplexing. True, the EITC isn\u2019t perfect; it\u2019s very effective for those with families while being considerably less supportive for childless adults. But that\u2019s an argument for expanding the EITC for childless adults \u2014 or adding wage subsidies in addition to the EITC \u2014 not scrapping the program entirely.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a horrendous 2013 in which he backtracked on immigration, he's back with a new cause: Making poverty worse", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s cynical new low: A poverty plan destined to fail", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After a horrendous 2013 in which he backtracked on immigration, he's back with a new cause: Making poverty worse", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s cynical new low: A poverty plan destined to fail", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/marco_rubios_cynical_new_low_a_poverty_plan_destined_to_fail/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/AP130312132579-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a horrendous 2013 in which he backtracked on immigration, he's back with a new cause: Making poverty worse", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s cynical new low: A poverty plan destined to fail", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/AP130312132579-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alex Pareene, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Earned Income Tax Credit, Editor's Picks, Inequality, Jamelle Bouie, Jim Newell, Jonathan Cohn, Marco Rubio, Poverty, Sharon Parrott, The Daily Beast, The New Republic, Wage subsidies, War on Poverty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d49\"", "article_summary": "Forget comprehensive immigration reform; in 2014, Marco Rubio has a new noble crusade on his mind.\nBut that\u2019s an argument for expanding the EITC for childless adults \u2014 or adding wage subsidies in addition to the EITC \u2014 not scrapping the program entirely.\nNow, while there\u2019s definitely a good argument to be made in favor of wage subsidies, Rubio\u2019s decision to scrap the EITC in their favor is somewhat perplexing.\nTrue, the EITC isn\u2019t perfect; it\u2019s very effective for those with families while being considerably less supportive for childless adults.\nTopics: Alex Pareene, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Earned Income Tax Credit, Editor's Picks, Inequality, Jamelle Bouie, Jim Newell, Jonathan Cohn, Marco Rubio, Poverty, Sharon Parrott, The Daily Beast, The New Republic, Wage subsidies, War on Poverty, Politics NewsTruth be told, 2013 was not a good year for Florida Sen.
