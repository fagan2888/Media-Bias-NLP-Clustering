For example, in 2016, subsidies are available in 2016 for a family of four with an income of up to $97,000.\n\nResearchers say the finding is encouraging as it shows that a key Patient and Affordable Care Act objective \u2014 getting more people to have checkups to spot medical problems before they develop into expensive complications \u2014 is being met.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are really reassuring.
