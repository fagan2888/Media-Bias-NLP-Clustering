1) Haley Bonar – Last War

“Last War” is artist Haley Bonar’s fifth album. In this record, Bonar has found a unique and cohesive sound that still allows her voice to shine. The album has a darker more expansive feel that is at times reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine. Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon collaborates on two tracks, “Eat for Free” and “From a Cage.” Their lyrical-folk-feel harkens back to her earlier work. The song “No Sensitive Man” can be listened to below:

2) Conor Oberst – Upside Down Mountain

Conor Oberst began making emotionally charged music as a teen in his parent’s home in Omaha, Nebraska. For an artist whose music has been characterized by disconcertingly relatable teenage angst (in Bright Eyes), this album it’s both refreshing and familiar. In “Upside Down Mountain,” Obsert returns to his lyrical roots, tackling love, happiness and his past in his characteristically poetic way. Though Oberst has created music in a variety and genres (and side projects) — punk, country, electronic — “Upside Down Mountain’s” folk-rock-sound showcases Conor at his best.
