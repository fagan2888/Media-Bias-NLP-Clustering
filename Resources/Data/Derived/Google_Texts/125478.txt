From the moment Google started offering “free” email, which users “paid” by allowing Google to target ads based on keywords in the content of their emails, anyone paying attention understood that Google’s access to intimate information about our lives is breathtaking. But over the last month, the extent to which Google has expanded its surveillance capabilities is still astonishing.

On Friday, Nest, the subsidiary of Google that makes “smart” thermostats and smoke alarms and aspires to provide “the operating system of the home,” announced it was purchasing DropCam, a security company that operates in-home webcams. Then, on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Nest would for the first time start sharing user information with Google.

The integration will allow those users to set the temperature of their homes with voice commands to a Google mobile app. It will also allow Google’s personal digital assistant, Google Now, to set the temperature automatically when it detects, using a smartphone’s location-tracking abilities, that a user is returning home.

When the news that Google was buying Nest broke in January, co-founder Tony Nadell declared that “our privacy policy clearly limits the use of customer information to providing and improving Nest’s products and services. We’ve always taken privacy seriously and this will not change.”
