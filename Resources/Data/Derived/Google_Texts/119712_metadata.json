Linda Sanchez at a State of the Nation address Wednesday.\n\nSanchez spoke to members of several local chambers of commerce Wednesday, touching upon far-ranging topics including the Affordable Care Act, jobs, higher wages and the gridlock in Congress.\n\nShe called the speech before members of the Artesia, Lakewood, Norwalk and Santa Fe Springs chambers of commerce at the Double Tree by Hilton a chance to speak directly to constituents.\n\n\u201cEvery August, during summer recess, I have an opportunity to meet and chat with local folks and find out what is happening in the communities I represent, \u201c said Sanchez, D-Norwalk.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, she continued, \u201cWashington is still firmly gridlocked.\u201d\n\nHow to break the cycle of gridlock\n\nSurprisingly, the source of some of the legislative impasse is not Democrats versus Republicans, but between GOP senators and house members, she said.\n\n\u201cThere is an inability for Republicans in the senate and in the house to work together,\u201d she explained. Nonetheless, Sanchez, who is the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said there are \u201cglimmers of hope for a breakthrough\u201d regarding the gridlock.\n\n\u201cMost members are working hard for their constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cConsensus is not always easy, but we are trying to find common ground.\u201d\n\nDisconnect between jobs and wages\n\nThe good news coming from Washington is a stronger economy and more jobs, Sanchez said.\n\n\u201cThe economic recovery has been steady with 13 million jobs created in the last 65 months,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nSince last year at this time, the unemployment rate has dipped from 6.2 percent to 5.3 percent.\n\nHowever, she admitted, a lot of people have not directly felt the positive upturn in the economy because wages have remained stagnant.\n\nOne potential cure Sanchez supported was raising the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cPaying workers a livable wage makes a great difference,\u201d she said.\n\nDefending the Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has proven to be mostly successful since its passage five years ago, Sanchez said.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s uninsured rate is the lowest ever recorded,\u201d she said. \u201cMedical costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe Latino community, she said, has 4.2 million adults now with coverage.\n\n\u201cThe hope is to stop arguing about the Affordable Care Act, and if it\u2019s going to stay, and instead to work to fine tune it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NORWALK >> It isn\u2019t Democrats and Republicans who need to learn to work together to end Washington gridlock, but GOP senators and house members, said Rep.
