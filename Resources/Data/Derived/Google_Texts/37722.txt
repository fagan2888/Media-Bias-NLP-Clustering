Insurance denials based on 'pre-existing condition'

Hampton cancer patient's care before and after Affordable Care Act

Popadak duly signed up to pay $230 a month, but he missed the clause in the carrier's small print that exempted preexisting conditions from coverage. Even if he hadn't missed the clause, the sound engineer, self-employed and without insurance since 2000, wouldn't have believed that it applied to him. When he purchased his insurance, he didn't have a diagnosis. "I knew I had a lump, but I didn't know I had cancer," he said.

After more than a decade without health insurance and more than four years without a visit to a doctor, Popadak bought insurance in September 2013. He was concerned about a lump on his jaw, but his long-ago doctor deemed him a "new patient" and refused to see him without insurance.

Since then he has learned that "pre-existing condition" is a legal, rather than a medical term. He has kept a log of his bills on an Excel spreadsheet. The vast majority have been denied — labs, doctor visits, hospital stays — leaving him responsible for almost $100,000. His insurance has paid $2,739.04.

A timeline:

• May 2013, Popadak cut himself shaving and felt "a little bump" in his neck, about the size of a pea.

• Summer 2013, the lump grew to about 1 inch by 2 inches; his friends started asking about it.

• August 2013, he went to a doctor who had given him a physical in 2006. He was deemed a new patient and the doctor wouldn't see him without insurance. He went to an urgent care doctor who didn't want to give him a diagnosis if he didn't have insurance in order to avoid a future problem with a pre-existing condition; the doctor gave him a break and charged the standard co-pay.

• Sept. 14, 2013 he purchased insurance and received notice on Oct. 2, 2013 that his coverage was effective. "I picked a plan with a deductible and premium I could afford," he said.

• Oct. 2, 2013 he went to family doctor who scheduled a CT scan. Two weeks passed and he didn't hear anything. His insurance refused it. His doctor sent him to an ENT, ear, nose, throat specialist. Once again, insurance refused a CT scan. Instead, as it didn't need prior authorization, he had an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

• Oct. 24, 2013 he was diagnosed with cancer. His CT scan was denied again, this time based on "pre-existing condition," under the "usual and customary" clause despite his not having had a diagnosis prior to purchase of insurance. "I knew I had a lump," said Popadak. "I didn't know I had cancer." His bill for treatment of high cholesterol was also denied.

• Nov. 14, 2013, he started a chemotherapy regimen with three kinds — two were delivered through a drip over five hours; the third was delivered by a pump in a slow feed over five days.

• Three weeks later, Popadak repeated the regimen. "It shrank the lump down immediately. It damn near killed me," he said.

• Jan. 1, 2014, he applied for new insurance through the state marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act.

• Jan. 3, 2014 he started a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. He received radiation five days a week for seven weeks and finished on Feb. 28.

• Feb. 1, 2014, his new insurance took effect.

• In February, he wrote a check to the oncologist for $650 for February's treatments, the limit of his annual out-of-pocket payments.
