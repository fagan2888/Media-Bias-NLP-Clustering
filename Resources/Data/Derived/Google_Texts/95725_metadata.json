Just about every one of those predictions turned out to be wrong\n\nBut in fairness, there is one thing GOP officials said that turned out to be correct. The right argued \u2013 it was more a fear than a predication \u2013 that once \u201cObamacare\u201d was in place, and American families and consumers came to rely on the system\u2019s benefits, it would be awfully difficult, if not impossible, for Republicans to simply take those benefits away. And five years later, that sounds about right.\n\nIn Arkansas, for example, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), soon after taking office earlier this year, had to decide whether to scrap the state\u2019s Medicaid-expansion policy. The Republican was vague on the issue during his 2014 campaign, but in January, Hutchinson announced he wanted to see the policy remain in place, at least for a while, to prevent public suffering.\n\nYesterday, as the Arkansas News reported , the governor suggested he\u2019s prepared to make the policy permanent.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday he is open to continuing to accept federal funding for Medicaid expansion if the federal government grants the state increased flexibility in shaping its health-care programs. \u201cAs governor, I will accept the continued expansion dollars from the federal government if we can achieve the (Medicaid) waivers that are needed,\u201d Hutchinson told a joint meeting of the Health Reform Legislative Task Force and the Governor\u2019s Advisory Council on Medicaid Reform.\n\nIn fairness, the governor has a whole bunch of ideas about how to make the policy as conservative as possible, but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that Hutchinson has no interest in scrapping Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a compassionate state. We\u2019re not going to leave 220,000 without some recourse, without some access to care,\u201d he said\n\nExactly. That\u2019s the point.\n\nArkansas may be a ruby-red state now \u2013 President Obama lost the state by 24 points in his re-election bid \u2013 and the word \u201cObamacare\u201d probably polls horribly. But on a national level, few states need the ACA as desperately as Arkansas, and even fewer have benefited more from the reform law.\n\nJust this month, Gallup showed the states with the largest drop in the uninsured rate. Arkansas was #1\n\nHutchinson\u2019s proposed changes certainly matter, and they\u2019ll be the subject of an important debate. But the broader point remains the same: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave 220,000 without some recourse, without some access to care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "There's a difference between GOP policymakers telling the public, \"We hate the president, so you're losing your insurance,\" and actually going through with it.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arkansas-reluctant-give-medicaid-benefits", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "There's a difference between GOP policymakers telling the public, \"We hate the president, so you're losing your insurance,\" and actually going through with it.", "title": "Arkansas reluctant to give up on Medicaid benefits", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arkansas-reluctant-give-medicaid-benefits", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/arkansas_primary_.jpeg-02928.jpg?itok=g7Wovefu", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arkansas-reluctant-give-medicaid-benefits", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/arkansas_primary_.jpeg-02928.jpg?itok=XsNZyFqS", "height": 553}, "title": "Arkansas reluctant to give up on Medicaid benefits", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "There's a difference between GOP policymakers telling the public, \"We hate the president, so you're losing your insurance,\" and actually going through with it."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-20T11:21:48-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,arkansas,asa-hutchinson,health,health-care,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Arkansas reluctant to give up on Medicaid benefits", "published": 1, "date": "08/20/2015 11:21:48 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arkansas-reluctant-give-medicaid-benefits"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "There's a difference between GOP policymakers telling the public, \"We hate the president, so you're losing your insurance,\" and actually going through with it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health Care Reform, Health, Affordable Care Act, Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, Health Care, Medicaid, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1026\"", "article_summary": "Yesterday, as the Arkansas News reported , the governor suggested he\u2019s prepared to make the policy permanent.\nArkansas was #1Hutchinson\u2019s proposed changes certainly matter, and they\u2019ll be the subject of an important debate.\nAsa Hutchinson (R), soon after taking office earlier this year, had to decide whether to scrap the state\u2019s Medicaid-expansion policy.\nIn fairness, the governor has a whole bunch of ideas about how to make the policy as conservative as possible, but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that Hutchinson has no interest in scrapping Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion.\nBut on a national level, few states need the ACA as desperately as Arkansas, and even fewer have benefited more from the reform law."}
