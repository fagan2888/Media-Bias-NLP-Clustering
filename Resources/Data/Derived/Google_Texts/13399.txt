Jeremy, the eldest of the Thompson brothers, is in his third season with the Edmonton Rush and was acquired by the Hamilton Nationals in the first round, going sixth overall in 2011. He was also picked in the second round (10th overall) in the 2011 National Lacrosse League Entry Draft. The 27-year-old is currently a finalist for the 2014 NLL Transition Player of the Year award.
