We\u2019ve run out of money,\u201d Obama said last week, then hedged by saying the move might merely be reallocating existing resources.\n\nA day earlier, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted: \u201cBy pulling their own [immigration-related] bill, the House GOP once again proves why the President must act on his own to solve problems.\u201d\n\nThe criticism proved premature, considering the House later passed legislation that includes $694 million to help deal with the current immigration crisis. And by Sunday, Pfeiffer was backing off his go-it-alone push.\n\nHe said talk about Obama acting immediately was \u201cuniformed speculation,\u201d arguing that the departments of Justice and Homeland Security have yet to provide him with the legal guidance and other information needed before taking action.\n\nHowever, Pfeiffer remained ambiguous about when Obama would act, saying only it will be \u201cat the end of summer\u201d -- which unofficially ends Sept. 1, Labor Day, and officially ends Sept. 21.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see,\u201d he told ABC.\n\nObama addressed the issue again on Wednesday, saying he would \u201cscour over\u201d U.S. laws and regulations to see what authority he has to continue issuing executive orders but argued he has never had a \u201cgreen light\u201d to violate the Constitution or White House powers.\n\nThose who suspect Obama will likely issue an executive order over Congress\u2019 five-week break think that will likely happen during the middle of the first family\u2019s vacation on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts, when he returns to Washington Aug. 17-19 to White House meetings on undisclosed matters.\n\nIn addition to the immigration issue, Obama could also take action to stop U.S. companies from establishing overseas headquarters to avoid federal taxes -- a situation that Congress also has not resolved legislatively.\n\nLeaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate suggest they will have a proposed fix in September but are asking Obama to take action now to stop the corporate tax dodge -- known as \u201cinversion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge you to use your authority to reduce or eliminate tax breaks associated with inversions,\u201d Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Ill., Jack Reed, R.I., and Elizabeth Warren, Mass., wrote in a letter Tuesday to Obama. \u201cInverted corporations take advantage of all the things American tax dollars provide \u2026 . Yet these companies claim to be foreign corporations when it\u2019s time to pay their tax bill.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the Treasury Department made clear the administration is indeed considering acting alone.\n\n\u201cThere are limits to what Treasury can do without action by Congress,\u201d an agency spokesperson said. \u201cNonetheless, Treasury is reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative actions that could limit the ability of companies to engage in inversions.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s 2012 executive order deferred deportation for roughly a half million young illegal immigrants brought in the U.S. by their parents.\n\nBut his next executive action reportedly could extend delayed deportation to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants, including adults who knowingly came to the U.S.\n\nSuch a move could be politically risky for fellow Democrats with Election Day about 10 weeks out.\n\nJust 31 percent of Americans approve of the president\u2019s handling of the immigration issue, according to a June 20 Gallup poll.\n\nObama continues to point out that he taken fewer executive actions than any of the past three presidents -- one Democrat and two Republicans. And he argues the best and long-term solutions can be achieved only by passing legislation.\n\n\u201cGet things done,\u201d he told Congress last week.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
