Rev. David Zubik, the Catholic bishop for Pittsburgh, is leading the charge in the case, which consolidated the complaints of objecting Christian universities and groups like Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nHobby Lobby won a Supreme Court case last year that allowed businesses to opt out of providing certain contraceptives for religious reasons, but it did not extend to nonprofits. The Obama administration hoped to appease religious groups by allowing them to submit an exemption form and allow a third party to provide it instead. But the groups have still taken issue with this and sued. Now the case is before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe groups say they are still involved in the process of providing the contraceptives by facilitating the coverage. They say the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) protects them from having to violate their consciences by participating in providing contraception, even if they don\u2019t pay for it. RFRA law states there must be a compelling government interest for violating sincerely held religious beliefs and that the violation must be done in the least restrictive way possible. The groups argue Obamacare has not met that burden.\n\nBut Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death is a tough loss for the Obamacare opponents, and Justice Anthony Kennedy could likely be the swing vote. During his September visit to the U.S., Pope Francis met with the Little Sisters of the Poor to support their fight.\n\nDo You Think Parts Of Obamacare Are Unconstitutional?

Nor should the government be allowed to say that the Sisters aren\u2019t \u2018religious enough\u2019 to merit the exemption that churches and other religious ministries have received.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nSend tips to [email protected].
