It\u2019s a crucial provision of Obamacare, bringing in much-needed revenue and trying to curb the incentive for employers to offer outlandish insurance plans to their workers. But it doesn\u2019t kick in until 2018, so it\u2019s going to be the next president\u2019s problem.\n\nIf Clinton opposes it, she\u2019ll be running against nearly every U.S. health policy expert and the White House. They all see it as clunky but necessary to reduce health care costs.\n\nBut politically, fighting the Cadillac tax is a winner. Republicans hate it because it increases revenue and is simply part of Obamacare. And unions object to it because they often negotiate generous health plans in lieu of higher take-home pay. It\u2019s no wonder that \u2014 as POLITICO\u2019s Brian Faler reported in a deep look at the topic in April \u2014 the Cadillac tax is shaping up to be the next big Obamacare fight.\n\nClinton didn\u2019t say exactly what she\u2019d do, but in her response to the AFT questionnaire, she began to stake out a position. \u201cAs currently structured,\u201d Clinton wrote, \u201cI worry that it may create an incentive to substantially lower the value of the benefits package and shift more and more costs to consumers.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean exactly? Clinton\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised to see her call for eliminating the tax, since it would open her to attacks for undermining the progress made on containing health costs (not from her primary opponents, but from MSM and health policy experts),\u201d Guy Molyneaux, a Democratic strategist, wrote in an email. \u201cBut I could certainly see her calling for changes that would ease the impact on union plans.\u201d\n\nEasing the impact won\u2019t be easy, particularly as Republicans are almost certain to retain at least the House in the next Congress. They aren\u2019t going to accept a carve-out for unions. But repealing it altogether is also difficult, since it would require finding $87 billion in additional revenue or spending offsets. Like so many other issues in Washington these days, lawmakers face a fraught issue with a specific deadline, and no clear solution \u2014 but a lot of political points to score by complaining about it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Agenda", "description": "The candidate drops a hint at America's next big healthcare fight", "title": "Hillary: I'm 'examining' Obamacare's Cadillac tax", "url": "http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/07/hillary-im-examining-obamacares-cadillac-tax-000150", "image": "http://static.politico.com/b1/13/130d84bc4f93aae2b56c2163f788/20150716-hillary-clinton-gty-1160.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/DannyRVinik"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicoagenda", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicoagenda"}, "description": "The candidate drops a hint at America's next big healthcare fight", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But politically, fighting the Cadillac tax is a winner.\nIn a questionnaire for the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), which endorsed her this week, Clinton noted that the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d levied under Obamacare is one area she is \u201cexamining.\u201dThe Cadillac Tax is a surcharge on expensive health care plans.\nAnd unions object to it because they often negotiate generous health plans in lieu of higher take-home pay.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that \u2014 as POLITICO\u2019s Brian Faler reported in a deep look at the topic in April \u2014 the Cadillac tax is shaping up to be the next big Obamacare fight.\nIf Clinton opposes it, she\u2019ll be running against nearly every U.S. health policy expert and the White House."}
