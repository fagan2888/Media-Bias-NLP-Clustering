The IRS \u2014 whose Tea Party-targeting scandal is now over 1,100 days old without anyone being charged or sent to jail \u2014 seems to have a habit of \u201daccidentally\u201d destroying hard drives containing potentially incriminating evidence. It has done so in spite of court orders, in spite of Congressional inquiries and in spite of pretty much everyone\u2019s belief that these \u201caccidents\u201d were actually the deliberate, illegal destruction of incriminating evidence to protect the guilty.\n\nThe IRS scandal would have sunk a Republican administration, perhaps leading to impeachment. But the Democratic press is in on the joke, and the Obama administration is set to run out the clock in its usual fashion.\n\nThen there\u2019s Hillary\u2019s email scandal, in which emails kept on a private unsecure server \u2014 presumably to avoid Freedom of Information Act disclosures \u2014 were deleted. Now emails from Hillary\u2019s IT guy, who is believed to have set up the server, have gone poof.\n\nThe only way Hillary will be indicted, as she certainly deserves to be, is if the Democrats decide that she can\u2019t beat Donald Trump\u2013an increasingly likely eventuality\u2013and decide to go with someone else.\n\n\u201cDestroy the evidence, and you\u2019ve got it made,\u201d said an old frozen dinner commercial. But now that appears to be the motto of the United States government.\n\nSad but true. Worst of all, perhaps, is the way Barack Obama and his Attorneys General, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have corrupted the Department of Justice. Time after time, federal judges have found that DOJ lawyers have lied to the courts on behalf to the Obama administration\u2019s political agenda. Paul described the latest instance, and one of the most shocking, here.\n\nThen there is the fact that Barack Obama is a scofflaw. Repeatedly, he has ignored the Constitution and violated federal law, refusing to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws, imperiously changing his own Obamacare statute with no legal authority, and so on. Years later, the courts sometimes catch up with him; the administration has lost a number of 9-0 Supreme Court decisions where its lawbreaking was indisputable. But more broadly, the Obama administration\u2019s campaign of lawbreaking and stonewalling has succeeded.\n\nGlenn asks the right question: if our purported leaders are scofflaws, why should the rest of us be honest?\n\nSo why do the rest of us bother to obey the law? And, yes, that\u2019s an increasingly serious question.\n\n***\n\n[P]eople may obey the law because they think that being law-abiding is an important part of maintaining a viable society. But that\u2019s the kind of law-abiding behavior that\u2019s at risk when people at the top treat the law with unconcealed contempt. Being law-abiding for its own sake is a traditional part of bourgeois culture, and our ruling class has lately treated the bourgeoisie with contempt as well. Which raises the risk that this contempt will be returned.\n\nIt is being returned, as evidenced by the Trump and Sanders candidacies.\n\nAmerica has been \u2014 and, for the moment, remains \u2014 a high-trust society. In high-trust societies, people extend trust to strangers and follow rules for the most part even when nobody is watching. In low-trust societies, trust seldom extends beyond close family, and everybody cheats if they can get away with it. High-trust societies are much nicer places to live than low-trust ones. But a fish rots from the head and the head of our society is looking pretty rotten.\n\nWhich is why this year\u2019s election is so important. Barack Obama\u2019s legacy must be repudiated, root and branch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Glenn Reynolds\u2019 current USA Today column addresses the rapid decline of the United States as a high-trust society, something that sociologists have found to be critical for economic developme\u2026", "title": "We Are a Fish, Rotting From the Head", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/05/we-are-a-fish-rotting-from-the-head.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2016/05/shutterstock_49263286.jpg?resize=879%2C660&w=240", "site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-24T01:57:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-24T01:57:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But a fish rots from the head and the head of our society is looking pretty rotten.\nIn high-trust societies, people extend trust to strangers and follow rules for the most part even when nobody is watching.\nBut the Democratic press is in on the joke, and the Obama administration is set to run out the clock in its usual fashion.\nHigh-trust societies are much nicer places to live than low-trust ones.\nAmerica has been \u2014 and, for the moment, remains \u2014 a high-trust society."}
