The residents said for several preceding days, a man had been entering their front porch, taking shoes that were left outside and swapping them for other shoes.\n\nThe residents said they were so concerned they purchased a surveillance system to monitor the porch and the inside of the house.\n\nThursday, the residents were monitoring the system when they saw Sills approach the house. The residents confronted him and detained him until police arrived.\n\nSills told police he buys and sells women\u2019s shoes at a local flea market. The vehicle that Sills used to drive to the residence had approximately 100 pairs of women\u2019s shoes inside.\n\nSills denied being at the woman\u2019s home before, but officers said they recovered shoes that were stolen from the home.\n\nPolice said there have been several similar incidents, and they are investigating whether Sills was involved in them.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 17:31:20 -0400", "Description": "An alleged shoe bandit stepped on the wrong toes when he started swiping footwear from outside a Pinellas Park home, police said.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "An alleged shoe bandit stepped on the wrong toes when he started swiping footwear from outside a Pinellas Park home, police said.", "title": "Pinellas Park residents snare alleged shoe bandit", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/pinellas-park-residents-snare-alleged-shoe-bandit-20150314/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150314/ARTICLE/150319505/EP/1/1/EP-150319505.jpg", "height": 600}, "updated_time": "2015-03-14T17:31:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "An alleged shoe bandit stepped on the wrong toes when he started swiping footwear from outside a Pinellas Park home, police said.", "title": "Pinellas Park residents snare alleged shoe bandit", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150314/ARTICLE/150319505/AR/0/AR-150319505.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-03-14T17:31:20Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-03-14T17:31:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e67\"", "article_summary": "An alleged shoe bandit stepped on the wrong toes when he started swiping footwear from outside a Pinellas Park home, police said.\nThe vehicle that Sills used to drive to the residence had approximately 100 pairs of women\u2019s shoes inside.\nSills told police he buys and sells women\u2019s shoes at a local flea market.\nRusty Wayne Sills, 46, of Largo is being held in the Pinellas County Jail on $10,000 bail on a charge of burglary.\nThe residents said they were so concerned they purchased a surveillance system to monitor the porch and the inside of the house."}
