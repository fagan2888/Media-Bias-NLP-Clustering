I told him it didn\u2019t, and I went out to my car and got my colander,\u201d Hammond told KFOR.com. \u201cHe kind of chuckled, giggled, gave me a funny look and asked me what religion I was. I said I was a Pastafarian.\u201d\n\nPastafarianism is a religion where there are \u201cno strict rules and regulations, there are no rote rituals and prayers and other nonsense,\u201d according to the church\u2019s website.\n\nHammond said she is an Atheist and believes no one should be forced into certain beliefs.\n\n\u201cFor me the colander represents freedom, our freedom of religion, and to whatever religion we prefer or lack of religion. It was important to me to exercise that, even if it\u2019s just a driver\u2019s license photo,\u201d she said.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol officials said they would review of the picture to make sure it followed all the rules. If it did, authorities said they may look at changing the rule of religious headwear because it is more than 10-years old.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shawna Hammond said the strainer did not violate state law that required religious headpieces to present a clear view of your face.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "Shawna Hammond said the strainer did not violate state law that required religious headpieces to present a clear view of your face.", "title": "Woman claims spaghetti strainer as religious headwear in license picture", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2014/09/06/pastafarian-drivers-license/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/okla-license.jpeg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/okla-license.jpeg?w=640"}, "site": "@cbs6", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2014-09-06T19:20:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-06T19:20:31+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "keywords": "national, news,", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1600\"", "article_summary": "If it did, authorities said they may look at changing the rule of religious headwear because it is more than 10-years old.\n\u201cI asked if I could wear my religious headwear and he said, yes, it just couldn\u2019t have any logos, or any type of writing.\nENID, Okla. \u2013 An Oklahoma woman was allowed to wear a spaghetti strainer on her head in her state driver\u2019s license photo after she said it symbolized her religious freedom.\nShawna Hammond said the strainer did not violate state law that required religious headpieces to present a clear view of your face.\n\u201cFor me the colander represents freedom, our freedom of religion, and to whatever religion we prefer or lack of religion."}
