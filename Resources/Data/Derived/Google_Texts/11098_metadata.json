I think of seeing my family,\u201d Katrina said.\n\nTucked along the St. John River and the Canadian border, Madawaska boasts an impressive seclusion by the standards of 21st-century millennials like the Daigle sisters. With scarce cellphone service and limited Internet capability, the town of 4,000 is an escape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so secluded that we have to focus our entire attention onto visiting with our families,\u201d Katrina said. \u201cA lot of times, when people are with their families, the younger generations are on their phones or computers and they\u2019re still connected to their lives back at home. But up here, we\u2019re really not. We don\u2019t have service, we don\u2019t have Internet. So it\u2019s just family, and that is really what matters to us most.\u201d\n\nWith Thanksgiving around the corner, Katrina and Lauren\u2019s invited the Bangor Daily News for a look at what going home for the holidays means for them.\n\nLasagna, ployes, poutine\n\nAfter a four-hour trip from Bangor, the sisters arrived around 9 p.m. at their paternal grandparents\u2019 house \u2014 or \u201ccamp,\u201d as they call it \u2014 on Long Lake, just outside of Madawaska. Clad in robes and slippers, their meme and pepe emerged to exchange hugs and hellos with them.\n\nMoments later, their meme, Dorilda Daigle, pulled out a lasagna she made for their arrival and insisted they sit and eat. Immediately after the last bites of the welcome home meal were eaten, Meme Daigle shuffle into the cellar and emerged with two trays of sweet treats.\n\n\u201cMeme has never not been awaiting our arrival with food. It is always at our fingertips,\u201d Lauren said. \u201c[Meme] pushes food, and I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. Usually she\u2019ll start making desserts months in advance and freeze them until we get up here.\u201d\n\nDorilda and her husband, Norman, maintained the camp for years as a place for their family to visit in the summer, as many families in Maine do. Eventually, the family winterized the home to make it a year-round residence, but Dorilda says it will always have the feeling of camp.\n\n\u201cWe used to come here during the summer and stay until September when school started, and then we went back in town,\u201d Dorilda said. \u201cBut Norm, oh Norm, loves the lake. I keep saying \u2018our camp, our camp,\u2019 and that\u2019s because it will always be a camp.\u201d\n\nThe next morning gave way to a breakfast of homemade toast, buttered and ready for grilling, alongside farm-fresh eggs of assorted colors and sizes. Though bacon and doughnuts were added to the meal, Meme Daigle insisted this was a lighter spread than usual visits.\n\nOnce Pepe Daigle left for a drive around the lake and Meme Daigle headed into town for her weekly hair appointment, the girls went to see their mother\u2019s parents.\n\nSimone and Lionel Doucette live just across a few sprawling potato fields from the lake \u2014 a spot considered closer to town but still far enough where they can only see one neighbor for what seems like miles.\n\nLauren and Katrina walk into the 150-year-old home to the aroma of love, in the flavor of deep-fried hand-cut potatoes served underneath homemade gravy and a generous helping of cheese. The girls set themselves up around the kitchen counter as Meme Doucette dished out servings upon servings of the French-Canadian delicacy, poutine.\n\nAs the snow picked up outside the kitchen windows, steam bellowed from the stove as Meme Douchette whipped up more tastes of home: beef stew and ployes, a traditional Acadian buckwheat pancake.\n\n\u201cMeme, you didn\u2019t have to make all of this. The stew and poutine would have been enough,\u201d Lauren said.\n\n\u201cAh, no, no. It\u2019s Meme\u2019s secret recipe. Ployes and stew \u2014 you can\u2019t have one without the other,\u201d Meme Doucette said.\n\nBoots for church?\n\nWhile in other parts of the country, the rest of the afternoon might have happened at a local mall. Saturday shopping in Madawaska usually involves trips to the local Shop \u2018n Save or Mardens, so the girls head into town. They need to find clothes for church that evening.\n\nAfter tirelessly searching Marden\u2019s for a better shoe option, Katrina settles on wearing her L.L. Bean Boots to church \u2014 an option her grandmother does not like but is still a practical one, considering the inches of snow that accumulated over the day.\n\n\u201cEverything is pretty casual and practical up here, but there is something to be said about having to look presentable in certain circumstances,\u201d Katrina said.\n\nThe Daigle sisters know that if they are in Madawaska, church is not optional. On this Saturday night, the traffic leaving the 4 p.m. Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Church\u2019s went straight for the Knights of Columbus Hall, where a spaghetti supper fundraiser was being held to help a local family with medical costs.\n\nAs soon as the girls entered the hall, aunts, uncles and cousins of varied relation approach them with hugs and questions about how they are doing.\n\n\u201cMadawaska is so small. Everyone knows each other. I have never seen a greater sense of community anywhere else, and that is something that resonates with me wherever I [visit],\u201d Lauren said.\n\nOnce everything wrapped, and 450 meals had been taken to the paper mill to feed workers who could not attend the supper, the Doucettes and their granddaughters made the snowy trek home. When arriving home, Katrina asked her Pepe Douchette to play his fiddle, but he thought it was too late and he promised her he would play in the morning \u2014 and play he did.\n\nLionel has never read a note of music in his life. Instead, he has learned every song he plays on his fiddle by ear. Though after learning the instrument at age 13 and performing in local dance halls since age 16, Lionel holds the demeanor of a seasoned musician.\n\n\u201cAfter I learned how to play a few tunes that we considered fluent enough for people to dance to, my sister started accompanying me on the keyboard,\u201d Lionel said. \u201cUp here, this instrument is considered a violin. But in an orchestra atmosphere, this would be considered a fiddle.\u201d\n\n\u2018Just a small meal\u2019\n\nBefore heading back to Bangor, the girls had \u2014 of course \u2014 one more meal to enjoy. Lauren and Katrina\u2019s aunt capitalized on the opportunity to host an early Thanksgiving, since so many family members were in town.\n\nShe insisted this would be a small meal \u2014 and, \u201cno, they didn\u2019t need to bring anything.\u201d However, the girls were met with a 21-pound turkey, stuffing, biscuits, mashed potatoes, a potato casserole, green bean casserole, turnip and carrots and cranberry sauce. And that was just the main course. After dishes were finished and stomachs just about full, dessert came.\n\nThis meant a tower of sweet treats, including chocolate Oreo balls, butterscotch bark, a chocolates cake and not one but two butterscotch pies \u2014 a Daigle family favorite.\n\n\u201cThis is just something that we do up here. Everyone is in town so we are going to have a turkey. Even if it\u2019s not around a holiday, it gets treated like it is a holiday. All the food is there, and everybody is together,\u201d Lauren said.\n\nStomachs full and hearts heavy, the girls say their goodbyes and traveled back down Route 1 toward Bangor. But they\u2019ll be back. Before even reaching the Madawaska town line, the sisters began to plan their next trip up north.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For young Mainers, holiday homecomings offer the perfect chance to ditch devices and recharge their personal batteries amid family, friends and way too much food.
