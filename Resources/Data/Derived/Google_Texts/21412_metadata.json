People are generally not very public with that, and may be actually hard to find people that to give you honest responses in surveys. And on the flip side, you may actually have a hard time finding the people who are using drugs at the highest levels because they don\u2019t respond to surveys \u2014 they\u2019re in jail or or they\u2019re in a hospital setting or something like that. So the idea of actually getting a real measure of the actual level of use is quite compelling to people.\u201d\n\nOn the importance of accurate drug use trend numbers\n\n\u201cWhen it comes the drugs, everybody\u2019s an expert. Drugs are actually a very complicated issue. And what we find out is that it\u2019s very easy for people to think they know what\u2019s going on. You may be in a mid- to small-sized town and hear from the sheriff or the PTA, you know, drug Q is the new big, hot thing. And you have no way of know if that\u2019s true or not. There has not been good information for everybody, from my perspective, in terms of really informing whatever the policy debate needs to be around drugs. And I think we need to be having good, vigorous policy debates. We need good quality information, and right now we have very poor information. We can\u2019t have a good conversation without that high quality data.\u201d\n\nOn the question of privacy\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is looking at a chemical makeup. Something like methamphetamine, we\u2019re actually looking for that chemical compound. There are no identifiers at all of the individual associated with that. We\u2019re just looking at the methamphetamine. In fact, we\u2019re looking at methamphetamine that could have come from a thousand different people. We\u2019re just looking for the amount of that chemical in the wastewater. So when we\u2019re looking at a community-wide perspective like an entire city or even a smaller town, like three or five thousand people, that\u2019s all getting mixed together. And what I can tell you at the end of the day, for instance, might be that while on average per thousand people there might be 300 milligrams of methamphetamine used, and I might be able to back-calculate that and say, well I think in a city of 5,000 people that might mean you have 50 users. But I can\u2019t tell you who they are or where they are.\u201d\n\nGuest", "article_metadata": {"description": "From methamphetamines in London to cocaine in Oregon, scientists are figuring out which drugs are running through a city just by looking at something everyone leaves behind.", "application-name": "WBUR: Here and Now", "og": {"site_name": "hereandnow", "description": "From methamphetamines in London to cocaine in Oregon, scientists are figuring out which drugs are running through a city just by looking at something everyone leaves behind.", "title": "Scientists Test Wastewater To Track Drug Use", "url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/02/04/drug-use-wastewater", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2014/02/0203_wastewater-plant-624x402.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/02/04/drug-use-wastewater", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2014/02/0203_wastewater-plant-624x402.jpg", "site": "@HereAndNow", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists Test Wastewater To Track Drug Use"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-04", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaace\"", "article_summary": "You may be in a mid- to small-sized town and hear from the sheriff or the PTA, you know, drug Q is the new big, hot thing.\nInterview Highlights: Caleb Banta-GreenOn why wastewater testing is appealing to drug researchers\u201cDrug use is a hidden phenomenon.\nSomething like methamphetamine, we\u2019re actually looking for that chemical compound.\nThere has not been good information for everybody, from my perspective, in terms of really informing whatever the policy debate needs to be around drugs.\nAnd what we find out is that it\u2019s very easy for people to think they know what\u2019s going on."}
