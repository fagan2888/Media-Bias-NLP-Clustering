Every two seconds someone in the United States needs blood and 4.5 Million Americans will need blood transfusions each year. Sadly, only five percent of the eligible United States population donates blood in any given year. Healthy donors are the only source of blood for the supplies that are needed to save lives. Currently there is no substitute. If all blood donors gave three times a year, blood shortages would be a rare event!

Why is blood such an important part of every day life? Blood is the liquid that circulates throughout the entire body carrying nutrients to every cell and at the same time carrying away waste products. Blood plays a central role in the body's defenses. Through a network of miles and miles of vessels, blood is pumped by the heart to every part of the body. The average adult body contains about 10 pints of blood.

Humans can't live without blood. Without blood, the body's organs couldn't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive; we couldn't keep warm or cool off, fight infections, or get rid of our own waste products. Blood donation sites throughout the United States ensure that the safest possible blood is readily available whenever and wherever needed; for the military, blood centers across the United States and for all 5,000 of America's hospitals.

The next blood drive will be held Jan. 26, from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Estes Park Medical Center's Longs Peak and Meeker Conference Room.

The general guidelines for donating blood are as follows:

• Individuals must be healthy and be at least 17 years old

• Weight must be at least 110 pound

• Individuals must not have donated blood in the last 8 weeks (56 days) or a donation of double red cells in the last 16 weeks (111 days)

• Healthy means that you feel well and can perform normal activities

• If you have a chronic condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure, "healthy" also means that you are being treated and the condition is under control.

Other aspects of each potential donor's health history are discussed as part of the donation process before any blood is collected. Each donor receives a brief examination during which temperature, pulse, blood pressure and blood count (hemoglobin or hematocrit) are measured.

Before you donate:

• Get a good night's sleep

• Have a good breakfast or lunch

• Eat iron rich foods - red meat, fish, poultry, beans, iron fortified cereals, raisins, etc.

• Avoid fatty food before donating - tests for infections done on all donated blood can be affected by fatty materials that can appear in your blood for several hours after eating fatty foods. When this occurs and required testing cannot be performed, the blood may need to be discarded.

• Be sure to bring personal identification.

It isn't every day you can do something to save someone's life - but that's exactly what you do every time you donate blood. Blood is a priceless gift - a lifesaver. Even the best trained medical personnel, using the most advanced equipment can become helpless in the event a patient needs blood. The gift of blood can only come from another human being ...there are no substitutes.
