Who misled him?\u201d Todd asked. \u201cWho misled the president on this? Are you telling me \u2026 somebody let the president go out to the American public to give this speech and say this and make this promise? In fact, the next line is: \u2018I promise you, this is a lot easier, it\u2019s like booking a hotel or plane ticket.\u2019 Who let him down?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s frustrated,\u201d Carney replied. \u201c(W)e\u2019re focused on making improvements so that the millions of Americans who want affordable health insurance are getting the best.\u201d\n\nTodd asked again whether Obama was \u201clet down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, what I\u2019ll tell you as I mentioned earlier, I think, is that there\u2019s no question that the volumes exceeded substantially expectations and that the testing that was done was based on \u2013\u201d Carney began.\n\n\u201cAdding a server would have fixed it in a heartbeat. That isn\u2019t the issue, right?\u201d Todd interjected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019re not a \u2013\u201d Carney said.\n\n\u201cI am not a computer science guy,\u201d Todd said.\n\n\u201c\u2013 you haven\u2019t written code in your day,\u201d Carney completed.\n\n\u201cI understand that but if this were simply a traffic issue, that\u2019s fixable fast, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Todd pressed.\n\nCarney restated the White House\u2019s position that the failures are in some part due to a supposedly high volume of people trying to enroll in the exchanges.\n\nCarney was also asked whether the law\u2019s individual mandate would be delayed if people are unable to register for a plan.\n\nABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl asked if people would still be subject to a penalty for not having health care if they can\u2019t access the site to buy it online.\n\nCarney said that in some cases, those who don\u2019t have access to health insurance may not be subject to fines, but he did not directly address it in terms of the website glitches.\n\n\u201cThe law itself as written, makes clear who have access to affordable insurance will need to have insurance by March 31,\u201d Carney said. \u201cNow the people who do not have access to affordable care, due to example to a state not expanding Medicaid, and there are states out there who are depriving their own citizens to access to expanded Medicaid or due to other factors\u201d will not face the same penalties.\n\nCarney was also asked if there is a firm timeline in mind to have the system glitches worked out.\n\n\u201c(Obama\u2019s) deadline, his insistence is that every minute of every hour of every day going forward, this problem has to be addressed,\u201d Carney said.\n\nTheBlaze\u2019s Fred Lucas contributed to this report.\n\n(H/T: Washington Free Beacon)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Amid widespread acknowledgementabout the failure of a key aspect of Obamacare, NBC News' Chuck Todd pressed White House spokesman Jay Carney on one question Monday: Who told the president the program was ready?
