Authorities investigating a prostitution ring involving underage children said they have rescued a 16-year-old girl victim who was found a Windsor Locks motel.

In December, Windsor Locks Police and the FBI Task Force for Missing and Exploited Children learned that a “multi-jurisdictional prostitution ring involving underage children” was operating in Windsor Locks, as well as other locations, police said, and began working together to find the children involved.

After five days, authorities found a 16-year-old girl at the Motel 6 in Windsor Locks, identified her and were able to remove her from the premises.

The FBI task force arranged for medical care and for the girl to safely return to her family out of state.

“In this case the Windsor Locks Police were able to remove a young child from a dangerous, unthinkable situation involving the sexual exploitation of underage children,” police said in a release.

The investigation is ongoing and police ask anyone with information about these types of crimes to notify police and help them find children.
