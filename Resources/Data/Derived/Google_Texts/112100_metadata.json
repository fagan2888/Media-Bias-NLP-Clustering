Northam read Noah\u2019s electroencephalogram and sent the 7-year-old home from the hospital with a dose of powerful anti-seizure medication and instructions to return for more tests.\n\nNortham\u2019s work as a doctor is a far cry from his other day job, presiding over the Virginia Senate, where he welcomes visitors to Mr. Jefferson\u2019s Capitol and enforces the chamber\u2019s arcane rules.\n\nMost Virginians don\u2019t know that the lieutenant governor spends much of his time treating sick children as a pediatric neurologist. More to the point, most Virginians don\u2019t know who the lieutenant governor is.\n\nNortham (D) is the latest in a long line of politicians toiling in relative obscurity in a largely ceremonial post for a chance to become the commonwealth\u2019s next governor. He\u2019s first in line to take over should anything happen to Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a fellow Democrat. But he has a steep hill to climb to win the job in an election.\n\nA native of the rural Eastern Shore with a distinctive drawl, a military background and hunting skills, Northam ascended to the statewide stage at a tumultuous moment in Virginia politics.\n\nVirginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam stands behind Deborah L. Stitzer-Brame as the staff of EDMARC, a child hospice center, begins to gather for a routine staff meeting at its headquarters in Portsmouth. Stitzer-Brame is the executive director of the organization and Northam volunteers as its medical director. (Timothy C. Wright/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn a state party that is tilting left to appeal to a growing base of young, urban and nonwhite voters, Northam has a centrist image that can look out of place at first blush. As a state senator, he revealed an independent streak that occasionally irritated other Democrats.\n\nLast year, Northam ran for statewide office on a record of supporting women\u2019s reproductive rights, gun control and Medicaid expansion \u2014 playing up his progressive side and a doctor-soldier bio that won over even the state\u2019s liberal Northern Virginia electorate during the Democratic primary.\n\nFar from the most dynamic guy to hit Virginia\u2019s political stage, Northam must find a way to emerge from the shadow of the two other Democrats who have monopolized the political stage since they all assumed office in January. McAuliffe has dominated headlines in partisan battles with the Republican-controlled House of Delegates over expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd Attorney General Mark R. Herring, another former state senator with a centrist reputation, has taken controversial positions in support of gay marriage and providing in-state tuition to some undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn contrast, Northam has maintained the same methodical, steady-hand-on-the-tiller approach that he brings to other aspects of his life.\n\n\u201cMy job is to reach out to people on both sides of the aisle on the issues that I feel strongly about,\u201d he has said more than once.\n\nBut Northam appears acutely aware of his challenge: He doesn\u2019t have to run against the term-limited McAuliffe to become governor, but Herring is a likely rival for the Democratic nomination. Northam is collecting chits by helping fellow Democrats raise money, and he has adopted issues newly relevant to Virginia\u2019s changing electorate that could position him for a gubernatorial bid in 2017.\n\nVirginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam drives his Toyota Prius back to his office after meeting patients and medical residents at the Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters in Norfolk. Seated in the back seat is his policy director, Holly Coy. (Timothy C. Wright/For The Washington Post)\n\nOnancock beginnings\n\nNortham, 54, grew up hunting and fishing on the Eastern Shore. He and his wife, Pam, raised their children, Wes and Aubrey, not far from the Chesapeake Bay-side Onancock farm where his parents, a commonwealth\u2019s attorney-turned-judge and a nurse, raised him.\n\nAt Onancock High School, he was voted \u201cMost Likely to Succeed,\u201d played the French horn and was \u201cone of the few white guys on the basketball team\u201d in his predominantly African American class, said the Class of \u201977 president, Carla Y. Savage-Wells. An obsession with fixing up old cars started about that time with a \u201953 Oldsmobile (he still has it) and continues today with a \u201971 Corvette.\n\nShortly after he was elected to the Senate in 2007, Northam angered some Democrats when he crossed party lines to end an impasse over judicial appointments. Thinking they had a sympathetic ear, Republicans asked him to switch parties. He declined.\n\nSen. Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City), who became the majority leader after control of the chamber shifted in early June, said Northam has been more in line with the Democratic Party since winning statewide office.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a criticism. That\u2019s just a reality of politics when you get to that level,\u201d said Norment, who bonded with Northam over their alma mater, the Virginia Military Institute.\n\nAs a state senator, Northam executed a partisan political coup for Democrats in 2012 by igniting a national firestorm over a weak spot in Republican legislation that called for women to undergo ultrasounds before an abortion. On the floor of the Senate, Northam explained that the bill would require invasive \u201ctransvaginal\u201d ultrasounds in most cases because standard abdominal ultrasounds show nothing in the early stages of a pregnancy, when most abortions are performed.\n\n\u201cI might as well put the ultrasound probe on this bottle of Gatorade,\u201d Northam said at the time, holding up the drink. \u201cI\u2019m going to see just as much.\u201d\n\nWhat had seemed like the kind of abortion regulation \u2014 such as parental consent and 24-hour wait times \u2014 that many Virginians support had morphed into a government invasion of women\u2019s bodies.\n\nThe bill\u2019s chief sponsor, state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Winchester), looked dumbstruck by what Northam said, state Sen. George L. Barker (D-Fairfax) recalled.\n\nNortham also raised his profile by spearheading the state\u2019s smoking ban and says he\u2019ll push a bill to legalize a specific strain of medical marijuana for sick children. He also lamented the General Assembly\u2019s relative powerlessness in combating childhood obesity. Walking past soda machines in the hospital, he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to get rid of those.\u201d\n\nNortham won\u2019t entertain questions about a potential gubernatorial campaign or his long-term political strategy, but he appears to be preparing for the next step.\n\nHis chief of staff, Clark Mercer, was political director for the state party during last year\u2019s Democratic sweep of three statewide races, and his PAC has raised about $140,000. Northam is headlining fundraisers for legislative hopefuls from Arlington County to southwest Virginia, making himself known to activists and donors.\n\nAnd he showed that he can win over voters in the Democratic stronghold of Northern Virginia, where he narrowly beat tech guru Aneesh Chopra \u2014 President Obama\u2019s pick as the nation\u2019s first chief technology officer \u2014 in last year\u2019s Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cHe has a nice folksy style, but he uses that style to convey pretty strong progressive values about women\u2019s reproductive rights, for example, or gay and lesbian rights or whatever the issue might be,\u201d said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.). \u201cIt\u2019s almost jarring. With that drawl, you don\u2019t necessarily expect to hear those kinds of sentiments.\u201d\n\nSoldiers and children\n\nNortham\u2019s work in health care is one source of that authenticity. He entered VMI bent on becoming a fighter pilot, but a failed vision exam led him to Eastern Virginia Medical School, from which his son just graduated. After completing his pediatric residencyat Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio and a child neurology fellowship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Northam was sent to Germany, where he treated Gulf War wounded.\n\nNortham was discharged in 1992 as a major; he still wears his dark hair cropped short, and suits hang off his slim, 6-foot-1 frame.\n\nAbout four days a week, he sees up to 20 patients a day in Norfolk at the specialty practice he helped found in 1998 at Children\u2019s Hospital of the King\u2019s Daughters.\n\nThis is where Northam seems most at ease, confidently strolling the halls, doling out \u201cHow are ya\u2019lls?\u201d and \u201cYes, ma\u2019ams\u201d to the staff. His exam rooms are decorated with fish decals and his office door declares, \u201cGone Fishing.\u201d\n\nIn a recent meeting with students, Northam explained that strokes in kids are uncommon \u2014 \u201crarer than hen\u2019s teeth,\u201d in fact.\n\nFor 16 years, Northam has also been the volunteer medical director for Edmarc Hospice for Children in Portsmouth, a nonprofit organization that serves children not expected to survive into adulthood.\n\nAfter a recent examination of a 4-month-old, Northam ordered a genetic test to confirm his hunch about the baby\u2019s condition before telling the parents that she would probably die. But the insurance company refused to cover the test, wouldn\u2019t entertain an appeal from Northam and delayed the diagnosis for weeks.\n\n\u201cIt pulls the rug right out of the relationship with doctor and patient,\u201d he said.\n\nHis daily frustration over insurance companies\u2019 influence on medical care motivated him to enter politics.\n\nPriorities\n\nNortham juggles the demands of his practice with presiding over the Senate and traveling the state in a white Prius. But doctoring often trumps politics \u2014 at least for now. Northam planned to join McAuliffe and Herring as they worked the crowd at a three-day medical-dental clinic set up at a county fairground in far southwest Virginia recently, but the real-life doctor had to see his own patients.\n\nLieutenant governor is technically a part-time job and pays $36,321 a year. When the General Assembly is in session, Northam sometimes sleeps on a couch near his office.\n\nWith few constitutional obligations, he is focused on issues that remind voters of his medical expertise and are just newsworthy enough to yield benign statewide attention while showing his Hampton Roads base that he hasn\u2019t forgotten them.\n\nNortham heads the governor\u2019s task force on mental health, formed after the son of state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Bath) stabbed his father before taking his own life. Northam supports universal pre-kindergarten in public schools and is committed to redeveloping the decommissioned Army base at Fort Monroe in Hampton.\n\nHis legislative priorities pale beside Herring\u2019s headline-grabbing refusal to defend the state\u2019s gay marriage ban and decision that some undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children could qualify for in-state college tuition.\n\nBill Bolling, a two-term lieutenant governor who was outmaneuvered for the GOP nomination for governor last year by then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II, said it\u2019s tough to gain political or policy traction in the post.\n\nThe last time a lieutenant governor won the top job over an attorney general of the same party was in 1989, when Democrat Mary Sue Terry moved aside for L. Douglas Wilder.\n\nBut Northam marches on. One morning this spring, he rode an elevator to the top floor of a downtown Richmond high-rise to attend a breakfast fundraiser for Del. Sam Rasoul (D-Roanoke). When he asked a receptionist for directions, she explained that he was in the wrong building. He smiled and thanked her, unfazed that she didn\u2019t recognize him.\n\nBolling remembered similar moments when he held the office. \u201cIt was amazing to me,\u201d he said, \u201chow many people didn\u2019t have a clue who I was.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, Ralph Northam, Mark Herring, lieutenant governor", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Va.\u2019s low-profile Lt.
