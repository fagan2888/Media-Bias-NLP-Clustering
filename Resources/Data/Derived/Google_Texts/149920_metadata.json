In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shooting at Fort Hood, the second in five years, calls are growing for the military to allow base personnel to arm themselves.\n\nRep. Steve Stockman, Texas Republican, renewed his effort last week for House members to support his \u201cSafe Military Bases Act,\u201d which would repeal the ban on bringing weapons on base. Currently only base-security personnel are permitted to carry arms in most cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the third mass shooting on a military base in five years, and it\u2019s because our trained soldiers aren\u2019t allowed to carry defensive weapons,\u201d said Mr. Stockman in a statement. \u201cAnti-gun activists have turned our military bases into soft targets for killers.\u201d\n\nFort Hood was scarred by tragedy for the second time when Spc. Ivan Lopez, 34, killed three and wounded 16 after opening fire Wednesday with a .45-caliber pistol he smuggled onto the base. He took his own life after being confronted by an armed security officer.\n\nRep. Roger Williams, Texas Republican, whose district includes the base, told the Burleson Star that the gunman might have been stopped sooner had more people on the base been allowed to carry weapons.\n\n\u201cIf they had been armed, they probably could have stopped this action, said Mr. Williams. \u201cThese are the most highly trained people we have with weapons. They are returning from overseas war zones. They shouldn\u2019t have to return to their homes \u2014 on our military bases \u2014 and face a war zone.\u201d\n\nMilitary bases are becoming increasingly popular targets for shootings, but so far the Pentagon has stood firm on its policy limiting who may carry weapons on base.\n\nAfter Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan shot and killed 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009, the Defense Department examined its policies on concealed carry, and again after the deadly September shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart.\n\n\u201cDoD does not support arming all personnel. We hold this position for many reasons,\u201d said Mr. Pickart in an email. \u201cSome of the top reasons are safety concerns, the prohibitive costs of use-of-force and weapons training, qualification costs, and compliance with various weapons screening laws (for example, the Lautenberg Amendment).\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, DoD guidance does provide flexibility to Component and Installation Commanders to arm additional personnel based on necessity as long as they can meet the requirements of Department of Defense Directive 5210.56,\u201d said Mr. Pickart.\n\nThat directive states that arming military personnel with firearms \u201cshall be limited and controlled.\u201d\n\n\u201cQualified personnel shall be armed when required for assigned duties and there is reasonable expectation that DoD installations, property, or personnel lives or DoD assets will be jeopardized if personnel are not armed,\u201d says the directive.\n\nSteven Bucci, former commander of the Army 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces, and now with the Heritage Foundation, said he sees problems with allowing military or civilian personnel to carry firearms on base.\n\n\u201cI just get very concerned about some of these comments,\u201d said Mr. Bucci. \u201cFort Hood is the size of a small city. There are all kinds of people there \u2014 do you really want everyone around there carrying a weapon? And trust me, I\u2019m a big Second Amendment advocate.\u201d\n\nMr. Bucci added that military installations \u201cprobably have less crime than anywhere else, but when you do have something happen, it\u2019s pretty spectacular.\u201d\n\nThat position was echoed by Adm. Michael Mullen, former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one, as someone who\u2019s been on many, many bases and posts, that would argue for arming anybody that\u2019s on base,\u201d said Mr. Mullen.\n\nEven so, Rep. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who heads the House Homeland Security Committee, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he wants to revisit the issue.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take very long to wound and kill a large number of people,\u201d said Mr. McCaul. \u201cI think that would be a deterrent, number one, and number two, a way to have a quick response to any sort of shooter that\u2019s come on these bases.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fort Hood may seem worlds apart from Sandy Hook Elementary School, but they have at least two things in common: Both have been victimized recently by horrific mass shootings, and neither allows the carrying of firearms.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fort Hood may seem worlds apart from Sandy Hook Elementary School, but they have at least two things in common: Both have been victimized recently by horrific mass shootings, and neither allows the carrying of firearms.", "title": "Calls rise after Fort Hood to allow carrying firearms on base", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/5/calls-rise-after-fort-hood-allow-carrying-firearms/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/03/fort-hoodjpeg-0a0fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/03/fort-hoodjpeg-0a0fb.jpg", "description": "Fort Hood may seem worlds apart from Sandy Hook Elementary School, but they have at least two things in common: Both have been victimized recently by horrific mass shootings, and neither allows the ca", "card": "summary", "title": "Calls rise after Fort Hood to allow carrying firearms on base"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Fort Hood, Ivan Lopez"}, "article_summary": "In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shooting at Fort Hood, the second in five years, calls are growing for the military to allow base personnel to arm themselves.\nFort Hood may seem worlds apart from Sandy Hook Elementary School, but they have at least two things in common: Both have been victimized recently by horrific mass shootings, and neither allows the carrying of firearms.\n\u201cFort Hood is the size of a small city.\n\u201cAnti-gun activists have turned our military bases into soft targets for killers.\u201dFort Hood was scarred by tragedy for the second time when Spc.\nRep.
