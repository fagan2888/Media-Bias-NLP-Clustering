Door to HealthCare is a Healthy Howard program that is the western region's official connector organization for the insurance marketplace.\n\nNov. 9, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange will roll out an improved Maryland Health Connection website marketplace, Masten said. All consumers shopping for health insurance on the exchange for the 2015 calendar year \u2014 even those who currently have a qualified health plan through the exchange \u2014 should re-enroll between Nov. 15 and Dec. 18, Masten said.\n\n\u201cIt is clearly easier to use,\" Masten said.\n\nThe exchange is a public corporation and an independent unit of Maryland state government that administers Maryland Health Connection.\n\nLast year, Chung's center reached out to minority groups \u2014 including communities that speak more than 20 languages and anyone in search of answers \u2014 as they navigated their new insurance options, the law's requirement and a troubled website. Door to Healthcare navigators and assisters will be available again to help consumers through the process.\n\nLast year's first round with the state's online marketplace did not capture all of the estimated 20,825 in Frederick who had no health care coverage.\n\n\u201cWe still have work to do,\u201d Chung said.\n\nThe first round did get 2,367 Frederick County residents enrolled in qualified health plans, and 7,544 were added to Medicaid, which was expanded to include more people, Masten said. For 2014, Maryland enrolled 72,207 in qualified health plans, with 11,145 of those coming from the western region of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard and Washington counties.\n\nAgain this year, Chung said her center intends to set up enrollment stations, with multilingual assistants, in various community locations.\n\nExchange representatives announced that Cigna Health and Life Insurance Co. is the newest carrier in the marketplace for 2015. Cigna joins CareFirst, Evergreen, Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealthCare, all of which offered plans in the exchange in 2014.\n\nThe new website will allow people to browse the options anonymously, allowing people to see different plans and make comparisons, Carolyn Quattrocki, executive director of the exchange, said in a news release.\n\n\u00a92014 The Frederick News-Post (Frederick, Md.)", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "The new website will allow people to browse options anonymously, allowing people to see different plans and make comparisons.", "pubDate": "2014-10-9", "og": {"title": "Maryland HIX Expands Options for 2014 Enrollment"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4dc8\"", "article_summary": "Nov. 9, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange will roll out an improved Maryland Health Connection website marketplace, Masten said.\nMaryland health care consumers will discover a better website and more health insurance options this year, according to state program directors and local community organizers.\nThe exchange is a public corporation and an independent unit of Maryland state government that administers Maryland Health Connection.\nFor 2014, Maryland enrolled 72,207 in qualified health plans, with 11,145 of those coming from the western region of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard and Washington counties.\nAgain this year, Chung said her center intends to set up enrollment stations, with multilingual assistants, in various community locations."}
