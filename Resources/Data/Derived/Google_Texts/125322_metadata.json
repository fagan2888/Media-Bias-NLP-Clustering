The argument that that can not be done is baloney,\" Bevin said during his first news conference since his victory in the governor's election Tuesday.\n\nAlso during the news conference, the Republican governor-elect repeated his pledge to dismantle kynect, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange that has been hailed as a national model. And Bevin said he will not be releasing his tax returns even though he said during the campaign that he would do so if elected.\n\nWhile he repeated his election night comment that Republicans and Democrats must work together as \"one Kentucky\" to tackle the challenges ahead, he made clear that he believes voters gave him a mandate to carry out his conservative agenda.\n\n\"I think the people of Kentucky have clearly spoken, ...\" he said. \"We have a clear political mandate where the people clearly state, 'We want something new. We want to be heard.'\"\n\nOne thing Bevin said he will do quickly is issue an order that addresses the situation of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who was jailed by a federal judge in September for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite a U.S. Supreme Court order legalizing such marriages.\n\nOutgoing Gov. Steve Beshear has said only the General Assembly can make such a change, and Beshear declined to call a special legislative session for the legislature to change the marriage licensing form and procedure.\n\nBut Bevin said Friday: \"We've already changed those forms three times, for crying out loud. ... I do intend to make that change. We will take the names off of those forms. We will do that by executive order. We will do it right out of the gate.\"\n\nBevin said the changes will allow a marriage license to be filed and recorded with a clerk like other legal documents such as mortgages or deeds without the clerk being the issuer.\n\nRegarding kynect, the online service people use to shop for health coverage or determine whether they are eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Bevin said \"my intent is to have it wound down by the end of next year.\u201d\n\nInstead, Bevin said he will transition people to the federal site, Healthcare.gov, to shop for insurance under the law, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nBevin said 34 states never created a health exchange and Kentucky simply doesn\u2019t need one.\n\n\u201cIt adds no value,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a redundancy that we as taxpayers in this state are paying for twice.\u201d\n\nBut the decommissioning process will be complicated and costly \u2014 state officials have estimated shutting down kynect could cost upwards of $20 million, money the state would have to repay the federal government, which financed the startup. Federal officials also require a 12-month notice before a state can shut down an exchange.\n\nAnd health advocates warn many people are likely to go without insurance if the state shuts down kynect, which has been praised as simple, accessible and easy to use.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot of people who fall through the cracks,\u201d said Bill Wagner, executive director of Family Healthy Centers in Louisville, a network of community health clinics.\n\nIn addition to offering a good website, kynect has knowledgeable staff on hand to help with problems and assist with enrollment, he said. As a result, Kentucky has had an enormous success with locating and enrolling people in health care plans, many of whom never had prior insurance, Wagner and other health advocates said.\n\nSince Kentucky implemented the federal health law in 2013 by executive order of Beshear, about 400,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in Medicaid and another 100,000 purchased private health plans through kynect. Kentucky\u2019s success in enrolling people resulted in the sharpest drop in the nation of residents with no health insurance, now about 9%.\n\nBut the health plan has long been the target of Republicans in the Kentucky legislature and nationwide, who criticize it as excessively broad and costly.\n\nBevin also said that his administration will begin work immediately to scale back the Medicaid expansion authorized by the federal law, which permits people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level to enroll. That\u2019s an annual income of about $33,000 a year for a family of four.\n\nBevin said he wants to obtain permission, or a waiver, that would allow Kentucky to create its own plan that would include some cost-sharing by consumers instead of the mostly free coverage Medicaid now provides.\n\nA handful of states have obtained federal waivers to create their own Medicaid expansion plans, with most involving cost-sharing through co-pays or premiums. Bevin said he expects to create a similar plan for Kentucky.\n\n\u201cIt will involve people having some skin in the game ... taking personal and financial responsibility for these things,\u201d he said, repeating a pledge he made often during his campaign.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean people will lose coverage right away, he said.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t an attempt to cut people off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an attempt to have people take responsibility.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1iIggTf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Matt Bevin also pledged to dismantle the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Matt Bevin also pledged to dismantle the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "title": "Kentucky\u2019s governor-elect to remove clerk name from marriage form", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/11/06/kentuckys-governor-elect-remove-clerk-name-marriage-form/75313564/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Matt Bevin also pledged to dismantle the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "title": "Kentucky\u2019s governor-elect to remove clerk name from marriage form", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e9e5e2defd96e13787b5b0d87879d7440535822/c=0-507-1987-2494&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "Kentucky\u2019s governor-elect to remove clerk name from marriage form", "author": "Tom Loftus, Joseph Gerth and Deborah Yetter", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation-now", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30879fc4440d1e0e5196ee94b4724e63dd43e8ca/c=0-175-1981-2816/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51d8913b7731b86a05daca7d05828d04ed9c72ed/c=0-507-1987-2494/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79a0118215758d9c5ef820045ac0ac5113f02b6d/c=0-28-1981-1517/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9888c568d23f1bd15d4a86b95721f6cb99d45c8b/c=0-348-1981-1467&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-06T15:51:56.503000-05:00", "shorthed": "Ky.\u2019s governor-elect to remove clerk name from marriage form", "articleid": 75313564, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0c6c90bdcfb4212b3998cb3b857acc5f4e44d95/c=0-348-1981-1467/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eeec2b4b99f2271466e53d729cec9c043fa8170e/c=153-0-1833-3000/local/-/media/2015/11/06/Louisville/Louisville/635824121787853688--DSC9652.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Kentucky\u2019s success in enrolling people resulted in the sharpest drop in the nation of residents with no health insurance, now about 9%.\nAlso during the news conference, the Republican governor-elect repeated his pledge to dismantle kynect, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange that has been hailed as a national model.\nBevin said the changes will allow a marriage license to be filed and recorded with a clerk like other legal documents such as mortgages or deeds without the clerk being the issuer.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Kynect \"adds no value\" that the federal exchange doesn't provide, the Kentucky governor-elect said Friday at the State Capitol in Frankfort.\nAnd Bevin said he will not be releasing his tax returns even though he said during the campaign that he would do so if elected."}
