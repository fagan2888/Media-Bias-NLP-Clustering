In addition, UnitedHealthcare has offered a narrower network of health care providers than either Highmark or UPMC.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, price is the competition,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cWhen you start comparing prices, people have chosen to go with Highmark or UPMC.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Scott worried about the impact on rates if UnitedHealthcare decides at some point to pull up stakes.\n\n\u201cIf or when they leave, my fear is other carriers may do the same, which would be bad for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need competition to help maintain stability, even if at the moment they aren\u2019t the first choice in Western Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare, the biggest health care insurer nationally by membership, anticipated losses of $500 million on its 2016 exchange business, which it offers in 34 states. Other insurers have reported similar losses on the coverage.\n\nDowntown-based Highmark, the fourth biggest Blue Cross and Blue Shield carrier in the country, on April 1 reported losing $1.6 million a day \u2014 $590 million in all \u2014 on its Affordable Care Act exchange plans in 2015, paying $1.20 in care for every premium dollar received.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on the sustainability of our ACA plans and need to secure the rates necessary to keep the plans viable in the future,\u201d Highmark said in a statement Monday.\n\nInsurers have blamed losses in the ACA market on higher than anticipated medical costs for many members who were not previously insured.\n\nNeither Highmark nor UPMC plan to stop participating in Pennsylvania\u2019s exchange marketplace. \u201cUPMC Health Plan welcomes the opportunity to provide coverage for the health insurance marketplace, regardless of changes in the market,\u201d the carrier said in a statement Monday.\n\nAnother competitor, Aetna, said no final decisions had been made about its 2017 exchange offerings.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of evaluating the outlook for the marketplace in 2017 to help us make final decisions on where we will participate,\u201d the company said in a statement Monday.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania carriers have stopped paying broker commissions for ACA plan sales until 2017, a strategy intended to dampen sales of money-losing products without the carrier having to pull out of the market.\n\nUnitedHealthcare has 289,131 ACA members in 23 counties of Pennsylvania, less than one-third of the 439,235 individual marketplace members statewide, according to a new study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The carrier offers one of the two lowest-cost silver plans in 14 Pennsylvania counties.\n\nKris B.
