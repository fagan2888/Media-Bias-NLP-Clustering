Fishing boats. Houses. Entire villages. The 2004 tsunami left Banda Aceh with mountains of debris up to 6 kilometers (4 miles) inland.\n\nDriving in the remade communities today, it\u2019s easy to wonder where it all went. Some of it is still there \u2014 recycled into road materials, buildings and furniture. Some of it was burned, creating new environmental hazards. And most of it was simply washed out to sea.\n\nTen years after that gigantic wave engulfed this city of 4 million on the day after Christmas, Banda Aceh has been almost totally restored. The tangled mountains of rubbish are gone, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the destruction that once choked rivers, blocked streets and ripped up trees by the roots.\n\nThe endless heaps of twisted metal, splintered wood and broken concrete have all disappeared except for some scattered reminders for tourists and local residents. A drive along the coast highlights a stunning coastline with new houses perched near the beach. Lush mangroves have been planted to help withstand future tsunamis, fishermen are back at sea and farmers are again working their rice paddies.\n\nStill, authorities are concerned about the health and environmental risks posed by debris contaminated by oil, asbestos and medical waste sitting on the seafloor off the coast and in 32 unregulated dump sites around the city.\n\n\u201cUnsafe disposal of waste will cause further environmental damage in the long term,\u201d said Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, who headed the Aceh and Nias Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency, which led the massive clean-up effort and was dissolved in 2009 after the job was judged finished.\n\nBanda Aceh, located on the northern tip of Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra island, was the hardest hit city by the disaster, which devastated hundreds of communities in more than a dozen countries around the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe tsunami left an estimated 10 million cubic meters (13 million cubic yards) of debris here, most of it washed into the ocean, Mangkusubroto said. If all that was squeezed into a 1-hectare (2 1/2 acre) field, it would create a tower of trash 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) tall.\n\nCleaning up the wrecked city was a mammoth, often overwhelming, task.\n\nFor weeks, the streets were strewn with rubble, and rescue workers retrieved dead bodies from under houses and in ponds, said Abdul Mutalib Ahmad, who worked at Banda Aceh\u2019s only landfill and witnessed the tsunami from atop a three-story building.", "article_metadata": {"description": "10 years on, where did all the tsunami debris go?", "title": "10 years on, where did all the tsunami debris go?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "10 years on, where did all the tsunami debris go?", "title": "10 years on, where did all the tsunami debris go?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/21/10_years_on_where_did_all_the_tsunami_debris_go/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/indonesia-tsunami-debris.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "10 years on, where did all the tsunami debris go?", "title": "10 years on, where did all the tsunami debris go?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/indonesia-tsunami-debris.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Fakhrurradzie Gade and Niniek Karmini", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca808\"", "article_summary": "The 2004 tsunami left Banda Aceh with mountains of debris up to 6 kilometers (4 miles) inland.\nThe tsunami left an estimated 10 million cubic meters (13 million cubic yards) of debris here, most of it washed into the ocean, Mangkusubroto said.\nTen years after that gigantic wave engulfed this city of 4 million on the day after Christmas, Banda Aceh has been almost totally restored.\nStill, authorities are concerned about the health and environmental risks posed by debris contaminated by oil, asbestos and medical waste sitting on the seafloor off the coast and in 32 unregulated dump sites around the city.\nFor weeks, the streets were strewn with rubble, and rescue workers retrieved dead bodies from under houses and in ponds, said Abdul Mutalib Ahmad, who worked at Banda Aceh\u2019s only landfill and witnessed the tsunami from atop a three-story building."}
