One of these targeted were hospital \u201creadmissions\u201d \u2013 instances in which a patient with a particular illness or injury admitted, treated, and discharged must later be re-admitted because of a recurrence or complications.\n\nThe theory was, essentially, that the health care provider should get it right the first time, and that a readmission is assumed to be the fault of the provider\u2019s failure to provide appropriate care during the first admission.\n\nImplementation of disincentives for readmission has hit health care providers hard. \u201cFor the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, more than 2,600 hospitals will lose a combined total of $420 million, according to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\u201d according to a September 14, 2015 Washington Post article by Lena H. Sun entitled, \u201cMedicare unfairly penalizes hospitals treating sickest, poorest patients, study finds.\u201d\n\nA new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association shows that the hospitals slated for these massive cuts are the least equipped to handle the loss in compensation. According to the Washington Post,\n\nFor the last four years, Medicare has wielded a big stick: It has fined hospitals if too many of their patients returned to any hospital within weeks of being released. But many safety-net hospitals, including academic teaching hospitals, say this is unfair because they take care of sicker, poorer patients. Now data released Monday shows they may be right.\n\nThe researchers found:\n\nHospitals serving healthier, more socially advantaged patients may not have to devote any resources to achieving a penalty-free readmission rate, whereas hospitals serving sicker, more socially disadvantaged patients may have to devote considerable resources to avoid a penalty. By selectively increasing costs or lowering revenue for hospitals serving patients at greater risk of readmission, the HRRP [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program] therefore threatens to deplete hospital resources available to improve overall quality for populations at high risk of poor outcomes.\n\nWhile the term \u201cquality\u201d certainly sounds like a positive way to enhance health care, the \u201cquality measures\u201d Obamacare gives HHS to power to impose on health care providers can, in effect, be used to limit the healthcare Americans receive .\n\nUnder the language of the law, the term \u201cquality measures\u201d is a euphemism for preventing treatment that the government feels drives up cost too much \u2013 no matter what the patient need.\n\nIn a separate September 14, 2015, article published in Vox, \u201cObamacare punishes hospitals that see poor patients, study finds,\u201d Sarah Kliff writes,\n\nAll told, the new Harvard study estimates that about half of the difference in readmission rates can be explained away by patient population characteristics. And that means some of the hospitals could be getting penalized more simply for seeing vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cThe clear implication is this penalty exacerbates the financial strain they\u2019re under,\u201d says J. Michael McWilliams, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cOne would worry this would translate into worse-quality care.\u201d\n\nThe judgment whether or not the \u201cquality\u201d is good will essentially only be about providing health care in the cheapest way possible. As in other government reimbursement models, the outcomes\u2013meaning how well people recover function\u2013is secondary.\n\nThis means that a course of treatment a doctor and patient deem advisable to save that patient\u2019s life or preserve or improve the patient\u2019s health\u2013but which would trigger the penalty \u2013 is less likely to be provided.\n\nDocumentation on Obamacare\u2019s rationing provisions in general can be found here.\n\nIt is more important now than ever to keep this debate alive and elect a pro-repeal Congress and President in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/readmission3-300x276.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1481\"", "article_summary": "Implementation of disincentives for readmission has hit health care providers hard.\nBut many safety-net hospitals, including academic teaching hospitals, say this is unfair because they take care of sicker, poorer patients.\nWhile the term \u201cquality\u201d certainly sounds like a positive way to enhance health care, the \u201cquality measures\u201d Obamacare gives HHS to power to impose on health care providers can, in effect, be used to limit the healthcare Americans receive .\n\u201cOne would worry this would translate into worse-quality care.\u201dThe judgment whether or not the \u201cquality\u201d is good will essentially only be about providing health care in the cheapest way possible.\nBy Jennifer Popik, J.D., Powell Center for Medical EthicsWhen the Obama Health Care Plan became law in 2010, one of the first provisions that went into effect authorized the federal Department of Health and Human Services to impose so-called \u201cquality measures\u201d on health care providers."}
