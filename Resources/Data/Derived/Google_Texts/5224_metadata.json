Most Americans will get three more days to file their returns in April, and residents in two New England states will get an extra four days.\n\nThat\u2019s because local and state holidays, along with a well-timed weekend, are forcing the Internal Revenue Service to extend the traditional deadline of April 15.\n\nThis year the deadline for 2015 income tax returns is Monday, April 18. On Friday, April 15 Washington will be celebrating Emancipation Day, the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. It is a D.C. holiday, which the IRS considers a federal holiday for tax-filing purposes.\n\nRelated: 14 Outrageous Tax Deductions the IRS Denied\n\nEmancipation Day is typically commemorated on April 16, which falls on a Saturday this year. Instead, it\u2019s being officially observed on the Friday before, a blessing for last-second taxpayers.\n\nProcrastinators living in Maine and Massachusetts are even luckier this year. They have until Tuesday, April 19 to file their federal taxes. That\u2019s because April 18 is Patriot\u2019s Day, a statewide holiday in both states. The IRS earlier ruled that those state residents get an extra day to file taxes if the federal deadline falls on a statewide holiday.\n\nThe last time tax day fell on a day other than April 15 was in 2012, when the deadline was extended to Tuesday, April 17. That year, April 15th fell on a Sunday and the 16th was Emancipation Day.\n\nRelated: From Boob Jobs to Body Oil, 5 Surprising Tax Deductions\n\nNext year, tax day again will be extended to Tuesday, April 17 because the 15th is a Sunday and the following Monday is Emancipation Day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re prone to putting off your taxes to the last minute, this is a good year.", "title": "Why Your Tax Filing Deadline Is Later This Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/05/Why-Your-Tax-Filing-Deadline-Later-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122012_Preparing_Taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/05/Why-Your-Tax-Filing-Deadline-Later-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122012_Preparing_Taxes_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you\u2019re prone to putting off your taxes to the last minute, this is a good year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: From Boob Jobs to Body Oil, 5 Surprising Tax DeductionsNext year, tax day again will be extended to Tuesday, April 17 because the 15th is a Sunday and the following Monday is Emancipation Day.\nThe last time tax day fell on a day other than April 15 was in 2012, when the deadline was extended to Tuesday, April 17.\nOn Friday, April 15 Washington will be celebrating Emancipation Day, the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\nThe IRS earlier ruled that those state residents get an extra day to file taxes if the federal deadline falls on a statewide holiday.\nThat year, April 15th fell on a Sunday and the 16th was Emancipation Day."}
