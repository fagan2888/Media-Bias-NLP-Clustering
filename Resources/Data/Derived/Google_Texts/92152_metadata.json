It now turns out that John Podesta, chair of Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 and the same man who called the allegations of Peter Schweizer\u2019s Clinton Cash \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d \u2013 has a brother who runs a company, The Podesta Group, that lobbied the State Department on behalf of Uranium One while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and beyond.\n\nUranium One is, of course, the uranium firm that sent a \u201cflow of cash\u201d to the Clinton Foundation as the Russian government gained increasing ownership of the company; the State Department had to sign off on the Russians\u2019 encroachment into the American uranium market. The Clinton Foundation did disclose its relationship with Uranium One in Hillary\u2019s State Department disclosures. According to the Daily Caller, Uranium One \u201cpaid the Podesta Group $40,000 to lobby the State Department, the Senate, the National Park Service and the National Security Council for \u2018international mining projects,\u2019 according to a July 20, 2012 filing.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHillary\u2019s relationship with John Podesta goes back to the first Clinton administration. During Bill Clinton\u2019s second term, Podesta acted as chief of staff. After leaving, he created the Center for American Progress, a Clinton-backed leftist think tank designed to forward the political goals of the Clintons. As the Christian Science Monitor reported when Podesta joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign back in January:\n\nPodesta is the guy people call on when the going gets tough: He served as Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001, helping control a series of crises including Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial. The Obama administration brought him on to help the President steer a path through Congressional impasses and to avert embarrassments like the Affordable Care Act\u2019s botched rollout.\n\nPodesta\u2019s relationship with the Clintons didn\u2019t waver during Hillary\u2019s time in the White House; his own ties with the Obama administration grew stronger when he became a senior advisor to the Obama administration in late 2013, before resigning this year to join Hillary\u2019s campaign.\n\nPodesta isn\u2019t the only member of the Clinton team embroiled in Clinton Foundation corruption. Hillary\u2019s new top fundraiser is Dennis Cheng, the former chief development officer for the Clinton Foundation, which means he did all the fundraising for that organization. Cheng has not been asked any questions thus far about his relationship with the Clinton Foundation or the new Clinton 2016 campaign.\n\nJust as President Obama magically transformed his campaign organization, Obama for America, into a political action group, Organizing for Action, to lobby for his preferred governmental policies, Hillary Clinton has transformed the Clinton Foundation and its constellation of allies into her 2016 campaign.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
