KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) â€” Six Kansas City school employees are suspended and two students face charges in juvenile court in connection with a 14-year-old girl's allegations that a boy repeatedly raped her at school.

The suspensions at Southwest Early College Campus came after school officials vowed to increase measures to protect students after an alleged rape in August at the same school.

The girl in the latest case told authorities a 14-year-old boy raped her "on numerous occasions" over the last month while a 13-year-old girl stood in the hall as a lookout. The boy and the alleged lookout have been charged in juvenile court with one count each of rape and sodomy and ordered to remain detained.

A district spokesman declined to identify the suspended employees or their positions at the school.
