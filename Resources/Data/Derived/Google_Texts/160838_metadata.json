Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham all said they wouldn\u2019t take part in this year\u2019s event. While the poll has rarely been an accurate predictor of the eventual GOP nominee, it was considered an early measure of which candidates might have staying power.\n\nIt was also one of three things that made people pay attention to Iowa, the other two being the Iowa caucuses and someone carving something large out of butter.\n\nBut the straw poll took money to win, and the 2016 candidates clearly saw it as a waste of resources.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report, Iowa Republican officials \u201cwanted to make sure negativity surrounding the straw poll didn't hurt Iowa's traditional place in holding the first votes of the presidential nomination contest, with its leadoff caucuses.\u201d\n\nThe problem is, with the field of GOP candidates growing like a rabbit colony in the shadow of a Viagra manufacturing plant, there is nothing to winnow the crowd down before the Iowa caucuses. It\u2019s quite possible there will be more GOP presidential candidates than there are Iowans.\n\nThat\u2019s where I believe the Illinois Republican Party can step in and steal some of Iowa\u2019s \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d thunder.\n\nMy proposal is simple and in keeping with conservative principles: Introduce the first-annual Illinois Presidential Paintball Tournament.\n\nAll 17,523 candidates will be invited to attend the event, held in a large field outside Springfield. Everyone will be armed with a high-powered paintball rifle and suited up in the kind of camouflage hunting gear that makes presidential candidates look awkward.\n\nThen it\u2019s just winner take all. Splat! Splat! Splat!\n\nThe event will have everything the Republican base could want: guns, people trying to protect themselves with guns and lots of screaming and yelling.\n\nI sent a tweet to the Illinois Republican Party: \u201c@ilgop With Iowa Straw Poll gone, you guys want to jump in and launch the Illinois Presidential Paintball Tournament? I have #ideas.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t heard back, but I have to imagine officials will jump at this chance to put Illinois on the presidential campaign map. The event would demonstrate which candidates have the most American exceptionalism (paintball prowess is a well-established measure of exceptionalism) AND it would make the party a ton of cash.\n\nImagine how much money both Republicans and Democrats would pay to watch GOP candidates fire paintballs at each other. It\u2019d be far more entertaining than just watching them shoot themselves in the foot.\n\nrhuppke@tribpub.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Iowa Straw Poll cancellation opens door for Illinois", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "It\u2019s a sad day for Iowans, and, for once, it\u2019s not just because they live in Iowa.", "title": "Iowa Straw Poll cancellation opens door for Illinois", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/huppke/ct-iowa-straw-poll-20150612-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-557b2494/turbine/ct-iowa-straw-poll-20150612", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "iowa straw poll, iowa straw poll cancelled, gop candidates, presidential campaign iowa", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/83770662", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-12", "Description": "With the Iowa Straw Poll cancelled, Illinois has an opportunity to get on the presidential campaign map", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "iowa straw poll, iowa straw poll cancelled, gop candidates, presidential campaign iowa"}, "article_summary": "The Iowa Straw Poll, a staple of Republican presidential politics since 1979, has been canceled because several of the top-tier GOP presidential candidates didn\u2019t want to participate.\nI sent a tweet to the Illinois Republican Party: \u201c@ilgop With Iowa Straw Poll gone, you guys want to jump in and launch the Illinois Presidential Paintball Tournament?\nBut the straw poll took money to win, and the 2016 candidates clearly saw it as a waste of resources.\nMy proposal is simple and in keeping with conservative principles: Introduce the first-annual Illinois Presidential Paintball Tournament.\nIt\u2019s quite possible there will be more GOP presidential candidates than there are Iowans."}
