It would have been Boston\u2019s first major hospital deal in more than decade, but complexities over the deal eventually killed the plan.\n\n\u201cOver the last several months, Tufts Medical Center and Boston Medical Center have carefully considered how we might combine our two organizations,\u201d said BMC CEO Kate Walsh and TMC CEO Michael Wagner, MD, in a joint statement. \u201cAfter much consideration, we have determined that at this time it is best for our medical centers to remain separate.\u201d\n\nBased on geography alone, the deal made sense and it should have been \u201creasonably straightforward to combine programs, build scale, and generate savings,\u201d wrote Massachusetts-based healthcare consultant David Williams earlier this year. \u201cTufts has a good reputation, too, but has a hard time standing out. BMC is well respected, but the large safety net population makes it hard to invest to compete effectively.\u201d\n\nBut two sources close to the organizations told the Boston Globe that one bone of contention was Tufts\u2019 goal of expanding commercially insured patients, a move that could conflict with BMC\u2019s safety-net status, which brings in $100 million in Medicaid disproportionate share funding.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nAffiliated with Boston University\u2019s Medical School, BMC has a 482-bed hospital, 4,500 employees and 1,200 physicians, and is the state\u2019s largest safety-net hospital, the descendent of the Boston City Hospital that merged with the Boston University Medical Center in 1996. In the last fiscal year, BMC earned $34 million in profit on more than $1 billion in revenue, while half of its patients are covered by Medicaid. (BMC\u2019s HealthNet Plan Medicaid HMO has seen losses in recent years, along with Partners\u2019 Neighborhood Health Plan.)\n\nDespite that issue, Williams thinks a merger between the two is kind of inevitable. \u201cI expect it will be discussed again within the next few years.\u201d\n\nStory continues below chart\n\nBMC is also in the midst of a $270 million renovation project.\n\nTufts Medical Center is located just one mile north of BMC. The Tufts University affiliate has its 415-bed flagship hospital, as well as the Floating Hospital for Children, and is itself in the midst of a merger with the Lowell General Hospital, under the health system name of Wellforce. In the last fiscal year, Tufts earned $9 million on more than $850 million in revenue. Tufts also serves many Medicaid and Medicare patients, but more commercially-insured patients than BMC.\n\nStory continues below chart\n\nThe key question for each institution is \u201cwhether they would be stronger together than they are separately,\u201d said Paul Levy, who\u2019s credited with saving a post-merger Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center as CEO from 2002 to 2011.\n\n\u201cIf not, this could be a case of strapping two leaky lifeboats together, leading to a faster demise than if they remained apart,\u201d Levy wrote on his blog, Running A Hospital, laying out a raft of challenges for the proposed merger.\n\n[Also: Healthcare mergers and acquisitions up in first quarter]\n\nOne is the \u201cdiminution in public support for safety net hospitals, like BMC,\u201d in the era of universal health insurance. Another, for Tufts, is that it has one of the weakest referral bases of all the teaching hospitals in Boston, Levy wrote. \u201cThird, BMC has a large number of unions that, in the words of a prior CEO, \"\u2019make it impossible to manage.\u2019\"\n\nAdministrative economies of scale could be achievable, along with leverage in supply chain purchasing and insurance contracts, Levy argued, and there would also be opportunities to rationalize clinical offerings, although this is where the organizational cultures of the two systems could have gotten in the way.\n\n\u201cFor example, both hospitals have kidney transplant programs that are, frankly, too small to justify in the own right. By combining them, costs could be reduced and outcomes likely improved. Might there be other examples?\u201d Levy wrote. \u201cBut it is often difficult to accomplish such rationalizations, in that the doctors in each hospital might feel a proprietary interest in their programs. Someone would have to negotiate a new clinical leadership agreement.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nWith the exception of Partners\u2019 1994 founding through the Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women\u2019s hospitals, healthcare mergers in greater Boston have usually turned out to be more like acquisitions, Levy argued.\n\n\u201cMost mergers are not mergers. They are takeovers by one party. The BIDMC example is apt,\u201d he said. \u201cA so-called merger of New England Deaconess Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in the mid-1990's was actually a takeover of the former by the latter. This led to resentment, alienation, and near bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nThe Tufts-BMC deal would have been the first large hospital merger since the formation of BIDMC. A merger idea between BIDMC, Lahey Health, in the suburb of Burlington, and the physicians group Atrius Health, was withdrawn last year.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/boston-medical-center-tufts-medical-center-abandon-merger", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tufts-Medical-Center-tuftsmedicalcenter.org-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Organizational differences were just too difficult to bridge, executives say, ending what would have been Boston's only merger since 1994.", "title": "Boston Medical Center, Tufts Medical Center abandon merger"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tufts-Medical-Center-tuftsmedicalcenter.org-feature.gif"}, "description": "Organizational differences were just too difficult to bridge, executives say, ending what would have been Boston's only merger since 1994.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Boston Medical Center, Tufts Medical Center abandon merger"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Boston Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center have concluded months of merger talks without a merger.
