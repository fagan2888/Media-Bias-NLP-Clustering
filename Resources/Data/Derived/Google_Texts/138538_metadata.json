The company\u2019s focus in its initial phase is managing hypertension.\n\nMany patients have trouble sticking to the behavior changes a physician recommends depending on their condition. The Benecure system is aimed at making that process not only easier but increase the likelihood of continued improvement even after a user stops using the system.\n\nAs co-founder Muhammed Fazeel explains, the focus for Benecure is \u201cintrinsic motivation,\u201d namely a way to change behavior long-term. As opposed to extrinsic motivation, like offering someone $5 each time they go to the gym, the gamification aspect of Benecure\u2019s platform randomizes when rewards are given for certain behavior. Fazeel says this is proven to have longer-lasting results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData received from sensors keeps track of where a patient\u2019s progress stands according to doctor recommendations, and the system then provides \u201cnudges\u201d to remind them when to make changes.\n\nWith the application, users have the option to set their own goals based on doctor recommendations, or, once data is in the system, back-end algorithms can interpret complex patterns and set realistic goals for a user.\n\nWhat\u2019s being monitored could be an activity, sleep, weight, blood pressure, calories and sodium intake. Specifically with lifestyle changes, goals start small in order to increase the likelihood of adherence.\n\nA provisional patent has also been filed for an additional feature that will be added to the platform in the near future, which will identify how well you\u2019re actually following the recommendations.\n\nAs Fazeel points out, for patients who see a physician semi-regularly to monitor a condition, they often have a tendency to lie at some point because they are embarrassed. When this happens, the platform can then readjust what the recommendations are in order to make them more realistic and doable for that patient.
