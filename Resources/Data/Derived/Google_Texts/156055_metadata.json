So the question lingers from the Supreme Court\u2019s non-resolution last week of the latest controversy brought about by the Obama administration\u2019s effort to make birth control available to women in the work force: Was it a sign of a new appetite for compromise or of institutional dysfunction?\n\nAlong with the many headline writers who stressed \u201ccompromise,\u201d I\u2019d like to believe the former. But I fear the latter.\n\nI think the court is engaged in an exercise of understandable but fruitless wishful thinking. To recap for anyone who might not have been devoting the nearly nonstop attention needed to understand how we got to the present pass:\n\nRegulations under the Affordable Care Act define contraception as one of the \u201cessential services\u201d that employers must provide, without a co-pay, as part of their employee health plans. Churches themselves are exempt, but religiously affiliated schools, universities, charities and other nonprofit organizations are not. For them, the Obama administration provided an accommodation: Notify the government or your insurer of your religious objection, and your obligation and involvement end; the insurance company or plan administrator will pick up the coverage, and those institutions are out of the picture. Not good enough, said the nonprofits; our insurance plan will still be the basis for making birth control available, and we will be complicit in sin.\n\nThe nonprofits went to court, claiming that the administration\u2019s accommodation \u201chijacked\u201d their insurance plans and placed a substantial burden on their freedom of religion, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. They lost, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear seven appeals from four federal appeals courts, consolidated under the name Zubik v. Burwell. The case was argued in March, and it was clear that the eight justices were deeply divided.\n\nA week later, the justices issued an unusual order, suggesting the outlines of a compromise. Suppose, the unsigned March 29 order said, the objecting nonprofits (\u201cpetitioners\u201d) wouldn\u2019t have to provide any formal notice to anyone. They would simply obtain an insurance plan that excluded contraceptives. Then the insurance company, \u201caware that petitioners are not providing certain contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, would separately notify petitioners\u2019 employees that the insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners\u2019 health plan.\u201d The court asked both sides for supplemental briefs responding to this idea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I last wrote about this development, I speculated that it originated with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the justice most likely to be struggling with the issue and looking for a way out of having to decide it. On reflection, I now agree with smart observers of the court, including Professors Richard C. Schragger and Micah Schwartzman of the University of Virginia Law School and Professor Nelson Tebbe of Brooklyn Law School that Justice Stephen G. Breyer is the more likely instigator. He has spent two decades on the court trying to craft compromises that might bring Justice Kennedy around. He has failed as often as not, but he has had some successes, too, and Justice Breyer is the eternal optimist, ever hopeful that logic can bring together people of good will but divergent views.\n\nIn any event, whoever on the court came up with the \u201cwhy can\u2019t we all get along\u201d idea may have met his or her match in the determination of the religious nonprofits to treat any compromise as unacceptable surrender. The Obama administration readily agreed that the court\u2019s proposal of inferential notification could work. And at first it appeared that the nonprofits would go along as well. \u201cSisters Say \u2018Yes\u2019 to Scotus Solution,\u201d proclaimed the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, lawyers for one of the plaintiffs, the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cWhen the court asked if there were other ways and if the Little Sisters would accept them, \u2018yes\u2019 was an easy and obvious answer,\u201d the Becket Fund\u2019s news release said.\n\nBut nothing about this case is that easy or that obvious. The nonprofits\u2019 supplemental reply brief contained important qualifications. The brief made clear that the only acceptable arrangement would be \u201ca separate policy, with a separate enrollment process, a separate insurance card, and a separate payment source, and offered to individuals through a separate communication.\u201d Contraception coverage could be provided only \u201cpursuant to an individual contract between the insurance company and the plan beneficiaries [i.e., women], not as an automatic and unavoidable companion to petitioners\u2019 plans.\u201d\n\nTo translate: There could be no automatic enrollment, and women would have to learn about the separate coverage, sign up and, separate insurance card in hand, shop for a doctor who accepted it. This is unacceptable to the Obama administration; as Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. made clear during the argument two months ago, the whole point was to make contraception coverage \u201cseamless\u201d and integrated with the rest of a woman\u2019s health care.\n\nSo the court\u2019s reference last week to the \u201csubstantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties\u201d presents a puzzle. What\u2019s been clarified, it seems to me, is how far apart the two sides really are. It\u2019s highly likely that the four federal appeals courts that rejected the nonprofits\u2019 position in the first place will reiterate the conclusion that nothing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or the First Amendment requires the government to go through the contortions being demanded of it. Then the justices \u2014 however many there are at that point \u2014 will have decided what to do.\n\nTo clear my head of the weeds in which this case has become entangled, I went back to take a fresh look at the appeals courts\u2019 opinions to see why judges across the political spectrum, including some of the judiciary\u2019s most liberal and most conservative members, found the religious nonprofits\u2019 position so lacking in merit.\n\nPerhaps the most illuminating is the opinion written by Judge Cornelia Pillard for a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Priests for Life v. United States Department of Health and Human Services. All the plaintiffs had to do to opt out of the obligation to cover contraception, Judge Pillard said, \u201cis express what they believe and seek what they want via a letter or two-page form.\u201d She continued, \u201cThat bit of paperwork is more straightforward and minimal than many that are staples of nonprofit organizations\u2019 compliance with law in the modern administrative state.\u201d\n\nA valuable part of this opinion was the context Judge Pillard provided for understanding who the plaintiffs were (most, although not all, Catholic-related) and how broadly their claim to a religious exemption swept:\n\n\u201cCatholic nonprofits have a long and broad history of service that goes far beyond worship or proselytizing. Nationally, Catholic hospitals, clinics, universities schools, and social service groups provide many services that are not inherently religious. Catholic-identified nonprofits employ and enroll as students millions of adults, not all of whom are coreligionists or share the Catholic Church\u2019s religious opposition to contraception.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI quote this passage because there is a widespread misunderstanding that the case is about nuns, specifically the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order whose mission is to run nursing homes for the elderly poor. Commentary following last week\u2019s decision perpetuated this misunderstanding. \u201cSurely the Obama administration could find a way to provide contraception to women without involving a group of Catholic nuns,\u201d Ramesh Ponneru, a senior editor of National Review, wrote in a Bloomberg News post titled \u201cThe Culture War Obama Didn\u2019t Have to Wage.\u201d Richard W. Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, wrote on Scotusblog that the Obama administration had \u201caggressively and unlawfully overreached\u201d in its \u201cstrange insistence that a community of nuns who take vows of poverty and care for the elderly poor must serve as a vehicle for delivering free contraception to their employees.\u201d In a Wall Street Journal column titled \u201cBig Win for Little Sisters,\u201d William McGurn wrote that \u201cthough it was more a TKO than a straight-up ruling, the Little Sisters prevailed at the Supreme Court Monday in their fight against the Obamacare contraceptive mandate.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nBy my count, the Little Sisters of the Poor (who, as I\u2019ve noted before, advertise themselves as equal-opportunity employers in the nursing home enterprise) are only one of 30 petitioners in the seven Supreme Court cases. The other 29 include Catholic and Baptist colleges, Catholic high schools, individual bishops, two chapters of Catholic Charities, other charities, and several individuals. Granted, it\u2019s more compelling to hear about the travails of the Little Sisters (who even merited a photo op with Pope Francis last September) than about the objection to contraception coverage held by the named plaintiff in the lead case, the Most Reverend David A. Zubik of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.\n\nOpponents of the contraception mandate have been brilliant in positioning the case as being about nuns who have a name \u201cperfectly pitched to make liberals/progressives squirm,\u201d as Mona Charen wrote in National Review in a post that accused The Washington Post of burying the group\u2019s name in its story about the court\u2019s decision. A reader had to turn to the jump, Ms. Charen complained, and \u201cread down another five paragraphs to learn this is the case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor.\u201d Well, yes, and 29 other plaintiffs.\n\nSo pervasive has the administration-versus-nuns narrative been that it\u2019s hard to believe that it has not at least subliminally played on the instincts and helped to shape the views of some members of the Supreme Court. Now that the cases are most likely back to square one, it\u2019s time for the administration and its supporters to recapture the narrative and make clear to a confused public that this is not a case about nuns. It\u2019s a case about women who should not, by reason of their particular employment, have to forfeit the right to comprehensive health care that the law makes available to other women in the work force.
