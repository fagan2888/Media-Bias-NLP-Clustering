Especially for a longtime fan of the series. Many of the jokes herein refer to past episodes. Take, for instance, queefs, the differences between buddy/guy/friend, and so on, so forth. But I think the most important part of this episode is that it\u2019s simply funny.\n\nThere are so many things going on in this episode and I think because of that, no one joke becomes stale. It\u2019s possible that the queef joke might, to some extent, only because it was the major storyline of a previous episode (Eat, Pray, Queef). And I feel that the multitude of layers keeps the message from being too on the nose. Mr. Mackey introduces Intellilink, which is an obvious stand-in for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online registration issue. Every button pushed causes music to play on the intercom, the blinds to go up and down, or the lights to go on and off. It would be easy for Matt and Trey to go the easy route and just bring in Obama, Sebelius, Tea Partiers and just say it up front. Instead, they filter this message through an absurd storyline about Kyle\u2019s brother, Ike, having grown up and experiencing puberty.\n\nFans know Ike. He\u2019s the babbling, floppy-headed adopted Canadian brother who has shown support of McCain and has slept with his teacher. But he\u2019s going through what\u2019s dubbed \u201cCanadian Puberty\u201d, which apparently hits at a much younger age than its American counterpart. He\u2019s moody, zitty, and has developed a penchant for chewing tobacco. I like the moment when Ike laments the confusion deciding between watching Yo Gabba Gabba or going out and \u201ctaming some strange\u201d. I also enjoy his little mustache. Finding out that his problems are rooted in Canada\u2019s healthcare system using Intellilink is funny, but maybe a little obvious (as the right wingers like to compare ACA to Canada\u2019s system). But it\u2019s even better when it\u2019s revealed his constipation medicine is going to some athlete in the northeast, explaining why Tom Brady is having such an off year. This episode truly is a pastiche of pretty much every story and non-story of the past few weeks.\n\nWhen Ike finally does tame some strange, Yo Gabba Gabba\u2019s Foofa is his victim. Apparently this was the push she needed to move on from children\u2019s entertainment and embark on a Miley-esque journey down the twerking rabbit hole. Even Sinead O\u2019Connor joins the rest of the Gabba cast to appeal to Foofa, much like O\u2019Connor\u2019s real life email to Miley. Every moment of this episode was a reference, which is fun, but a bit laborious at times. I\u2019m just glad I have co-workers willing to discuss these things openly in the break room, or else my complete apathy for anything Miley might have made this episode harder to follow.\n\nI thought the bits involving Intellilink were pretty funny. South Park rarely misses a chance to have someone take a shit, but Mackey exclaiming his pride in holding an appointment with a student while shitting at the same time made the whole scene worth it. When the story forays into the Canadian Minister of Health subplot, I found myself thinking this could have been either excised in favor of more Kyle and Ike, or just trimmed a bit. It felt like it was a bit pointless. When Mackey hires a Kathleen Sebelius stand-in to take the unwarranted blame for the Intellilink debacle, I felt we were provided the point well enough there. The Minister subplot certainly didn\u2019t ruin the episode for me, it just weakened it some. Although, I can\u2019t help but laugh when they say, \u201cqueef\u201d in a Canadian accent. Again, I\u2019m just happy they didn\u2019t take the easy route and have Obama be the defensive one to Michelle.\n\nI had a discussion with someone about whether South Park was taking a right-leaning stance here. It was before I was able to watch the episode, however. I did say I feel like South Park has always taken the opportunity to skewer anyone and everyone. No one is safe. They say it all the time. Here though, I think it\u2019s important to mention, that I don\u2019t believe this is South Park\u2019s statement on the Affordable Healthcare Act, at all. This is a statement on the online registration debacle. I think they succeeded. Tell me what you think in the comments section below! As always, please tell me how wrong I am.\n\nWeekly Pairing:\n\nI feel like I can\u2019t quite compare this with any one episode. In fact, I feel like the Canadian and political satires deserve a strong comparison to the South Park movie, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.\n\nAfter-Thoughts:\n\n\u2013 I know South Park likes the shock humor, but why did that Intellilink service guy kill himself? I chuckled, I guess, if that was the intention.\n\n\u2013 Does Obama deserve a giant queef in his face?\n\n\u2013 Same with not including Obama or ACA directly, I like that they never mentioned Miley Cyrus directly. This was smart.\n\n\u2013 Ike threatening Kyle with, \u201cKick the baby, brah\u201d was priceless. A real treat for longtime fans.\n\n\u2013 I don\u2019t feel like I learned anything here. Not that I\u2019m supposed to, no. But I also don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m considering or reconsidering my way of thinking in a new light either, like many South Park episodes can do. I feel like maybe this episode simply gave voice to my exasperation during this whole ACA issue.\n\n\u2013 Also, I never refer to ACA as Obamacare. I really hate all these pun put-downs for politics (and sports, too). It really has got to stop. You\u2019re not clever or funny and you haven\u2019t changed anyone\u2019s mind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This might be one of the finest Canadian-theme South Park episodes we've ever seen.
