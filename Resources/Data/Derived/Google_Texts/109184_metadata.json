Make sure you add dental care to the mix.\n\nThat's right. Taking care of your teeth with regular brushing and checkups can actually prevent serious diseases and painful dental procedures down the road.\n\nUnfortunately many opt out of dental coverage to save money, even though the associated health problems cost significantly more than preventive care. If you're examining 2015 health care options through a strictly budget-focused filter, take caution.\n\nDental coverage is not required for adults under the Affordable Care Act; it's only required for children. That means:\n\n\u2022 Employers aren't required to offer dental insurance to employees, which leaves those without employer-provided coverage weighing out-of-pocket and individual insurance options.\n\n\u2022 Even if employers do provide it, adults can opt out of the company's dental coverage, and purchase their own through the Insurance Marketplace or forgo it all together.\n\nBuy Photo Dentist Allison Powers examines Chloe Spencer\u2019s teeth at Milford Dental Excellence.

Many cut short-term costs with out-of-pocket dental care, paying the full amount for services like cleaning and fillings.\n\nThat strategy may trim expenses in the short term, and many think it's a viable option for maintaining good oral health.\n\nBut statistics tell a different story. By forgoing dental coverage, many are actually forgoing preventive oral care. The National Association of Dental Plans reports those without dental coverage are less likely to go to the dentist, and throughout the last decade, the number of adults who visit the dentist has been on the decline. In fact, the ADA reports that in 2012, only 35.4 percent of working adults visited the dentist.\n\nThis shift toward out-of-pocket dental coverage \u2013 and the consequential lack of preventive care \u2013 can cause major health problems and financial burdens.\n\nIndividuals without dental coverage are more likely to face oral health problems like extractions, dentures and gum disease because they don't get the preventive treatment they need. And those problems can extend well beyond the mouth. According to the NADP, those without dental benefits are:\n\n\u2022 67 percent more likely to have heart disease.\n\n\u2022 50 percent more likely to have osteoporosis.\n\n\u2022 29 percent more likely to have diabetes.\n\nAvoiding routine checkups has financial ramifications, too. Routine dental exams allow problems to be caught early and treated inexpensively. Think of it like this:\n\n\u2022 Every $1 spent on preventive oral care can result in $8 to $40 in savings on future dental costs, according to the American Dental Hygienists' Association.\n\n\u2022 A major procedure like crowns or dentures can cost you up to double what you would pay if you had insurance, the NADP reports.\n\nIf you're looking to save money in 2015, skimping on dental coverage is not your best option. To maintain good oral health on a budget, consider a dental insurance plan that meets your specific needs. The good news is, the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period runs through February 2015, so it's not too late to sign up.\n\nDental care may not be at the top of your resolution list, but it's critical for a healthy, happy new year.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1BJqg4R", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "$1 spent on preventive oral care can result in $8 to $40 in savings on future dental costs", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "$1 spent on preventive oral care can result in $8 to $40 in savings on future dental costs", "title": "Ignoring dental health can be costly", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/01/09/ignoring-dental-health/21513465/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "$1 spent on preventive oral care can result in $8 to $40 in savings on future dental costs", "title": "Ignoring dental health can be costly", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39fb94fad06152df0cea7dc41ecaa53858b557ea/c=354-0-1154-800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/American Dental Association", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/American Dental Association", "title": "Ignoring dental health can be costly", "author": "By Anthony Cook", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5819136017af617bee56cd3eb368daf5d1da6a64/c=436-0-1036-800/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e094856d4410ebfb80c30d1125bc6c51d16734e7/c=354-0-1154-800/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/62998571892a671152c954b7617406e949244db2/c=209-56-1199-800/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7cf8f5d378035d1dffd916dbd8000f753acd6bfd/c=289-74-1198-588&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-09T15:49:35.933000-05:00", "shorthed": "Opinion: Ignoring dental health can be costly", "articleid": 21513465, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bea79c1cd2cb4b19b03ba82ddc7862bebef07b1/c=289-74-1198-588/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/42a4aca79a1a62952aa59075cc47f81e673d9dd5/c=489-0-937-800/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/01/09/B9315527170Z.1_20150109153254_000_GQH9KDCJ2.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26e9\"", "article_summary": "Anthony Cook (Photo: Provided)Anthony Cook is president and CEO of The Dental Care Plus Group, one of the Tristate region's leading dental benefits providers.\n(Photo: The Community Press/Cindy Schroeder)In the past decade, the number of Americans with dental coverage has declined, according to the American Dental Association.\nTo maintain good oral health on a budget, consider a dental insurance plan that meets your specific needs.\nUnfortunately many opt out of dental coverage to save money, even though the associated health problems cost significantly more than preventive care.\nThis shift toward out-of-pocket dental coverage \u2013 and the consequential lack of preventive care \u2013 can cause major health problems and financial burdens."}
