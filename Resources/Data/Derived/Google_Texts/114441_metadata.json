It\u2019s a role Polonsky excels in: working from the outside, thinking strategically, and being blunt with management.\n\nBut as an independent contractor, he never received the same health benefits employees could access.\n\n\u201cUsually I just paid for it on my own, but it was, like, $1,200 a month, and my income was pretty spotty,\u201d says Polonsky.\n\nHe\u2019s now 68, old enough to qualify for Medicare. But his wife is younger, and her part-time job doesn\u2019t provide health insurance.\n\nGetting her coverage is pushing Polonsky back into the workforce, and away from freelance consulting.\n\n\u201cIt is an incredible conundrum for me, and I\u2019m sure, many others, that I have to be seeking a job based on the quality of health insurance that I might get,\u201d says Polonsky.\n\nThe Accidental System\n\nSo, how did Polonsky get here? How did we all get here? Where our health care, and the health care of our families, became so dependent on our jobs?\n\n\u201cThe whole system of employer-sponsored insurance really sort of came about by accident,\u201d says Julie Sonier, a health policy researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe accident she\u2019s referring to came about during World War II, when the federal government imposed wage controls at the same time the country faced a labor shortage.\n\nHungry for workers, American companies enticed talent with benefits, instead of salary. The IRS green-lighted the practice by giving benefits favorable tax treatment.\n\nSonier says this system of employer-based coverage actually worked pretty well.\n\nIn fact, her research finds that a decade ago, 81% of people under age 65 in New Hampshire were covered through the workplace.\n\nBut that\u2019s now starting to fade.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the recession that started in 2008 has played a role, and accelerated that change,\u201d says Sonier.\n\nPost-recession, that number is now at 74%, still the highest in the country, but it\u2019s trending down. And it\u2019s small businesses in New Hampshire that are cutting back the most on health benefits.\n\nThat hurts those firms, because they can\u2019t attract the best employees. And it also hurts workers who can\u2019t move as freely around the economy.\n\nPicking The Job Lock\n\nThere\u2019s a theory that describes a worker\u2019s inability to pursue other passions: job lock.\n\n\u201cJob lock is when employees are unable to leave a current position, when they want to, in order to go chase their dreams,\u201d says Seth Goodall, who runs the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s New England region.\n\n\u201cIf we can make health insurance more affordable, then that individual may have that opportunity to chase their dreams and start their own business.\u201d\n\nChasing dreams, or what an economist might call \u2018the mobility of labor,\u2019 is a good thing: you want people to be able to work for any company, or start their own enterprise.\n\nGoodall says the Affordable Care Act encourages this freedom. He points to one study that estimates as many as 1.5 million people nationally, and 7,000 in New Hampshire, will take advantage of cheaper health insurance opportunities through the ACA and start their own business.\n\nJohn Holahan, a researcher with the DC-based Urban Institute, says the availability of cheaper individual policies could decrease job lock, eventually.\n\n\u201cI think it will,\u201d says Holahan. \u201cIt has to obviously get implemented, and that is off to a pretty rocky start.\u201d\n\nBut Holahan cautions the health law doesn\u2019t fundamentally alter the employer-based system of insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cAnd even with the ACA, I mean, it is not being changed. The ACA is largely filling in the gaps around that system.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s that employer-based system that many workers still strive for.\n\nLike Bedford consultant Richard Polonsky, who hopes to find a way to insure his wife.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping the Affordable Care Act will provide that,\u201d says Polonsky. \u201cBut, in the interim, I\u2019m looking for a job primarily so that I will get the health benefit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Richard Polonsky is an organizational consultant, and can, if prompted, easily talk like one. \u201cBeing an outsider to an organization, I think people tend", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nhpr.org/post/will-work-health-insurance-job-lock-conundrum", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/styles/medium/public/201311/IMG_1792.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Richard Polonsky is an organizational consultant, and can, if prompted, easily talk like one. \u201cBeing an outsider to an organization, I think people tend", "title": "Will Work For Health Insurance: The 'Job Lock' Conundrum"}, "story_id": 246527458, "twitter": {"site": "@nhpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bookmannhpr"}, "author": "Todd Bookman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Will Work For Health Insurance: The &#039;Job Lock&#039; Conundrum"}, "nid": 38906, "datePublished": "2013-11-21", "keywords": "How We Work", "wordCount": 783, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Where our health care, and the health care of our families, became so dependent on our jobs?\nBut his wife is younger, and her part-time job doesn\u2019t provide health insurance.\n\u201cIt is an incredible conundrum for me, and I\u2019m sure, many others, that I have to be seeking a job based on the quality of health insurance that I might get,\u201d says Polonsky.\nPicking The Job LockThere\u2019s a theory that describes a worker\u2019s inability to pursue other passions: job lock.\n\u201cBut, in the interim, I\u2019m looking for a job primarily so that I will get the health benefit.\u201d"}
