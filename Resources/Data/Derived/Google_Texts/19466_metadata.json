Advance care planning is openly promoted as a means of slashing health care spending.\n\nAs noted above, National Right to Life is calling on constituents to urge Congressional Representatives to co-sponsor H.R. 3251 . You can easily do this online.\n\nOnly a sustained and informed outcry can now prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to fund sessions that typically will serve to steer senior citizens away from treatment they would have otherwise want.\n\nFar from opposing the concept of advance directives concerning treatment, the National Right to Life Committee provides a \u2018Will to Live\u2019 version on www.nrlc.org /medethics/ and supports alternatives that provide truly informed consent to decisions about medical treatment. But we must fight the tax funding and promotion of advance care planning counseling that cannot be adequately monitored for bias and that typically is less about discovering and applying patients\u2019 own wishes than about pushing them to accept premature death.\n\nThe Powell Center\u2019s a report, \u201cThe Bias Against Life-Preserving Treatment in Advance Care Planning.\u201d\n\nThat report cites a 2013 Health Affairs article entitled \u201cDecision Aids: When \u2018Nudging\u2019 Patients to Make A Particular Choice Is More Ethical Than Balanced, Nondirective Content,\u201d which gave this advice on how to get people with prostate cancer to agree not to have costly surgery:\n\n[I]f incontinence and impotence are presented as plainly stated\u2013that is, with no detailed description of these risks\u2013 men with early-stage prostate cancer may be swayed toward the option of surgery. If instead those possible effects of surgery are presented vividly via personal stories, men may be swayed away from the surgery option.\n\nThe Powell Center report gives multiple examples of advance care planning materials in widespread use that violate the principle of informed consent by selectively presenting facts in a distorted and unbalanced manner to \u201cnudge\u201d unwary patients to reject cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), IV fluids, and medically assisted feeding. Other advance care planning materials, it documents, describe disabilities and illnesses in an inaccurately repugnant way so as to induce people to agree that a low \u201cquality of life\u201d is not worth living.\n\nThe Powell Center report notes that providers of advance care planning materials to health insurers frequently tout the money it saves them. For example, to implement an advance care planning program Aetna hired the \u201cCenter to Advance Palliative Care,\u201d which proudly reported that the result of its efforts was an average reduction of more than $12,000 annually in benefits for senior citizens covered by the insurance company.\n\nThe Powell Center report concludes, \u201cSignificant safeguards would need to be incorporated in any governmental program promoting . . . advance care planning in order for [it] to be truly protective of the values and intent of patients, and to ensure they are not pressured into rejecting treatment against their wishes\u2026all in the name of cost-savings.\u201d The proposed rule would give a blank check to use tax funds for advance care planning without any safeguards against the widespread bias against choosing life-saving that is tragically so pervasive.\n\nPlease contact your representative to urge him or her to co-sponsor this vital legislation to protect vulnerable older people from being pressured into acquiescing in premature death!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bias-against-life-preserving-2015-300x147.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7de\"", "article_summary": "Advance care planning is openly promoted as a means of slashing health care spending.\nThe Powell Center report notes that providers of advance care planning materials to health insurers frequently tout the money it saves them.\nThe Powell Center report concludes, \u201cSignificant safeguards would need to be incorporated in any governmental program promoting .\nDuring the debate over the enactment of Obamacare, there was considerable controversy over the inclusion in an early version of the bill of funding for health care providers to be paid to conduct \u201cadvance care planning\u201d for patients under Medicare.\nAdvance care planning refers to counseling potential patients on deciding when to accept or reject life-preserving medical treatment and advising on legal documents embodying that decision."}
