Young people aren\u2019t interested in a party that brands itself as the \u201cparty of no,\u201d and they\u2019re turned off by messaging about social issues that don\u2019t mesh with their own beliefs. In fact, only 18 percent of millennials say they belong to the GOP, while 31 percent call themselves Democrats.\n\nThis week, as conservatives from across the country have convened in Washington for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the GOP can send a strong, unified message to millennials. Rather than focusing on what divides our nation, Republicans have an opportunity to speak to this generation about the massive, ever-growing debt that threatens our future \u2014 and what we can do to fix the problem.\n\nThe millennial opportunity for both parties lies in the 45 percent of young voters who identify themselves as independent. Here, Republicans should have a clear advantage. Millennials are smart. They realize the government spends more than it takes in, and our growing national debt isn\u2019t going away on its own. They want Congress to take their future seriously and stop kicking the can down the road. They want entitlement reform. The GOP has a unique opportunity to win over these young voters by showing how Republican principles can fix the fiscal problems that threaten to destroy our country\u2019s future.\n\nYoung voters are fed up with our government\u2019s reckless spending, which continues to bury their generation under a mountain of debt they\u2019ll never be able to pay off. Even President Obama\u2019s signature law hasn\u2019t escaped their criticism. According to a recent study by the Harvard Institute of Politics, 57 percent of millennials disapprove of Obamacare. Only 13 percent said they would definitely enroll.\n\nMillennials are already bearing more than their fair share of the weight of our nation\u2019s massive debt. Student loan debt has topped $1 trillion, and too many young adults can\u2019t find a job when they graduate from college. Facing years of student loan payments, many young adults are moving back home after college, and many more are defaulting on their payments.\n\nEntitlement spending is also out of control. Consider Social Security. Longer life expectancy for retirees, coupled with a tidal wave of retiring baby boomers, means we\u2019re facing a disproportionate ratio of young workers-to-retirees, which will deplete the Social Security system by 2033 if we don\u2019t take steps now to reform it.\n\nThe GOP has taken some proactive steps to up its appeal to millennials. Last year the Republican National Committee (RNC) hired Elliott Echols to be the party\u2019s first national youth director, charged with increasing outreach to people under 30. Young people must understand that their future is at stake, but they aren\u2019t interested in a party that perpetuates division and gridlock. They want to see compromise and all sides working together. This kind of effective politics is being spearheaded by No Labels, an organization that focuses on how to fix our problems, without painting every issue either red or blue.\n\nWinning the millennial vote will take smart, targeted messaging that shows young people the facts and lets them make informed decisions. Condescending and unsophisticated ad campaigns targeted at young voters (both parties are guilty of this) only alienate millennials. If the GOP wants to win young voters, it\u2019ll have to focus on the issues that really matter most to them.\n\nMillennials deserve the same bright future their parents and grandparents enjoyed. But unless we reform our spending habits, their lives will be harder, and the American Dream will be much more difficult to achieve. If the GOP can share this message effectively, it will have no problem winning and securing the millennial vote.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If the GOP wants to win young voters, it\u2019ll have to focus on the issues that really matter most to them.\nIf the GOP can share this message effectively, it will have no problem winning and securing the millennial vote.\nCondescending and unsophisticated ad campaigns targeted at young voters (both parties are guilty of this) only alienate millennials.\nIn fact, only 18 percent of millennials say they belong to the GOP, while 31 percent call themselves Democrats.\nThe millennial opportunity for both parties lies in the 45 percent of young voters who identify themselves as independent."}
