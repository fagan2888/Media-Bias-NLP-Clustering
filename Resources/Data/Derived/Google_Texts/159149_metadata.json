Safer, she noted, than many other things \u2014 including pregnancy.\n\nAs Sofia Resnick reported at RH Reality Check, Mary Spaulding Balch admitted during a strategy session that current data shows abortion is safer than giving birth or getting plastic surgery, which is why arguments about women\u2019s safety don\u2019t make any sense in a movement to criminalize abortion. \u201cWho would ever say that we should ban liposuction because of the risk to the women?\u201d Balch said during the session. \u201cWho\u2019s going to win that debate?\n\n\u201cIf we were to argue, for instance, that abortion should be banned at, say, 20 weeks because late abortions are dangerous to the mother\u2019s health, let\u2019s look at the fact of abortion,\u201d Balch continued. \u201cYou know that a mother\u2019s risk of death by abortion after a particular time \u2014 in this instance let\u2019s say 20 weeks pregnant \u2014 the risk to the mother\u2019s life rises to .09 [for] every 1,000 abortions. But let\u2019s compare the other risks of a woman\u2019s health. We know, for instance, that if she was to get liposuction that there\u2019s .19 deaths for every 1,000 procedures. If you look for facelifts, it\u2019s .2 per 1,000 procedures. For C-sections, 1.98 per 1,000, versus vaginal deliveries, which are .63 per 1,000.\u201d\n\nBalch is obviously still on a mission to criminalize all abortion, but her position is that the anti-choice movement should make that argument by focusing on the so-called unborn, not false data about health complications. And there\u2019s something that is strangely refreshing about that. As I\u2019ve argued before, the concept of women\u2019s safety has been mostly gutted of actual meaning by cynical politicians and judges. Texas and Mississippi are closing clinics at an alarming rate and denying women healthcare, but all in the name of \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201d Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that 35 feet of shouting distance is more significant than women\u2019s right to access medical care without harassment, intimidation or violence. In this context, Balch\u2019s candor seems almost revolutionary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The director of the National Right to Life came clean about abortion being safe.
