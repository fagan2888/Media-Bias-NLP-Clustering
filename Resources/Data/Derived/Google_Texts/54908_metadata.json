The answer is a definite yes, according to a recent RevCycleIntelligence.com article about key findings from a pair of Harvard Medical School professors\u2019 Health Affairs blog study.\n\nThe bureaucracy will gobble up a quarter of federal spending; the ACA will add almost $274 billion in new administrative costs heading into 2022, well beyond what would have been expected had the ACA not been passed, maintain David U. Himmelstein, MD, FACP, Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Professor at the City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College and Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, FACP, Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, and Adjunct Clinical Professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Two-thirds of this new overhead \u2013 over $172 billion \u2013 are directly associated with private insurers\u2019 administrative costs and profits, Himmelstein and Woolhandler state.\n\nRevCycleIntelligence.com conversed with Himmelstein last week about the greater implications of what such numbers mean for the healthcare industry at large.\n\n\u201cWe are wasting an enormous amount of money that ought to go to healthcare on paperwork,\u201d Himmelstein maintains. \u201cIt\u2019s been an extraordinarily inefficient way of deploying resources. Frankly, that\u2019s just one piece of it because we analyzed just one piece of the paperwork costs, those in insurance firms, the flip side of the paperwork which we have not documented in those numbers, is the providers\u2019 cost for complying with insurers\u2019 paperwork requirements. That\u2019s enormous as well,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPrevious work we\u2019ve done suggests that a third of the total healthcare dollar goes to paperwork and bureaucracy,\u201d Himmelstein states. Such numbers are likely mere underestimates that require updating, he confirms.\n\n\u201cThe way we go about financing healthcare is extraordinary wasteful and politicians have been unwilling to do anything about it up until now,\u201d Himmelstein says. \u201cWinston Churchill once said, \u2018You can always rely on Americans to do the right thing after they have exhausted every other possibility,\u2019\u201d Himmelstein says, in reference to what he refers to as a wasteful approach to financial healthcare reform.\n\n\u201cEven most of the new Medicaid money is going through private Medicaid HMOs or managed care plans. And we know that private insurers\u2019 overhead is much higher than overhead in public programs,\u201d he confirms. \u201cThe politicians have made a decision to use the most wasteful way of going about financing care,\u201d he adds.\n\nCostly and inefficient exchanges, Himmelstein says, are further hindering the healthcare industry. \u201cThe best estimate is that the exchanges themselves will add about 3 \u00bd percent to the cost of premiums of policies that are sold through the exchanges,\u201d he claims.\n\n\u201cMost other nations are much more efficient in the way that they finance and administer healthcare,\u201d Himmelstein confirms. \u201cThere is no reason, other than political difficulty, that we can\u2019t shed massive bureaucratic costs.\u201d\n\nHimmelstein predicts the ACA will soon lose dominance within the healthcare industry, moving forward. \u201cInstead of fighting about whether to go back to an old system, repealing the ACA,\u201d he says, \u201cthe debate will turn to how we move from here to something different, hopefully better.\u201d\n\nSuch will occur just as Medicare and Medicaid, once newly implemented, became a focal point of the healthcare system only a few years after they were passed, with attention then focused on what could be next around the bend, Himmelstein states.\n\n\u201cCosts are likely to resume an upward growth pattern and more and more people are going to find themselves grossly underinsured. All of those problems are going to be part of the debate very soon,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are moving to a handful of giant organizations controlling the health delivery system, largely focusing on their own interests and giving lip service to wanting to serve patients, but really acting like corporate masters of the healthcare system and shaping it to do what they want rather than what patients need,\u201d he maintains.\n\nThe simple solution is to implement national health insurance, Himmelstein maintains. \u201cIs it appropriate that some private organization have the decision making power over the healthcare of the vast majority in that region?\u201d he asks. \u201cPrivatization is much less efficient,\u201d Himmelstein states. \u201cWe\u2019ll again be coming to a debate about national health insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Affordable Care Act", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/will-inefficient-financial-healthcare-reform-kill-the-aca", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_3946535598.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Will Inefficient Financial Healthcare Reform Kill the ACA?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Affordable Care Act", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_3946535598.jpg"}, "title": "Will Inefficient Financial Healthcare Reform Kill the ACA?", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc612\"", "article_summary": "Is the Affordable Care Act (ACA) hurling the healthcare industry further into the red?\n\u201cWe are wasting an enormous amount of money that ought to go to healthcare on paperwork,\u201d Himmelstein maintains.\nRevCycleIntelligence.com conversed with Himmelstein last week about the greater implications of what such numbers mean for the healthcare industry at large.\nCostly and inefficient exchanges, Himmelstein says, are further hindering the healthcare industry.\n\u201cMost other nations are much more efficient in the way that they finance and administer healthcare,\u201d Himmelstein confirms."}
