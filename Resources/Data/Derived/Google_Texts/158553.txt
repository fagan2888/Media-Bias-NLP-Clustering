BOSTON — When it was called the FleetCenter in 2004, TD Garden hosted the NCAA Frozen Four, the most memorable hockey trip of my career. Maine’s disallowed power-play goal in the first period, Gabe Gauthier five-hole snipe on Jimmy Howard, the NCAA’s best goalie at the time, and the University of Denver’s 6-on-3 disadvantage in the waning moments of a surreal 1-0 hockey game that gave the Pioneers their first national title since 1969, when Keith Magnuson captained DU to the championship in Boston.

Magnuson, of course, died during the 2003-04 season in a car accident, but legend has it he was on the ice with the Pioneers at the FleetCenter, tripping a Maine player going on a breakaway at one point near the blue line.

For your viewing pleasure:

As for Monday’s Columbus Day game in Boston, the 0-2 Avalanche will start goalie Reto Berra against the 1-2 Bruins, who might also go with their backup, Niklas Svedberg.
