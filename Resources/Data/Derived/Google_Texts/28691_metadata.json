This combined approach will give physicians detailed data on their patients\u2019 health and lifestyle to better assess risk and improve care.\n\n\u201cMD Revolution is excited to be working with WellTrackONE to help Renaissance Health Network better address CCM and annual wellness visits,\u201d said MD Revolution Founder and CEO Samir Damani, M.D., PharmD, FACC. \u201cThis will help their physicians reach more patients who need additional care.\u201d\n\nRHN is an independent physician association (IPA) based in Pennsylvania with more than 70 associated practices. With MD Revolution and WellTrackONE, participating physicians can now provide their patients an integrated solution for preventative healthcare and chronic care management.\n\nUnder new Medicare rules, physicians can provide 20 minute remote consultations each month for their chronic care patients. However, most practices lack the technical experience and infrastructure to implement these regulations. MD Revolution and WellTrackONE provide the digital tools physician practices need to identify eligible patients, engage them remotely and bill appropriately.\n\nWith millions of Americans suffering from chronic, preventable conditions, CCM is becoming an increasingly important priority for physicians nationwide. However, it can be difficult for individual practices and IPAs to implement a program from scratch.\n\n\u201cThe new CCM rules are great for both patients and physicians, but they\u2019re kind of a Catch-22,\u201d said Barry Green, MD, Executive Chairman at RHN. \u201cOn one hand, physicians are motivated to help their chronic patients; but setting up these systems on their own could actually take time away from patients. MD Revolution and WellTrackONE solve that problem for us.\u201d\n\nWith MD Revolution and WellTrackONE on board, RHN physicians will have the ability to provide more care for their sickest patients. In addition to helping them identify and communicate with chronic care patients, the systems being put in place will extend their ability to encourage compliance and track progress. A number of studies have shown that giving patients better access to their medical team improves outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe believe these programs will be a win-win for everyone,\u201d said Dr. Green. \u201cPatients will benefit from the enhanced CCM and physicians will be able to provide more comprehensive care, as well as being compensated for their efforts.\u201d\n\nAbout MD Revolution\n\nFounded in 2011 by Samir Damani, MD, PharmD, FACC, a practicing cardiologist, MD Revolution is at the forefront of chronic disease prevention and care.

The Annual Wellness Visit has been an integral part of the Affordable Care Act since 2011 and is a key cost-reducing program of the United States healthcare budget. Using a full-service model, WellTrackONE can help physicians process these critical wellness visits with no change in their workflow and in turn allow them to identify the key risk factors of their patients. Once these risk factors are identified, physicians can initiate treatment plans through its proprietary Clinical Triggers program to prevent the onset of chronic illness and disease as well as falls, breaks and fractures.
