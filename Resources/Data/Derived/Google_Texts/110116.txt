The US president – who is no stranger to sending himself up – takes a selfie with a selfie stick and stumbles over the words 'February Fifteenth' while rehearsing a speech.

He was recently featured in a series of bizarre digitally-altered photos showing world leaders with their pants down on the toilet.

We see him pull stupid faces in the mirror, including his version of Miley Cyrus's 'wink face', and blames himself when he can't dunk a giant cookie in a small glass of milk.

The 53-year-old also draws a ridiculous child-like pencil sketch of wife Michelle which he proudly describes as "pretty good".

The two-minute Buzzfeed video called 'Things Everyone Does But Doesn't Talk About' cuts back and forth between Obama and another random man doing the same kind of chores and activities.

But the final scene reveals the man to be one of Obama's aides who walks in on the president pretending to throw basketballs at an imaginary hoop.

Obama, who recently claimed our Prime Minister David Cameron was a 'great friend', breaks the awkward tension by telling the assistant: "Can't I live?"
