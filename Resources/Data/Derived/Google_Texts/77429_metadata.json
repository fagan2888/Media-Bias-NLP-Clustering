Foster Library downtown needs a new heating and air-conditioning system, estimated to cost $1 million, and the Avenue Library will need more money from the city\u2019s general fund next year.\n\nAfter some haggling over wording, the council voted unanimously to direct the city staff to, among other things:\n\nStudy whether a council liaison should be appointed to interface with the commission, county leadership and library staff.\n\nDecide whether libraries are considered by the council to be an important service.\n\nInclude a library stakeholder on any future committee exploring new revenue.\n\nConsider allocating future revenue increases toward increased library services.\n\nMuch of the debate Monday night centered on whether a new library is needed in east Ventura.\n\nCouncilman Carl Morehouse wondered whether there\u2019s a long-term need for a new library building. He said he doesn\u2019t use the library anymore. He just uses his smartphone.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is: Who are we building a new facility for?\u201d Morehouse asked. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of unanswered questions for me. There\u2019s things going on technologically. Who are we designing this for?\u201d\n\nMorehouse said young people don\u2019t go to libraries because they \u201clive and die\u201d with their smartphones.\n\nA speaker, Ventura resident Jeannette Sanchez, said technology and libraries go hand-in-hand.\n\n\u201cWhile many have questioned the fundamental need for libraries, one thing that remains constant about libraries is that they provide access for those who cannot afford to buy books, those who can\u2019t afford to have computers, DVDs, or the Internet at home,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cLibraries can provide that.\u201d\n\nCouncilman Mike Tracy said libraries are important but not essential city programs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is an essential service or a core service,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cIt is an important service. We could close another fire station so we can open a library, but I don\u2019t think that will work.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story contained an error. The council agreed to explore new revenue for new and existing libraries.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Ventura to consider more funding for libraries", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/ventura/ventura-to-consider-more-funding-for-libraries-ep-1340981784-351028571.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/venturacityhall_25833140_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "The Library Advisory Commission has asked the city of Ventura to consider allocating more money for library services, including for a branch on the city's east side.", "title": "Ventura to consider more funding for libraries"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/venturacityhall_25833140_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "The Library Advisory Commission has asked the city of Ventura to consider allocating more money for library services, including for a branch on the city's east side.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ventura to consider more funding for libraries"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By Joshua MolinaThe city of Ventura has moved a step toward exploring new revenue to fund existing and new libraries.\nThe Ventura Library Advisory Commission made a request at Monday night\u2019s City Council meeting.\n\u201cLibraries can provide that.\u201dCouncilman Mike Tracy said libraries are important but not essential city programs.\nSquires said, however, that the commission needs support and direction from the City Council.\nCommission members and Ventura residents requested that the city find ways to fund libraries, including building a $6 million eastside branch library, which would cost about $714,000 a year to run."}
