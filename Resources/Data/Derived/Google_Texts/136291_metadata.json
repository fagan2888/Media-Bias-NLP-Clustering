And when one of those towns, Yutan\u2014a 40 minute drive from downtown Omaha\u2014realized it was on the list they immediately asked for help. Why? Because, as Nebraska Watchdog first reported, if one of those trains derailed Yutan wasn\u2019t ready.\n\n9: MECA mum when questioned on lack of public meetings.\n\nOmaha\u2019s powerful arena board spent a lot of 2014 flexing its muscles. But MECA\u2019s call for a bigger board with longer terms only found sand kicked in its face. At one point the city\u2019s attorney told MECA to drop the move for longer terms or face the consequences: MECA blinked. In addition after a Nebraska Watchdog investigation exposed years of spotty MECA meetings\u2014half a dozen a year compared to monthly meetings by other city boards such as the little-known \u201cBuilding Board of Review\u201d\u2014the arena board expanded it\u2019s public get-togethers. At the same time though some critics argue MECA is still woefully short on sunshine.\n\n8: State Auditor hopeful was a frequent flyer as senator.\n\nTerm limited out of the legislature at the end of 2014, Lincoln State Sen. Amanda McGill-D spent much of 2014 looking for a promotion. She wanted to be Nebraska\u2019s next State Auditor, where she\u2019d be responsible for keeping an eye on state spending. Nebraska Watchdog took a close look at some of McGill\u2019s office expenses, specifically her travel expenses. Although she lost her bid for auditor to embattled Republican Charlie Janssen, McGill landed on her feet and goes into 2015 running Congressman-elect Brad Ashford\u2019s (D) Omaha office.\n\nComing up Friday: 7-6 and 5.\n\nContact Joe Jordan at joe@nebraskawatchdog.org.\n\nJoe can be heard on Omaha\u2019s KFAB radio every Monday morning at 7:40, KLIN in Lincoln every Tuesday morning at 7:35 and KHAS-AM in Hastings every Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. and 12:45 p.m.\n\nTo subscribe to news updates from Nebraska Watchdog at no charge, click here", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "In 2014 Nebraska Watchdog continued its commitment to original reporting.\r\nIncluded in our many exclusive reports are stories involving one strange death, two key Capitol Hill races, Nebraska's role in the battles surrounding illegal immigration, Obamacare, \"purple penguins,\" frequent flyers and more.", "title": "Nebraska Watchdog's Top 10 Stories of 2014: 10-9-8...  - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/2014.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-24T06:42:40+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/187408/top-10-stories-2/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Nebraska", "tag": "Amanda McGill,Brad Ashford,Charlie Janssen,Joe Jordan,MECA,Nebraska Watchdog", "published_time": "2014-12-24T06:28:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-24T06:42:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "In 2014 Nebraska Watchdog continued its commitment to original reporting.\r\nIncluded in our many exclusive reports are stories involving one strange death, two key Capitol Hill races, Nebraska's role in the battles surrounding illegal immigration, Obamacare, \"purple penguins,\" frequent flyers and more.", "title": "Nebraska Watchdog's Top 10 Stories of 2014: 10-9-8...  - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/2014.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "article_summary": "Nebraska Watchdog took a close look at some of McGill\u2019s office expenses, specifically her travel expenses.\nBecause, as Nebraska Watchdog first reported, if one of those trains derailed Yutan wasn\u2019t ready.\nAfter first telling Nebraska Watchdog that rail shipments of Bakken oil rolling across Nebraska were a secret, in October state officials did an about face and disclosed which towns were on the route.\nShe wanted to be Nebraska\u2019s next State Auditor, where she\u2019d be responsible for keeping an eye on state spending.\nJoe Jordan | Nebraska WatchdogIn 2014 Nebraska Watchdog continued its commitment to original reportingIncluded in our many exclusive reports are stories involving one strange death, two key Capitol Hill races, Nebraska\u2019s role in the battle\u2019s surrounding illegal immigration, Obamacare, \u201cpurple penguins,\u201d frequent flyers and more."}
