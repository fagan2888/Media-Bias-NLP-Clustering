The study found that 65 percent of Americans said they had helped a stranger and 44 percent had volunteered.\n\nRelated: Why We Might Be Headed for a Recession in 2016\n\nThe most generous country, according to the report, is Myanmar, which edged out the United States after the two nations were tied last year. That country\u2019s generosity may reflect its culture of Theravada Buddhism. More than 90 percent of residents gave money last year, and half volunteered.\n\nRounding out the top five countries on the World Giving Index are New Zealand, Canada and Australia. The list of the top 20 most generous countries also includes some extremely poor nations, including Sri Lanka, Kenya and Guatemala.\n\nGlobally, the report found that 1.4 billion people gave money to charity in 2014, a participation rate of 31.5 percent, up from 28.3 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe world is becoming a more generous place,\u201d CAF Chief Executive John Low said in a statement. \u201cIt is heartening to see that, even during these times of economic uncertainty across the world, people are increasingly likely to donate money to causes to help others.\u201d\n\nRelated: You\u2019re Richer Than You Think. Really.\n\nEven as they\u2019re giving more money, people are less likely to donate their time. The study found that 21 percent of people volunteered in 2014, a slight decline from the previous year.\n\nThe report also reveals some interesting gender divides. In developed countries, women are more likely to give than men, but men are more likely to give overall.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to giving back, Americans rank second in the world, according to a", "title": "Here\u2019s the World\u2019s Most Generous Country \u2014 and It\u2019s Not the U.S.", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Here-s-World-s-Most-Generous-Country-and-It-s-Not-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11102015_Salvation_Army_Giving.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Here-s-World-s-Most-Generous-Country-and-It-s-Not-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11102015_Salvation_Army_Giving.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to giving back, Americans rank second in the world, according to a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f82\"", "article_summary": "The list of the top 20 most generous countries also includes some extremely poor nations, including Sri Lanka, Kenya and Guatemala.\nRounding out the top five countries on the World Giving Index are New Zealand, Canada and Australia.\n\u201cThe world is becoming a more generous place,\u201d CAF Chief Executive John Low said in a statement.\nIn developed countries, women are more likely to give than men, but men are more likely to give overall.\nThe report finds that 63 percent of Americans donated to charity last year, down from 68 percent last year."}
