The Republicans' problems began when the U.S. Supreme Court handed the presidency to G.W. Bush in 2000. With 9/11, Afghanistan war quagmire, Iraq war quagmire, Katrina and the debt crisis and economic downturn, the wheels came completely off the Bush presidency, badly damaging the Republican brand.

Obama's election gave birth to the tea party, then Trump's birtherism drive to discredit Obama. Republicans' loathing of Obama and obstructionism grew, especially after Obamacare passed in 2010. Obama's 2012 re-election, left Republicans furious.

Out of that hateful medium arose 2016's extremist Republican presidential candidates, including Trump. Gaining the House and Senate GOP majority in 2010 and 2012 has been inconsequential.

A contested July RNC convention, with Trump denied the nomination, might just be the final nail in the coffin for the existing GOP! But, even if he's accepted as the Republican candidate look for another Democratic victory and possibly major Republican Congressional upsets

The Republican party needs to stop the loathing and get its soul back!
