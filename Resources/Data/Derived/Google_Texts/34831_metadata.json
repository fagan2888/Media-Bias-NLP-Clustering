Bill Walker\u2019s proposal to cover the Medicaid expansion population, Walker unilaterally expanded Medicaid using a statute that allows executive receipt of federal funds.\n\nThe Alaska legislature, via the Legislative Council, subsequently sued Walker and Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Commissioner Valerie Davidson.\n\nIn August, Superior Court Judge Frank Pfiffner denied the Legislative Council\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, saying they were unlikely to prevail on the merits of the case.\n\n\u201cThis case turns on the meaning of one word: \u2018required,\u2019\u201d Pfiffner said when he rendered that decision.\n\nThe Alaska statute relating to Medicaid eligibility (AS 47.07.020) reads, \u201cAll residents of the state for whom the Social Security Act requires Medicaid coverage are eligible to receive medical assistance under 42 U.S.C. 1396 \u2013 1396p (Title XIX, Social Security Act).\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nThe Medicaid expansion population is included in a Social Security Act list for whom states \u201cmust\u2026 provide for making medical assistance available.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Social Security Act textually commands participating states to provide medical assistance to the expansion group,\u201d Pfiffner wrote in his Tuesday opinion.\n\nThis is the interpretation held by the Walker Administration.\n\nIn NFIB v Sebelius, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote:\n\nAs for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer. The States are given no such choice in this case: They must either accept a basic change in the nature of Medicaid, or risk losing all Medicaid funding. The remedy for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal Government from imposing such a sanction. That remedy does not require striking down other portions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNFIB created a unique situation where, for the first time, the Social Security Act textually commands states to cover a group but it does not penalize noncomplying states,\u201d Pfiffner explained. \u201cThis requirement may lack the coerciveness that Congress intended, but it is still a requirement.\u201d\n\nJudge Pfiffner: Walker More Convincing, Relies on Plain Language\n\nThe Legislative Council disagreed, concluding that this makes the expansion population optional and subject to a 1974 statutory amendment stating, \u201cAdditional groups may not be added unless approved by the legislature.\u201d\n\nFurther, the Legislative Council argued that requiring coverage for the Medicaid expansion population violates the \u201canti-commandeering principle\u201d that limits federal interference in state legislative processes.\n\n\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has struck down laws under the anti-commandeering principle on only two occasions,\u201d responded Pfiffner. \u201cBoth of these cases were decided in the 1990s. It is unlikely that the 1974 Alaska Legislature infused the word \u2018requires\u2019 with a special meaning premised on a constitutional doctrine established in 1992.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he Governor\u2019s interpretation is more convincing because it relies on the plain, rather than a specialized, meaning of the statute,\u201d Pfiffner ruled.\n\nThough in August Pfiffner said he would defer to Davidson on interpretation of relevant statute, Pfiffner relied Tuesday on the 2015 decision in Alaska Department of Health and Social Services v Gross in rejecting Walker\u2019s argument that DHSS should be shown deference.\n\n\u201cThe primary question in this case is what the phrase \u2018for whom the Social Security Act requires Medicaid coverage\u2019 means,\u201d wrote Pfiffner. \u201cAnswering this question does not implicate Department expertise or specialized knowledge. Instead the answer depends on the legislature\u2019s intent in amending Alaska\u2019s Medicaid statute in 1974.\u201d\n\nBut Gross also affirmed that \u201c[A] remedial statute is to be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a part of the Social Security Act, Medicaid is a remedial statute. The primary purpose behind Alaska\u2019s Medicaid statute is to provide \u2018the needy persons of this state\u2026 uniform and high quality care that is appropriate to their condition and cost-effective to the state,\u2019 Pfiffer wrote, quoting from statute.\n\n\u201cInterpreting the statute to require coverage of needy individuals rather than interpreting the statute to forbid coverage promotes this remedial purpose,\u201d he concluded.\n\nPfiffner\u2019s determination is that it was the legislature, not Walker, who ultimately required coverage of the expansion population when it wrote, \u201cAll residents of the state for whom the Social Security Act requires Medicaid coverage are eligible[.]\u201d\n\nLikely referring to Article III, section 16, Pfiffner noted, \u201c[I]f the legislature does make a group eligible, the governor would potentially violate the Alaska Constitution if the governor did not cover the group.\u201d (emphasis in original)\n\nDuring oral arguments on the motion for preliminary injunction, Pfiffner was incredulous that the legislature placed intent language in the FY 2016 budget blocking Medicaid expansion, a move the Alaska Supreme Court has deemed a violation of the confinement clause of the Alaska Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf it so desires, the current legislature can change state law to reject the expansion. Until then, state law requires the Governor to provide Medicaid services to the expansion group,\u201d Pfiffner ruled Tuesday.\n\nHe added, partially quoting Roberts in NFIB, \u201cThis order interprets the law. It says nothing about the merits of expanding Medicaid. It says nothing about the merits of giving that choice to either the executive or the legislative branch of government. \u2018Under the Constitution, that judgment is reserved to the people.'\u201d\n\nLegislative Minority Celebrates Ruling\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer in our court system and today\u2019s ruling validated that belief,\u201d Rep. Andy Josephson (D-Anchorage) said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cBy not properly considering Medicaid expansion legislation, the Majority leadership in the House and Senate left the Governor no choice but to use his executive power to help thousands of Alaskans get life-saving healthcare. That decision was the right one morally, and now we know it was the right one legally.\u201d\n\nDespite advice from Legislative Legal Services that Walker\u2019s expansion of Medicaid was likely legal, the Legislative Council voted to sue. They authorized up to $450,000 for legal representation in the case, including $400,000 for Outside firm Bancroft, LLC.\n\nRep. Sam Kito III (D-Juneau) is the Council\u2019s only minority member and the only member to vote in opposition.\n\nIn a press release, Sen. Bill Wielechowski (D-Anchorage) said:\n\nOur own legislative attorneys predicted this, and the court agreed. It\u2019s disappointing that the Majority in the legislature has now spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to come to the same exact conclusion that our own attorneys did months ago. We can\u2019t change the past, but it is time to move on, accept the court\u2019s decision, and acknowledge the benefits of Medicaid expansion which have been touted by the Majority\u2019s own hired consultants, and the Department of Health and Social Services.\n\n\u201cLawmakers should be working towards Medicaid reform and the hundreds of million[s] in savings, not wasting money by suing the Governor for doing something he was obligated to do by the law,\u201d said Rep. Geran Tarr (D-Anchorage).\n\n\u201cDuring these times of fiscal crisis, we simply do not have the money to waste on this issue, and my sincere wish is that the Majority will accept the court\u2019s decision and not appeal this frivolous lawsuit,\u201d Wielechowski agreed.\n\nOn the contrary, Senate Majority Leader John Coghill (R-North Pole), who sits on the Legislative Council and whose office drove the lawsuit, told KTUU Wednesday afternoon that the legislature will appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Tuesday, a Superior Court judge dismissed the legislature's lawsuit attempting to block the expansion of Medicaid.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Craig Tuten", "og": {"site_name": "Alaska Commons", "description": "On Tuesday, a Superior Court judge dismissed the legislature's lawsuit attempting to block the expansion of Medicaid.", "title": "Legislature's Medicaid Expansion Lawsuit Against State Dismissed - Alaska Commons", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://acmedia.alaskacommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/medicaid-expansion-cover.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-11T09:54:03+00:00", "url": "http://www.alaskacommons.com/2016/03/02/legislatures-medicaid-expansion-lawsuit-against-state-dismissed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday, a Superior Court judge dismissed the legislature's lawsuit attempting to block the expansion of Medicaid.", "creator": "@alaskacommons", "image": "http://acmedia.alaskacommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/medicaid-expansion-cover.jpg", "title": "Legislature's Medicaid Expansion Lawsuit Against State Dismissed - Alaska Commons", "site": "@alaskacommons", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 563153020}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://acmedia.alaskacommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-AC-Logo-Tester-290x290.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/alaskacommons", "section": "Statewide Politics", "tag": "U.S. Supreme Court", "published_time": "2016-03-02T21:30:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T09:54:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bill Walker\u2019s proposal to cover the Medicaid expansion population, Walker unilaterally expanded Medicaid using a statute that allows executive receipt of federal funds.\nOn Tuesday, a Superior Court judge dismissed the legislature\u2019s lawsuit attempting to block the expansion of Medicaid.\nThere are an estimated 42,000 Alaskans eligible for health coverage under Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cThe primary question in this case is what the phrase \u2018for whom the Social Security Act requires Medicaid coverage\u2019 means,\u201d wrote Pfiffner.\nThe Alaska statute relating to Medicaid eligibility (AS 47.07.020) reads, \u201cAll residents of the state for whom the Social Security Act requires Medicaid coverage are eligible to receive medical assistance under 42 U.S.C."}
