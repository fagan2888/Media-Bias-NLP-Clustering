ADA worked with Quest Diagnostics to identify newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 cases in a database. The study has been accepted for publication in journal Diabetes Care.\n\nIn Tennessee there are 750,000 to 1 million people who have diabetes although many do not know they have the disease, said Dr. Alvin Powers, director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center.\n\n\"Tennessee has one of the highest rates of diabetes in the country. The significance of this (study) is that you are detecting diabetes at an earlier stage \u2026 it lowers the long-term problem that comes from diabetes,\" said Powers, who is also a board member of the ADA.\n\nRoughly 12.2 percent of adults, or 797,000, in the state had been diagnosed as of 2013, according to the The State of Obesity 2014 by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\n\"What happens is that often the symptoms in early diabetes in type 2 \u2014 this is in every population that has been looked at \u2014 the onset is insidious for most people. They don't become obvious for several years,\" said Powers.\n\nAllowing diabetes to go untreated can lead to serious and costly complications such as amputations, kidney failure, blindness and nerve problems.\n\nMedicaid expansion programs use federal funding to expand coverage to adults who do not qualify for Medicare and have income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,105 for a single adult.\n\nGov. Bill Haslam proposed Insure Tennessee, a coverage expansion plan in December, to bring insurance access to Tennesseans who are ineligible for TennCare and buying insurance on the federally run insurance marketplace. Insure Tennessee failed in a special senate committee.\n\nDiabetes can be found at early stages by testing blood glucose levels when fasting. People in expanded Medicaid programs have better access to tests where diabetes can be found, said Powers.\n\n\"Regardless of the politics, this to me, is an economic issue. People who have diabetes, we know they cost more to the (health care) system, they are out of work more \u2014 it really becomes an economic issue,\" he said.\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n\u2022750,000-1 million of 6.54 million Tennesseans have diabetes\n\n\u202212.2 percent or 797,000 were diagnosed as of 2013\n\n\u2022200,000 could be living with the disease but be undiagnosed\n\nSource: Dr. Alvin Powers, director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n\nFind out whether you have diabetes risk factors and whether you should get tested: askscreenknow.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1bqgpb4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Medicaid expansion increases diabetes diagnoses; about 200k Tennesseans may be unaware", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Medicaid expansion increases diabetes diagnoses; about 200k Tennesseans may be unaware", "title": "Medicaid expansion brings more diabetes diagnoses", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2015/03/24/medicaid-expansion-brings-diabetes-diagnoses/70346592/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicaid expansion increases diabetes diagnoses; about 200k Tennesseans may be unaware", "title": "Medicaid expansion brings more diabetes diagnoses", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/539ed0787a1a3fdfbe1f32816d0e6204e44fd66a/c=0-58-1199-1257&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Diabetes", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Diabetes", "title": "Medicaid expansion brings more diabetes diagnoses", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b423e80143836c5b452cd1f2f3df0cda349a384b/c=0-102-1200-1702/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54daceb85a55f7044526771f9b226c27ae56fdd6/c=0-58-1199-1257/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee22e709a633c934e1552e1afb11fa82986ea6d9/c=0-137-1199-1038/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00977461c26b8e48489516130b1af276c082fc70/c=0-264-1199-941&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-24T09:03:18.883000-05:00", "shorthed": "Medicaid expansion brings more diabetes diagnoses", "articleid": 70346592, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb39d90b98d6eae04f5ae3ccd1db991c9fc86ad8/c=0-264-1199-941/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5fc194ea2f1128ab7f6a6a15839fb37441b2961e/c=95-0-1106-1805/local/-/media/2015/03/23/Nashville/Nashville/635627312188823591-Powers-Al.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "American Diabetes Association, Alvin Powers, Insure Tennessee, Bill Haslam, diabetes"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Alvin Powers, director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center (Photo: Submitted) Story Highlights States with expanded Medicaid programs have seen an increase in diabetes diagnoses.\nStates with expanded Medicaid programs saw a 23 percent increase in patients newly diagnosed with diabetes, compared to a 0.4 percent increase in the states that didn't expand Medicaid, according to the American Diabetes Association.\nStates that expanded health insurance coverage through Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act are seeing more people diagnosed with diabetes.\nPeople in expanded Medicaid programs have better access to tests where diabetes can be found, said Powers.\nADA worked with Quest Diagnostics to identify newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 cases in a database."}
