Willis Mitchell\n\n\n\n\n\nQUICKREAD Meet the author John Mitchell, who writes fiction under the pen name J. Willis Mitchell, will be signing copies of \u201cMedical Necessity\u201d from 1\u20135 p.m. today at Palisade Brewing Co., 200 Peach Ave. Palisade is \u201cone of my favorite breweries on the Western Slope,\u201d Mitchell said by way of explanation. \u201cDanny, the head brewer, and I met a few years ago when I wrote a review for the brewery at craftbeer.com.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTaking care of sick people could be a mean business,\u201d writes J. Willis Mitchell in his character-driven medical thriller, \u201cMedical Necessity.\u201d\n\nMitchell should know. The Cedaredge resident and owner of SnowPack Public Relations is a former hospital administrator with an obvious gift of psychological insight.\n\nLaurena Mayne Davis: Your characters are so richly drawn. How did you go about developing characters?\n\nJ. Willis Mitchell: All but one of the characters are fictional, inspired by personality types rather than any actual people. When I thought about what I wanted a character to accomplish in the plot, I thought of personality types.\n\nI realized that in my life and career I have seen reoccurring personality types \u2014 some good, others really wretched. It was really a lot of fun to develop these characters. And the more I got into the story, the easier it got to tap into them as I came to know my characters better and better.\n\nThe one character who is not as fictional is Dr. Massari, who is based on a good friend of mine. He is an Egyptian internal medicine doctor (now a U.S. citizen) and a Muslim who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with me when I had to tackle some really difficult management issues at a hospital where I was the CEO.\n\nMy friend had to overcome great obstacles in his life to become the excellent physician he is today. He has saved the lives of many Christian patients and he is in medicine for the right reason.\n\nDavis: And that twisted Dr. Denise DeLuca: Care to spill your inspiration for that medical viper?\n\nMitchell: Ha! Viper is a great description for Dr. Deluca! I think all of us have met at least a few great narcissist people, even sociopaths, in our lives. I have, including a stepmother. So, growing up I had a front row seat to a personality type that ended up serving me well in writing the book.\n\nI added in some megalomaniac behavior I have observed in physicians and I came up with Dr. DeLuca. Isn\u2019t she just wonderfully warped? I\u2019m already thinking of a sequel with her.\n\nDavis: As a former hospital administrator, you had to have drawn upon your own experiences. How much of the story really happened?\n\nMitchell: Many of the issues I write about \u2014 lack of best practices (which I heard many doctors over my career refer to as \u201cindependent medical judgment\u201d), lack of quality and outcomes accountability, doctors bullying nurses, physician financial incentive \u2014 have been addressed since the late 1990s when the book is set.\n\nA lot of these got corrected under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which has greatly aligned hospital and physician interests in doing what\u2019s best for patients. So that\u2019s the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that there are still people, including administrators and doctors, working in hospitals for the wrong reasons \u2014 usually for a paycheck. Sometimes \u2014 like Dr. DeLuca \u2014 for power.\n\nA report out this week on a study conducted by John Hopkins Medicine asserts that hospital medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. The root cause of this continuing problem is caused by many of the issues I write about in \u201cMedical Necessity,\u201d which unfortunately persist in some hospitals.\n\nIt takes a really committed, servant leader hospital administrator with the support of a hospital board to root out these behaviors and hold people accountable. This is easy to say and hard to do, because most hospital managers learn to be command-and-control bosses, rather than inspirational leaders.\n\nDavis: Where did you work in hospital administration?\n\nMitchell: My last position was at the hospital in Delta, which is how I came to live on the Western Slope, something my wife and I really enjoy. It was short-lived because the elected board and I had some major differences of opinions that could not be resolved. But it\u2019s a good little hospital that does a fine job with the services it offers.\n\nI also worked for Centura twice on the Front Range, once as a COO and once as a CEO. I also was the CEO at a 90-bed regional hospital in Washington state. In Washington, my administrative team and I were named \u201cBest Leadership Team in Healthcare for Mid-Sized Hospitals\u201d by HealthLeaders Media. It was quite an honor to receive that annual, national award.\n\nDavis: What do you think readers will be most surprised about as they discover the inner workings of hospitals?\n\nMitchell: Based on the feedback I received from people who have read the book, readers are surprised to find that medical and hospital staff aren\u2019t any better or worse than the people and situations they find in their own workplace. But everyone wants to look forward to going to work and feeling inspired, whether it\u2019s in a hospital or a hamburger stand.\n\nDavis: You also have a background in television, and a persistent TV reporter is a catalyst in the book. What was your television experience like?\n\nMitchell: My TV news experience was limited to about a year. I started as an intern in undergraduate and then was hired to work over a summer. I realized after that year that I did not want to be a TV news reporter. For me, it seemed absurd that I was supposed to be an expert on any given topic in a 30-, 45-second report. I also noted a lot of cynicism among the longtime reporters who did not seem to value what they were doing every day.\n\nDavis: What was the most difficult thing about completing the novel?\n\nMitchell: The difficult part of writing the novel was wondering at times if it was any good and if anyone would care about what I had to say. I finally had to come to peace with those thoughts and assume the answer to both questions would be yes. This fear also was very motivating, as it made me very self-critical to cut out or rewrite parts that were not working.\n\nDavis: What are you working on now?\n\nMitchell: Well, I have several great freelance clients whom I work for every week. But, I\u2019ve dusted off a novel I started many years ago about a Coast Guard pilot in Miami. The character is loosely based on my brother-in-law who was a search and rescue pilot and is now a medevac pilot.\n\nHe tells great stories about his work, to which he is still very committed. When I pulled it out recently and read the first six chapters I had written, I realized it was still pretty good. My wife said she always liked that book and I should finish it.\n\nI\u2019m also planning a sequel to \u201cMedical Necessity\u201d featuring more of Dr. DeLuca. She\u2019s such a wrecking ball. At the end of \u201cMedical Necessity\u201d everyone gets what they deserve. But I exiled Dr. DeLuca to rise up another day, as well as make a key point: Even bad doctors can usually find another job.\n\n\u25a0\n\nHave news about local authors, bookstores, book clubs or writing groups?
