What does it mean for a business to hold a faith or show sincerity? How, as courts now ponder, could a corporation exercise its religion, if it had one?\n\nSepper argues the premise goes against longstanding principles of corporate law.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart is Wal-Mart, even when Sam Walton resigns,\u201d Sepper said. \u201cFor-profit corporations are designed to be separate from the individuals who own them and to protect those individuals from corporate obligations and liabilities.\u201d\n\nSepper said that the courts\u2019 decisions in this area will have a wide effect on health-care benefits, anti-discrimination law and social insurance programs.\n\n\u201cIf for-profit employers are unconstitutionally burdened by regulation of health insurance, they\u2019ll be able to dispute other mandated benefits on religious grounds \u2014 from sexually transmitted infection counseling and testing to vaccination to depression screening,\u201d Sepper pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s just a short step from deciding for-profit, secular employers can deny employees insurance for contraception to allowing them to get rid of employees for simply using contraception.\u201d\n\nSepper wrote an article on the issue, \u201cContraception and the Birth of Corporate Conscience,\u201d which will be published in a forthcoming issue of the American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy & the Law.\n\nReview Sepper\u2019s article here.\n\nCheck out Sepper\u2019s blog posting on the topic.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#a51417", "application-name": "Washington University in St. Louis", "og": {"site_name": "The Source", "description": "The controversy and legal battles surrounding the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act have led to a new \u2013 and worrisome \u2013 legal concept: the idea of a \u201ccorporate conscience,\u201d warns Elizabeth Sepper, who teaches at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.", "title": "Contraception mandate debate leads to worrisome \u2018corporate conscience\u2019 concept, law professor warns\u200b | The Source | Washington University in St. Louis", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2016-01-13T08:43:18-05:00", "url": "https://source.wustl.edu/2013/10/contraception-mandate-debate-leads-to-worrisome-corporate-conscience-concept-law-professor-warns/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The controversy and legal battles surrounding the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act have led to a new \u2013 and worrisome \u2013 legal concept: the idea of a \u201ccorporate conscience,\u201d warns Elizabeth Sepper, who teaches at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.", "card": "summary", "title": "Contraception mandate debate leads to worrisome \u2018corporate conscience\u2019 concept, law professor warns\u200b | The Source | Washington University in St. Louis"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Washington University in St. Louis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "article": {"section": "Humanities & Society", "tag": "School of Law", "published_time": "2013-10-03T00:10:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T08:43:18-05:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://source.wustl.edu/wp-content/themes/thesource-theme/_assets/img/favicon/mstile-144x144.png?v=160222"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6f8\"", "article_summary": "Sepper argues the premise goes against longstanding principles of corporate law.\nSepper, an associate professor of law at Washington University, contends the dangerous doctrine of \u201ccorporate conscience\u201d has begun to emerge as courts endow secular, inanimate businesses with inherently human religious and moral beliefs to excuse them from complying with the law.\nSepper said courts have failed to grapple with tricky issues raised by these unprecedented decisions: How can a business have beliefs, religious or otherwise?\nClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)The controversy and legal battles surrounding the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act have led to a new \u2013 and worrisome \u2013 legal concept: the idea of a \u201ccorporate conscience,\u201d warns Elizabeth Sepper, JD, who teaches at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.\nHow, as courts now ponder, could a corporation exercise its religion, if it had one?"}
