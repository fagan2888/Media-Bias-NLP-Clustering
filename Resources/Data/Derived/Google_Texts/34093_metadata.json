And it often invades your life when you least expect it.\n\nBut you can take steps to keep your medical bills from getting out of hand.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do is to be prepared to the best of your ability,\u201d said Susan Sylvest, certified financial planner at Murphy & Sylvest in Dallas. \u201cUnderstand what your insurance will and will not cover.\u201d\n\nSylvest speaks from personal experience, having dealt with health care providers for her own surgery as well her family\u2019s health needs. She learned firsthand how to deal with medical bills.\n\nHere\u2019s what Sylvest and other experts say you need to know:\n\nStay in network\n\nYour insurance plan contracts with a wide range of doctors, hospitals, labs, radiology facilities and pharmacies. These health care providers are part of your plan\u2019s network and have agreed to accept your plan\u2019s contracted rate as payment in full for services.\n\nThe rate includes both your insurer\u2019s share of the cost and your share. Your share may be in the form of a co-payment, deductible or co-insurance.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say your insurer\u2019s contracted rate for a primary care visit is $120. If you have a $20 co-payment for primary care visits, you\u2019ll pay $20 when you see a doctor in your network and your insurer will pick up the remaining $100.\n\nIf you go outside of your network, you pay more because those providers haven\u2019t agreed to a set rate with your insurer. Your plan may require higher co-payments, deductibles and co-insurance for out-of-network care.\n\n\u201cFor somebody who\u2019s been going to a particular doctor and may now have new coverage, they really need to be certain that the doctor they have a long-standing relationship with is part of their network,\u201d said Mark Rukavina, principal at Community Health Advisors LLC in Chestnut Hill, Mass.\n\n\u201cIf their doctor, who is part of the network, refers them out to a specialist or to a particular hospital for care, they need to make sure those providers are also in the network because that unpleasant surprise of co-insurance trips up lots of people,\u201d Rukavina said.\n\nSometimes, asking the network question may be the last thing on your mind. In an emergency, you may not have the ability \u2014 or the desire \u2014 to ask for such details.\n\nBut in non-emergency situations, ask whether all your providers are in your network.\n\nAsk about costs\n\nBefore undergoing a procedure, ask how much it will cost and how much your insurance company will cover. Much of that will depend on whether you\u2019ve met your deductible and annual out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nYour insurance company can help you with this.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that I have found is that when I\u2019ve called the insurance company, there is usually something called either a case advocate or a nurse advocate,\u201d said Sylvest. \u201cThey are generally nurses who understand insurance as well.\u201d\n\nShe said the questions you should ask are:\n\nWhat do you know about my diagnosis?\n\nShould I get a second opinion?\n\nHow much is this going to cost? Who\u2019s going to be involved?\n\n\u201cWhen trying to judge medical expenses, the biggie is trying to figure out who all will send you a separate bill,\u201d Sylvest said. \u201cThat is by far one of the most challenging things to discover. Call the insurance company and ask, \u2018How many people could I possibly get a bill from?\u2019\u201d\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, the largest health insurer in the state, offers a \u201cbenefits value adviser\u201d to help guide plan participants through health care decisions.\n\nThe adviser helps consumers with provider-specific cost and quality information for common procedures, clinical educational support, appointment scheduling, help in understanding benefits, locating in-network providers and requesting pre-authorization for a procedure.\n\n\u201cMany times, consumers can choose between different providers or facilities and receive the same procedure at a lower cost,\u201d said Margaret Jarvis, a Blue Cross spokeswoman.\n\nKnow the rules\n\nYour insurance company may require pre-authorization for a procedure. For example, one employer\u2019s plan under Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas requires participants to call the insurance company before non-emergency outpatient MRI and CT imaging procedures to receive full benefits.\n\n\u201cSo many insurance companies force you to call them for approval for something that they would deem elective or not time-sensitive,\u201d Sylvest said.\n\nAsk about financial aid\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires nonprofit hospitals to have written financial assistance policies.\n\n\u201cThis only pertains to nonprofit hospitals,\u201d Rukavina said. \u201cBut many for-profit hospitals do have financial assistance policies as well, so people should ask whether the hospital has any form of financial assistance they offer to patients.\u201d\n\nMany nonprofit hospitals have their financial assistance policies structured in a way that they provide help to both insured and uninsured patients, he said.\n\n\u201cEven if somebody is insured, they might have a lot of first-dollar costs in front of them like for a deductible, significant co-pays or co-insurance,\u201d Rukavina said. \u201cThey should ask and see whether or not there\u2019s a financial assistance policy and whether it covers people with insurance, as well as the uninsured.\u201d\n\nYou should also ask your doctor or the hospital if they have extended payment plans.\n\n\u201cMany providers also offer prompt-pay discounts to people, so if you pay at or near the time of service, or within 30 days, they\u2019ll oftentimes offer a prompt-pay discount,\u201d Rukavina said.\n\nGet itemized bills\n\n\u201cThe first and foremost thing any patient has got to do is get a detailed itemized statement,\u201d said Pat Palmer, chief executive of Medical Billing Advocates of America.\n\n\u201cWhat hospitals provide them is something like a summary deal. It will say, \u2018OR: $20,000,\u2019 \u2018Miscellaneous supplies: $30,000.\u2019 You have no clue what you\u2019re being asked to pay for.\u201d\n\nOnce consumers get the itemized statement, they should analyze each charge, she said.\n\n\u201cPrior to any payment, you want a detailed itemized statement of every item you\u2019ve been charged for so you can see if you feel it\u2019s justified,\u201d Palmer said.\n\nBe your own advocate\n\nIt\u2019s important to speak up and fight for your rights.\n\n\u201cThe key points for consumers to recognize are that health care\u2019s expensive and many of us are shocked when we get those bills,\u201d Rukavina said.\n\n\u201cBut silence or not responding is typically not helpful. I\u2019ve found that providers are willing to work with patients if they hear from them.\u201d\n\nFollow Pamela Yip on Twitter at @pamelayip.\n\nIN THE KNOW: Key terms\n\nDeductible: The amount you owe for health care services before your insurance company begins to pay.\n\nCo-payment: A specific charge that your health insurance plan may require that you pay for a specific medical service or supply, also referred to as a co-pay. For example, your health insurance plan may require a $15 co-payment for an office visit or brand-name prescription drug, after which the insurance company pays the remainder of the charges.\n\nCo-insurance: The amount that you have to pay for covered medical services after you\u2019ve made any co-payment or deductible required by your health insurance plan. Co-insurance is typically expressed as a percentage of the charge. For example, if your insurance covers 80 percent of the allowable charge for a specific service, you would be required to cover the remaining 20 percent as co-insurance.\n\nOut-of-pocket maximum: The most you pay during a policy period \u2014 usually a year \u2014 before your insurer begins to pay 100 percent of the allowed amount.\n\nSOURCES: UnitedHealthcare, eHealthInsurance.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical debt is a major factor in the filing of consumer bankruptcies.
