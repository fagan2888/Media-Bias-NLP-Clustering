Yet patients increasingly are forced to pay retail prices to get their medications as health plans have adopted increasingly restrictive drug \"formularies,\" or lists of covered drugs, according to the study.\n\nThe 2014 expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act has done little to curb the rising price of prescription drugs, the authors said.\n\nRosenberg and his co-author, daughter Miranda Rosenberg, a third-year medical student at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, did not identify a specific trend that would explain the price hikes.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Dr. William Eaglstein of the University of Miami considers one important driver of drug prices: the cost of drug development.\n\nDr. Mark Lebwohl, president of the American Academy of Dermatology and chairman of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said there is plenty of blame to go around for higher drug prices. These include pharmaceutical profit-taking and rebates that drug makers pay to health insurers to gain preferred placement on drug formularies.\n\nFor some Americans, prescription drug prices are out of reach. \"There's a high proportion of prescriptions that go unfilled because of the cost,\" Lebwohl said.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Rosenberg surveyed four national pharmacy chains -- Costco, CVS, Sam's Club and Walgreens -- in West Palm Beach, Fla., to obtain retail prices for 72 brand-name drugs. Subsequent surveys eventually included 120 brands and their generic equivalents.\n\nThe final analysis, conducted in August 2015, is based on 19 brand-name drugs and a handful of generics.\n\nEscalating prices were seen across the board. On average, anti-infective medicines (Altabax, Oxistat cream and Xolegel) rose 309 percent, and corticosteroids such as Cloderm cream and Cutivate lotion increased 290 percent. Acne and rosacea medicines, including Benzaclin and Finacea, jumped 195 percent, and psoriasis drugs such as Oxsoralen-Ultra increased 180 percent on average.\n\nTwo drugs for cancer-related skin conditions -- Targretin (bexarotene) gel and Carac (fluorouracil) cream -- each posted increases of 1,697 percent over the six-year study period. Targretin's price jumped from $1,686 in 2009 to $15,708 in 2014 and $30,320 in 2015. Carac averaged $159 in 2009. By 2015, the median price was $2,705.\n\nA 30-gram tube of nystatin-triamcinolone, a generic antifungal medicine, rose from $9.15 in 2011 to $103.88 in 2014, a 10-fold price increase, the authors found.\n\n\"We're getting the message, 'Prescribe generics,' but the generics are a fortune,\" Lebwohl said. \"I do think that a public outcry will help.\"\n\nMore information\n\nHealthFinder.gov can help you find prescription assistance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/mis-cancer-news-102/retail-prices-of-dermatology-drugs-skyrocket-705625.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/creme_skin.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Study reveals quintupling of prices over six years", "title": "Retail Prices of Dermatology Drugs Skyrocket"}, "description": "Study reveals quintupling of prices over six years", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Between 2009 and 2015, retail prices of brand-name dermatologic drugs rose 401 percent, on average, study authors reported Nov. 25 in JAMA Dermatology.\nIn an accompanying editorial, Dr. William Eaglstein of the University of Miami considers one important driver of drug prices: the cost of drug development.\nFor some Americans, prescription drug prices are out of reach.\nBeginning in 2009, Rosenberg surveyed four national pharmacy chains -- Costco, CVS, Sam's Club and Walgreens -- in West Palm Beach, Fla., to obtain retail prices for 72 brand-name drugs.\nDr. Mark Lebwohl, president of the American Academy of Dermatology and chairman of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said there is plenty of blame to go around for higher drug prices."}
