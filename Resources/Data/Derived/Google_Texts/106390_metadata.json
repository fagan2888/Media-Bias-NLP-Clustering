His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nThey call the Trans-Pacific Partnership the TPP. But it\u2019s really a bi-partisan Ponzi scheme \u2013 and should be called \u201cTrans-Pacific Ponzi.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a trillion dollar rip-off of the American people and American workers. President Barack Obama wants \u201cfast-track authority\u201d because he wants to put the end of America as we know it on a fast track.\n\nTrust me, neither TPP or the TPA (ie fast track authority for the president) are dead. Like Freddie Kruger of \u201cNightmare on Elm Street\u201d they will keep coming back from the dead. Because the billionaires and billion dollar multi-national corporations want TPP \u2026 badly. The powers that be will not rest until it passes \u2013 come hook or crook. And since they are all crooks, they\u2019ll use any means necessary to get it passed.\n\nBut TPP makes Obamacare look open, honest and transparent. Share:\n\nMy book, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class,\u201d describes the unholy alliance of the socialists and communists like Obama and the crony capitalist corporations who own both political parties. The TPP is the perfect example of \u201cthe murder of the middle class\u201d in one devastating treaty. Passing it requires secrecy and fraud carried out by both Obama and his partners in the Republican Party. Fraud and treachery certainly makes for strange bedfellows.\n\nThe worst part isn\u2019t even what\u2019s in it \u2013 and it contains a toxic brew that will destroy millions of middle class jobs. More on that later.\n\nBut the worst part is how it\u2019s been hidden from the people by Obama and the Republican leadership \u2013 working as a tag team like this is a World Wrestling Federation match.\n\nRemember when Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cWe have to pass Obamacare to find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d We all know how that turned out. Obamacare is killing jobs, dramatically increasing the national debt and bankrupting the middle class with gigantic increases in health insurance premiums. That\u2019s precisely why no one wanted you to read it, study it, or take the time to analyze it.\n\nThese disastrous billion dollar bills need to be hidden and then passed quickly before anyone has a chance to understand their implications. They are written by lobbyists and lawyers, and never read by the very politicians voting for them. It\u2019s all about dollars. Corporations and fat-cat donors make billions and the politicians collect millions in legal bribes (also called \u201ccampaign contributions\u201d) and million dollar lobbying jobs after they retire.\n\nThat was the real storyline of Obamacare.\n\nThe exact same scenario is playing out with the TPP. Do you know what\u2019s in the details? I don\u2019t. Neither do any of the Republicans voting for it. They openly admit it. Members of Congress need a \u201csecurity clearance\u201d to be \u201callowed\u201d to read it.\n\nLeading GOP TPP supporter Sen. Orrin Hatch admits he doesn\u2019t fully know what\u2019s in it.\n\nGOP Majority Whip Steve Scalise and GOP Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions both admit they haven\u2019t read it.\n\nPaul Ryan channeled Nancy Pelosi when he said, \u201cIt\u2019s classified. You\u2019ll find out what\u2019s in it after we pass it and it\u2019s declassified.\u201d\n\nCredit: AP\n\nAre you kidding me? The GOP now thinks it\u2019s own voters are as dumb and ignorant as Democrats? Paul Ryan thinks he should be allowed to pass bills the citizens aren\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d to read? Really? Then it\u2019s time for the citizens to remove Paul Ryan from office.\n\nFolks Obamacare was 2,000 pages of legalese that no average citizen could understand. The regulatiions of Obamacare contain over 2 million words. That was the tip off that it was a rip off. But TPP makes Obamacare look open, honest and transparent.\n\nTPP is kept under lock and key. No citizen has access. No citizen has a clue what\u2019s in it. Only senators and representatives with security clearance can walk into a room in the Capital Building to read it \u2013 alone. Then they are required to leave without making copies or taking notes.\n\nDoes this sound strange to you? Does it sound surreal? Does it sound like it\u2019s good for the people?\n\nBecause to me it sounds like a scam. A Ponzi scheme. Only criminals want their victims to sign contracts without reading them. It\u2019s quite clear \u2013 the ruling class and the corporate elite think we are serfs, and they are our masters.\n\nAt this point I don\u2019t care what\u2019s in it. If they don\u2019t want us to read it \u2013 if Congress thinks they should pass it without knowing what\u2019s in it \u2013 then our job is to burn it down. Stick a knife in its heart. Stab it until it can never again rear its ugly head.\n\nBut what is actually in it? Well Wikileaks has leaked small parts of it. It appears it is a killer of American sovereignty. The TPP appoints a commission of soul-less corporate lawyers with sweeping authority to override U.S. laws and our Constitution.\n\nThat commission will have sweeping power over U.S. trade, labor, immigration, environmental and commerce regulations. In other words, foreign and corporate powers will be running the United States of America. Unelected foreign lawyers representing multi-national corporations will have more power than American citizens and even our politicians. And America only gets one vote on this commission. We\u2019ll have no more power or importance over rules regulating our lives than Brunei or South Korea.\n\nHow does that sound to you?\n\nBut I don\u2019t need to know all that. All I need to know is it\u2019s supported by Barack Obama. Heck its been nicknamed \u201cObamatrade.\u201d If Obama created it, it must be a toxic brew of onerous job-killing government regulation, insane job-killing climate change rules, illegal immigration amnesty that opens our borders to the poor and dependent of the world (future Democrat voters), and higher minimum wages that will drive small businesses out of business and guarantee millions more jobs are shipped overseas (where they can pay employees pennies on the dollar).\n\nObama doesn\u2019t support free trade. He supports Big Brother government and \u201cthe murder of the middle class.\u201d He loves to fool and defraud you by using cute cuddly names. The bill that made your healthcare unaffordable was named \u201cThe Affordable Care Act.\u201d Now the bill that destroys America\u2019s free trade economy is disguised as \u201cfree trade.\u201d\n\nFor once the unions are right. This is a treaty that will destroy good-paying American jobs. It will destroy middle class lives. It will make the American Dream unaffordable. How do you know I\u2019m right? Because the government has banned the citizens from reading it. It\u2019s time to rise up and kill it. And if the GOP won\u2019t listen to its own voters and supporters, then it\u2019s time to kill the GOP.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
