The newest soldier in this problem-solving army is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nBack in August, I noted that Republicans in Congress are stepping up to the issue of finding better treatment, or perhaps even a cure, for such terrible maladies as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and cancer.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn the House, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee, has advanced his 21st Century Cures Act, which passed the House by a wide margin in July.\n\nAlso in July, on the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the turbocharged National Republican Senatorial Committee, among other powerful posts, introduced the EUREKA [Ensuring Useful Expenditures is the Key to Alzheimer\u2019s] Act . Wicker, like Upton, is far more of a workhorse than a showhorse; perhaps that\u2019s why the courtly Mississippian has already managed to gain 24 co-sponsors for his four-month-old bill.\n\nAt the same time, the Republican presidential candidates, too, are becoming energized on the cures issue. In September, for Breitbart, I noted that White House hopeful Mike Huckabee has made cures a linchpin of his campaign.\n\nIndeed, in the now-notorious CNBC debate in Colorado, Huckabee was emphatic on the cures issue. Responding to a question on Medicare from the network\u2019s Becky Quick\u2014in what is certain to be her first-and-last debate-moderating appearance\u2014Huckabee answered:\n\nWell, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. The fact is if we don\u2019t address what\u2019s costing so much, we can\u2019t throw enough money at this. And it\u2019s why I\u2019ve continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.\n\nHaving made the point that we have to do something positive, Huckabee reminded viewers that the United States has history on its side; we have solved the problem of disease before\u2014and thereby reaped huge economic, as well as humanitarian, benefits. Thinking back to the Salk Vaccine of 1955, the Arkansan recalled:\n\nPolio\u2014when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? We didn\u2019t spend any. We\u2019ve saved billions of dollars.\n\nAnd then he returned to the looming fiscal and human crisis of Medicare:\n\nYou want to fix Medicare? Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you\u2019ve fixed America, its economy and you\u2019ve made people\u2019s lives a heck of a lot better.\n\nHuckabee then summed it up, posing a question to those who have let themselves be preoccupied with health insurance at the expense of broader health concerns:\n\nWhy aren\u2019t we talking about\u2014instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people\u2014why don\u2019t we say, \u201cLet\u2019s cure the four big cost-driving diseases?\u201d\n\nNow, vastly strengthening the effort, here comes an even bigger name in the GOP these days, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas; Cruz is running third in the latest Fox News presidential poll, behind only Donald Trump and Ben Carson.\n\nIn the healthcare arena, Cruz is best known, of course, as perhaps America\u2019s most vociferous opponent of Obamacare\u2014or, as he likes to call it, \u201cthe train wreck of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nYes, Cruz\u2019s bona fides as a resolute opponent of Obamacare, or anything that smacks of Big Government, are sterling.\n\nYet at the same time, the Texan knows that Americans do not live by libertarian limited government alone.\n\nIn July, in his capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness, Cruz chaired a fact-finding Capitol Hill hearing, \u201cUnlocking Cures for America\u2019s Most Deadly Diseases.\u201d\n\nThree months later, in October, having distilled the lessons he learned from that hearing and other research, Cruz spoke to the American Academy of Pharmaceutical Scientists, meeting in St. Louis, and declared, \u201cWe need a supply side revolution that spurs medical innovation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in an extended paean to discovery throughout American history, Cruz added:\n\nAmerica has always been a pioneering place. The first light bulb, telephone, airplane, and smart phone were all created in America. The same has been true in medical innovation.\n\nBut, the junior senator from Texas continued, medical innovation, in particular, is being crushed. And a principal culprit in this crushing is the Food and Drug Administration. Laws and regulations that may have been put in place with the best of intentions are now having a deadly impact.\n\nAs Cruz put it, far too many medical researchers and entrepreneurs are \u201cbeing denied the opportunity to save lives today.\u201d Continuing, he added:\n\nAs economist Alex Tabarrok so aptly etched into the American imagination, there lies within our cities and towns an invisible graveyard. While they keep stealing the lives of our loved ones who fall victim to uncured diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, and Parkinson\u2019s. Never know how many could have been saved through breakthrough research. But we can work to save millions who otherwise would fall prey to those diseases. We need to open a new era of medical innovation.\n\nLater in October, Cruz published an equally detailed article in National Review, \u201cLet\u2019s Revive America\u2019s Culture of Cures,\u201d in which he asserted:\n\nWe need to tear down the barriers blocking a new era of medical innovation, and the primary inhibitor is the government itself. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration stifles new treatments, operates with decades-old methodology, and discourages scientific development.\n\nWe might observe that the proof that Cruz is right about the FDA comes from the FDA\u2019s own data: While drug approvals have upticked in the last few years, approvals are fewer today than they were two decades ago. We can add that it\u2019s hard to think of anything else in the economy, or in the tech sector, that is worse today than it was in the mid-90s. And the same disappointing story, or worse, could be told for medical devices and antibiotics.\n\nAnd since Cruz is a sitting senator, he can do things; nothing happens easily in Washington these days, but alongside his fellow lawmakers, Upton and Wicker, Cruz has started the ball rolling.\n\nAs an aside, we can note with wonder the curious case of Dr. Ben Carson.\n\nAs a former onetime neurosurgeon who saved many a life, Carson would seem to be the obvious and most effectiv Republican champion of a Cure Strategy. Yet instead, he is trapped in a no-win \u201cgotcha\u201d game, defending himself against charges that he wants to abolish Medicare. And his defense is not being helped by the fact that he indeed has called for abolishing Medicare, and still wants to.\n\nWhatever the merits of this idea in the mind of a purist, in the minds of real people it\u2019s pure poison.\n\nSo now we might look ahead: Where will this \u201cCures Crusade\u201d take us? And crucially, what are its implications for the overall healthcare system?\n\nWe can start by considering what is still the hottest health issue for Republicans\u2014Obamacare. Virtually all Republicans are united in strong opposition to Obamacare; indeed, staunch opposition helped the Party win the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. (The GOP seemed to take a detour in 2012.)\n\nYet as we look ahead, we can see that Obamacare will be hard to repeal, even if the GOP wins the White House next year. And why is that? Well, for openers, Republicans have yet to a agree on a formula for \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s perfectly evident that \u201crepeal and replace\u201d gets harder with each passing year, as the system adjusts, however painfully and fitfully, to the new bureaucratic burden.\n\nMoreover, for further perspective on repealing the Democrats\u2019 handiwork, we might think back on the Department of Education. The DOE was established in 1979, and Ronald Reagan pledged to abolish it in his triumphant 1980 campaign for the White House. Yet once in office, President Reagan was stymied by the legislative challenge of finding an acceptable replacement model. So even though the Gipper won two consecutive national elections in landslides, carrying a total of 93 states and earning more than 1000 electoral votes, he still couldn\u2019t find a \u201crepeal and replace\u201d formula for that meddlesome department.\n\nThus the fate of the Department of Education\u2014still going strong, bigger than ever, four decades after its creation\u2014should serve as a cautionary tale for Republicans as they plot the fate of Obamacare. As GOPers look ahead with hope to a right-leaning 45th president, they might reflect that the Party will have to hit on all cylinders to make \u201crepeal and replace\u201d a reality. With that in mind, all Republicans might wish to broaden the argument over health policy to include cures; after all, while not everyone wants to repeal national health insurance, everyone does wish to be cured of dreaded disease.\n\nIn other words, the Cure Strategy, as advanced by such visionary leaders as Upton, Wicker, Huckabee, and Cruz, offers a potential booster for the GOP\u2019s political and legislative success.\n\nToday, all Americans instinctively yearn for a future of medical innovation and transformation. And so Republican activists ought seriously to consider a plan for giving Americans what they want; after all, medical cures raise all boats. Indeed, as GOPers seek that frustratingly elusive national majority\u2014the Party has obtained a majority of the vote only in one of the last six presidential elections\u2014activists ought to be thinking fresh, vote-enticing thoughts. They should be thinking, not just about \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d but, rather, repeal and transcend.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ranks of the Republican cures crusade continue to swell.
