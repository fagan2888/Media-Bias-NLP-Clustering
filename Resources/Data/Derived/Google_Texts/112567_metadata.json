After a failed attempt to deal with the issue as part of the Affordable Care Act, it may again be returning to the policy agenda. Can we avoid another catastrophic bout of misinformation?\n\nThe debate over end-of-life planning has largely been dormant since 2009, when the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin\u2019s false claim that President Obama\u2019s health care plan included a \u201cdeath panel\u201d spelled the end of a proposal for Medicare to reimburse doctors for voluntary end-of-life consultations with patients. The Obama administration briefly issued and then withdrew a regulation that would have added end-of-life consultation coverage to Medicare in early 2011, but is likely to revisit the issue after receiving a recommendation from an influential American Medical Association panel.\n\nA Myth That Refuses to Die Although the claim has been repeatedly proved false, polls have consistently shown that more than a third of Americans believe the Affordable Care Act created a government panel to make decisions about end-of-life care for people on Medicare. % 40 30 20 10 0 34% Jul '10 Dec '10 Jun '11 Nov '11 Sep '12 Mar '13 Mar '14 % 40 30 20 10 0 34% Jan '11 Jan '12 Jan '13 Mar '14\n\nUnfortunately, the lesson from the \u201cdeath panel\u201d controversy is that this issue is vulnerable to demagoguery if it becomes linked to people\u2019s partisanship or feelings about controversial political figures and issues. For example, after Ms. Palin\u2019s comments became widely known, and other prominent Republicans began to echo her claims, the myth came to be deeply held among the public. People\u2019s negative predispositions toward Mr. Obama or his plan overwhelmed their critical faculties.\n\nIn an analysis of 2009 polling data, for instance, I found that Republicans who thought they were well informed about Mr. Obama\u2019s plan were more likely to be misinformed than those who said they didn\u2019t know very much about it \u2014 the same pattern observed in 1993 for the myth that President Clinton\u2019s health care plan would take away your choice of doctor.\n\nThe same biased reasoning processes make it difficult to undo these mistaken beliefs once they are entrenched. In a 2011 experiment, Jason Reifler, Peter Ubel and I found that corrective information about the \u201cdeath panel\u201d claim successfully reduced belief in the myth among people with neutral or warm feelings toward Ms. Palin who were less knowledgeable about politics.\n\nPhoto\n\nHowever, we found that misperceptions did not decrease significantly among people with mixed or positive feelings toward Ms. Palin who were more knowledgeable about politics \u2014 the individuals who are best equipped cognitively to resist unwelcome information. In fact, exposure to corrective information attributed to \u201cnonpartisan health care experts\u201d actually increased belief in the myth among respondents who feel very warmly toward her \u2014 a finding that is consistent with the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d Mr. Reifler and I found in prior research.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe \u201cdeath panel\u201d belief has persisted in the years since Ms. Palin\u2019s comments. Though the wording of the question is imperfect, polling data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that approximately one-third of Americans still believe in the myth \u2014 a proportion that has remained relatively stable since 2010. (Similarly, a 2012 academic survey using different wording found that one in two Americans endorsed the myth and only about one in six knew with high certainly that it was false.) This persistence may be the reason that the Obama administration has avoided the issue until now.\n\nWill things turn out differently this time? Support for covering voluntary end-of-life planning is actually remarkably strong across the political spectrum. In addition to the American Medical Association panel\u2019s recommendation, both private insurers and states such as Colorado and Oregon are now offering coverage for these consultations. Even critics of President Obama\u2019s health care plan such as National Review\u2019s Wesley J. Smith and Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, are in favor of advance planning.\n\nGiven the strength of this bipartisan consensus, adding coverage for end-of-life planning might seem unlikely to attract significant opposition or revive previous misconceptions. But a risk-averse administration may still elect to dodge the issue given Mr. Obama\u2019s weak approval ratings and precarious political standing. A lesson of 2009, after all, is that it only takes one ambitious critic to spark a conflagration.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140910070110, "twitter": {"description": "The persistence of the \u201cdeath panels\u201d myth shows that the issue is vulnerable to exploitation by a demagogue.", "title": "Can We Have a Fact-Based Conversation About End-of-Life Planning?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/upshot/can-we-have-a-fact-based-conversation-about-end-of-life-planning.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003100180"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "BrendanNyhan", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/upshot/10UP-PANELS/10UP-PANELS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/upshot/can-we-have-a-fact-based-conversation-about-end-of-life-planning.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003100180", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/upshot/can-we-have-a-fact-based-conversation-about-end-of-life-planning.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 10, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Living Wills and Health Care Proxies,Polls and Public Opinion,Obama  Barack,Palin  Sarah", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Brendan Nyhan", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/upshot/10UP-PANELS/10UP-PANELS-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Palin, Sarah", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By BRENDAN NYHAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The persistence of the \u201cdeath panels\u201d myth shows that the issue is vulnerable to exploitation by a demagogue.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/upshot/10UP-PANELS/10UP-PANELS-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The persistence of the \u201cdeath panels\u201d myth shows that the issue is vulnerable to exploitation by a demagogue.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Palin, Sarah", "published": "2014-09-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "11up-panels", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824162508, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/upshot/can-we-have-a-fact-based-conversation-about-end-of-life-planning.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/upshot/10UP-PANELS/10UP-PANELS-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The persistence of the \u201cdeath panels\u201d myth shows that the issue is vulnerable to exploitation by a demagogue.", "title": "Can We Have a Fact-Based Conversation About End-of-Life Planning?"}, "pdate": 20140910, "des": "Polls and Public Opinion", "articleid": 100000003100180, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Can We Have a Fact-Based Conversation About End-of-Life Planning?", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cc8\"", "article_summary": "Even critics of President Obama\u2019s health care plan such as National Review\u2019s Wesley J.
