However, two other lawsuits have been filed, with the trial courts in each issuing wildly differing opinions.\n\nKlayman v. Obama was filed in a Washington, D.C., federal court the day after The Guardian first broke the Snowden story. Last month, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon found the NSA\u2019s activities \u201calmost Orwellian\u201d and likely unconstitutional.\n\nLess than two weeks later, a federal court in New York arrived at an opposite conclusion. U.S. District Court Judge William Pauley found that the American Civil Liberties Union lacked standing to sue NSA Director James Clapper for Fourth Amendment rights violations. The court could have left it at that, but Pauley went on to rule that mere telephone numbers are not protected under the Fourth Amendment, though the judge did admit that the sheer amount of data collected was \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay you live in interesting times\u201d is an ancient Chinese curse. A fitful Obamacare rollout accompanied by a spate of lawsuits, a midterm election that could result in a reversal of political fortune and now Paul\u2019s class-action lawsuit could very well combine to make 2014 an interesting time.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "U.S. Sen Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced his intention to file a class-action lawsuit against the Obama administration\u2019s National Security Agency.
