A Liberian doctor's death is the second among the six people treated with ZMapp, an experimental drug to treat Ebola made by a San Diego-based biotech.\n\nA Liberian doctor treated with a San Diego company's experimental Ebola drug has died.\n\nAbraham Borbor was one of six Ebola patients to receive ZMapp, a drug previously untested in humans. Officials said he had been improving until his condition took a turn for the worse Sunday.\n\nAs of last week, two other West African health workers treated with ZMapp were said to be showing signs of recovery.\n\nThe small San Diego firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical is focused on producing more Zmapp now that existing supplies have run out.\n\nExperts have said it's unclear whether or not the drug has been effective. A Spanish priest who took ZMapp also died, but two American recipients have already been released from the hospital.\n\nQuestions remain about how much ZMapp each patient received and how far the disease had progressed before they received treatment.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have died in the current Ebola outbreak, making it the deadliest on record.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Liberian doctor's death is the second among the six people treated with ZMapp, an experimental drug to treat Ebola made by a San Diego-based biotech.", "author": "David  Wagner", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "A Liberian doctor's death is the second among the six people treated with ZMapp, an experimental drug to treat Ebola made by a San Diego-based biotech.", "title": "African Doctor Treated With San Diego Company's Ebola Drug Dies", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/aug/25/african-doctor-treated-san-diego-companys-ebola-dr/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2014/08/25/ebolamsf_wide-9ce622cb71b00ea5e5eba90644cebf09694c9b7a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "142461 %##% African Doctor Treated With San Diego Company's Ebola Drug Dies", "keywords": "Health, Science, Biotechnology", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d4a\"", "article_summary": "A Liberian doctor treated with a San Diego company's experimental Ebola drug has died.\nA Liberian doctor's death is the second among the six people treated with ZMapp, an experimental drug to treat Ebola made by a San Diego-based biotech.\nThe small San Diego firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical is focused on producing more Zmapp now that existing supplies have run out.\nA Spanish priest who took ZMapp also died, but two American recipients have already been released from the hospital.\nAs of last week, two other West African health workers treated with ZMapp were said to be showing signs of recovery."}
