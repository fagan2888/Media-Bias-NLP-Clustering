(AP) - The images of Granby Street\u2019s long-gone arches of light have found their way onto many a postcard.\n\nThe views show the port city\u2019s bustling downtown around the turn of the 20th century; row after row of big, beaming lights, each arch stretching above and across Granby.\n\nNorfolk wants that scenery back.\n\nProblem is, it\u2019s not cheap to re-create the past. So, city leaders are rolling out a less expensive version of the arches.\n\nFor about $565,000, you\u2019ll soon see steel cable arches. They won\u2019t look as hefty as those of yesteryear, but city leaders hope they\u2019ll give Granby some new and, at the same time, throwback personality.\n\nConstruction began earlier this month; crews are digging holes for the foundation, city spokeswoman Lori Crouch said in an email.\n\nA total of 11 arches, between 300 and 500 feet apart, will run from Brambleton Avenue to Main Street. Six will be completed by March, Deputy City Manager Ron Williams Jr. said. They will be composed of 42-foot stainless steel cables connected to 24-foot poles on either side of Granby. The light bulbs, 40 on each cable, are two and a half inches wide.\n\nThe additional tax revenue that downtown property owners agreed to pay in exchange for enhanced services is covering the cost, Crouch said.\n\nThe original arches would\u2019ve cost the city millions, Williams told several council members during a committee meeting earlier this month.\n\n\u201cReally, that image was about a $3 million image,\u201d Williams said during the meeting.\n\nThe arches first lit up Granby on Sept. 1, 1909, according to a front-page story in The Virginian-Pilot that dubbed them \u201cThe Great White Way.\u201d\n\nIt stated that Norfolk was \u201cthe most brilliantly lighted city in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cA more decided tone of metropolitanism hung in the air and the beauty of it all was that everybody was happy and all smiles,\u201d the article read.\n\nBy 1924, the lights had become a source of displeasure.\n\nAn article in June 1924 stated that the lights, once \u201cthe pride of Norfolk \u2026 have dropped so in public estimation with the passing years.\u201d Norfolk\u2019s then-City Manager Charles E. Ashburner called them \u201csmall town stuff\u201d and reported that they were going to be taken down.\n\nThe idea to re-create them started a couple of years ago and resulted from \u201ctwo parallel visions that collided in a great way,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAt the time, Mayor Paul Fraim and then-Councilman Anthony Burfoot advocated for better lighting on Granby Street, Williams said.\n\nAround the same time, a small group of downtown stakeholders seized on the idea of re-creating the historic arches they saw in photos.\n\nOne of them was Kevin Murphy, president of the Downtown Norfolk Civic League.\n\n\u201cThe historic pictures just look wonderful,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBut he was underwhelmed, he said, by a demonstration of the lights a couple weeks ago. They weren\u2019t as large as Murphy had hoped, and did not have the same dramatic effect.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the final product will be more impactful,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cEither do it right or don\u2019t do it at all.\u201d\n\nDeborah Thorpe, a board member of the Downtown Norfolk Council, also witnessed the demonstration.\n\n\u201cThe concept, I think it\u2019s great,\u201d said Thorpe, assistant director for the Governor\u2019s School for the Arts, which is also on Granby.\n\n\u201cIt will look very cool as you\u2019re looking down the street.\u201d\n\nPilot news researcher Jakon Hays contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The images of Granby Street's long-gone arches of light have found their way onto many a postcard.", "Author": "TIM EBERLY", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/27/norfolks-arches-of-light-to-return-to-granby-stree/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The images of Granby Street\u2019s long-gone arches of light have found their way onto many a postcard.", "title": "Norfolk\u2019s \u2018Arches of Light\u2019 to return to Granby Street"}, "twitter": {"title": "Norfolk\u2019s \u2018Arches of Light\u2019 to return to Granby Stre", "description": "The images of Granby Street's long-gone arches of light have found their way onto many a postcard.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "NORFOLK, Va.
