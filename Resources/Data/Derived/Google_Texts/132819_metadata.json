Kramer, a cofounder of the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis, is also the revered author of Faggots and The Normal Heart. So people took note when, just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published national guidelines that included PrEP in its HIV prevention strategy, Kramer spoke out against people who take it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to me cowardly about taking Truvada instead of using a condom,\u201d Kramer told The New York Times. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a drug that is poison to you, and it has lessened your energy to fight, to get involved, to do anything.\u201d\n\nMore problematically, Michael Weinstein, the president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, is using the brand and the resources of one of the world\u2019s largest HIV and AIDS organizations to launch an anti-PrEP campaign, which raises red flags about its efficacy if not taken properly but does little to educate about its enormous potential to help end HIV.\n\nAs a counterbalance to these influential voices, The Advocate has reached out to and compiled quotes from prominent individuals, including doctors, activists, leaders of health organizations, and other well-known proponents of PrEP, which has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection by up to 99 percent if taken daily as directed. Find out why the World Health Organization, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Kramer\u2019s alma mater, the GMHC, along with many others, are saying yes to PrEP. Those without quotations did not release a formal statement, but wanted to be included in the list of supporters.\n\nDo you support use of PrEP? Leave your reason why in the comments below. And be sure to follow The Advocate's monthlong series of articles, \u201c31 Days of PrEP.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time, WHO strongly recommends men who have sex with men consider taking antiretroviral medicines as an additional method of preventing HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis) alongside the use of condoms. Rates of HIV infection among men who have sex with men remain high almost everywhere and new prevention options are urgently needed. Modelling estimates that, globally, 20-25 percent reductions in HIV incidence among men who have sex with men could be achieved through pre-exposure prophylaxis, averting up to 1 million new infections among this group over 10 years.\u201d [WHO]\n\n\n\nIan Thompson, Legislative Representative, ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual and HIV Project: \u201cIt is important for the response to HIV to always be based on what the science tells us. PrEP has been demonstrated to vastly reduce the risk of contracting the disease and additionally, it would enable those at the greatest risk of contracting HIV to exercise greater control over their medical care. The government should ensure it is doing all that it can to remove any barriers \u2013 including financial \u2013 that would prevent those who wish to use PrEP from being able to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends PrEP's use for any \u201cgay or bisexual man who has had anal sex without a condom or been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months. ... PrEP is a powerful HIV prevention tool and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone. But people who use PrEP must commit to taking the drug every day and seeing their health care provider for follow-up every three months.\u201d [CDC]\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Balli, Health Care Professional: \u201cYou deserve to navigate your sexuality with empowerment and safety. Love and sex do not have to be a battlefield, and it's time we accept that there is the possibility of a future where we're not on opposing sides (poz and neg), and we don't have to go into it wearing armor and the scars of past fears.\u201d [\u201cMen of Color Explain Why They Take PrEP\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\nAVAC: \u201cRecent clinical trials have shown clearly that daily, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using the antiretroviral drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection for men and women who take it as directed. While PrEP won\u2019t be right for every individual at risk for HIV, untold numbers of men and women will benefit \u2014 if they can access this potentially life-saving option.\u201d [AVAC]\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Barrington-Ward, Health Equity Professional: \u201cPrEP is merely a tool in our prevention toolbox, and we should be empowering people with the facts about PrEP, not stigmatizing or shaming people for wanting another prevention option outside of condoms.\u201d [\u201cMen of Color Explain Why They Take PrEP\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\nCalvin Stowell, Director of Digital and Content, DoSomething.Org: \u201cI am for any and every measure that helps prevent the spread of HIV. PrEP, in coordination with condoms and better education about the virus, could help us see the end of the HIV epidemic. We should all be working together to make sure everyone, regardless of age, race or class can access any and every tool necessary to prevent HIV, and PrEP is one of those tools.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMathew Rodriguez, Community Editor, TheBody.com: \u201cI think PrEP is useful, but there are people for whom it may not be the best option, so it\u2019s really a \u2018Know thyself\u2019 situation. But, if it is an option you want to pursue, know that you must be the best advocate for your own health, and there may be a lot of obstacles in your way \u2014 fussy doctors, insurance red tape, pharmacy problems. Be ready to combat them, and if you need help, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to someone.\u201d [\u201cMen of Color Explain Why They Take PrEP\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\nZack Ford, Editor, Think Progress: \u201cKnowing your status and reducing the risk of transmission is common sense. PrEP is an easy way to resist the HIV epidemic, and we should celebrate those who take steps to keep themselves and others safer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Murguia, Federal Employee and HIV Activist: \u201cThe research is clear. When used correctly and consistently, PrEP can help reduce new HIV infections. The question is why more folks are not using it.\u201d [\u201cOp-ed: We Need Every Tool to End HIV\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\nR.J. Aguiar, YouTube Personality and Bisexual Activist: \u201cHIV infections are on the rise again. It makes no sense not to use every tool at our disposal to put a stop to it, or to shame members of our community for using them. Period.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Glazek, Executive Editor, Genius.com: \u201cIt\u2019s good politics to be on PrEP \u2014 it\u2019s good to want the AIDS epidemic to end. It\u2019s also good to be able to truthfully say to your poz friends, \u2018This is literally something that doesn't even potentially matter to me.\u2019 Sexual exclusion of poz people is a very real and very shitty thing. When you go on PrEP, you\u2019re not neg or poz anymore \u2014 you're \u2018post.\u2019\u201d [\u201cMen on PrEP Explain Why They Take It\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\nCorey Johnson, New York City Council Member: \u201cIt\u2019s simple: PrEP has been proven to work, and at the end of the day that\u2019s what matters. PrEP isn\u2019t a cure-all but an important piece of the puzzle in how to prevent new HIV infections.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Evans, Vice Chair, Louisiana AIDS Advocacy Network: \u201cOur organization strongly endorses PrEP as a means to reduce HIV transmission for those who are HIV-negative and for serodiscordant couples. LAAN has looked carefully at the pros and cons of PrEP, reaching a conclusion that PrEP makes sense as a tool preventing the spread of HIV. Also, as I am a longtime advocate for same-gender marriage, I must admit, this is an awkward obstacle for couples who find themselves in this situation. In the past, if two people fell in love and one was HIV-positive and the other HIV-negative, having a worry-ree sex life without concerns of 'Did I expose my loved one?' was next to impossible. Today, effective treatment is excellent at keeping viral loads undetectable in people living with HIV and making transmission of HIV negligible. Furthermore, studies have consistently demonstrated the use of PrEP is highly effective in keeping people HIV-negative. Such past concerns and worries about transmission are strongly diminished. I am advocating this for a wonderful young couple I have come to know here in northwest Louisiana.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBria and Chrissy, YouTube Personalities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVallerie D. Wagner, COO, APLA Health & Wellness: \u201cSupporting PrEP means more than just telling someone to take a pill. It means, over three decades into the epidemic, that we support a new tool in the arsenal against HIV/AIDS. It means, along with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that we have an opportunity to get many more MSM of color and transgender individuals into a culturally competent health care setting to talk with them, learn from them, and help them make positive choices. We support PrEP because we have opened a health center for the LGBT community that includes comprehensive counseling and doctor-managed care of Truvada \u2014 and we are committed to changing things for the better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKelsey Louie, CEO, Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis: \u201cWhile HIV and AIDS may no longer be a death sentence, there have been 50,000 new HIV infections every year for the past decade \u2014 and it's going to stay that way unless we all step up now. GMHC's goal is to end the HIV and AIDS epidemic in New York State by 2020, and we're advocating for the widespread adoption of PrEP to help get it done. Can you imagine how quickly we would have embraced a pill like PrEP that was over 90 percent effective in preventing HIV infections during the height of the crisis? If every New Yorker at risk of HIV infection had affordable access to these resources, we could save more lives and end this epidemic once and for all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Paul Leue, Mr. L.A. Leather 2014: \u201cPrEP and its biochemical prevention brothers are a turning point in 35 years of this epidemic. PrEP is the most efficacious HIV prevention method for HIV-negative people, [treatment as prevention] renders the virus just about nontransmissable, and [post-exposure prophylaxis] is always there if other efforts didn't go as planned. Whoever denies the science that stands behind it and stands in the way of progress to end this epidemic is the climate-change-denier of HIV prevention.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Wiener, San Francisco City Supervisor: \u201cAs an elected official, disclosing this personal health decision [to be on PrEP] was a hard but necessary choice. After all these years, we still see enormous stigma, shame, and judgment around HIV, and around sexuality in general. That is precisely why I decided to be public about my choice: to contribute to a larger dialogue about our community\u2019s health.\u201d [The Huffington Post]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Loduca, VP of Philanthropy at San Francisco AIDS Foundation (In response to Wiener\u2019s coming out as on PrEP): \u201cWe need more people like Supervisor Wiener. In my own personal network, many of my HIV-negative gay male friends are on PrEP. None of them talk about it publicly, and that is a reflection of the enormous stigma and shame that we still have around sex, around a desire to have intimacy. ... It\u2019s an important watershed moment for our community that someone so visible steps forward and says \u2018PrEP is helping me.\u2019\u201d[NPR]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Pickett, Director of Prevention Advocacy, AIDS Foundation of Chicago: \u201cI support all ways to engage in safer sex, and that definitely includes PrEP. I especially love PrEP because it puts bottoms of all genders in control \u2014 it need not be negotiated with your boyfriend, your husband, your hook-up, or your friend with benefits. PrEP is your decision. And it doesn\u2019t need to be taken in the heat of the moment when your hormones are raging and your fingers are sticky.\u201d\n\nJeff Berry, Director of Publications, Test Positive Aware Network: \u201cI recently sat in on a support group for newly diagnosed individuals, and I remember asking myself, How have we failed these young gay men? What are we doing wrong? I believe that PrEP, as part of a comprehensive prevention package that includes access to condoms, testing, education, and increasingly, other biomedical interventions, will finally help to turn the tide and someday make those support groups a relic of the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Campos, San Francisco City Supervisor: \u201cPrEP is the first new tool in our fight to protect ourselves from HIV since the epidemic began.\u201d [NPR]\n\n\n\n\n\nGrindr: \u201cAs the largest gay network, with more than 5 million active monthly users, Grindr is a powerful platform to raise awareness on important issues for the gay community around the world. We launched Grindr for Equality to spur action on a variety of causes, as well as gay men\u2019s health issues such as HIV/AIDS and most recently PrEP awareness. Actions can take the form of signing petitions, donating money to a worthy cause, or participating in a specific call to action. To date, Grindr has helped raise awareness surrounding numerous PrEP initiatives, including studies and information sessions. Grindr is highly committed to promoting safe sex within the community and strongly encourages our users to engage in safe sex practices, get tested and know their HIV status.\u201d [Grindr.com]\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Gladstein, MD, HIV Specialist: \u201cConcerns with toxicity and long-term harm have been overemphasized when they really don\u2019t exist for the most part. The bottom line is, it\u2019s a powerful tool when used correctly, and it could turn the tide in new transmissions. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve not been able to do in the past 33 years.\u201d [\u201cAs PrEP Becomes More Widely Available, Couples With One Poz Partner Consider Treatment\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Stephens, Director of Counter Narrative: \u201cI think [PrEP] is also a part of our sexual rights. As black gay men we absolutely have a right to pleasure, we have a right to health; we have a right to every tool that\u2019s available to protect ourselves. There are arguments that suggest by having access to PrEP it will increase condomless sex and it will make people less afraid of HIV. I believe those arguments are rooted in a very moralistic and judgmental lens around sexuality.\u201d [GA Voice]\n\n\n\n\n\non the state's \u201cBending the Curve\u201d plan to provide PrEP to high-risk groups: \u201cNew York State has reached an important milestone in controlling the AIDS epidemic, and through this comprehensive strategy, we are decreasing new HIV infections to the point where by 2020, the number of persons living with HIV in New York State will be reduced for the first time.\u201d [ New York Governor's Office\n\nTank Teachworth, Former Mr. Atlanta Eagle and American Leatherboy Title Holder: \u201cSometimes in leather things can get intense and sometimes condoms can break. Nothing is foolproof. I wouldn\u2019t call myself an exceptionally promiscuous person, but I like to have fun. If there\u2019s another opportunity to stop one more case of HIV transmission then I feel PrEP is worth it. If I make a connection with somebody I\u2019d like to do so responsibly.\u201d [GA Voice]\n\n\n\nChad Griffin, President of the Human Rights Campaign: \u201cToday, there is an unprecedented chance to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, in part through PrEP's aggressive prevention of new HIV infections. There is no reason \u2014 medical or otherwise \u2014 to discourage individuals from taking control of their sexual health and talking to their doctor about PrEP.\u201d [HRC]\n\n\n\nTyler Curry, Senior Editor, HIV Equal: \u201cIf you have had sex even once since your last HIV test without a condom, it is worth it to educate yourself on PrEP and determine if it is right for you. It only takes one time to transmit the virus, and it only takes one pill a day to stop it.\u201d [The Huffington Post]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Staley, HIV activist: \u201cEverybody looks at costs of Truvada, fears of toxicity \u2014 those are all the challenges and questions facing the person who has already decided to look at this option. That\u2019s not the underlying problem. The problem is that very few people even consider the option. And the reason for that is HIV-related stigma.\u201d [Slate]\n\n\n\nMichael Lucas, CEO of Lucas Entertainment: \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about PrEP enough. When things aren\u2019t talked about, there is stigma. But we both agree the stigma that comes with HIV infection is far more damaging than the stigma associated with PrEP. People need to be educated and take the steps to protect themselves regardless of what people think.\u201d [\u201cMen on PrEP Explain Why They Take It\u201d]\n\n\n\nDamon L. Jacobs, Activist: \u201cPrEP has changed my dating life, because it has completely removed the fear of HIV from sex. I had never experienced sex without fear in my life. As the receptive partner, I had always made my HIV status contingent on the 'top' using a condom, making sure it didn't fall off, fall in, or break. With PrEP, I could make rational decisions about my sexual choices and still remain 100 percent in control of my negative HIV status. That has increased my romantic and sexual connections greatly.\u201d\n\n\n\nJack Mackenroth, HIV Activist: \"We now have a drug that can make HIV-positive men undetectable and therefore non-contagious. That same drug can make HIV-negative men impermeable to HIV infection. We have a tool that could stop HIV infection in it's tracks. I have taken Truvada for seven years with no side effects. Condom only messaging has proven to be unsuccessful for the past 30 years. You can either get on board with PrEP or you can argue against it. Simply put, you are either part of ending the epidemic or you are part of the problem.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hear why some of the leading HIV activists, organizations, and beyond support PrEP as a tool to end HIV.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2014/10/23/Prep-Celebs-x400.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T22:28:15-05:00", "type": "article", "title": "35 Activists, Doctors, and Organizations Speak Out in Support of PrEP"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-24T05:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T05:00:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "35 Activists, Doctors, and Organizations Speak Out in Support of PrEPAmong the greatest obstacles to promoting PrEP as an invaluable tool for HIV prevention has been the prominence of its naysayers, like Larry Kramer and Michael Weinstein.\n...
