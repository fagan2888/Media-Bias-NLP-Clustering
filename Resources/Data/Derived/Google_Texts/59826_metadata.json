Create one now.\n\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights hosted an open forum for students Wednesday night, which drew a crowd of about 30 people.\n\nA committee led by graduate students Connor Lewis and Eric Scott has been gauging interest in a potential graduate student union since late August. The group shared its plans to pursue unionization during the Wednesday forum at Keller Auditorium. Scott and Lewis said they were optimistic they could gather about 2,000 signatures necessary to hold a vote this year and have a contract in place by 2016.\n\nLewis said similar conversations about graduate student worker benefits are happening at colleges and universities across the country. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a bigger movement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment within graduate education in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights formed in August after MU gave graduate assistants 24-hour notice that they would no longer receive health insurance subsidies because of an IRS interpretation of the Affordable Care Act. The university later rescinded that decision, but the process sparked a campuswide discussion about graduate student employee benefits. Graduate students with assistantships conduct research for the university and teach undergraduate classes.\n\nOrganizers of the Coalition of Graduate Workers said about 220 graduate students had expressed interest in serving as their departments\u2019 union representatives and answering questions from fellow graduate student employees.\n\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights began recording videos of graduate students sharing their stories during the Wednesday event. The videos will be part of a campaign to share those stories, which feature graduate students discussing the positive and negative aspects of working at MU.\n\nRonnie LaCombe, a graduate student and MU committee member of the Forum on Graduate Rights, filmed her story during Wednesday\u2019s meeting. LaCombe said she would like to see the university focus on rebuilding trust with students.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/7a/a7a418ad-f13a-5ddd-b066-c37010918408/560d75629551d.image.jpg?resize=800%2C509"}, "description": "Graduate students at the University of Missouri who have been demanding better pay, a long-term insurance solution and full tuition waivers for all graduate assistants, among other things, are a step closer to unionizing.", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MU graduate students take further steps toward unionizing"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "Graduate students at the University of Missouri who have been demanding better pay, a long-term insurance solution and full tuition waivers for all graduate assistants, among other things, are a step closer to unionizing.", "title": "MU graduate students take further steps toward unionizing", "url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/education/mu-graduate-students-take-further-steps-toward-unionizing/article_bada1108-2141-500d-8a6d-05f404782b2e.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/7a/a7a418ad-f13a-5ddd-b066-c37010918408/560d75629551d.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C636", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "university of missouri,forum of graduate rights,coalition of graduate workers,missouri national education,connor lewis,eric scott", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Graduate students at the University of Missouri who have been demanding better pay, a long-term insurance solution and full tuition waivers for all graduate assistants, among other things, are a step closer to unionizing."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab4b\"", "article_summary": "Ronnie LaCombe, a graduate student and MU committee member of the Forum on Graduate Rights, filmed her story during Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\nA committee led by graduate students Connor Lewis and Eric Scott has been gauging interest in a potential graduate student union since late August.\nThe Forum on Graduate Rights began recording videos of graduate students sharing their stories during the Wednesday event.\nThe videos will be part of a campaign to share those stories, which feature graduate students discussing the positive and negative aspects of working at MU.\nOrganizers of the Coalition of Graduate Workers said about 220 graduate students had expressed interest in serving as their departments\u2019 union representatives and answering questions from fellow graduate student employees."}
