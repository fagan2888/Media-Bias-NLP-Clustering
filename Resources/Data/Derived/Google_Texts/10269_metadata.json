Metropolitan Police Department officers responded to a report of a shooting and found two men suffering from gunshot wounds. Both men were taken to area hospitals, but 20-year-old Devonte Reed, of Lanham, Maryland, died from his injuries.\n\nThe injured man, 26-year-old Jamie Patterson, was charged with second-degree murder in Mr. Reed\u2019s death. No further information about the nature of the shooting was available Monday.\n\nThe first of the Brightwood shootings occurred at 8 p.m. Sunday in the 5600 block of Georgia Avenue NW. A man was shot in the foot after he tried to fight off a robber, according to Capt. Brian Bray, who wrote an account of this incident and two others on the police department\u2019s online Listserv.\n\nThe man told police he was walking through an alleyway when another man approached him and told him to give up his phone. The victim attempted to punch the robber, who pulled out a handgun and shot him.\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital for treatment, and the robber fled.\n\nThe second Brightwood robbery occurred at 3:15 a.m. Monday in the 900 block of Gallatin Street NW. Three people were standing outside of an apartment building when a man pointed a gun at them and demanded money, Capt. Bray said.\n\nOne of the victims handed over cash. Something startled the gunman, and he began firing at the victims, striking one in the hand and another in the leg. The victims\u2019 injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.\n\nThe robber ran from the scene and got into a black sedan that fled. The car only made it a few blocks before it crashed into a fence and fire hydrant while trying to evade police.\n\nThe gunman and others inside the car escaped, but police found evidence in the stolen car they believe ties them to several other robberies in the area that night, Capt. Bray said.\n\nIt was unclear whether the robbery attempt in the 5600 block of Georgia Avenue was among those believed to be related.\n\nIn a separate incident, another man was shot in the arm around midnight in the 3600 block of Warder Street in NW near Petworth.\n\nAfter initially refusing to cooperate with officers, the victim told police he was attending a party at a home on the block when a man \u201cshot him from across the street while he was standing on the porch of a house,\u201d Capt. Bray said.\n\nThe shooter fled the scene, and no arrests have been made.\n\nThe series of shootings follow two other homicides over the weekend.\n\nPolice said 29-year-old Anthony Andre Osgood was killed and a woman injured in a shooting in the 2300 block of Irving Street in Southeast early Saturday.\n\nA Bowie man also was stabbed to death shortly after noon Friday in Northeast. Police identified the man as 24-year-old Stephon Demarrio Clark and said he was fatally stabbed near the intersection of 18th and H streets in Northeast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six people were shot in Washington, D.C., over an 8-hour period stretching from Sunday night to early Monday, including one man killed in Northeast and three people injured in two separate robbery attempts in the Brightwood neighborhood in Northwest.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Six people were shot in Washington, D.C., over an 8-hour period stretching from Sunday night to early Monday, including one man killed in Northeast and three people injured in two separate robbery attempts in the Brightwood neighborhood in Northwest.", "title": "6 people shot in D.C. over an 8-hour period", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/6-people-shot-dc-over-8-hour-period/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/07/police-car.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/07/police-car.jpg", "description": "Six people were shot in Washington, D.C., over an 8-hour period stretching from Sunday night to early Monday, including one man killed in Northeast and three people injured in two separate robbery att", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "6 people shot in D.C. over an 8-hour period"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Brian Bray, Devonte Reed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c38\"", "article_summary": "The man told police he was walking through an alleyway when another man approached him and told him to give up his phone.\nA man was shot in the foot after he tried to fight off a robber, according to Capt.\nIn a separate incident, another man was shot in the arm around midnight in the 3600 block of Warder Street in NW near Petworth.\nThe victim attempted to punch the robber, who pulled out a handgun and shot him.\nThe fatal shooting occurred in the 500 block of 58th Street NE at 9 p.m. Sunday."}
