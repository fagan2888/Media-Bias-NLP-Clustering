Common sense works great. We already have laws that demonstrate how a person can become an American citizen. We don\u2019t have to re-litigate that. If we do re-litigate it, it needs to be done by the proper branch of government, which is Congress. It is not by the president. It is not by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon said illegal immigrants would not be entering the U.S. if there were not \u201ca magnet drawing them in.\u201d One way to stop the flow, Carson maintained, was for the government to crack down on companies who hire illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to Politico, Carson later said, however, that undocumented immigrants should not have to \u201chide in the shadows,\u201d and suggested the U.S. adopt an undocumented worker program similar to what is in Canada.\n\nDr. Carson also touched on Obamacare during his speech Saturday, telling attendees, \u201cEven if it worked, I would oppose it,\u201d but maintains the program, in fact, does not work. Carson also does not believe in the government\u2019s intrusion in health care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in taking the most important thing a person has, which is their health and their health care, and putting it in the hands of the government.\u201d\n\nBen Carson spoke at the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday, alongside potential 2016 presidential contenders, including Chris Christie and Scott Walker. Representative Steve King of Iowa and the group Citizens United hosted the Summit.\n\nCarson has hinted at a 2016 presidential run for quite some time, but when asked if he has made a decision on whether or not he intends to throw his hat into the ring, Carson did not give a definitive answer. He told the Daily Caller, however, he is still considering it.\n\n\u201cI have a surgical personality which means you have to dot a lot of I\u2019s and cross a lot of T\u2019s. And make sure you have a good infrastructure. And we\u2019re in the process of doing all those things.\u201d\n\n[Image courtesy of Gage Skidmore]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson told a conservative crowd in Iowa on Saturday that the next president must focus on stopping illegal immigrants from entering the U.S. Whoever wins", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Ben Carson told a conservative crowd in Iowa on Saturday that the next president must focus on stopping illegal immigrants from entering the U.S. Whoever wins", "title": "Ben Carson Talks Immigration At Iowa Summit, Next President Should \u2018Seal The Border\u2019 In First 12 Months", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1786315/ben-carson-talks-immigration-at-iowa-summit-next-president-should-seal-the-border-in-first-12-months/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ben-Carson.gif", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T12:50:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-25T13:46:54+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ben-Carson.gif", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-01-25T12:50:36+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ben carson,ben carson immigration,iowa freedom summit,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ben-Carson.gif", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ben Carson told a conservative crowd in Iowa on Saturday that the next president must focus on stopping illegal immigrants from entering the U.S. Whoever wins"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf220\"", "article_summary": "Speaking on the subject of immigration, Ben Carson told GOP supporters there are laws already on the books to take care of the U.S.\u2019s immigration problem, reports the Daily Caller.\nBen Carson told a conservative crowd in Iowa on Saturday that the next president must focus on stopping illegal immigrants from entering the U.S. Whoever wins the White House needs to commit to sealing the borders within their first year in office.\nAccording to Politico, Carson later said, however, that undocumented immigrants should not have to \u201chide in the shadows,\u201d and suggested the U.S. adopt an undocumented worker program similar to what is in Canada.\nIf we do re-litigate it, it needs to be done by the proper branch of government, which is Congress.\nRepresentative Steve King of Iowa and the group Citizens United hosted the Summit."}
