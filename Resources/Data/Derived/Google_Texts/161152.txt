Rep. Tim Huelskamp says it’s a “twisted world” when “transgender and transracial” are considered “in,” while trans fats are “out.”

The Kansas Republican tweeted on Tuesday:

Twisted world: transgender and transracial are ‘in’; and trans fats are out! #jenner #dolezal http://t.co/ccEnSos9eK — Cong. Tim Huelskamp (@CongHuelskamp) June 16, 2015

The congressman was referencing two major recent news stories: Caitlyn Jenner, the Olympian and reality TV star formerly known as Bruce Jenner, appearing as a woman for the first time on the cover of Vanity Fair; and Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP chapter leader who resigned amid accusations that she “disguised” herself as a black woman.

Huelskamp included in his tweet a link to an Associated Press story on the Obama administration banning partially hydrogenated oils, a source of trans fat, from products made by food manufacturers.
