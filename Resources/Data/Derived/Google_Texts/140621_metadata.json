Hood Community College honoring Junki and Linda Yoshida. The college was renaming a gym to honor the founder of Yoshida Foods International after the couple\u2019s cool $1 million donation. Kitzhaber described the Yoshidas as his old friends. They are also his financial supporters, having given, for instance, $35,000 toward last year\u2019s successful but disastrous reelection effort.\n\nIt was a success because Kitzhaber won. He beat Republican opponent Dennis Richardson by almost 6 percentage points. He didn\u2019t quite get a majority because of third party candidates but Democrats could shrug that off with the excuse that it was such a heavily Republican year, nationally.\n\nThe election was a disaster because Kitzhaber couldn\u2019t hold on to that tainted win. Scandals involving the governor and his fianc\u00e9e and business partner, Oregon First Lady Cylvia Hayes, plagued the campaign. Richardson refused to concede on the night of the election, out of sheer dumb disbelief as much as anything else.\n\nA federal probe into misspent funds, reporting from Oregon media, and pressure from his own party finally convinced Kitzhaber to throw in the towel as of February 18, only 38 days into his term. Future American political historians will likely use his campaign the new textbook example of a \u201cPyrrhic victory.\u201d\n\nFor normal taxpaying Oregonians, it only gets worse from there. In the last Oregon Trial dispatch, we looked at the huge legal bills that Oregon could be stuck with to defend Kitzhaber and cronies and at the ongoing stamp his decisions are putting on state government.\n\nAt the time, there was a freeze on his nominations but unelected Governor Kate Brown had decided to let one of his healthcare nominees go through. Now she has asked the Oregon state senate to confirm all of his remaining nominees. That\u2019s kind of shocking but we\u2019re supposed to look away because Brown is now throwing up all manner of fairy dust by promising \u201cethics reform.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Kitzhaber\u2019s political decisions could cost Oregonians dearly, soon and at tax time next year. In March, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case of King v. Burwell. A decision is expected this summer. The case asks the court to decide how to interpret the text of the Affordable Care Act that fixes both fines and subsidies only to health insurance \u201cexchanges\u201d established by the \u201cstates.\u201d\n\nFor our purpose, read \u201cexchanges\u201d as \u201cwebsites,\u201d because you can\u2019t have one without the other these days. Several states never set up their own websites because Republicans were in charge and didn\u2019t want them. Other solidly Democratic states, such as Oregon, started to set up their own websites that were plagued with problems similar to the disastrous, made-for-SNL rollout of the federal Obamacare website.\n\nOregon\u2019s effort, Cover Oregon, was the bottom of the barrel. \u201cOregon\u2019s Obamacare sign-up is an \u2018epic failure\u2019\u201d blared a headline for Politico in November of 2013. \u201cHow Oregon wound up with the nation\u2019s worst Obamacare Web site,\u201d was the headline in the somewhat slower Washington Post in March, 2014.\n\nThese were headlines that Kitzhaber didn\u2019t need and couldn\u2019t afford as he tried for an unprecedented fourth term. He was a practicing medical doctor from the late \u201970s to the mid-\u201980s. Much of his political career rested on a veneer of medical expertise.\n\nJust take a whiff of the man\u2019s Wikipedia bio and smell the latex gloves: \u201cKitzhaber became the Director of the Center for Evidence Based Policy at the Oregon Health & Science University, served as the Executive Chair and President at both the Foundation for Medical Excellence and the Estes Park Institute, and founded the health care advocacy group the Archimedes Movement.\u201d\n\nIf any Democratic politician could get a health insurance website working by sheer force of his CV, it was Kitzhaber. But no. In spite of $300 million in federal funds to play with, the Cover Oregon site suffered one setback after another and finally collapsed in April of 2014.\n\nOregonians who had wanted to sign up through the state exchange were told to sign up through the U.S. Government website instead. No big loss, perhaps, except that if the Supreme Court decides the text of the Affordable Care Act actually means what it says then tens of thousands of Oregonians could suddenly find themselves without the subsidies that make Obamacare \u201caffordable\u201d \u2014 in some cases hiking premiums by 78 percent.\n\nIn theory, Oregon could get around such a ruling by reestablishing a healthcare exchange, but that takes time, money, and effort. And just this month the state decided to scrap Cover Oregon altogether.\n\nMoreover, if Oregonians find that this unsubsidized fate has befallen them, they are going to go looking for explanations. The smart money says they are unlikely to be mollified by the answers. The liberal alt-weekly Willamette Week, in particular, has done yeoman\u2019s work showing us how, when the Cover Oregon website ran into trouble, Kitzhaber treated it not as a technical problem to be solved but a political one to be punted.\n\nKitzhaber handed practical control of the site to top political aid Patricia McCaig, \u201cwho\u201d \u2014 and we are not making this up \u2014 \u201cliked to call herself the Princess of Darkness.\u201d From emails, we can see that she viewed the whole thing as a political liability. With Kitzhaber\u2019s blessing, she did everything in her power to get Oregonians out of a state exchange and into the now constitutionally dubious federal one.\n\nAlong the way, the two launched a lawsuit against a computer contractor, Oracle, that has resulted in a counter-suit and much future expensive litigation for Oregonians. We\u2019ll look into that in our next dispatch.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03f8\"", "article_summary": "Now she has asked the Oregon state senate to confirm all of his remaining nominees.\nFuture American political historians will likely use his campaign the new textbook example of a \u201cPyrrhic victory.\u201dFor normal taxpaying Oregonians, it only gets worse from there.\nOregon\u2019s effort, Cover Oregon, was the bottom of the barrel.\nAnd just this month the state decided to scrap Cover Oregon altogether.\nIn spite of $300 million in federal funds to play with, the Cover Oregon site suffered one setback after another and finally collapsed in April of 2014."}
