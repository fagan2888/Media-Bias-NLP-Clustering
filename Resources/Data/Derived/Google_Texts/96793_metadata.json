Virginians don\u2019t want Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. Two of the three Obamacare Medicaid Senate Republicans are retiring; I\u2019m running to retire the third \u2013 Emmett Hanger,\u201d Moxley said. Senator John Watkins was the first to announce retirement after receiving a primary challenge announcement from Steve Thomas, a Republican activist and businessman.\n\n\u201cVoters know that we need real, drastic change in the direction of our Commonwealth. Liberal, intrusive, big government policies are contrary to our founding principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. One of my goals as a senator is to cut overreaching government regulations and taxes that are increasingly breaking the backs of our fellow Virginians, Moxley continued.\n\nThe retirement of the three most liberal republicans in the Virginia Senate this year, following the ouster of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor last year, would reflect one of the biggest changes in direction of Virginia politics in recent history, as well as a rise in the power of the grassroots to dictate the direction of the Republican Party from the ground up.\n\nDan Moxley is an entrepreneur and small business-owner. He holds an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, and a graduate degree in Religion. Studies in history, languages, and debate spurred Dan\u2019s interest in Constitutional principles and limited government, and incited a desire for principled statesmen to restore them. Dan married his wife Jan in 1987, and they have 7 children.
