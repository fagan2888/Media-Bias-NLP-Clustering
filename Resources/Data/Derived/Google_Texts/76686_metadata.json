"article_text": "WASHINGTON (Legal Newsline) \u2013 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a new rule stating that companies have within 60 days to return overpayments from federal governments after it identifies the overpayment.\n\nThe much anticipated final rule concerning Section 6402(a) of the Affordable Care Act means that Medicare and Medicaid providers, suppliers and managed care contractors have to report and return an overpayment by the later of \u201c60 days after the date upon which the overpayment was identified or the date any corresponding cost report was due, if applicable.\u201d\n\nThe requirements in the rule are aimed at ensuring the compliance with related statutes, promote the furnishing of high quality care, in addition to protecting the Medicare Trust Funds from fraud and improper payments.\n\nTony Maida, a partner at McDermott Will & Emery, who was involved in creating the final rule, told Legal Newsline that the rule will help businesses.\n\n\u201cThe rule will help companies defending False Claims Act suits because having a regulation is better than the risk of having the meaning of the statute litigated in separate judicial districts,\u201d Maida said.\n\nHowever, Maida added that there are many unanswered questions about how False Claims Act lawsuits will play out regarding those who knowingly conceal, or knowing and improperly avoiding reporting and returning an identified overpayment.\n\n\u201cWe have already started to see relators increasingly include this allegation in complaints, so I expect to see that further increase following the final rule,\u201d Maida said.\n\nIn an effort to respond to many concerns within the industry, CMS reduced the lookback period from the proposed 10 years to six years, while clarifying its \"identified\" standard and simplifying how companies should report and return overpayments.\n\nUnder the new rule, the 60-day clock begins when a provider has identified an overpayment, which includes proactive compliance activities such as internal audits and reactive activities such as internal investigations of credible information of a potential overpayment.\n\nHowever, the most important issue in the rule, the meaning of \"identified,\" will be debated as controversial by many, Maida said.\n\n\u201cIt essentially creates a negligence standard by saying that you have identified an overpayment when you should have determined through exercising reasonable diligence that you have received an overpayment,\u201d Maida said.\n\nThey key element of the final rule is the emphasis CMS has put on the importance of compliance programs in making sure that providers meet the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d concept.\n\nMany commentators to the rule\u2019s proposed preamble were concerned about the meaning of the rule\u2019s \u201creckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of the overpayment\u201d standard and whether the time proposed was enough for the provider to take steps to conclude whether or not it had received an overpayment and, if so, the amount.\n\nCMS is clear that providers have a period of time to conduct the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d to determine if they have an overpayment and the amount before the 60-day clock report and return starts, Maida said.\n\n\u201cCMS said it applies a six-month 'benchmark' to measure how long this 'reasonable diligence' should take, absent extraordinary circumstances or complex matters, such as a Stark issue,\u201d Maida said.\n\nWhile Maida thinks the benchmark is unrealistic due to the complicated nature of Medicare laws and rules, the rule applies to a wide ride of situations from a simple error to a complex, multi-year situation.\n\n\u201cThe government expects providers to move forward on reviewing potential overpayment issues in a reasonable manner,\u201d Maida said. \u201c[While] it\u2019s not a sprint, it not a Sunday walk in the park [either].\u201d\n\nCMS\u2019s final rule will become effective on March 14.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (Legal Newsline) \u2013 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
