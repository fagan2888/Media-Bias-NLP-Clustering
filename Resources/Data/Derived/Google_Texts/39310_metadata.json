Often stuffed with a crisp dollar bill or two, the envelopes are exchanged between family members, friends and neighbors with wishes for good fortune and health in the new year. This Saturday, as tens of thousands of people crowd San Francisco\u2019s streets for its annual Chinese New Year parade, a group of Asian-American activists will be handing out a special kind of red envelopes bearing a special message: that Asian-American communities should join the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\n\n\u201cWe want to use this time when we are all celebrating and sharing wishes for a prosperous new year to lift up the message that the black community also deserves a safe and prosperous year,\u201d says Jennifer Phung, an activist from Oakland, California.\n\nPhung is a member of the group #Asians4BlackLives, which will be handing out the envelopes. Each envelope will contain a card reading, in part, \u201cAs Asian Americans, we enjoy many rights that were fought for and won by Black liberation movements. Today, we too have the power to stand on the side of justice. We can create harmony by building strong relationships between Black and Asian communities and standing together for Black Lives. Which side are you on?\u201d\n\n#Asians4BlackLives was formed late last year, in the wake of the non-indictments of the police officers who killed Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The group\u2019s first action was participating in a shutdown of the Oakland Police Department\u2019s headquarters by chaining themselves to the main door of the building while holding a banner reading, \u201cEnd the war on black people #Asians4BlackLives.\u201d Members of the group have also taken part in civil disobedience protests at the Federal Building in Oakland and at a Bay Area Home Depot where a black woman allegedly shoplifted before being shot and killed by police from Emeryville, California.\n\nBy participating in the #BlackLivesMatter movement specifically as Asian Americans, the group has tried to put forward a model of black-Asian solidarity that runs counter to the \u201cmodel minority myth\u201d that has served to separate the two groups for decades. (As I\u2019ve written in the past, the model minority myth is a tool of racism that uses Asian American success to disprove the existence of racism against African-Americans.) But in turning from protests against police brutality to outreach at the Chinese New Year parade, #Asians4BlackLives is refocusing its energies on confronting the ongoing existence of anti-black prejudice within many Asian immigrant communities.\n\nThe presence of resentment, distrust and intolerance between two different groups that are both struggling to succeed in the white-dominated United States is no secret. Tensions between Korean American shopkeepers and African-Americans were put on national display during the Los Angeles Riots in 1992, and in many Asian communities, anti-black sentiment goes unquestioned and unchecked. The recent indictment of Chinese-American New York City police officer Peter Liang for shooting and killing an unnamed black man, Akai Gurley, in the staircase of a housing project last November, is a stark calling of the question that #Asians4BlackLives is putting forward: \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As some Asians condemn Officer Liang's indictment in the shooting of a black man, #Asians4BlackLives calls foul", "title": "\u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d: #Asians4BlackLives confronts anti-black prejudice in Asian communities", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As some Asians condemn Officer Liang's indictment in the shooting of a black man, #Asians4BlackLives calls foul", "title": "\u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d: #Asians4BlackLives confronts anti-black prejudice in Asian communities", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/which_side_are_you_on_asians4blacklives_confronts_anti_black_prejudice_in_asian_communities/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/black_lives_matter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As some Asians condemn Officer Liang's indictment in the shooting of a black man, #Asians4BlackLives calls foul", "title": "\u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d: #Asians4BlackLives confronts anti-black prejudice in Asian communities", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/black_lives_matter.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Julia Carrie Wong", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #asians4blacklives, Oakland, Race", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc577\"", "article_summary": "Topics: #asians4blacklives, Oakland, Race, NewsLittle red envelopes are ubiquitous in Asian communities during Lunar New Year.\nTensions between Korean American shopkeepers and African-Americans were put on national display during the Los Angeles Riots in 1992, and in many Asian communities, anti-black sentiment goes unquestioned and unchecked.\nWe can create harmony by building strong relationships between Black and Asian communities and standing together for Black Lives.\nBut in turning from protests against police brutality to outreach at the Chinese New Year parade, #Asians4BlackLives is refocusing its energies on confronting the ongoing existence of anti-black prejudice within many Asian immigrant communities.\nPhung is a member of the group #Asians4BlackLives, which will be handing out the envelopes."}
