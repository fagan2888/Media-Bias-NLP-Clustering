At Friday\u2019s big surveillance speech, after five years of Big Government\u2013orchestrated Constitution shredding, he looked the American people in the eye and explained that, as monitoring technology has evolved over the centuries, our nation has always \u201cbenefitted from both our Constitution and traditions of limited government.\u201d While your head was still spinning, another whopper: After five years of whimsically \u201cwaiving,\u201d ignoring, and unilaterally rewriting congressional statutes, he bleated that \u201cour system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power; it depends upon the law to constrain those in power.\u201d\n\nOf course, from the man who repeatedly vowed that you could keep your health-insurance plan, all the while scheming to eliminate your health-insurance plan, we\u2019ve come to expect this disconnect between rhetoric and reality. What makes President Obama so hard to take seriously is not just the lying. It is that he does not take his job seriously. Consider the great \u201cmetadata\u201d controversy, the focal point of yesterday\u2019s speech.\n\nIt has been seven months since Edward Snowden\u2019s first felonious leaks \u2014 seven months of firestorm over the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of phone-record information on virtually all Americans. During that time the program has been hysterically slandered by critics on the left and right \u2014 the libels aided and abetted by legislators who\u2019ve known for years exactly what the NSA was doing and yet feigned shock over Snowden\u2019s \u201crevelations.\u201d (I use the mock quotes in a nod to Representative Jerrold Nadler (D., Upper West Side), who conceded last June that, when it came to the NSA\u2019s data collection, Snowden revealed nothing that hadn\u2019t been well known and hotly debated for seven years.)\n\nIt has been claimed, spuriously but relentlessly, that the NSA was massively spying on U.S. citizens, systematically tracking their phone calls, e-mails, and movements. This narrative has solidified into conventional wisdom. Americans widely believe that they are on the government\u2019s radar, their every conversation eavesdropped on. I\u2019ve witnessed it firsthand.\n\nAs someone who used to work the legal end of national security and who is not exactly a notorious Obamabot, I am frequently invited to speak to conservative audiences about surveillance programs. I make it a habit of asking, \u201cHow many of you know that the NSA doesn\u2019t know who you are? That they only collect your phone number, not your name or address or anything that would actually identify it as your phone number?\u201d There is always genuine surprise, just as there is about the fact that phone calls are not being monitored; about the fact that data is only being collected, not analyzed \u2014 except for a fraction of phone numbers reasonably suspected of belonging to those with ties to terrorism, and so tiny that to call it infinitesimal seems an overstatement; about the fact that there is extensive, rigorous oversight of the NSA program by Congress and the FISA court. This is not a unilateral Obama-administration production like siccing the IRS on the Tea Party.\n\nBut out-to-pasture prosecutors in coffee klatches do not a bully pulpit make. With an important national-defense program on the ropes, only presidential leadership could make a difference. Obama would have to skip a fundraiser or two, or perhaps just play the front nine one day, and do what he does best: read a speech. Except this time, the speech could have the unusual added benefits of being succinct and true.\n\nInstead, the Obama administration gave us . . . silence. Oh, the president offered a fleeting, tepid defense of the program when the controversy first erupted \u2014 leery of provoking his base while it was canonizing Snowden. And NSA chief Keith Alexander was dispatched to testify on Capitol Hill. Alas, General Alexander, an admirably straight shooter, proved to be a less than compelling communicator. The argument adduced to defend the collection of bulk data \u2014 the government\u2019s amassing of hundreds of millions of records pertaining to innocent Americans in order to find a handful of jihadists \u2014 was less than helpful: He contended that piling hay into a stack somehow makes it easier to find the needle.\n\nThis now becomes especially maddening. To preserve the NSA program \u2014 i.e., to shore up public support for an effort, based on a Bush-era statute passed with strong bipartisan majorities that enables our government to map jihadist cells without posing any real threat to privacy \u2014 all President Obama needed to do last spring was say what he said yesterday:\n\nThis program does not involve the content of phone calls, or the names of people making calls. Instead, it provides a record of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls \u2014 meta-data that can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a particular number is linked to a terrorist organization.\n\nObama elaborated that the program fills a critical intelligence void that led, in part, to the failure to interrupt the 9/11 plot. Had the NSA program been in place, the intelligence community would have known that suicide-hijacker Khalid al-Midhar was already in San Diego \u2014 not in some overseas outpost \u2014 when he was in contact with a known al-Qaeda safe-house in Yemen. The program is not for spying on Americans; it is for exposing the alien terrorists in our midst. Moreover, the president added:\n\nThe program does not involve the NSA examining the phone records of ordinary Americans. Rather, it consolidates these records into a database that the government can query if it has a specific lead \u2014 phone records that the companies already retain for business purposes. The [panel I commissioned to investigate the program] turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused. And I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved.\n\nThis was the brake the freight train needed half a year ago, before it ran away. The NSA\u2019s record gathering is not Obamacare, Benghazi, or the IRS scandal, webs of administration deceit and stonewalling. It is a rigorously examined Bush-era counterterrorism effort. If the president had given this part of Friday\u2019s speech back when it mattered last June, the public would have seen that his account of the program matched the account provided by such a respected conservative as former federal judge Michael Mukasey, who, as President Bush\u2019s attorney general, was intimately familiar with its boundaries and civil-liberties safeguards.\n\nObama, instead, refrained from vigorously defending the program. He voted present while its detractors moved in for the kill. We will live with the consequences. He announced Friday that the program will be overhauled in some still undetermined manner \u2014 the president tap-danced on that one yesterday, essentially telling us to check back with him in late March. And in a mind-boggling concession to irate progressives who want the program dismantled, Obama decreed yesterday that every person on Planet Earth, no matter where located, now has privacy rights against surveillance by American intelligence services. While our spies are hamstrung, no word yet on when Russia, China, Iran, and similarly upstanding global exemplars will be reciprocating.\n\nSo it goes, this toxic mix of passive unseriousness and active harm.
