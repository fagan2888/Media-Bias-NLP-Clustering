Republican Dave Brat secured his second endorsement in two days from a leading national conservative advocacy group, with FreedomWorks for America lauding him Wednesday as a “liberty candidate” in the race to replace former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

“In order to preserve the economy for future generations, we need people in Washington who actually understand how the economy works,” said FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe. “Dave Brat is a liberty candidate who pledges to fight Common Core, defund ObamaCare, audit the Federal Reserve, protect civil liberties, and return power back to the states in every way possible.”

On Tuesday, the Senate Conservatives Fund — which has irked the Republican establishment for attacking GOP incumbents at times this cycle — also endorsed Mr. Brat, an economics professor who scored an upset win over Mr. Cantor in a June primary.

“Dave’s recent primary victory demonstrated that grassroots candidates can take on powerful incumbents and win against all odds,” said SCF president Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, Virginia’s former attorney general who ran for governor last year. “Dave Brat will oppose wasteful spending and stand up to the big spenders in both parties.”

After his loss, Mr. Cantor said he would relinquish his majority leader post at the end of July but serve out the remainder of his term and later decided to resign from Congress as of Aug. 18. On Tuesday, the New York-based investment firm Moelis & Company announced Mr. Cantor was being appointed as its vice chairman and managing director.

Mr. Brat is taking on Democrat and fellow Randolph-Macon College professor Jack Trammell and Libertarian James Carr in the contest to represent the GOP-leaning 7th district, which stretches from Richmond to the Shenandoah Valley.
