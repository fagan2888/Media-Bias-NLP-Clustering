No people, no animals were hurt,\u201d Dumbauld said.\n\nThe zoo is home to more than 300 animals, including lions, tigers and bears.\n\nA vacant two-bedroom suite, a storage building full of horse feed for sale and Dumbauld's residence were damaged.\n\nFirefighters from Westmoreland, Fayette and Somerset counties battled the fire, which started about 11:15 p.m. Sunday, Dumbauld said.\n\n\u201cThere is a double roof on there that was giving us a bit of difficulty. The fire got in between the roofs to make it a little harder to get to,\u201d said Chief Shawn Kestner of Chestnut Ridge Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nDumbauld, 32, and his wife, 31, have been on-site park managers for six years.\n\nPark owner Tom Guiher is his wife's father, Dumbauld said.\n\n\u201cI found the fire. My wife and I were watching television and I heard a crackling sound from the bathroom. I saw smoke and went outside and saw the storage room on fire,\u201d Dumbauld said.\n\nHe called 911 and helped to kick in a door at one undamaged suite after the occupants failed to open the door.\n\nAs a precaution, overnight guests were relocated to a nearby hotel, Dumbauld said.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation, he said, but appears to have been electrical in nature.\n\n\u201cThankfully the way the wind and everything blew last night, we didn't have any (smoke) go to the zoo,\u201d Dumbauld said.\n\nFirefighters were at the park until about 4:15 a.m., Dumbauld said.\n\nGuiher founded the park's Moraine location near New Castle in 1992, and opened the Laurel Highlands park in 1998.\n\nAmong the animals visitors can view, and sometimes pet and feed, are an alpaca, alligator, Brahma bull, black swan, dromedary camel, timber wolf, white bison and zebra.\n\nBy mid-morning Monday, visitors were filling the park's lot.\n\nMary Pickels is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
