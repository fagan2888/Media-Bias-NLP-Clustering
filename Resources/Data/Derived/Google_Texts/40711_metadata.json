Its initial outbreak in humans in 1997 has been followed by yearly outbreaks with increasing mortality rates. Lethality has increased from 40 percent initially to 70 percent and, in some cases, even 100 percent. There are no therapeutics for the virus and no vaccines for humans. This discovery could pave the way for the development of a much-needed antiviral drug.\n\nThe virus is carried by the flying fruit bat and causes only mild illness in pigs, dogs, cats, horses, goats and sheep, which also spread the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s the scariest virus you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d said Jessica Bruhn, a graduate student in Saphire\u2019s lab, noting that the movie \u201cContagion, \u201c a medical thriller that came out in 2011, is based on outbreaks of the Nipah virus. Bruhn initially designed this study of Nipah as a summer internship project in 2012 for Katherine Barnett, then an undergraduate student in a summer program at TSRI, who is also a co-author of the paper.\n\nQualcomm Makes Worldwide Patent Top 10 List\n\nQualcomm has cracked the world\u2019s top 10 list for the number of patents awarded in a year, KPBS reports. The San Diego-based company was one of only three American firms on the list.\n\nThe wireless technology company landed in ninth spot in 2013 with 2,103 patents. That\u2019s up sharply from the 1,292 patents Qualcomm added in 2012. That 62 percent gain also pushed it up from its 17 place ranking that year.\n\nQualcomm joined IBM and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies among the top 10.\n\nRoger Martin is a senior vice president of intellectual property at Qualcomm. The ranking, he said, is a reflection of both the size of the company and the firm\u2019s commitment to research and development. He said R&D spending lagged during the recession, but the company reinvested once the economy improved.\n\n\u201cIt is not so much a change in business model or a philosophy about patents,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been protecting our innovation. It is reflective of the success of the company and how it came out of the last recession.\u201d\n\nQualcomm has more than 50,000 patents in its portfolio, according to Martin. The patents involve everything from how cell phones transmit and receive large amounts of data, to technology that allows for wireless links to smart devices in the home.\n\nGovernor Declares Drought State of Emergency\n\nWith California facing water shortfalls in the driest year in recorded state history, Gov. Jerry Brown today proclaimed a state of emergency and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for these drought conditions. \u201cWe can\u2019t make it rain, but we can be much better prepared for the terrible consequences that California\u2019s drought now threatens, including dramatically less water for our farms and communities and increased fires in both urban and rural areas,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI\u2019ve declared this emergency and I\u2019m calling all Californians to conserve water in every way possible.\u201d\n\nIn the State of Emergency declaration, Brown directed state officials to assist farmers and communities that are economically impacted by dry conditions and to ensure the state can respond if Californians face drinking water shortages. The governor also directed state agencies to use less water and hire more firefighters and initiated a greatly expanded water conservation public awareness campaign.\n\nThe proclamation gives state water officials more flexibility to manage supply throughout California under drought conditions.\n\nState water officials say that California\u2019s river and reservoirs are below their record lows. Manual and electronic readings record the snowpack\u2019s statewide water content at about 20 percent of normal average for this time of year.\n\nRetail Market Panel\n\nRetail Market Forecast: Signs of Optimism in San Diego\n\nSan Diego is poised for retail growth, according to panelists at the International Council of Shopping Centers 2014 San Diego Retail Market Forecast this week. \u201cUnlike other areas, San Diego is not over-retailed,\u201d said Gregg R. Sadowsky, senior vice president of Regency Centers. \u201cThere is demand and I see strong growth for San Diego.\u201d\n\nMore than 200 people attended the program, which focused on changes in San Diego\u2019s retail scene. It is just one of the ICSC Southern California chapter\u2019s events that connect shopping center owners with developers, investors, retailers and other major players in the market.\n\nFormer San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders noted in his keynote address that business optimism has increased. \u201cAccording to the Chamber\u2019s San Diego County Business Forecast, sponsored by Silvergate Bank, there was a slight uptick in business confidence at the end of 2013,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cI hope that business confidence continues to improve in 2014 as more businesses learn about the Affordable Care Act and its impacts, and with the runoff election for the San Diego mayoral race.\u201d\n\nKelley Maher-Neff, senior vice president of Madison Marquette, moderated the panel discussion, which focused on the year ahead in San Diego retail and highlighted major retail developments in various stages of completion. In addition to Sadowsky, the panel of local industry leaders included Steve R. Scott, senior vice president of Kilroy Realty Corp.; Michael P. Orlando, owner, partner and chairman of The Orlando Company Inc.; and Colton T. Sudberry, president of Sudberry Properties Inc.\n\nPanelists addressed the shift towards e-retail and brick-and-mortar stores\u2019 struggle to appeal to local residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about engaging the customer,\u201d said Orlando. \u201cWe have to work hard to get the right mix of local and national tenants.\u201d\n\nSudberry added that successful stores have found that, \u201ccreating a sense of place translates into better places for the community. It\u2019s the right thing to do for the community and the right thing financially.\u201d\n\nRotarian Terrence Caster and Wife Donate $1.85 Million to Rotary Programs\n\nSan Diego businessman and Rotary club member Terrence Caster and his wife Barbara have donated $1.85 million to Rotary in support of the humanitarian service group\u2019s polio eradication and peace studies programs.\n\n\u201cBarbara and I are blessed to be fruitful in our family business A-1 Self Storage, and we\u2019ve always felt it is important to give back and help others,\u201d said Caster, the company\u2019s founder and a member of the Rotary Club of La Mesa. \u201cAs a result, we are involved in numerous charities. But as a Rotarian, I can think of no cause more worthy than Rotary\u2019s work to end polio and promote world peace.\u201d\n\nThe donation, announced during an annual conference of Rotary leaders in San Diego, is among the largest single gifts ever made to the organization by an individual Rotary club member.\n\nThe largest share of the gift, $1.1 million, will go to Rotary\u2019s PolioPlus program, which works to immunize children in the developing world against this disabling infectious disease. The remainder of the gift, $750,000, will go to the endowment fund of Rotary\u2019s Peace Centers program, which offers master\u2019s degree-level fellowships in peace studies and conflict resolution at six major universities in five countries.\n\nAnn Kinner Named Chair of Business Leadership Council\n\nAnn Kinner, owner of Seabreeze Nautical Books and Charts in Point Loma, has been named chair of the 2014 Leadership Council of the National Federation of Independent Business, California.
