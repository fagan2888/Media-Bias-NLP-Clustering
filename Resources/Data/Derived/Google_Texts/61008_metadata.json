Court of Appeals with left-leaning judges was aided by the American Constitution Society, a non-profit group that \u201cpromotes a progressive vision of the law.\u201d The ACS is funded in part by the Democracy Alliance, a liberal donor network that funnels millions to a web of dark-money member groups.\n\nDuring a fundraising presentation at the Democracy Alliance\u2019s meeting in Chicago this spring, the American Constitution Society boasted about meeting its \u201cperformance goals,\u201d which included helping to secure the Senate filibuster reform that paved the way for reshaping the D.C. circuit court.\n\nThe group said it \u201cadvanced filibuster reform\u201d by \u201chighlighting [the] issue in national media\u201d and \u201csuccessfully leveraging attention to create outcry for confirmation of long-stalled D.C. circuit nominees,\u201d according to its presentation.\n\nThe ACS also said it drafted and supplied materials that were used by Senate Democrats to advance the rule change.\n\nExperts argued these activities appeared to cross the line from education to lobbying.\n\n\u201cIt bills itself as a tax-exempt educational organization, but obviously the American Constitution Society is engaging in policy-making activities,\u201d said Daniel Epstein, the executive director of Cause of Action and an expert at the conservative Federalist Society. \u201cThey created the intellectual arsenal behind filibuster reform.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The Democracy Alliance is] investing a lot of money to get the American Constitution Society to do things that are going to benefit the Democratic Party politically,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an historic move, Senate Democrats used the \u201cnuclear option\u201d last year to eliminate filibuster rules that allowed the Republican minority to hold up executive and judicial nominees.\n\nRepublicans had been blocking several nominees to the D.C. Court of Appeals who they argued were radical judicial activists. The D.C. circuit court hears some of the most consequential appeals cases on issues ranging from health care reform to federal agency regulations.\n\nPrior to the filibuster reform, the court was evenly divided between liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning judges. After the nuclear option, additional progressive judges were added to the D.C. circuit.\n\nThree of the judges were ACS members, the group noted in its Democracy Alliance presentation.\n\nThe organization said it \u201cmet [its] goal to deepen ACS\u2019 influence within the legal community\u201d by getting \u201cfive members of ACS network confirmed to federal bench, including three of four new D.C. Circuit members.\u201d\n\nIn the case Halbig v. Burwell, the D.C. circuit court rejected an Obamacare provision that provided taxpayer-funded subsidies to individuals in states that had set up state health care exchanges. Residents of states that declined to establish exchanges were not eligible for the tax credits.\n\nThe D.C. circuit\u2019s decision in Halbig put it at odds with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which had ruled in favor of the federal government. The conflicting rulings made it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court would take up the case.\n\nHowever, the Obama administration is now pushing for the D.C. circuit to rehear the case en banc\u2014meaning that it would go before a panel of all of the court\u2019s active judges. Legal experts predict that such a hearing would favor the Obama administration, because a greater number of progressive judges sit on the bench.\n\nIf the D.C. circuit sides with the 4th circuit during a rehearing, it would be less likely the case would make it to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d no longer have a circuit split, and therefore you\u2019d have a less of a chance the Supreme Court will review,\u201d said Epstein.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Influx of progressive judges to D.C.
