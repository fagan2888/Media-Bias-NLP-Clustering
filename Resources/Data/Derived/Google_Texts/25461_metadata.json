Ships take ballast water from one part of the world to others, running the risk of bringing non-native species that could harm ecosystems.\n\nThe decision is a major win for a coalition of environmental groups that had sued, saying the EPA did not adequately explain why it couldn\u2019t go further in mandating technology and practices to reduce the movement of organisms.\n\nThe court is asking the EPA to reconsider its decisions regarding technology, its exemption for certain older ships and other parts of the rule, but the regulation will stay in place while the agency undertakes the process.\n\nThe National Wildlife Federation, one of the groups that had brought the litigation, cheered its outcome.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge win for our environment, economy, fish, wildlife, communities and businesses,\u201d said Marc Smith, the group\u2019s policy director.\n\n\u201cThe court, in no uncertain terms, has told the federal government that it needs to uphold its responsibility under the Clean Water Act to protect our drinking water, jobs and way of life,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Central pieces of the regulations to reduce the spread of invasive species through ship ballast water were rejected.", "description": "Central pieces of the regulations to reduce the spread of invasive species through ship ballast water were rejected.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Central pieces of the regulations to reduce the spread of invasive species through ship ballast water were rejected.", "title": "Court rules against EPA\u2019s invasive species rule", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/255982-court-rules-against-epas-invasive-species-rule", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/invasivespeciesgiantafricansnail10052015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/255982-court-rules-against-epas-invasive-species-rule", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-05T17:12-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, invasive species,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-05T17:12:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/255982-court-rules-against-epas-invasive-species-rule", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Central pieces of the regulations to reduce the spread of invasive species through ship ballast water were rejected.", "card": "summary", "title": "Court rules against EPA\u2019s invasive species rule"}, "dcterms.title": "Court rules against EPA\u2019s invasive species rule"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb138\"", "article_summary": "A federal court Monday rejected central pieces of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) regulations to reduce the spread of invasive species through ship ballast water.\nShips take ballast water from one part of the world to others, running the risk of bringing non-native species that could harm ecosystems.\nADVERTISEMENTBallast, which is used to stabilize and balance ships, is a key culprit of the spread of invasive species such as the zebra mussel.\n\u201cThis is a huge win for our environment, economy, fish, wildlife, communities and businesses,\u201d said Marc Smith, the group\u2019s policy director.\nThe National Wildlife Federation, one of the groups that had brought the litigation, cheered its outcome."}
