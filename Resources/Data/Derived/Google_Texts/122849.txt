PARIS (AP) — So much for John Isner vs. Nicolas Mahut redux.

Those two men met in the longest match in tennis history — more than 11 hours spread over three days in the first round at Wimbledon in 2010, with Isner winning 70-68 in the fifth set — and then, incredibly, were forced to play each other in the same round at the same tournament a year later.

They were drawn last week to have a possible third career Grand Slam meeting in the second round of the French Open. But it won’t happen, because France’s Mahut lost his opener Monday, 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-4 to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Kukushkin. Isner, an American seeded 10th, won his first-round match Sunday.
