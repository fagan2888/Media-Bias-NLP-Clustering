Gary Herbert has secured remarkable concessions from the federal government to cover Utah\u2019s uninsured the Utah way. The resulting Healthy Utah plan is as close to a risk-free proposal as it gets.\n\nGOP leaders in the House are reportedly \u201cdone\u201d debating Healthy Utah.\n\nFaced with a March 12 deadline for getting the peoples\u2019 business done, and for balancing the budget, House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, has consigned Healthy Utah to the Rules Committee where it will presumably die.\n\nI empathize with Hughes, who I'm sure has reasons for his decision. The biggest argument House members make against Healthy Utah is the risk of losing control of costs. But as someone steeped in the \u201crisk\u201d business for 44 years, let me propose a different calculus. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest risk and 10 the highest, here is my own opinion as to the relative risk I\u2019ve had to help manage over the years:\n\nRisk level 3: As a private auditor, and as Utah\u2019s state auditor, I have published opinions on the financial health \u2014 the good, bad and ugly \u2014 of major corporations and of colleges and universities.\n\nRisk level 4: As assistant director and, later, as director of the Utah Division of Finance, I balanced the state\u2019s books and helped bring its financial reporting into full compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nRisk level 8: As finance director for the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, I helped manage contracts and finances to ensure there would be no deficit for Utahns.\n\nRisk level 7: Being CFO of a large health system, University of Utah Hospital and Clinics, is profoundly challenging. You have to be budgeted and staffed to adequately cover the health care needs of the community \u2014 including during natural disasters and disease outbreaks \u2014 without breaking the bank and while socking money away to maintain facilities.\n\nRisk level 9: If that\u2019s not enough, in the period between 2005 and 2014, University of Utah Health Care endured the added challenge of a doubling in our uncompensated, or \u201ccharity\u201d care, costs, which now stand at $120 million per year.\n\nBy comparison, Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah 2.0 plan is a no-brainer \u2014 not quite a zero risk scenario, but easily a \u201clevel 1.\u201d That\u2019s because the state\u2019s hospitals, including University of Utah Health Care, have agreed to contribute $25 million of the state\u2019s hospitals portion of the future bill. In so doing, we alleviate the financial burden related to hospital services on taxpayers and businesses. And we ensure Utah\u2019s federal tax dollars stay in Utah ($3.2 billion that will otherwise pay for Medicaid expansions in other states over the next six years). Those are hard numbers to ignore.\n\nMore persuasive, even for a numbers guy like me, is the potential for saving lives by ensuring all Utahns have access to quality health care. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine showed three states that have expanded Medicaid (New York, Maine and Arizona) have seen their mortality rate drop 6.1 percent. That\u2019s 19.6 deaths per 100,000 residents who, according to the study, also now face fewer delays in getting care and self-report better health. In the end, shouldn\u2019t that be the litmus test for Healthy Utah 2.0?\n\nThere have been times that I and my colleagues have wanted to throw up our hands and be \u201cdone\u201d with the Affordable Care Act. Complying with the law \u2014 its complicated regulations and safety and quality reporting requirements, too numerous to list here \u2014 has been all-consuming for the industry. It\u2019s made my job more difficult and it has cost UUHC tens of millions of dollars, mostly in reduced Medicare payments carved away to fund the president\u2019s signature initiative.\n\nLike the governor, we\u2019ve tried to work with federal officials to find a happy middle ground on provisions we believe distract us from our mission to advance the health of this community. Herbert has secured remarkable concessions from the feds to cover Utah\u2019s uninsured the Utah way. The resulting Healthy Utah 2.0 plan is as close to a risk-free proposal as it gets.\n\nSurely, our leaders in the House and Senate can find the time and political will to reach consensus on this most important policy debate. UUHC doctors and nurses will continue to care for Utah\u2019s low-income and uninsured, with or without reimbursement. That\u2019s their job and their privilege. But imagine how many more mothers, fathers, sons and daughters we could save \u2014 the value of which cannot be measured in time or money.\n\nGordon Crabtree is chief financial officer for University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@deseretnews", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "description": "Gov.
