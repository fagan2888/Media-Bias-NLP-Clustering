The Wall Street Journal\n\nHow the mighty have fallen.\n\nSix years after being bailed out by British taxpayers, Royal Bank of Scotland PLC in Hong Kong has sold the company\u2019s chauffeur-driven Mercedes sedan, used to ferry executives around town, opting instead for a seven-seater Nissan, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe silver Mercedes with the license plates \u2018RBS\u2019 was a regular feature in the precinct outside the bank\u2019s central Hong Kong offices where both driver and car could be seen waiting patiently for passengers to arrive.\n\nThe Mercedes, sold after the bank\u2019s strategic overhaul in February, served as a vivid reminder of a period when the British lender was bent on becoming the world\u2019s largest bank before it crashed to earth during the 2008 financial crisis. Now 80% owned by the British government, RBS continues to cut jobs and has been plagued by controversies over bonus payments and product misselling.\n\nThe RBS license plates have survived the cull, however, and are now attached to the Nissan.\n\nHelped by its 2007 purchase of ABN Amro, RBS in Asia controlled branches and trading floors from India to Australia, offering customers everything from sophisticated advice on deals to corporate loans.\n\nMuch of that network has now been scaled back. Instead, RBS in the region now focuses on day-to-day needs for clients such as transaction banking, debt financing and hedging in the currency and interest rates markets.\n\nThe bank plans to stay in 10 markets across the Asia Pacific, six of which are among the fastest growing markets for U.K. imports and exports.\n\n\u201cOur client trade flows mean that we need a strong global presence,\u201d a spokeswoman for the bank said in an emailed response to queries. \u201cNowhere is it more important than in the growing Asia Pacific region.\u201d\n\nRBS isn\u2019t the only British lender to have scaled back in Asia. After the 2008 financial crisis, rival Barclays PLC aggressively built out an investment bank with expensive staff hires and offered a suite of products from trading to deals advice. But after revenues disappointed, the bank has shed staff and promised to realign its Asian operations.\n\nIn a 2013 video presentation on the Barclays website, Helge Weiner-Trapness, who joined in 2010 as head of the financial-institutions group for the Asia-Pacific region, spoke of ambitious plans to build the bank into an institution to rival Wall Street\u2019s finest.\n\n\u201cI chose Barclays for the opportunity to join a great team. I wanted to be part of building our Asian investment banking business into being the best on the street.\u201d he said in the video. Mr. Weiner Trapness left the bank last month along with a wave of fellow executives.\n\nThe two giants of British banking in Asia \u2014 Standard Chartered PLC and HSBC PLC\u2014also face challenges. Although UK based, both lenders lean heavily on Asia for revenue. Standard Chartered has warned of falling profits and is selling assets in Hong Kong and South Korea, while HSBC too has exited businesses in the region.\n\nBritish banks were the first foreign lenders into Asia. Set up to grease the wheels of Empire across their colonized territories, they grew to become dominant forces in lending and trade, surviving wars and economic crises long before the ascent of Hong Kong and Singapore\u2019s gleaming skyscrapers.\n\nStill, there are bright spots in Asia where British banks could prosper. One is servicing the needs of the region\u2019s burgeoning list of millionaires, according to Keith Pogson, financial-services managing partner for Asia Pacific at Ernst & Young.\n\n\u201cBless her, but the Queen still brings trust and respect and tradition and all those things that connect people with private banking. So there are good opportunities there,\u201d Mr. Pogson said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong has swapped the company's chauffeur-driven Mercedes sedan for a seven-seater Nissan.", "title": "In Hong Kong, RBS Swaps Mercedes for Nissan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/04/in-hong-kong-rbs-swaps-mercedes-for-nissan/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "In Hong Kong, RBS Swaps Mercedes for Nissan", "description": "Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong has swapped the company's chauffeur-driven Mercedes sedan for a seven-seater Nissan.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Enda Curran", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong has swapped the company's chauffeur-driven Mercedes sedan for a seven-seater Nissan.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-05T01:54:24-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/04/in-hong-kong-rbs-swaps-mercedes-for-nissan/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-22180", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong has swapped the company's chauffeur-driven Mercedes sedan for a seven-seater Nissan.", "title": "In Hong Kong, RBS Swaps Mercedes for Nissan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/04/in-hong-kong-rbs-swaps-mercedes-for-nissan/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-22180", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-05T03:40:57-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Standard Chartered has warned of falling profits and is selling assets in Hong Kong and South Korea, while HSBC too has exited businesses in the region.\nThe silver Mercedes with the license plates \u2018RBS\u2019 was a regular feature in the precinct outside the bank\u2019s central Hong Kong offices where both driver and car could be seen waiting patiently for passengers to arrive.\nThe two giants of British banking in Asia \u2014 Standard Chartered PLC and HSBC PLC\u2014also face challenges.\nSet up to grease the wheels of Empire across their colonized territories, they grew to become dominant forces in lending and trade, surviving wars and economic crises long before the ascent of Hong Kong and Singapore\u2019s gleaming skyscrapers.\nStill, there are bright spots in Asia where British banks could prosper."}
