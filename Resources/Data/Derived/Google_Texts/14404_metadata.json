The Sayreville Police Department has seen a spike in IRS phone scams in the past few weeks, in which callers claim that an arrest warrant has been issued by the IRS for unpaid or delinquent taxes and that unless a fine is paid immediately, the victim will be arrested or face legal action.\n\n\u201cA call from someone posing as an IRS agent demanding money and threatening legal action is going to cause some panic. Scams of this nature have been occurring in every part of this country, and we urge our residents not to be deceived by these threatening phone calls,\u201d Sayreville Police Chief John Zebrowski said.\n\nAs with most scams, the con-artists are trying to scare the victim into \u2018wiring\u2019 money or trying to get a hold of personal information, such as a Social Security or credit card number, authorities said.\n\nThe IRS will always send written notification of any tax due via the U.S. mail, authorities said. The IRS never asks for a credit card, debit card or prepaid card information over the phone or insists that taxpayers use a specific payment method to pay tax obligations. The IRS will not take enforcement action immediately following a phone conversation. Taxpayers usually receive prior notification of IRS enforcement action involving IRS tax liens or levies.\n\nPotential phone scam victims may be told that they owe money that must be paid immediately to the IRS or they are entitled to big refunds. When unsuccessful the first time, sometimes phone scammers call back trying a new strategy.\n\nIf you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and you know you owe taxes or you think you might owe taxes, call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. The IRS employees at that line can help you with a payment issue, if there really is such an issue. If you know you don\u2019t owe taxes or have no reason to think that you owe any taxes call and report the incident to the Treasury Inspector General Tax Administration at 1-800-366-4484.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been targeted by this scam, you should also contact the Federal Trade Commission and use their \u201cFTC Complaint Assistant\u201d at www.ftc.gov. Add \u201cIRS Telephone Scam\u201d to the comments of your complaint.\n\nSOUTH BRUNSWICK\n\nTHEFT, 5:40 p.m. Nov. 18.
