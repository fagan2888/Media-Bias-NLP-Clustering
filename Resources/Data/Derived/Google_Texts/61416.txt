Pierre, SD

The presence of the National Rifle Association in the South Dakota Capitol has caused a stir among representatives in the House.



Some gun-toting lawmakers don't always agree with the stance of the NRA. But the association's score card system means legislators will have to account for their votes on gun legislation.



Two representatives say the score card systems are subjective. But the NRA says the process involves a lot of research and helps voters identify the best candidate for gun rights.



One bill has drawn conflicting stances from the NRA and the South Dakota Gun Owners. That has put legislators in a tough position when the groups rally their memberships.



The lawmakers say they rely on their constituents and consciences when facing the conflicting positions of different gun groups.
