His ego was bruised, too. It was only his second failure to finish the first run of a World Cup GS since February of 2009.\n\nLigety is the reigning Olympic champion in GS and has won gold medals at the past three world championships. He finished second in Saturday\u2019s super-G, but crashing in the discipline he has dominated for so long, and on home snow, was tough to take.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not cool in any kind of race when you go out,\u201d Ligety said, \u201d but this one\u2019s especially a bummer for sure.\u201d\n\nTwo other top GS racers went down in the first run, Alexis Pinturault of France and Thomas Fanara of Italy. Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, a three-time World Cup GS champion and four-time World Cup overall winner, had the fastest first run and cruised unchallenged in the second run to capture his 15th World Cup GS victory. That broke the record for GS wins by an Austrian, pushing him past Benjamin Raich and Hermann Maier.\n\nHirscher said he didn\u2019t let up in the second run despite the absence of chief rivals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always skiing against the time, not against Ted or Felix (Neureuther of Germany) or who else,\u201d said Hirscher, who won Saturday\u2019s super-G. \u201cI\u2019m always searching for perfect turns. I\u2019m happy with my skiing, and hopefully I can bring this momentum back to Europe.\u201d\n\nTaylor Shiffrin, a University of Denver racer and brother of superstar Mikaela Shiffrin, was one of the race forerunners. Shiffrin offered a detailed analysis of the first-run carnage and was in a more talkative mood than Ligety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky course,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cThere\u2019s a combination of very tight turns in a few sections and then very open, straight, speedy turns through those other sections. You have a lot of speed, a lot of intensity and the snow is very aggressive. A lot of these skis are very sharp, case in point Pinturault kind of getting juiced and thrown off Red Tail down here.\u201d\n\nWith sharp skis on \u201caggressive\u201d snow, racers can easily catch an edge and lose control.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of guys were having trouble with how much the snow transformed overnight, being so aggressive because it\u2019s so cold,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cMy ski (edge) just bit really quickly and I had to kind of let go of it the gate before. Then I booted out and went on my side and couldn\u2019t get back on my feet before I went through that next gate.\u201d\n\nLigety had other issues. He has been battling back problems because of three herniated discs, and he was sick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling good,\u201d Ligety said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve done well when I\u2019ve been sick before.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shocker in Beaver Creek: World champ Ted Ligety DNF in first run", "title": "Shocker in Beaver Creek: World champ Ted Ligety DNF in first run", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/06/shocker-in-beaver-creek-world-champ-ted-ligety-dnf-in-first-run/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206__Ted_Ligetyp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206__Ted_Ligetyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T11:46:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:33:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, a three-time World Cup GS champion and four-time World Cup overall winner, had the fastest first run and cruised unchallenged in the second run to capture his 15th World Cup GS victory.\nIt was only his second failure to finish the first run of a World Cup GS since February of 2009.\nHirscher said he didn\u2019t let up in the second run despite the absence of chief rivals.\nBEAVER CREEK \u2014 Ted Ligety has been nearly unbeatable in giant slalom at Beaver Creek, winning four of the last five World Cup GS races and the world championships GS last February, but the course beat him on Sunday.\nLigety is the reigning Olympic champion in GS and has won gold medals at the past three world championships."}
