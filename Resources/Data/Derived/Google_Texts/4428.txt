Consumer Contact: Tech Support Phone Scams

Russ Van Arsdale was in the studio Monday for this week’s Consumer Contact segment. This week, he was warning Joy of tech support phone scams that have been gaining popularity. Russ says due to Maine’s older population, our state is a prime target for these phone calls.

One key tip-off that Russ mentioned, is many of these scammers will drop the name “Microsoft,” saying they’ve “detected trouble with your computer.” Right away this should tip you off: Microsoft does not make “cold calls.” They will give technical help ONLY if a customer initiates the dialogue.

Scammers using this technique have been known to:

Try to get you to download malicious software that can capture personal information

Get you to visit phony websites that connect you to malicious software

Ask for credit card information to make phony charges

Send you to fake websites to enter personal information

Russ says the number one rule to remember when you think you might be dealing with one of these scammers: “Don’t call me. I’ll call you.”
