The former Republican presidential candidate is leaving to consider another run at the office in 2016, after President Barack Obama vacates, though Huckabee plans to save that decision for a later date.\n\nSee Photos: 24 TV Newscasters Ranked by Popularity\n\n\u201cTonight I will do more than just say goodnight. I will say goodbye. This is the last edition of \u2018Huckabee\u2019 on the Fox News Channel,\u201d he wrote Saturday on his website, in a statement he planned to also deliver on his final telecast. \u201cIt\u2019s been the ride of a lifetime, and I have never had so much fun in my life. But I also realize that God hasn\u2019t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.\u201d\n\nThe former Arkansas Governor has starred on his eponymous Fox News Show since 2008, the same year he made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency. He won the Iowa Republican caucus, but lost out in the Republican primary to Senator John McCain, who later went on to lose in the general election to then-Senator Barack Obama.\n\nIn the politician-turned-TV host\u2019s statement he admitted he hasn\u2019t ruled out running again in 2016, though he doesn\u2019t plan to make that announcement until the Spring.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018Scandal\u2019 Creator Shonda Rhimes Slams Mike Huckabee\u2019s Comments on Birth Control, Obamacare\n\n\u201cThere has been a great deal of speculation as to whether I would run for President. If I were willing to absolutely rule that out, I could keep doing this show. But I can\u2019t make such a declaration,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them nor is it possible for me to openly determine political and financial support to justify a race,\u201d Huckabee added. \u201cThe honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox. As much as I have loved doing the show, I cannot bring myself to rule out another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!\u201d\n\nIf Huckabee were to run for President of the United States of America in 2016, it\u2019s unclear who he would run against. Hillary Clinton, former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, is widely expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democrats, but she has yet to make any formal announcement.\n\nAlso Read: 2014 in Cable News: Fox News Stays on Top, CNN Climbs to No. 2 in Demo, MSNBC Falls Behind\n\nA Fox News Channel spokeswoman told TheWrap the network and the governor had amicably parted ways, saying the move was in the best interest of both parties.\n\n\u201cThe network will run various specials in place of \u2018Huckabee\u2019 for the next few weeks and will be trying \u2018a few new ideas\u2019 in the 8 p.m. weekend time slot,\u201d the spokeswoman added.\n\nRead Governor Huckabee\u2019s tweet below:\n\n\n\nRelease: Gov.
