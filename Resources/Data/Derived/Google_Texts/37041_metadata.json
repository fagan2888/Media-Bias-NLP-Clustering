In this month\u2019s election, Shumlin, a two-term incumbent, took 46 percent of the popular vote, edging out Milne, a political neophyte who jumped into the race very late in the year, by just 2,434 votes out of nearly 200,000. That was the worst performance of any recent incumbent governor and possibly the worst in the history of the Green Mountain State.\n\nIt also means that the race still isn\u2019t settled. According to Vermont\u2019s constitution, gubernatorial elections in which no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote go to the state legislature for a decision by secret ballot. The process went unused through most of the 20th century, but some recent winners in open races, including Shumlin in 2010 and Republican Jim Douglas in 2002, have gotten into office via legislative vote. One Vermont expert says the legislative vote was not used at all between 1852 and 1986.\n\nBut it is highly unusual for an incumbent to do this poorly in a reelection campaign. Douglas won his subsequent campaigns by solid majorities, as did Shumlin in 2012.\n\nMilne is betting that that vote indicates a high level of disenchantment with Shumlin.\n\n\u201cPeter Shumlin is the incumbent, and he performed the worst of any governor running for reelection in recent memory,\u201d Milne tells National Review Online. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any paid staff, just a close circle of supporters. We ran an insurgent campaign; we were outspent five to one, but we still came within fewer than 2,500 votes of being the top vote-getter. So we\u2019ve got the momentum on our side.\u201d\n\nMilne concedes that his odds in the state house are slim, and Vermont observers say he has only a very outside chance of winning. In past legislative votes, the top gubernatorial vote-getter has won (though no other races have been as close as this one). And although Republicans picked up eight seats in the state house and two in the state senate on November 4, Shumlin\u2019s Democrats retain a large majority in both houses, including a supermajority in the state senate.\n\nThe question is whether they\u2019re actually Shumlin\u2019s Democrats. The governor is notorious for having a fraught relationship with his own party, a problem that has been exacerbated by Shumlin\u2019s antics in creating what he hopes will be the nation\u2019s first single-payer health-care system. Since the election, it has come to light that Shumlin hired MIT\u2019s Jonathan Gruber \u2014 who has been caught discussing the stupidity of the electorate and the intentional obscurity of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s language \u2014 to consult in the construction of the system, which is slated to debut in 2016.\n\nAfter Gruber\u2019s comments came to light, Shumlin last week initially backed his $400,000 contract, but he pulled the plug shortly afterward. By that point, Vermont taxpayers had already paid Gruber more than $160,000.\n\n\u201cThroughout the campaign we referred to the governor as reckless with the people\u2019s money,\u201d Milne says. \u201cThe state\u2019s bond rating has been downgraded. The Gruber thing didn\u2019t come out until a week after the election, when the governor\u2019s office finally responded to a Freedom of Information Act request. There was no reason that it took so long to know about Gruber. This contract was signed in the first ten days of July. Our fiscal year starts July 1.\u201d\n\nVermont Republican-party chairman David Sunderland notes that the single-payer plan is not the only thing that\u2019s been going south way up north.\n\n\u201cShumlin is very vulnerable,\u201d Sunderland tells NRO. \u201cThe October unemployment numbers were not great. Our state\u2019s economy has been stagnant. The controversy over Gruber has come on top of all that.\u201d\n\nShumlin did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did the Democratic Governors Association, of which he is currently chairman. That Shumlin heads the organization despite his tanking popularity in his own state suggests trouble for the DGA. Vice chairman John Hickenlooper also failed to get a majority in his recent reelection in Colorado, while finance chairman Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s lieutenant governor was defeated in an upset by Republican Larry Hogan in Maryland (O\u2019Malley was term-limited). Jay Nixon, the embattled governor of Missouri, is on the DGA\u2019s executive committee.\n\nNevertheless, the DGA\u2019s opposite number has not taken an interest in Milne\u2019s dark-horse effort. The Republican Governors Association did not respond to requests for comment, but Milne characterizes the national party\u2019s help with his campaign, before and after the election, as \u201czero\u201d \u2014 a level of neglect he says may have been a blessing. \u201cI think one of the reasons I did so well is that my campaign was myself, my family, and close supporters,\u201d he says. \u201cIf RGA had come in and turned it into a typical national election, we might have lost some of our appeal.\u201d\n\nThe legislative vote is scheduled for early January, and the Vermont establishment has been turning up the pressure on Milne to concede. In an old-school talking-head video editorial, WPTZ president Kyle Grimes called last week for Milne to end the \u201cwrangling over the next governor,\u201d saying \u201dthat issue was decided by the voters on November 4.\u201d Although this last statement is factually incorrect in view of the state\u2019s constitution, it is true that previous total-vote losers have bowed out before the legislature took up the vote.\n\nBut Milne points to Shumlin\u2019s record of secrecy \u2014 including his failure to give details about the outsourcing of some state renewable energy authorities to Canadian contractors \u2014 as a reason to keep up pressure on the unpopular governor.\n\n\u201cIf me sticking around and losing in the legislature gets Vermonters some transparency, it will be worth it,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a press release last week, Milne hedged on the concession calls, noting that he intended to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d but pointing to the widespread public support his insurgent campaign has received.\n\n\u201cOur constitution is a great treasure. It was the first constitution in America to abolish slavery and to grant the vote to folks that didn\u2019t own property,\u201d Milne said. \u201cI see great value in deferring to the constitution, which requires the legislature to elect our governor when we end up with a situation like the Milne\u2013Shumlin race in 2014.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tim Cavanaugh is news editor of National Review Online.

In an old-school talking-head video editorial, WPTZ president Kyle Grimes called last week for Milne to end the \u201cwrangling over the next governor,\u201d saying\u00a0\u201dthat issue was decided by the voters on November 4.\u201d Although this last statement is factually incorrect in view of the state\u2019s constitution, it is true that previous total-vote losers have bowed out before the legislature took up the vote.\n\nBut Milne points to Shumlin\u2019s record of secrecy \u2014 including his failure to give details about the outsourcing of some state renewable energy authorities to Canadian contractors \u2014 as a reason to keep up pressure on the unpopular governor.\n\n\u201cIf me sticking around and losing in the legislature gets Vermonters some transparency, it will be worth it,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a press release last week, Milne hedged on the concession calls,\u00a0noting that he intended to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d but pointing to the widespread public support his insurgent campaign has received.\n\n\u201cOur constitution is a great treasure. It was the first constitution in America to abolish slavery and to grant the vote to folks that didn\u2019t own property,\u201d Milne said. \u201cI see great value in deferring to the constitution, which requires the legislature to elect our governor when we end up with a situation like the Milne\u2013Shumlin race in 2014.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tim Cavanaugh is news editor of National Review Online.
