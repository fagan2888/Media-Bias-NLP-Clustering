Indeed, it provides a guided path for its escape.\u201d\n\nThe current system of quality reporting is focused largely on provider processes and procedural outcomes, not on \u201cinformation that most patients value,\u201d they write.\n\nFor instance, while patients in New York and Pennsylvania can get a sense of cardiac-surgery outcomes for specific providers, \u201cthis information does little to help patients decide whether they want or need surgery in the first place.\u201d\n\nPatient-centered quality reporting should be a part of shared decision making \u2014 something that \u201crequires substantial investments in provider training, information systems, and process reengineering.\u201d\n\nA large barrier is that many clinicians \u201chave neither the time nor the financial incentives to make such investments, especially in a fee-for-service environment\u201d \u2014 although that\u2019s slowly being overcome by today\u2019s investments in training, IT, process reengineering and payment reform.\n\nIndeed, the gradual changes in quality metrics should start paying off just as personalized medicine begins going mainstream.\n\n\u201cWe now have a more urgent need for a similarly personalized approach to the health care decisions that patients encounter daily, but there is more involved than just clinical decision making,\u201d Huckman and Kelley write. \u201cThe analogue of the genetic code in this case is a combination of the patient's clinical problem, the effectiveness and cost of the remedy, and the resulting social or economic consequences for a patient's family.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/changes-needed-public-healthcare-quality-reporting", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Making healthcare quality reporting more patient-centered should be a natural part of making healthcare itself more patient-centered, say two authors of a recent New England Journal of Medicine article.", "title": "Changes needed in public healthcare quality reporting"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "title": "Changes needed in public healthcare quality reporting", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Making healthcare quality reporting more patient-centered should be a natural part of making healthcare itself more patient-centered, say two authors of a recent New England Journal of Medicine article."}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Making healthcare quality reporting more patient-centered should be a natural part of making healthcare itself more patient-centered, say two authors of a recent New England Journal of Medicine article.&#13; \u201cPublic reporting must shift from \u2018one size somewhat fits all\u2019 to an approach that reports metrics reflecting the varied concerns and preferences of consumers,\u201d write Robert Huckman, a Harvard business professor, and Mark Kelley, MD, CEO of the Henry Ford Medical Group.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc946f\"", "article_summary": "Making healthcare quality reporting more patient-centered should be a natural part of making healthcare itself more patient-centered, say two authors of a recent New England Journal of Medicine article.\nAmid a national focus on reining in healthcare spending and increasingly more out-of-pocket payments, patients \u201cwill want information that goes beyond current public reporting,\u201d they say.\nIndeed, the gradual changes in quality metrics should start paying off just as personalized medicine begins going mainstream.\n\u201cBy focusing patients on choosing between providers of specific services, current public reporting thus does little to keep the proverbial horse of medical utilization inside the barn.\nIndeed, it provides a guided path for its escape.\u201dThe current system of quality reporting is focused largely on provider processes and procedural outcomes, not on \u201cinformation that most patients value,\u201d they write."}
