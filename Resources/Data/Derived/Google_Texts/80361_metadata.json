This is the page from 29. 9. 1939, 28 days after World War II. broke out. (Epoch Times; German Federal Archive and USHMM screenshot).\n\nThe diary of Alfred Rosenberg, leading Nazi theorist and adviser to Adolf Hitler, provides a look at key steps in building the Nazi ideology as well as some of Hitler\u2019s personal thoughts. About 400 handwritten pages of the long-lost diary were recently transcribed (in German only) and published online by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nThe diary changed hands a couple of times after Rosenberg was found guilty of crimes against humanity in 1946 and hanged. It was recovered at the home of publisher Herbert Richardson in Lewiston, N.Y., on June 13, 2013. Many of the entries, dated from 1936 to 1944, became available on Tuesday on the museum\u2019s website.\n\nEpoch Times reviewed dozens of pages detailing daily affairs in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime, to distill some of the insights found in Rosenberg\u2019s diary.\n\n\u2018Church Father of National Socialism\u2019\n\nRosenberg played a key role in forming Nazi theories on racial supremacy and he wrote in the diary about forming a new religion, a religion of \u201cself-assertion.\u201d Hitler even called him \u201cthe church father of National Socialism,\u201d as Rosenberg himself recounted.\n\nThe entries flesh out and complement his book, started in 1917 and published in 1930, titled \u201cThe Myth of the Twentieth Century.\u201d He wrote in this book about a \u201creligion of the blood\u201d; such passages in the book were used as evidence against him and included in an indictment, published by the Cornell Law School.\n\nRosenberg wrote in his diary of \u201cthe great struggle for the absolute supremacy of the state over the church.\u201d He added, \u201cWe would continue the fight against the emperor of the great popes and would end it.\u201d (\u201cDas grosse Ringen um die absolute Vormacht des Staates \u00fcber die Kirche gehe weiter, wir h\u00e4tten den Kampf der grossen Kaiser gegen die P\u00e4pste weiterzuf\u00fchren und w\u00fcrden ihn beenden.\u201d)\n\nOccupying the East\n\nHitler made Rosenberg the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories in 1941. Nazis were divided on the approach toward Russia. Rosenberg felt great pressure, and he noted that Hitler recognized this in an emotional exchange between the two: \u201cThe F\u00fchrer [Hitler] said, and tears came to his eyes: \u2018It is a large, positive task you take on.\u2019\u201d (\u201cDer F\u00fchrer sagte, u. ihm kamen Tr\u00e4nen in die Augen: ,Es ist aber eine grosse positive Aufgabe, die Sie erhalten.\u2018\u201d)\n\nThough Rosenberg was devoted to Hitler, he did have a different opinion on how Russia should be handled. Rosenberg felt a united Russia should be avoided. He envisioned smaller states acting as a buffer zone, isolating the Great Russian state, which could otherwise gain strength and become a threat.\n\nHe compared himself in his diary to philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who \u201csaw all coming, but could not change it.\u201d (\u201c\u2026sah alles kommen u. konnte es nicht \u00e4ndern.\u201d)\n\nMLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHitler\u2019s Reliance on His Advisers\n\nThe diary continues through Nazi milestones large and small. Some of the minor events come together to paint a picture of a Nazi regime confident in its lasting reign.\n\nRosenberg describes the vision of the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question in Frankfurt, for example: \u201cWhoever from around the world wants to study the Jewish question will [one day] have to come to Frankfurt [to do so].\u201d (\u201cWer sp\u00e4ter aus der Welt einmal d. Judenfrage erforschen will, wird nach Frankfurt m\u00fcssen.\u201d)\n\nSome daily events described also show Hitler\u2019s trust in his advisers and the extent to which they helped build up \u201cDer F\u00fchrer.\u201d For example, Rosenberg recalled: \u201cThe F\u00fchrer had not read my speech yet. He told me: \u2018I do not need to read your speeches, they are always right.\u2019\u201d (\u201cDer F\u00fchrer hatte sie noch nicht gelesen. Er sagte mir: ,Ihre Reden brauche ich nicht zu lesen, sie sind immer richtig.\u2018\u201d)\n\nJuergen Matthaeus, a historian at the museum, told ABC News: \u201c[Rosenberg] was a very early Nazi and some would claim that he was an even earlier Nazi than Hitler himself.\u201d\n\nMatthaeus said the diary, \u201cwill shed light on a key player in the Nazi past and when you look at what was going on at the time, you can see how active his staff was to determine policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The diary of Alfred Rosenberg, leading Nazi theorist and adviser to Adolf Hitler, provides a look at key steps in building the Nazi ideology as well as some of Hitler's personal thoughts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Epoch Times", "description": "The diary of Alfred Rosenberg, leading Nazi theorist and adviser to Adolf Hitler, provides a look at key steps in building the Nazi ideology as well as some of Hitler's personal thoughts.", "title": "Diary of Hitler\u2019s Adviser Alfred Rosenberg Published, Gives Insight into Nazi Ideology and Daily Life", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2013/12/alfreddiary.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-21T10:06:02-05:00", "url": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/407796-diary-of-hitlers-adviser-alfred-rosenberg-published-gives-insight-into-nazi-ideology-and-daily-life/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Epoch Times", "description": "The diary of Alfred Rosenberg, leading Nazi theorist and adviser to Adolf Hitler, provides a look at key steps in building the Nazi ideology as well as some of Hitler's personal thoughts.", "title": "Diary of Hitler\u2019s Adviser Alfred Rosenberg Published, Gives Insight into Nazi Ideology and Daily Life", "image": {"src": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2013/12/alfreddiary.jpg"}, "creator": "@IngridLongauer", "site": "@EpochTimes", "card": "summary"}, "date": "December 21, 2013 10:06 am", "fb": {"admins": 10205921529470972, "pages": 92239399265}, "keywords": "World, Europe, US, US News", "article": {"section": "Europe", "published_time": "2013-12-19T15:15:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-21T10:06:02-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ingrid.longauerova"}}, "article_summary": "He told me: \u2018I do not need to read your speeches, they are always right.\u2019\u201d (\u201cDer F\u00fchrer hatte sie noch nicht gelesen.\nThe diary of Alfred Rosenberg, leading Nazi theorist and adviser to Adolf Hitler, provides a look at key steps in building the Nazi ideology as well as some of Hitler\u2019s personal thoughts.\nThe diary changed hands a couple of times after Rosenberg was found guilty of crimes against humanity in 1946 and hanged.\nAbout 400 handwritten pages of the long-lost diary were recently transcribed (in German only) and published online by the U.S.\nAlfred Rosenberg and his diary."}
