As of 2 p.m. on Wednesday, that petition has two signatures.\n\nLet\u2019s Fire TRUMP is not the most high-profile group to use a candidate\u2019s name as an acronym in an attempt to show an alignment with a candidate. The main super-PAC supporting Carly Fiorina is called CARLY for America, with Carly an acronym for \u201cConservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You.\u201d\n\nThat group changed its name to include an acronym only after the FEC called on it to change its name from Carly for America by mid-June.\n\nThe FEC has not publicly released whether that move was sufficient, but the most recent letter to Let\u2019s Fire TRUMP sheds doubt on the FEC approving that tactic.\n\nA spokeswoman at the FEC could not comment on the specifics but said that the absence of any public letter to CARLY for America does not mean that the FEC has moved on, only that it hasn\u2019t sent the group any new, formal request.\n\nCARLY for America has not yet returned a request for comment as to whether the FEC has privately responded to the name change.\n\nThe FEC ruled on acronyms in a similar case regarding the Decidedly Unhappy Mainstream Patriots Rejecting Evil-mongering Incompetent Democrats Political Action Committee (DUMPREID PAC), created to oppose then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).\n\nThe FEC\u2019s legal analysis in that case found that the group can use Reid\u2019s name in a special project that \u201cclearly and unambiguously shows opposition to Senator Reid.\u201d But it should not use his name in its committee name because the assertion that his name is an acronym still doesn\u2019t \u201cchange the fact that Senator Reid\u2019s name is listed as part of the official name of the Committee.\u201d\n\nSince the committee agreed to tweak its website disclaimers to include the full text of the acronym and refer to DUMPREID PAC as a project of the larger committee, the FEC chose to dismiss the complaint against it in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The committee's name can't include the candidate's name, the FEC says.", "description": "The committee's name can't include the candidate's name, the FEC says.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The committee's name can't include the candidate's name, the FEC says.", "title": "FEC tells dump Trump PAC to change its name", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/249645-fec-tells-dump-trump-pac-to-change-its-name", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/trumpdonald_071815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-29T17:24:41-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-29T17:24-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/249645-fec-tells-dump-trump-pac-to-change-its-name", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-29T14:54-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cheryl Segal", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T14:54:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T17:24:41-04:00"}, "keywords": ",Donald Trump,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/249645-fec-tells-dump-trump-pac-to-change-its-name", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The committee's name can't include the candidate's name, the FEC says.", "card": "summary", "title": "FEC tells dump Trump PAC to change its name"}, "dcterms.title": "FEC tells dump Trump PAC to change its name"}, "article_summary": "CARLY for America has not yet returned a request for comment as to whether the FEC has privately responded to the name change.\nThe jig may soon be up for the Let\u2019s Fire TRUMP political action committee, as the Federal Election Commission is calling on the group to change its name.\nThe FEC has not publicly released whether that move was sufficient, but the most recent letter to Let\u2019s Fire TRUMP sheds doubt on the FEC approving that tactic.\nThe group\u2019s first official act was to launch a Change.org petition calling on the Republican National Committee to bar Trump from the upcoming GOP debate.\nJennifer Scofield, the treasurer at Let's Fire Trump, told The Hill that she believes the name complies with FEC regulations and that the group, which pans Trump as \u201cthe absolute worst part of politics,\u201d will make that pitch to the FEC in a response."}
