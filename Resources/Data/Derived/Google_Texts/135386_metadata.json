(AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s worst coal mine disaster in decades exposed lax safety measures at some Appalachian mines, issues that persist five years later despite the crackdown that followed, according to an Associated Press review of federal inspection records.\n\nExcess methane gas and flammable coal dust fueled a fireball that raced through the Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia on April 5, 2010, killing 29 men. The explosion and mass casualties rocked the mining community, which had just recorded its safest year ever in coal mines.\n\nThe revelation that inspectors repeatedly had cited the mine for buildups of coal dust and methane, with little disruption to the mine\u2019s operations, drove calls for greater accountability. Federal authorities responded by stiffening safety rules, stepping up inspection raids and going after company higher-ups.\n\nProsecutors have won four convictions against former officials at Massey Energy, the company that owned Upper Big Branch, and secured a rare indictment on conspiracy charges against Don Blankenship, the former CEO. He has pleaded not guilty and is set for trial April 20.\n\nIn 2014, the nation again set a new low for coal mining deaths \u2014 16 \u2014 in part because about a hundred underground mines have closed in West Virginia and Kentucky over the last five years as the energy industry has moved away from Appalachian coal.\n\nThe U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration also credits its revamped approach to inspections. After Upper Big Branch, MSHA began sending teams of inspectors to target problem mines, many of them underground operations in West Virginia and Kentucky, which are still home to nearly half of the nation\u2019s coal mines. Federal inspectors have written nearly 14,000 citations during those visits, called impact inspections.\n\nMSHA chief Joe Main has said the increased enforcement has reduced serious violations that could lead to injury or death by about 60 percent in mines that MSHA has kept a close watch over since 2010.\n\nYet some mines consistently fail to follow rules meant to curb explosion risks, including some owned by the company that took over Massey\u2019s operations.\n\nIn January, federal officials found excess methane and coal dust at Mill Branch Coal Corp.\u2019s Osaka mine in Wise County, Virginia. The mine is owned by Alpha Natural Resources, which bought Massey\u2019s mines in 2011. During the visit, inspectors pulled miners out of two working sections, temporarily shutting down production. The January visit to Osaka was the fifth impact inspection at the mine.\n\nAt another Wise County mine in November, inspectors found 2-foot deep accumulations of combustible materials and coal dust in working areas of Regent Allied Carbon Energy\u2019s No. 2 mine. MSHA ordered the belt lines shut down since the mine had not followed an approved ventilation plan, and officials noted that the water supply to sprayers that suppress coal dust were not turned on.\n\nA worker at the Regent Allied mine referred questions to company president Ervin Stiltner, but calls to two numbers listed in his name were not answered.\n\nMSHA named six more mines in an August report that have had repeated problems meeting ventilation and dust control standards since Upper Big Branch. Five are in West Virginia and one is in eastern Kentucky.\n\n\u201cYou just have to shake your head and wonder what in the world are these mines doing?\u201d said Celeste Monforton, a former MSHA official and a member of a special investigative panel that compiled a report on Upper Big Branch for the West Virginia governor.\n\nThe fact that some mine operators continue to create conditions similar to those at Upper Big Branch should \u201creally send chills up peoples\u2019 spines, knowing that these situations are still occurring,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "5 years after coal mine blast, explosion risks persist", "title": "5 years after coal mine blast, explosion risks persist", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "5 years after coal mine blast, explosion risks persist", "title": "5 years after coal mine blast, explosion risks persist", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/04/5_years_after_coal_mine_blast_explosion_risks_persist/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mine-explosion-persistent-problems.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "5 years after coal mine blast, explosion risks persist", "title": "5 years after coal mine blast, explosion risks persist", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mine-explosion-persistent-problems.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dylan Lovan and John Raby", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The explosion and mass casualties rocked the mining community, which had just recorded its safest year ever in coal mines.\nIn January, federal officials found excess methane and coal dust at Mill Branch Coal Corp.\u2019s Osaka mine in Wise County, Virginia.\nExcess methane gas and flammable coal dust fueled a fireball that raced through the Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia on April 5, 2010, killing 29 men.\nFive are in West Virginia and one is in eastern Kentucky.\nProsecutors have won four convictions against former officials at Massey Energy, the company that owned Upper Big Branch, and secured a rare indictment on conspiracy charges against Don Blankenship, the former CEO."}
