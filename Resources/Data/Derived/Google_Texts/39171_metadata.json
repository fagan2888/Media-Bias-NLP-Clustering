This year, Republicans are looking to capitalize on voter frustration with Washington and predicted low turnout to take back some seats to help the GOP solidify its hold on the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see great strides,\u201d said Illinois GOP Chairman Tim Schneider.\n\nDemocrats are counting on their push for a higher minimum wage and other economic proposals to rally the party faithful and stave off any losses.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the most competitive contests:\n\n______\n\n10th Congressional District: Chicago\u2019s northern suburbs to the Wisconsin state line.\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Brad Schneider\n\nHometown: Deerfield\n\nBackground: Business consultant\n\nChallenger: Republican Bob Dold\n\nHometown: Kenilworth\n\nBackground: Pest control business. Former one-term U.S. congressman.\n\nMatchup: The rematch of a close contest in 2012 could come down to which party turns out the most voters. Dold narrowly lost a bid for a second term by slightly more than one percentage point. The district had been represented by Republicans, including current U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, since the 1970s. The two candidates share similar views on many issues. Dold recently aired an ad in which his sister assures voters he supports abortion rights, as does Schneider.\n\nIssues: Both candidates are tilting toward the center to attract independents. Schneider and Dold both favor raising the federal minimum wage - Schneider supports raising it to $10.10 an hour over three years, while Dold doesn\u2019t specify an amount. They differ on the Affordable Care Act: Schneider notes that a number of its problems have been fixed. Dold wants changes to make it as \u201cpatient-centered\u201d as possible.\n\n_____\n\n11th Congressional District: Southwest Chicago suburbs, stretching in a \u201cZ\u201d shape from Aurora to Joliet.\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Bill Foster\n\nHometown: Naperville\n\nBackground: Physicist and businessman. Elected to Congress in 2008. Lost re-election bid in 2010. Re-elected to newly drawn district in 2012.\n\nChallenger: Republican Darlene Senger\n\nHometown: Naperville\n\nBackground: Former city council member. State representative since 2009.\n\nMatchup: Foster defeated three-term Republican incumbent Judy Biggert in 2012 in a district now leaning Democrat with a growing Hispanic population. Senger notes her involvement in crafting a public pension overhaul in Springfield last year as evidence of her ability to work across the aisle. The candidates have clashed over a taxpayer funded mailer issued by Foster that claims millionaires don\u2019t pay enough taxes. Senger notes Foster\u2019s wealth and says he\u2019s hypocritical.\n\nIssues: Senger and Foster differ on taxes, government regulations and what\u2019s best for middle-class families. Senger says there should be fewer regulations, while Foster supports ending tax incentives that help companies move jobs offshore and expanding trade skills education. Senger opposes higher taxes to balance the federal budget, while Foster favors a mix of tax revenue and spending cuts.\n\n______\n\n12th Congressional District: Stretches from eastern St. Louis suburbs to the Kentucky border.\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Bill Enyart\n\nHometown: Belleville\n\nBackground: Former adjutant general of Illinois National guard. Served in U.S. Air Force.\n\nChallenger: Republican Mike Bost\n\nHometown: Murphysboro\n\nBackground: 19-year state representative. Former U.S. Marine and firefighter.\n\nChallenger: Green Party candidate Paula Bradshaw\n\nHometown: Carbondale\n\nBackground: Emergency room nurse\n\nMatchup: The district has been in Democratic hands for more than two decades but has grown increasingly conservative on social issues. The race could come down to personalities: Democrats have spent millions on ads featuring an angry outburst by Bost on the Illinois House Floor in 2012. Bost argues the eruption was atypical but might help him with voters frustrated with government. Bradshaw won 6 percent of the vote in a failed 2012 bid.\n\nIssues: Bost asserts that Enyart is out of touch and aligned with Democratic House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Enyart retorts that he\u2019s voted against Pelosi and the Obama administration \u201cwhen they\u2019re not correct,\u201d in particular on proposed regulations on coal-fired power plants. Enyart criticizes Bost\u2019s stance against raising the minimum wage and his work as a state lawmaker as Illinois descended into a financial crisis. Bradshaw says Washington is run by corporations and the wealthy. She advocates cutting the U.S. military budget in half and a $15 minimum wage.\n\n_____\n\n13th Congressional District: Bow-tie shaped district that stretches from Champaign to the St. Louis suburbs.\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rodney Davis.\n\nHometown: Taylorville\n\nBackground: Former projects director and campaign manager for U.S. Rep. John Shimkus\n\nChallenger: Democrat Ann Callis\n\nHometown: Edwardsville\n\nBackground: Former Madison County chief judge\n\nMatchup: Initially seen as one of the nation\u2019s most competitive races. A swing district favoring Republicans in non-presidential years and Democrats otherwise. Callis criticizes Davis as a Washington insider, noting he hired a lobbyist to be his chief of staff. Davis highlights questions about Callis\u2019 residency, noting reports that she signed mortgage papers saying her residence was in Missouri. Callis\u2019 campaign says she is a resident of Illinois and registered to vote and holds a drivers licence here.\n\nIssues: Callis links Davis to dysfunction and indecision in Congress. Davis blames the gridlock on the Democratic-led Senate. The candidates also have focused on jobs and the economy: Callis calls for equal pay for women, criticizes Davis for voting to keep the issue from coming to the House floor. Davis calls for fewer government regulations and boosting domestic oil production.\n\n_____\n\n17th Congressional District: Stretches from Rockford west to the Mississippi River, south along the Iowa border, then back east to Peoria.\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Cheri Bustos\n\nHometown: East Moline\n\nBackground: Former reporter, editor and nonprofit spokeswoman. Former member of the East Moline City Council.\n\nChallenger: Bobby Schilling\n\nHometown: Colona\n\nBackground: Pizza shop owner. Former one-term U.S. congressman\n\nMatchup: Another rematch. Bustos beat Schilling in 2012 by 6 percentage points. Schilling says Bustos broke her promise to give up 10 percent of her pay. Bustos said she misspoke and meant that she supports legislation to cut congressional pay by that amount. The key Quad Cities area remains strongly Democratic. Schilling has actively sought support from tea party allies who helped him win 2010.\n\nIssues: Schilling has made the Affordable Care Act a top issue, while Bustos has avoided the issue, talking about general health care topics instead. His focus is jobs and the middle class. Bustos emphasizes her focus on agriculture, including work on the latest Farm Bill, and touts her assistance in the federal purchase of the Thomson state prison.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years after being embarrassed in congressional elections, Illinois Republicans are aiming for payback in this year's Nov. 4 midterm vote.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two years after being embarrassed in congressional elections, Illinois Republicans are aiming for payback in this year\u2019s Nov. 4 midterm vote.", "title": "GOP aims to regain key Illinois Congress seats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/5/gop-aims-to-regain-key-illinois-congress-seats/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/05/c41d40cc287ca527610f6a706700ee5b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/05/c41d40cc287ca527610f6a706700ee5b.jpg", "description": "Two years after being embarrassed in congressional elections, Illinois Republicans are aiming for payback in this year's Nov. 4 midterm vote.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP aims to regain key Illinois Congress seats"}, "Author": "KERRY LESTER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae6f\"", "article_summary": "_____13th Congressional District: Bow-tie shaped district that stretches from Champaign to the St. Louis suburbs.\n_____17th Congressional District: Stretches from Rockford west to the Mississippi River, south along the Iowa border, then back east to Peoria.\n_____11th Congressional District: Southwest Chicago suburbs, stretching in a \u201cZ\u201d shape from Aurora to Joliet.\nHere\u2019s a look at the most competitive contests:______10th Congressional District: Chicago\u2019s northern suburbs to the Wisconsin state line.\n______12th Congressional District: Stretches from eastern St. Louis suburbs to the Kentucky border."}
