For a Wall Street bank with assets valued at $861 billion, the fine is a drop in the bucket and likely will be partially written off its taxes.\n\nMost notably, the Justice Department didn\u2019t bring criminal charges against individual officials of the bank, and no one will be going to the slammer.\n\nRelated: Goldman Sachs settlement on mortgage-backed bonds to hit earnings\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s high water mark in prosecuting financial industry misdeeds came in June 2002 during the Bush administration with Michael Chertoff\u2019 heading the criminal division. That\u2019s when Arthur Andersen, Enron\u2019s auditing firm, was convicted by a jury, which led to the firm closing, costing tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nA backlash by a shocked corporate world and even some prosecutors who thought Chertoff had gone too far led to a pullback in government prosecutions of corporate officials, according to an analysis by ProPublica and The New York Times. From then on, the Justice Department sharply increased the number of deferred and non-prosecution agreements and pursued fewer criminal prosecutions.\n\nA similar pattern emerged under President Obama, when Lanny Breuer, the new head of the criminal division, came on board with a mandate for aggressive investigation and prosecution of criminal activity on Wall Street. But after a series of early setbacks, including the loss of a case against Bear Stearns executives accused of misleading investors, as well as a cutback in investigative resources and funding, the Justice Department pulled back and focused more on settlements.\n\nThe recurring complaints from Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other prominent liberal lawmakers is that the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal regulators have treated Wall Street executives with kid gloves in the aftermath of the financial meltdown and never sought to punish top executives with prison time.\n\nOn Thursday, Sanders\u2019 Democratic presidential campaign released a new ad in Iowa criticizing Goldman Sachs for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. Many viewed the ad as an implicit attack on former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and accepting $2.2 million in speaking fees from Goldman over the past decade.\n\n\"How does Wall Street get away with it? Millions in campaign contributions and speaking fees,\" the narrator of the ad declares. \"Our economy works for Wall Street because it\u2019s rigged by Wall Street. And that\u2019s the problem. As long as Washington is bought and paid for, we can\u2019t build an economy that works for people.\"\n\nRelated: Presidential candidate Sanders takes aim at Wall Street, Clinton in speech\n\nWarren was turning up the heat as well with an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the Obama administration for weak-kneed enforcement policies on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cThe failure to adequately punish corporations or their executives when they break the law undermines the foundation of this great country,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cJustice cannot mean a prison sentence for a teenager who steals a car, but nothing more than a sideways glance at a CEO who quietly engineers the theft of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nWith Congress and the administration considering proposals for reforming the criminal justice system this year, Warren\u2018s office on Friday issue a 13-page report, \u201cRigged Justice: How Weak Enforcement Lets Corporate Offenders off Easy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t Weep for Wall Street: Banks Won More Than They Lost This Week\n\nThe study charges that the justice system is tilted in favor of corporations and executives who commit crimes, and it highlights 20 high profile cases that back up Warren\u2019s assertions. The administration insisted it was making important progress by pursuing civil actions against white-collar scofflaws.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to undervalue what we did with the banks,\u201d former Attorney General Eric Holder told the Financial Times. \u201cGiven the nature of the penalties that were extracted, given the interactions that we had with people at the banks, with those attorneys who represented the banks, I think the cultures have changed.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department announced in September that it would place more emphasis on taking to court individuals responsible for corporate crime. With so much blatant wrongdoing to choose from on Wall Street, within the energy production and auto industries and elsewhere, it\u2019s hard to imagine federal prosecutors would have trouble finding likely targets.\n\nHowever, one challenge frequently facing federal authorities in these matters is proving criminal intent. Some experts say it is often much easier to get corporate executives to fess up to mistakes under a civil proceeding than to meet federal standards for proving criminal intent.\n\nMoreover, some influential Republicans currently are attempting to amend a bill designed to reduce mandatory sentences for low-level drug offenders to make it harder for federal prosecutors to prove criminal intent \u2013 or mens rea \u2013 in cases involving suspected white-collar criminals.\n\nRelated: Sanders Doubles Down on Breaking Up the Big Banks\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Orrin Hatch (R-UT) said it was necessary to protect citizens from being prosecuted for crimes they did not realize they were committing. But Warren and other Democrats argue that such a change would make it even more unlikely that the Justice Department would ever go after corporate executives on criminal charges.\n\n\u201cIf adopted, this amendment would severely weaken the already anemic enforcement of federal white-collar criminal laws,\u201d Warren said in her report.\n\nHere are ten examples of what Warren contends constitute \u201crigged justice\u201d:\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s dishonest rating. In February 2015, S&P agreed to pay a $1.3 billion civil settlement on charges that it engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in the mortgage market by misrepresenting the true credit risks of residential mortgages.\n\nConspiracy of Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays, UBS AG, and Royal Bank of Scotland. In May 2015, those banks agreed to pay a combined $5.6 billion settlement for conspiring to manipulate exchange rates in a way that made the banks billions of dollars in profits at the expense of clients and investors.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s rigging of LIBOR. In April 2015, the wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank agreed to pay a $775 million settlement in response to charges that it rigged the London Interbank Offer Rate \u2013 a worldwide benchmark for roughly $10 trillion in loans.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s shady marketing. Two affiliates of Citigroup agreed in August 2015 to pay almost $180 million to the SEC to settle allegations that they defrauded investors with risky, highly leveraged bonds in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The shady tactics cost investors an estimated $2 billion \u2013 or more than ten times the amount of the settlement.\n\nJP Morgan Conflicts of Interest. The major bank agreed in December 2015 to pay more than $300 million to settle charges that it was involved in \u201cnumerous conflicts of interest in how it managed customers\u2019 money over a half decade.\u201d\n\nThe Ripoff by Education Management Corporation. The second largest for-profit education company in the country illegally paid recruiters to use high-pressure tactics to enroll students in programs financed with federal student loans and grants. EDMC settled for $95 million with the Justice Department in November 2015.\n\nNavient and Student Loan Servicers\u2019 scheme. The company, formerly known as Sallie Mae, agreed to pay nearly $100 million in May 2014 for intentionally and willfully violating military service members\u2019 rights under the Service members Civil Relief Act.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019s deadly coverup. The auto giant engaged in a years-long cover-up of an ignition switch problem in many of its vehicles that resulted in at least 124 deaths and 275 injuries. Yet in September 2015, the Justice Department deferred prosecution and settled for a $900 million fine that amounted to less than one percent of GM\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nHonda\u2019s Airbag Settlement. The Japanese automobile manufacturer was fined $70 million by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in January 2015 for failing to reveal more than 1,700 reports of deaths, injuries and other \u201cearly warning\u201d information to NHTSA.\n\nBP Deepwater Horizon\u2019s massive oil spill. In the wake of one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history, BP in October 2015 settled with the Justice Department and five states for the pollution of water and beaches arising from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The settlement required the company to pay $20.8 billion, but \u201cit was structured in a way that allowed BP to deduct $15 billion of the payments from the company\u2019s income for tax purposes, reducing the impact of the civil penalty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs, the banking behemoth, agreed to pay $5 billion in c", "title": "Warren Demands Tough Criminal Action Against Corporate Scofflaws", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/29/Warren-Demands-Tough-Criminal-Action-against-Corporate-Scofflaws", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-clinton-warren_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/29/Warren-Demands-Tough-Criminal-Action-against-Corporate-Scofflaws", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-clinton-warren_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs, the banking behemoth, agreed to pay $5 billion in c", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93f2\"", "article_summary": "\"Our economy works for Wall Street because it\u2019s rigged by Wall Street.\nFrom then on, the Justice Department sharply increased the number of deferred and non-prosecution agreements and pursued fewer criminal prosecutions.\nRelated: Presidential candidate Sanders takes aim at Wall Street, Clinton in speechWarren was turning up the heat as well with an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the Obama administration for weak-kneed enforcement policies on Wall Street.\nMost notably, the Justice Department didn\u2019t bring criminal charges against individual officials of the bank, and no one will be going to the slammer.\nBut Warren and other Democrats argue that such a change would make it even more unlikely that the Justice Department would ever go after corporate executives on criminal charges."}
