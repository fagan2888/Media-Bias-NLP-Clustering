Forrest Gump ran. And Ed Flemister, well, he flew.\n\n\u201cIt was my magic carpet ride,\u201d he says of the planes that were the centerpiece of an improbable adventure-packed life. \u201cMaybe more than 30,000 hours in all.\u201d\n\nHis passion for aviation gave him a ticket to see the world, but so did his other professions. He was an inventor, a mining engineer, a shrimper, a crop duster, a fisherman, a portrait painter and a photographer.\n\nSpend a few hours with Flemister, and he\u2019ll spin tales of harrowing experiences: two plane crashes, a shipwreck and a factory accident that cost him three fingers.\n\nThen he changes gears and slows the pace. He tenderly reveals how he was grounded in true love. He married his high-school sweetheart and they were together 68 years, until she took her last breath in his arms.\n\nNow he lives alone, missing his beloved Wanda but moving forward.\n\nThe Plant City man shares a snippet of his life through Jan. 31 in an exhibit called \u201cThe Last Alaskan Bush Pilot\u201d at the John F. Germany Public Library in downtown Tampa, where a few dozen of his vintage paintings and old photographs are on display.\n\nHe says there just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to finish all of his projects.\n\nMost of the time, he\u2019s hunkered down at one of his two computers. Three times a week, he works out at the gym. He can\u2019t fly anymore, but he gets around town in his 1974 Volkswagen Beetle. When he finishes restoring the 1961 Porsche he\u2019s owned since it came off the factory line, he\u2019ll drive that.\n\nA meticulous man, Flemister doesn\u2019t appear to be in any rush. At 97, he\u2019s thoroughly convinced he still has plenty of time left. He pulls out his driver\u2019s license as proof: it doesn\u2019t expire until 2018.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always thinking five years out,\u201d says his son, Jim, a retired advertising production manager. \u201cAnd you know what? He\u2019ll get there. Because this is a man who doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nv v v\n\nEd Flemister was born on Aug. 24, 1916, on the Blackfoot Indian Reservation in Idaho, exact location undetermined. His birth certificate states only: \u201cDown between the two rivers.\u201d\n\nHis father was a farming contractor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much,\u201d Flemister says. However, he did have a pet coyote. After six years, his mother, who had grown weary of the wind blowing through their two-room house, announced she was moving to Spokane.\n\nLife got better in the big city. His father got a job for $2.50 an hour in the big sawmill, then worked his way up to machinist at a dairy plant.\n\nAnd Flemister discovered his love for the big flying machines in the sky. He would leave home early in the morning, dashing through fields, scaling fences and climbing over an apricot tree to get to the airport five miles away.\n\nHe would sprawl out on the grass, stare up at the planes coming and going, and dream of the day he would pilot his own.\n\nThough the young Flemister was a voracious reader \u2014 he says he read the entire World Book encyclopedia set in two years \u2014 his grades were just so-so. He, too, became a machinist after graduation, earning 11 cents an hour. Eventually, he became a millwright, working his way up to 35 cents. He was settling in.\n\nBut fate had other plans. One early morning, a co-worker switched on the machine Flemister was oiling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this head with four knives I\u2019m working on,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThen the machine clicks on and pow! I pull out my hand and it looks like spaghetti.\u201d Only the pinkie and the thumb survived on his right hand.\n\nThe company awarded him $900. He knew what he wanted to do with it. He put down $600 and bought his very first plane, a J2 Taylor Cub.\n\nWith his missing fingers, Flemister was told the Federal Aviation Administration would never grant him a pilot\u2019s license. That didn\u2019t deter him. He talked a flight instructor into taking him up for a few short rides. After that, he took the controls and taught himself.\n\n\u201cI got the hang of it after a few forced landings,\u201d he says, chuckling.\n\nA stubborn man, he kept badgering the FAA to give him the official test. Finally, he got his transport license, which allowed him to start a passenger and freight service.\n\nAnd so, the magic carpet ride began. Flemister would own five planes and a myriad of aviation jobs.\n\nDuring the World War II years, when personal air service was grounded for security reasons, he found ways to keep flying. He worked for the Army Corps of Engineers, flying workers between Canada and Alaska as they surveyed and carved the 1,390-mile Alaska Highway out of the wilderness. He piloted float planes for Star Airlines (now Alaska Airlines), dealing with \u201cunforgiving rivers\u201d and the threat of grizzly bears. And he flew a mail plane that bore an unfortunate resemblance to the Japanese Zero, which caused a bit of a dust-up in Anchorage, given the wartime tension.\n\n\u201cPeople on the ground saw me 12,000 feet up, going 300 miles an hour. When I set down at Merrill Field, I was greeted by a whole squadron in Jeeps with machine guns,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s accustomed to close calls. There was that crash in the Alaskan wild that damaged his plane\u2019s wings, knocked off the exhaust and bent the propeller. He fixed it himself with heavy-duty tape and 5-quart oil cans, though the return flight was pretty shaky.\n\nYears later, when he moved to South America to work for a Bethlehem Steel mining operation in Venezuela, he had a fiery crash in the Amazon where his plane got caught in the towering canopy of a Saba tree. He managed to slide painfully down the massive trunk, then spent five days trying to find his way out of the jungle. He got his water from the morning condensation on the thick foliage and ate grubs for protein. After walking in circles for a few days, he finally put his engineer\u2019s mind to a plan that would get him out.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to survive a plane crash just to die in there,\u201d he says.\n\nHe had another brush with death on a solo winter fishing trip in Prince William Sound. A fierce wind picked up, sending his wooden vessel into a rocky passageway where he beached it. Then the pounding surf broke the boat to pieces, leaving only an engine.\n\nA Coast Guard cutter happened to be passing by at the moment he was flashing his mirror at the setting sun. A crew member caught a glimpse of the light. They got as close as they could and tossed a life jacket.\n\n\u201cGoing into that water was like getting hit in the chest with a sledgehammer,\u201d he says, shuddering.\n\nv v v\n\nWanda never cared much for flying. Still, she proved to be a great partner for his peripatetic life. She was 15 when she fell for the lanky 18-year-old Flemister, whose destiny as a world traveler was yet to be determined. She had to accept the reality of her husband\u2019s risky career, often standing in airfields counting the planes as they arrived.\n\nOnly when she saw his aircraft coming from the distance did she feel at peace.\n\n\u201cShe would integrate herself into whatever came next,\u201d he says of his longtime bride. \u201cShe was a poet, and she was good with people. And she handled things. I handed her every check I earned, and I could trust her.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, while living in Idaho where Flemister worked for a garnet mining company, the couple built a recovery machine he designed that separates black sand from precious metals. To this day, he is convinced that machine could turn a mining venture \u201cinto the biggest operation in the world in just two years.\u201d It now sits in a warehouse in Oregon, as he considers ways to market it from his Plant City home.\n\nJim, their only child, moved his father here when Wanda died nearly three years ago. He says he didn\u2019t realize just how unusual their life was until he was older. \u201cMy dad was just a guy making a living, that\u2019s all,\u201d he says. In fact, he didn\u2019t realize how many places they lived until he joined the Navy and needed a list of all his previous addresses.\n\n\u201cMy mom put it together, and it came to 33,\u201d he says.\n\nNow his father lives nearby \u2014 close enough to keep an eye on him, but far enough to give him his independence. These days, Flemister concentrates on assembling a lifetime of photos he took on his far-flung adventures with an extensive collection of vintage film cameras. His favorite subject is women, close up and personal: a waitress in Peru, a Denver model and a young Guatemalan girl are among the subjects in his display at the library. For current projects, he grudgingly uses a digital camera.\n\n\u201cYou have to move with the times,\u201d he says. His ever-present iPad and iPod prove he\u2019s not just giving lip service to progress.\n\nThe downside to living so long is \u201cyou outlive everyone,\u201d Flemister says. And from a physical standpoint, growing old can be bothersome. He uses a hearing aid and sometimes depends on a cane for support when he walks. He shuns red meat, never smoked a cigarette in his life and rarely drinks.\n\nBut on the positive side, he says, these are the greatest years of all.\n\n\u201cI really started to learn things after 85,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still learning every day. You\u2019ve gathered all this knowledge and you can put it to work.\u201d\n\nHe stops for a moment to collect his thoughts. Then Flemister goes back to what he loves best.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you another story,\u201d he says.\n\nmbearden@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7613", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 19 Jan 2014 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "Walter Mitty dreamed.
