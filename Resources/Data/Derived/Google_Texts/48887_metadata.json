Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) that really brought it home.\n\nLummis discussed her husband\u2019s death for the first time publicly and sought remind Gruber that his self-described \u201cglib\u201d words and the law that stemmed from them impact real people.\n\nShe said that she and her husband were both covered through insurance under the Obamacare exchange, but glitches in the system had seen them be dropped multiple times. Her husband had been having chest pains around this same time that they had only sporadic coverage.\n\n\u201cOn October 24, the week before election, my husband went to sleep and never woke up. He had a massive heart attack in his sleep at age 65. A perfectly, by all accounts, healthy man. Come to find out, in a conversation with his physician after he died, he chose not to have one of the tests, the last tests, his doctor told him to have. This happened to coincide with the time that we were told that we were not covered by Obamacare. I\u2019m not telling you that my husband died because of Obamacare. He died because he had a massive heart attack in his sleep.But I am telling you that in the time that he was having tests by a physician and was told we were not covered by Obamacare that he then decided not to have the last test the doctor asked him to have,\u201d Lummis shared.\n\n\u201cLet me suggest that there may be a decline in participation and that it may not be to the benefit to the American people. I want to suggest that, regardless of what happened to me personally, that there have been so many glitches in the passage and implementation of Obamacare that have real-life consequences on peoples\u2019 lives. The so-called glibness that has been referenced today has direct consequences for real American people. So get over your damn glibness.\u201d\n\nWatch the powerful clip below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via Screenshot While much of the House committee hearing on Jonathan Gruber was focused on his \u201cstupidity\u201d comments and his character, it was Rep.
