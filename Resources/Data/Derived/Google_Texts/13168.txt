Cruz: The "Obama Economy" Is Denying A "Fair Opportunity To Achieve The American Dream"

Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz talks about the economy and the state of the American dream in an interview with FOX Business Network's Trish Regan on Thursday:





CRUZ: It’s not news that Democrats are scaremongering, they’re attacking Republicans. And it’s not news that the mainstream media will amplify those charges. Here’s the simple reality: you know who’s been hurt the most under the Obama economy? It’s young people, it’s Hispanics, it’s African-Americans, it’s single moms. It’s people who are struggling. To the single mom who’s waiting tables, who’s had her hours forcibly reduced to 28 or 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week, that is a real hardship.



You know, Trish, 3.7 million women have entered poverty under the Obama economy. The median income for women has dropped $733 dollars an hour. I agree with Governor Bush that our number one priority needs to be economic growth. We need to get back to historic levels, 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent growth. Reagan in ’84, we had 7.2 percent growth! That lifts millions of people out of poverty and into prosperity. That’s what I’m campaigning on -- tax reform and regulatory reform so people like my dad, washing dishes as penniless immigrants, can have a fair opportunity to achieve the American Dream. That’s what the Obama economy is denying them.
