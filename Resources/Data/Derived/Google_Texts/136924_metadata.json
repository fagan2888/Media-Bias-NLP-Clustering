That\u2019s because he blew a new gasket in the reputation of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. In two separate segments.\n\nIn a bit about Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist whose recently surfaced remarks about the passage of Obamacare have created a fresh crisis for the Obama administration, he cited Pelosi\u2019s apparent selective amnesia. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Pelosi responded when asked recently about Gruber\u2019s comments \u2014 even though Pelosi had cited Gruber as an authority on health-care economics. \u201cCan you ever not disappoint us?\u201d asked Stewart.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she didn't know who Jonathan Gruber is, but she spoke about him in 2009 in footage surfaced by CSPAN. (CSPAN)\n\nThat jab was a caress compared with the treatment accorded to Pelosi in a separate segment, this time on her decision to deny a request from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) to vote by proxy in House leadership elections because she is pregnant. The minority leader defended the decision by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going to establish a situation where you\u2019re going to determine who has a note from the doctor that\u2019s valid \u2026 It\u2019s really a place we shouldn\u2019t go down.\u201d\n\nHere, Stewart\u2019s \u201cbig-time liberal\u201d leanings put him at odds with the House\u2019s leading Democrat, and he feasted. His takedown of Pelosi\u2019s denial of a pregnant woman\u2019s vote in House Democratic elections proceeds in merciless fashion. Availing himself of Pelosi\u2019s trail of accomplishments over the years, he documented how she has established herself on key issues that bear on the Duckworth situation. For instance: The National Partnership for Women and Families, noted Stewart, celebrated Pelosi\u2019s advocacy for \u201cworking women.\u201d Also highlighted by Stewart: Pelosi said at an event for the Voting Rights Act, \u201cThe right to vote must be the cornerstone of our democracy.\u201d\n\nStewart: \u201cYou\u2019re a recognized champion of working women and voting rights.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the rip was easy: \u201cYou rejected, you\u2019re suppressing the vote of a minority pregnant woman who is a wounded war veteran. She is everything you supposedly stand for stuffed into one individual. She is a Democratic demographic tur-Duckworth,\u201d said the host.\n\nTo explain why Pelosi would stiff Duckworth on this front, Stewart showed footage of pundits \u2014 including Washington Post reporter Ed O\u2019Keefe \u2014 explaining the political backdrop: Duckworth and Pelosi are at odds over who should get the top Democratic seat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Which prompted Stewart to say, \u201cAnd that\u2019s how the precedent was set, that a woman leader can be every bit as politically craven as her male counterparts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A liberal commentator, yes.
