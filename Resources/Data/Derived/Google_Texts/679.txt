St. Louis-based healthcare provider Ascension Health will acquire U.S. Health and Life Insurance Co. for $50 million, according to documents filed with the Michigan Department of Financial and Insurance Services, a move that boosts its services in population health.

Ascension Health and Trinity Health own Together Health Network LLC, a physician-led clinically integrated network. The acquisition of U.S. Health will provide Together Health with the ability to participate in the state’s health insurance exchange with its narrow provider network, according to Crain’s Detroit Business.
