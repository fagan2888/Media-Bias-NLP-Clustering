(Associated Press/Seth Perlman)\n\nThe Trumpkins put their faith in a charlatan, and now they are discovering that, well, he\u2019s a charlatan. In the last 48 hours or so we learn:\n\nHe might just raise taxes, after all. The supply-siders who swooned over his $10T-debt-creating tax plan and didn\u2019t bother with his trade and entitlement policies (straight liberal) may have been snookered. (Oh, and he\u2019s flip-flopped on raising the minimum wage.)\n\nLike an owner of a cheesy casino haggling with the banks, he thinks he can negotiate down the sovereign debt of the United States. No, really. (Question: If we aren\u2019t going to pay off all our debt do we have enough pennies in the couch to keep NATO running?)\n\nThe Republican presidential front-runner reversed course on a whole load of issues \u2013 all on May 4. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe populists who believed he was going to self-fund and avoid corrupting influences? Not only is that not happening but his finance director is mainly a Democratic money man. And he worked for Goldman Sachs. And he skipped out just before a bankruptcy sunk a film company in which he invested clients\u2019 money. (\u201cWith Relativity\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last week, those high hopes have been dashed, and Mnuchin has been left in a particularly uncomfortable position. The money-man and fellow investors in a Dune Capital fund are said to have lost as much as $80 million \u2014 equity that is almost certain to be lost for good, said two sources familiar with the situation. And disgruntled Relativity investors privately are questioning how a bank Mnuchin once headed \u2013OneWest Bank of Pasadena \u2013 was allowed by Relativity to drain $50 million from the studio just weeks prior to the July 30 insolvency filing.\u201d) Birds of a feather, I guess. Well, joke\u2019s on the populists I suppose.\n\nAnd the week is not yet over!\n\nSome keen observers \u2014 really just those possessing common sense \u2014 are hardly surprised. David McIntosh, president of Club for Growth, won\u2019t support Trump, although a spokesman clarifies he is not part of the #NeverTrump movement. The spokesman says, \u201cFor months we\u2019ve said that Trump is a liberal who will raise taxes. The so-called policies on his website will be proven to be nothing more than false advertising.\u201d Score one for CFG.\n\nThis would be terribly funny if it were not so terribly predictable and ruinous for the GOP and the country. Just as Trump University students allege, voters believed what Trump told them (at least what he told them at one particular moment). Being honest folk, they took him at his word. And within hours, he\u2019s reversed on a major selling point (self-funding) and a handful of not-insignificant debt. We suspect this is only the beginning. None of his \u201cpositions\u201d other than trade protectionism and expelling illegal immigrants seem heartfelt, so wait for changes on abortion, guns, Obamacare and more.\n\nLike those of most feeders at the trough of crony capitalism, Trump\u2019s political instincts \u2014 to the extent he has them \u2014 run in the direction of bigger government. His greatest failing is not that he is a garden-variety liberal (what policy differences will he wind up having with Hillary Clinton?), it is that he is unstable and unreliable \u2014 or as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) put it, \u201ca pathological liar.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think RNC delegates can sue for fraud like Trump University students did, but at this rate they might be in favor of changing some convention rules. If Trump is going to change his entire persona, it seems only fair the RNC should change its convention rules to allow delegates to consider if they are bound by votes cast for fraudulent positions and empty promises.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP primary turns out to have been another scam", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP primary turns out to have been another scam", "title": "Treacherous territory: Navigating the Trump terrain", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/05/treacherous-territory-navigating-the-trump-terrain/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/05/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Trump_America_Trumped-0a03d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/05/treacherous-territory-navigating-the-trump-terrain/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "trump and taxes, trump and self-funding, trump and democratic fundraiser", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "trump and taxes, trump and self-funding, trump and democratic fundraiser"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe134c\"", "article_summary": "Just as Trump University students allege, voters believed what Trump told them (at least what he told them at one particular moment).\nput it, \u201ca pathological liar.\u201dI don\u2019t think RNC delegates can sue for fraud like Trump University students did, but at this rate they might be in favor of changing some convention rules.\nThe spokesman says, \u201cFor months we\u2019ve said that Trump is a liberal who will raise taxes.\nDavid McIntosh, president of Club for Growth, won\u2019t support Trump, although a spokesman clarifies he is not part of the #NeverTrump movement.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Terre Haute, Ind., on May 1."}
