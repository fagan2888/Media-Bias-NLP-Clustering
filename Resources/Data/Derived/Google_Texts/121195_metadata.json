An independent health policy research program study released Wednesday showed all of his predictions about Obamacare were wrong. Way wrong. Wrong on every single fearmongering prediction and claim they made.\n\nUnder Obamacare, nearly 17 million have gotten insurance coverage since the fall of 2013. Seventeen MILLION.\n\nThe Rand analysis of their study revealed the facts:\n\nInsurance coverage has increased across all types of insurance since the major provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act took effect, with a total of 16.9 million people becoming newly enrolled through February 2015, according to a new RAND Corporation study. Researchers estimate that from September 2013 to February 2015, 22.8 million Americans became newly insured and 5.9 million lost coverage, for a net of 16.9 million newly insured Americans.\n\nRepublicans are running on taking that insurance away?\n\nRepublicans like to claim that it\u2019s all Medicaid expansion. Survey says, wrong again.\n\nAmong those newly gaining coverage, 9.6 million people enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans, followed by Medicaid (6.5 million), the individual marketplaces (4.1 million), nonmarketplace individual plans (1.2 million) and other insurance sources (1.5 million).\n\nAnd remember how Republicans sounded the hysteria alarms that Obama was ruining their insurance and nobody would get to keep their insurance?\n\nThe study also estimates that 125.2 million Americans \u2014 about 80 percent of the nonelderly population that had insurance in September 2013 \u2014 experienced no change in the source of insurance during the period, according to findings published online by the journal Health Affairs.\n\nRepublicans said Obamacare would cause private employers to stop offering insurance. Survey says, wrong again:\n\nRAND researchers say the findings that the biggest gain in coverage was from employer-sponsored insurance runs counter to predictions that many employers may quit offering insurance in response to the Affordable Care Act and suggests that regardless of whether that occurs, employer-sponsored coverage will remain the nation\u2019s major source of health insurance coverage.\n\nOn Sunday, this happened:\n\nChuck Todd confronted Boehner about his wrong Obamacare predictions that fewer people would have health care under the ACA and that Obamacare would kill jobs. Boehner replied, \u201cObamacare made it harder for employers to hire people. The economy expands and as a result you\u2019re going to have more employees because businesses have to. But you can ask any employer in America and ask them if Obamacare has made it harder to hire employees because it\u2019s a fact. Um, yeah. Do you know why there\u2019re more people insured? Because a lot more people are on Medicaid, and you know giving people Medicaid insurance is almost like giving them nothing. Because there aren\u2019t, you can\u2019t find a doctor that will see Medicaid patients, and so where do they end up? In the same place, they used to end up, in the emergency room.\u201d\n\nWe already debunked the Speaker\u2019s first point about Obamacare killing jobs. This is not happening. The only people killing jobs are Republicans, due to the sequester and their refusal to pass any jobs legislation.\n\nA poll by the National Association of Business Economics (NABE) that surveyed four sectors of the economy found that seventy-five percent of business owners said that the ACA has not impacted their hiring practices. An additional 85% said that they didn\u2019t expect the ACA to impact their hiring practices in the future.\n\nIn fact, President Obama has set a record for the longest stretch of private sector job growth of any modern president. So much nope. The public sector is suffering job losses due to the Republican sequester but also due to state Republicans slashing funds.\n\nNone of the predictions and claims Republicans \u2014 and indeed our media \u2014 ran with for years have come true. A \u201cglitch\u201d did not stop 17 million people from getting coverage.\n\nThe air leaking out of the GOP\u2019s ACA lies balloon, and the Republican Party is in for a rough landing if they continue to insist on repealing Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An independent health policy research program study showed all of his predictions about Obamacare were wrong.
