(Photo: Kelsey Kremer/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nWhen you go to the caucus, if you go, on Monday night, look to your left and your right and imagine the people who are not there, the ones not participating in this so-called great example of \u201cparticipatory democracy.\u201d You will not see the voter who has too many health issues, the shift worker, the emergency services worker, the voter with social anxiety, the voter who got sick the last time they caucused, the voter who wants to vote in private, the abused woman who is still in hiding, the snow bird who is gone every winter, the voter on a business trip, the person in the hospital and the voter without child care.\n\nWe have encountered all these people while out canvassing. All of these people could have participated in selecting our presidential candidates if some form of early or absentee voting were available. Now some folks are worried that we would lose our first-in-the-nation status if we don\u2019t do this caucus thing. Maybe they can be separated. And if not, is being first more important than disenfranchising large groups of voters?\n\n\u2014 Suzanne Zilber and Tom Corrieri, Ames\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1WSG5zd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This so-called great example of \u201cparticipatory democracy\" disenfranchises large groups of voters", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "This so-called great example of \u201cparticipatory democracy\" disenfranchises large groups of voters", "title": "Many Iowa voters are unable to caucus", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/caucus/2016/01/29/many-iowa-voters-unable-caucus/79490506/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This so-called great example of \u201cparticipatory democracy\" disenfranchises large groups of voters", "title": "Many Iowa voters are unable to caucus", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51f76f95370e137327fca42dfcb01d748c95eea8/c=0-0-3840-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Iowa Caucuses History", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Iowa Caucuses History", "title": "Many Iowa voters are unable to caucus", "author": "Suzanne Zilber and Tom Corrieri, Ames", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers/caucus", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91a00a138be56d1d04c921a094b68b1b2e0b8dca/c=891-0-3771-3840/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e90ff773555ca7614c639884ae80f85da195ff6/c=0-0-3840-3840/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed43d23f836e8638496a3d04092d466af92fa7c1/c=0-0-5107-3840/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4736819924ae2188641d497937481ce120827aed/c=0-590-5753-3840&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-01-29T18:12:30.640000-06:00", "shorthed": "Many Iowa voters are unable to caucus", "articleid": 79490506, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f6e86d405145b3129ec4bf3d42891afa6b4aaaf/c=0-590-5753-3840/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f3eb72f05906acddc806814dfc92e7057df60032/c=1805-0-3955-3840/local/-/media/2016/01/28/IAGroup/DesMoines/635896107067725551-FightFor15-KK-03.JPG"}}}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo A group of fast-food workers, home care and child care workers, and community supporters march through the streets of Des Moines on Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016, to the steps of the Iowa Events Center where the final GOP debate before the Iowa Caucus was being held.\nNow some folks are worried that we would lose our first-in-the-nation status if we don\u2019t do this caucus thing.\nAnd if not, is being first more important than disenfranchising large groups of voters?\nAll of these people could have participated in selecting our presidential candidates if some form of early or absentee voting were available.\nThe workers were fighting for a higher minimum wage and a union."}
