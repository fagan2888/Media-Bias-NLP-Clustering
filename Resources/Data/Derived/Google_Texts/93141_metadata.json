How is the rapist or the witness allowed to feel he has exercised some masculine privilege when, in fact, he has just violated the cardinal rule of masculinity?\u201d\n\nThat \u201ccardinal rule\u201d? \u201cBe respectful of women [emphasis Cohen\u2019s].\u201d\n\nHere, one might expect Cohen to offer his unique insight as a man who notoriously has not always respected women. In 1998, the Post found that Cohen had displayed \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d toward 23-year-old editorial aide Devon Spurgeon, creating a \u201chostile working environment\u201d with crude and sexually suggestive remarks. When the Lewinsky scandal was at its height, Cohen probed Spurgeon\u2019s brain on the question of whether oral sex constituted \u201ccasual sex,\u201d a discussion other Post staffers deemed \u201coffensive,\u201d according to the New York Observer. Cohen also told Spurgeon that she \u201clooked good in black\u201d and, on at least one occasion, asked her to \u201cstand up and turn around.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Post columnist wonders why culture devalues women -- but doesn't acknowledge his own sordid history", "author": "Luke Brinker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Washington Post columnist wonders why culture devalues women -- but doesn't acknowledge his own sordid history", "title": "Richard Cohen\u2019s latest disgrace: Noted creep has some thoughts on sexual creeps", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/25/richard_cohens_latest_disgrace_noted_creep_has_some_thoughts_on_sexual_creeps/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/richard_cohen21.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington Post columnist wonders why culture devalues women -- but doesn't acknowledge his own sordid history", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/richard_cohen21.jpg", "title": "Richard Cohen\u2019s latest disgrace: Noted creep has some thoughts on sexual creeps", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Richard Cohen\u2019s latest disgrace: Noted creep has some thoughts on sexual creeps", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, columnists, political pundits, Rape, Rape Culture, Richard Cohen, Rolling Stone, Sexual assault, Sexual Harassment, University of Virginia, Washington Post", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c60\"", "article_summary": "The latest entrant to this discussion is Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, who asks today what, in God\u2019s name, is happening on America\u2019s campuses.\nTopics: columnists, political pundits, Rape, Rape Culture, Richard Cohen, Rolling Stone, Sexual assault, Sexual Harassment, University of Virginia, Washington Post, Social News, Media News, Politics NewsLast week, Rolling Stone published a horrific, infuriating account detailing an alleged 2012 frat house gang rape at the University of Virginia.\nCohen also told Spurgeon that she \u201clooked good in black\u201d and, on at least one occasion, asked her to \u201cstand up and turn around.\u201d\n\u201cBe respectful of women [emphasis Cohen\u2019s].\u201dHere, one might expect Cohen to offer his unique insight as a man who notoriously has not always respected women.\n\u201cHow can rape thrive?\u201d Cohen wonders."}
