David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, says he'll introduce several bills.\n\n- The Flood Insurance Premium Parity Act (FIPPA), which would extend the reforms of the federal flood insurance program to business properties and owner-occupied second homes, ensuring that these properties receive the same relief already provided to residential properties and single-family homes. FIPPA would resolve the unequal treatment of these properties under the Biggert-Waters Act.\n\n- The Alternative Maximum Tax Act, which would create a maximum level of taxation that any one individual can be subjected to from all levels of government combined \u2013 federal, state, municipalities, and other taxing authorities. Under this legislation, no individual would be responsible for a level of personal taxation greater than 50% of their income, and Jolly\u2019s commitment is to then work to significantly reduce that threshold.\n\n- The Patient Freedom Act, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and restore the freedom of all Americans to decide what health care coverage is right for them and their family.\n\nJolly said he would also work on budget issues, \"adding political candidates to the national Do Not Call Registry, protecting recreational fisherman from increasing government overreach, fighting for a full \u2018choice card\u2019 for all veterans to receive healthcare at facilities of their own choosing, reducing VA and Social Security Administration benefit application backlogs, strengthening the 1033 military surplus equipment program, and advancing research in areas related to melanoma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and marine sciences.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 114th Congress begins tomrorow and Rep.
