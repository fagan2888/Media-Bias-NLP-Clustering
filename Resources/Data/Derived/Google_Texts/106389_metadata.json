As a public defender in Philadelphia, he provided legal representation for people who could not afford to hire a lawyer. And as a federal magistrate judge, he led a program that helped formerly incarcerated people get the education and job training they needed to have a successful life after prison.\n\nRestrepo\u2019s confirmation would be a step forward for Latino representation in the courts. As an immigrant from Columbia who became a citizen over 20 years ago, he would be the first Latino judge from Pennsylvania to serve on the 3rd Circuit Court and only the second Latino judge ever to serve on that court. Across the country, Latinos are severely underrepresented on circuit courts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike agree that Restrepo is the right choice to be the next 3rd Circuit judge. Both Pennsylvania senators, Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey Bob CaseyLawmakers blast poultry, meat industries over worker injuries GOP chairman sees funding deal soon on medical cures bill Overnight Healthcare: House takes first step on opioids bills MORE, came out strongly in favor of Restrepo when Obama nominated him.

He said, \u201cThere is little risk of the public outrage\u201d if Republicans use judicial nominations like that of Restrepo as \u201cleverage\u201d on the president\u2019s executive actions. But we won\u2019t let Toomey, Grassley, Levey, or the GOP get away with that.\n\nIt\u2019s not only harmful for Republicans to refuse to confirm a judge as well qualified as Restrepo, it also sends the message yet again that Republicans don\u2019t care about the priorities of our community. Latinos deserve better representation on influential courts, and there\u2019s no good reason for Toomey and his Republican allies to continue to hold up Restrepo\u2019s confirmation. It\u2019s high time for them to get to work and confirm the exceedingly qualified L. Felipe Restrepo to be the next judge on the 3rd Circuit Court.\n\nHuerta is a civil rights leader and serves on the board of People For the American Way.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "It sends the message yet again that Republicans don\u2019t care about the priorities of the Latino community.", "description": "It sends the message yet again that Republicans don\u2019t care about the priorities of the Latino community.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "It sends the message yet again that Republicans don\u2019t care about the priorities of the Latino community.", "title": "Toomey and Republicans: Do your job, confirm Restrepo", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/241375-toomey-and-republicans-do-your-job-confirm-restrepo", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/241375-toomey-and-republicans-do-your-job-confirm-restrepo", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-08T17:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Dolores Huerta", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Charles Grassley, Bob Casey,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-08T17:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/241375-toomey-and-republicans-do-your-job-confirm-restrepo", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "It sends the message yet again that Republicans don\u2019t care about the priorities of the Latino community.", "card": "summary", "title": "Toomey and Republicans: Do your job, confirm Restrepo"}, "dcterms.title": "Toomey and Republicans: Do your job, confirm Restrepo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d78\"", "article_summary": "Republicans and Democrats alike agree that Restrepo is the right choice to be the next 3rd Circuit judge.\nIt\u2019s high time for them to get to work and confirm the exceedingly qualified L.
