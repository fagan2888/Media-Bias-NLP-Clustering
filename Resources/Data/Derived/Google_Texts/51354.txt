One of the Arkansas lawmakers who created his state's influential "Private Option" Medicaid expansion alternative is working on a proposal for revamping the state's public health insurance exchange program.

State Sen. David Sanders, R-Little Rock, wants to use Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) Section 1332 — a provision that lets a state propose sweeping changes in PPACA exchange and commercial health insurance market rules for its market — to get Arkansas a more market-oriented, less rules-driven exchange.
