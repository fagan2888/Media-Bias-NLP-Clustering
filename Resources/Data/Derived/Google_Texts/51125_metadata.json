Indeed, that was the alleged 10-year gross cost of Obamacare\u2019s coverage provisions, according to the Congressional Budget Office (see Table 3), when Harry Reid, Mark Pryor, Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Al Franken, Mark Udall, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Begich, Mark Warner, and the rest of the Democrats rammed President Obama\u2019s signature legislation through the Senate on Christmas Eve without a single Republican vote. That 12-digit price-tag was widely cited by the New York Times and other sympathetic outlets, who treated it as gospel, even as conservatives observed that it was clearly a sham number.\n\nWell, now the CBO is out with a new report on Obamacare\u2019s costs, and\u2014sure enough\u2014its 10-year price-tag now eclipses $2 trillion. To be more exact, the CBO now projects (see Table B-1) that the 10-year gross cost of Obamacare\u2019s coverage provisions will be a cool $2,004,000,000,000.00.\n\nAnd what will all of that taxpayer money\u2014funneling to Washington, D.C. or to compliant insurance companies\u2014buy? Well, back in 2009, we were told that Obamacare would reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million people, leaving just 24 million without insurance (see Table 3). Now those numbers have essentially flipped around, as we\u2019re now told that it will reduce the number of uninsured by just 25 million, leaving 31 million uninsured (see Table B-2). That\u2019s what Obama calls \u201cuniversal coverage.\u201d\n\nSo, let\u2019s do the math on that: In 2009, we were told it would cost $848 billion to insure 31 million people. That\u2019s $27,000 per newly insured person. Now we\u2019re told it will cost $2.004 trillion to insure 25 million people. That\u2019s $80,000 per newly insured person\u2014about a three-fold increase since passage.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barack Obama,CBO,Costs,Democrats,Health Care,Jeffrey H.
