The gridlock that forced the farm sector to get by with temporary bills for more than a year is \u201cthe poster child for the state of dysfunction in Congress and American politics,\u201d as Congress-watcher Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute put it.\n\nActually, Congress\u2019s willingness to debate ag policy at length is a sign of political health. The farm bill long has been an irrational, subsidy-laden monstrosity. It\u2019s about time somebody challenged the ag lobby\u2019s hammerlock on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhy do we even need a farm bill, with its billions in subsidized crop insurance and definitions of \u201cmilk marketing orders\u201d and \u201cbase acreage\u201d? Is there something about farming, as opposed to other businesses, that makes market economics uniquely inapplicable?\n\nSupposedly the goal is food security: making sure agriculture pays well enough that rural America can always provide affordable commodities to the cities and suburbs where 82 percent of the population lives. Perhaps government intervention was necessary to achieve this during the Great Depression, when the New Deal first federalized farm policy.\n\n1 of 95 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles on the economy View Photos A collection of cartoons about the state of the economy.

This obesity-plagued nation is ankle-deep in cheap food. In 2012, the average U.S. household devoted just 6.4 percent of its spending to food eaten at home, easily the lowest percentage in the developed world, according to the Agriculture Department (USDA). Yet the average person in the United States consumed 474 calories per day more in 2010 than in 1970.\n\nMeanwhile, the USDA forecasts record farm net income of $131 billion in 2013, spread among many fewer farms than we had in the 1930s. U.S. farms export about a quarter of what they produce in a typical year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nThe cause of this abundance is simple: U.S. farms produce 262 percent more food than they did in 1950 while using essentially the same quantities of labor, seeds, feed and fertilizer, the Farm Bureau says. In 1950, the average dairy cow produced 5,300 pounds of milk; today, she gives 22,000 pounds.\n\nU.S. agriculture is so productive that even natural disaster doesn\u2019t threaten food supply as much as it once did.\n\nRemember how we absolutely had to pass a farm bill in 2012, to save us from that year\u2019s drought, which was the most extensive in half a century ?\n\nWell, \u201c[i]t is now clear that the impact of the drought on retail food prices will be smaller than initially forecast,\u201d the USDA reports.\u201cThe inflationary pressure of the drought has been offset by factors such as decreased exports of many U.S. agricultural products, a stronger U.S. dollar, low energy price inflation, and decreased prices for many commodities not affected by the drought.\u201d\n\nFood-supply alarmism is a staple theme of ag-lobby propaganda. The menace this year is a spike in milk prices \u2014 to $8 a gallon! \u2014 if there's no farm bill and the government is forced to buy up the supply, per an obscure 1949 law.\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.

Why liberals are panicked about Obamacare If Obamacare fails, \u201cIt will discredit Obama\u2019s new liberalism for years to come.\u201d By Charles Krauthammer Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nA recent report in Time explains that this is overblown, partly because the agriculture secretary can delay purchases and partly because other relevant costs, such as transportation, won\u2019t be affected.\n\nFor the ag lobby, though, the point is to keep people worrying about a price hike instead of questioning the absurd legal quirk that makes one possible in the first place.\n\nSupporters of the farm bill note that both the House and Senate versions would eliminate the egregious subsidy of direct payments that automatically awards growers of certain favored commodities $5 billion a year. That is a real reform.\n\nBut both versions would spend much of the savings on new protections for farms that could be \u201cless transparent . . . and less predictable in terms of projecting budget outlays\u201d than the old system, reports agricultural economist Roman Keeney of Purdue University.\n\nThis brings us to the one decent argument for the farm bill, which, in fairness to Ornstein, is the one he emphasized: About 80 percent of it is funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for the poor. The legislative twinning of farm subsidies and food aid reflects a decades-old deal across Congress\u2019s partisan and rural-urban divides.\n\nHouse Republicans wrongly held up the farm bill this year by trying to sharply cut SNAP benefits while preserving farm subsidies.\n\nSooner or later, though, Congress will have to find a balanced alternative to the old log-rolling link between help for the poor and corporate welfare for agribusiness.\n\nA functional political system would provide the former \u2014 without the latter.\n\nRead more from Charles Lane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charles Lane, chuck lane, washington post charles lane, farm bill, house senate farm bill negotiations, house senate conference farm bill, farm bill subsidies, congress norm ornstein, farm bill milk prices, farm subsidies congress, american farm bureau federation, drought food prices, roman keeney, congress food stamps farm bill, congress supplemental nutrition assistance program, congress snap benefit cuts, snap food stamps farm bill cuts, purdue roman keeney, time milk prices", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Now is the chance to break agriculture\u2019s hold on politics.", "title": "Charles Lane: Why do we even need a farm bill?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-lane-why-do-we-even-need-a-farm-bill/2013/12/16/27bdcef0-6679-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/16/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Cold_Snap_California-0ecb8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ChuckLane1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-lane-why-do-we-even-need-a-farm-bill/2013/12/16/27bdcef0-6679-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Charles Lane, chuck lane, washington post charles lane, farm bill, house senate farm bill negotiations, house senate conference farm bill, farm bill subsidies, congress norm ornstein, farm bill milk prices, farm subsidies congress, american farm bureau federation, drought food prices, roman keeney, congress food stamps farm bill, congress supplemental nutrition assistance program, congress snap benefit cuts, snap food stamps farm bill cuts, purdue roman keeney, time milk prices", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "27bdcef0-6679-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Now is the chance to break agriculture\u2019s hold on politics."}, "article_summary": "House Republicans wrongly held up the farm bill this year by trying to sharply cut SNAP benefits while preserving farm subsidies.\n\u2014 if there's no farm bill and the government is forced to buy up the supply, per an obscure 1949 law.\nWhy do we even need a farm bill, with its billions in subsidized crop insurance and definitions of \u201cmilk marketing orders\u201d and \u201cbase acreage\u201d?\nHouse and Senate conferees are reportedly close to agreement on a five-year farm bill to replace the one that expired Sept. 30, 2012.\nThe farm bill long has been an irrational, subsidy-laden monstrosity."}
