Safety engineers have been unable to reach many of the dams above closed roads, relying instead on phone calls with dam owners on-site.\n\nStatewide, 167 dams have water-storage restrictions because of structural deficiencies, and some probably exceeded their permitted storage levels during the flooding. Others could have been damaged when floodwaters poured down their emergency spillways.\n\nThe deficient dams have been restricted to reduced or no water storage for various reasons: no or inadequate spillways, excessive seepage, continual deterioration, general neglect, partial or complete breaches.\n\nWhen the clouds clear, \u201cthat\u2019s when we\u2019re really going to kick into action,\u201d said Bill McCormick, who heads the dam safety branch at the state Division of Water Resources.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be sitting with a bunch of full reservoirs,\u201d he said. \u201cFifty to 100 of those, we\u2019ll have to inspect as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nEngineering consultants in the Denver area have offered free help with the inspection job, which McCormick plans to accept.\n\n\u201cWhere we have to,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to release water again.\u201d\n\nThe dam safety program classifies Colorado dams into three groups. Failures of high-hazard dams are likely to drown people. Significant-hazard dam failures may cause extensive property damage, and low-hazard dams are not a big threat to people or property.\n\nFears about one high-hazard dam eased Friday, but homeowners below should expect to see water pouring down its spillway.\n\nThe Baseline Reservoir, which serves as the city of Lafayette\u2019s water supply, had a damaged inlet, water standing on the dam crest and signs of erosion on the embankment. Repair materials were brought in and tarps laid across the crest, and the dam is under round-the-clock surveillance.\n\nBut while the dam held, \u201cits spillway is going to activate,\u201d McCormick said, and people below may see unprecedented water flows.\n\nSo far, a handful of low-hazard dams have failed, along with dozens of other very small dams that the state does not inspect.\n\nThose include fishing ponds, stock ponds and aesthetic ponds. \u201cGenerally, these structures don\u2019t hold significant volumes of water but will cause localized flooding,\u201d said Todd Hartman, a spokesman for the state Department of Natural Resources. \u201cPeople living near these structures need to be vigilant.\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado dams survive record rainfall, but engineers to reinspect them", "title": "Colorado dams survive record rainfall, but engineers to reinspect them", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/14/colorado-dams-survive-record-rainfall-but-engineers-to-reinspect-them/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__evergreen_dam_colorado_floodingp1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__evergreen_dam_colorado_floodingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T14:47:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:50:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhere we have to,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to release water again.\u201dThe dam safety program classifies Colorado dams into three groups.\nSafety engineers have been unable to reach many of the dams above closed roads, relying instead on phone calls with dam owners on-site.\nThose include fishing ponds, stock ponds and aesthetic ponds.\nSo far, a handful of low-hazard dams have failed, along with dozens of other very small dams that the state does not inspect.\nThe deficient dams have been restricted to reduced or no water storage for various reasons: no or inadequate spillways, excessive seepage, continual deterioration, general neglect, partial or complete breaches."}
