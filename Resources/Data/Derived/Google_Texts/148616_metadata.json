Snyder gives his inauguration speech in front of the state capitol in Lansing. (Jan. 1, 2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Gov. Rick Snyder took the oath of office for another four-year term Thursday, saying that he proved that many of Michigan\u2019s biggest problems can be solved but pledged to not ease up because more \u201cincredible\u201d achievements are possible.\n\nOn a frigid and windy New Year\u2019s Day, the 56-year-old Republican was sworn in just after noon on a platform over the Capitol steps facing downtown Lansing.\n\n\u201cWe can do incredible things when we do them together,\u201d Snyder told a crowd of more than 500 supporters in his inaugural address, pointing to Detroit\u2019s recent emergence from bankruptcy. \u201cLet\u2019s keep that spirit going. Let\u2019s show how we can do these special things.\u201d\n\nSnyder took office in 2011 as Michigan\u2019s economy was starting to rebound from a decade-long slide.\n\n\u201cThe second term, we have to look forward,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cAs I said, we have to deal huge problems. We were a broken state. We\u2019re a state that\u2019s a comeback state now. A state that\u2019s growing, that\u2019s thriving. But we have more to work to be done. Now is the time to focus in on innovation, to be forward-looking, to say in terms of supporting our citizens we can show true leadership throughout the nation.\u201d\n\nSnyder\u2019s earliest second-term challenge will be selling a proposed 1 percentage-point sales tax increase tied to a legislative deal to pump an additional $1.3 billion a year into deteriorating roads and other transportation infrastructure. A statewide vote is scheduled for May.\n\nHe also said he wants to lead the nation in expanding technical education to fill open jobs in the skilled trades and make Michigan\u2019s entrepreneurial climate tops in the country. He also plans to seek more transparency and accountability in local governments and schools and re-evaluate state government services, saying recipients are being split \u201cinto pieces\u201d among an increasing number of programs instead of being treated as \u201creal people.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we get you in the mainstream, the river of opportunity so that we can create a path of success for all Michiganders? We shouldn\u2019t leave anyone behind,\u201d Snyder said, noting that this inaugural was more rewarding while the first one was more exciting.\n\nThe festivities featured music by the Michigan National Guard 126th Army Band and a 19-gun cannon salute. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan \u2014 the master of ceremonies \u2014 kept it \u201cshort and quick\u201d given the 20-degree temperatures, which felt colder with a wind chill.\n\nSnyder, a University of Michigan graduate whose three adult children led the Pledge of Allegiance, drew applause when he yelled \u201cGo Green!\u201d for Michigan State\u2019s football team, which was about to kick off in the Cotton Bowl against Baylor.\n\nLt. Gov. Brian Calley, Attorney General Bill Schuette, Secretary of State Ruth Johnson \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 and other state officeholders also were sworn in. That list included new Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein, who is blind. The GOP will continue to dominate the Legislature and almost all of state government, as it has since 2011.\n\nLt. Gov.

The GOP will continue to dominate the Legislature and almost all of state government, as it has since 2011.\n\nSnyder\u2019s first term was marked by an improved economy; Detroit\u2019s filing for and exit from bankruptcy, which was aided by a bipartisan $195 million state bailout; and major billion-dollar tax overhauls that cut business taxes but raised them on individuals. He also signed a right-to-work law that made union fees optional and expanded Medicaid for a half-million low-income adults.\n\nThe state Democratic Party accused Snyder of \u201cspinning a narrative thoroughly out of touch with reality for too many Michiganders,\u201d citing potential state budget problems and deficit-ridden school districts.\n\nSnyder, a former venture capitalist and computer company executive who had never held public office until 2011, is the sixth straight Michigan governor to serve a second term.\n\n\u201cI want to be measured on two things,\u201d the governor told 24 Hour News 8 before the swearing in. \u201cOne is, did I do what I said I was going to do. Secondly, did I do it in way that it was never about Rick Snyder being governor, but it was about creating an environment of long-term success where better, smarter people could come build on a foundation that we built. And we\u2019re doing that with everything from what\u2019s going on with Detroit to Healthy Michigan to the job creation we\u2019re seeing. But let\u2019s go faster in the next term.\u201d\n\nSnyder cannot run again in 2018 because of term limits but has been mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential candidate \u2014 though he has remained noncommittal about a run for federal office in interviews.\n\n\u201cHe has not been your typical politician. He\u2019s done what he believes is right and will help the state,\u201d First Lady Sue Snyder told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nShe has been involved in his campaign and some of his initiatives.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him to run for governor, I never ever anticipated what my role would be,\u201d she told 24 Hour News 8 before the swearing in. \u201cBut I love it. I love being able to lend my voice to causes that are so important to so many people.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he plans to concentrate on struggling rural areas in his second turn and not just urban cores.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put a focused effort on the places of greatest need, whether they be in a city or whether it\u2019s out in the countryside,\u201d he told the AP.\n\n24 Hour News 8\u2019s Rick Albin contributed to this report.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
