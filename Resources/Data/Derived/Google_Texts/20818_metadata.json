The division\u2019s revenues came in at $9.4 billion in 4Q15, which represents a YoY drop of about 3.3%.\n\nNotably, the company added approximately 0.31 million new commercial enrollments in 2015. (Anthem\u2019s commercial and specialty business is further differentiated into national, local group, specialty, and individual businesses. To know more about Anthem\u2019s commercial business, please refer to Market Realist\u2019s \u201cAnthem Enjoys Steady Commercial Business.\u201d)\n\nThe above graph shows that Anthem\u2019s commercial enrollments rose by about 1.1 %, from 29.4 million in 4Q14 to 29.7 million in 4Q15. This growth is attributed to increases in enrollments in the national and local group markets by 328,000 and 104,000, respectively.\n\nAnthem\u2019s commercial membership growth, however, was negatively affected by a decrease of 118,000 members from the company\u2019s individual business segment. Peers including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET), and Cigna Corporation (CI) are also witnessing declines in their ACA (Affordable Care Act) compliant individual and small-group exchange business.\n\nAnthem\u2019s national membership in 4Q15 and fiscal 2015\n\nIn 2015, Anthem\u2019s total national membership accounted for 43% of the company\u2019s total commercial enrollments and 33.1% of Anthem\u2019s total membership. The company\u2019s total national membership increased by 2.6%, from 12.4 million in 4Q14 to 12.7 million in 4Q15. National membership is further categorized into national accounts and BlueCard members.\n\nAnthem\u2019s commercial enrollments\n\nAnthem\u2019s national account membership rose by 2.8% YoY, from approximately 7.1 million in 4Q14 to about 7.4 million in 4Q15, mainly due to several large contracts such as that with Bank of America Corporation, which included contracts won by the company in 2015. Anthem\u2019s local group business also witnessed a rise in total enrollments of about 0.7%, from 15.1 million in 4Q14 to 15.2 million in 4Q15.\n\nIndividual business enrollments declined by 6.6%, from 1.8 million in 4Q14 to 1.7 million in 4Q15. In 2015, Anthem added about 84,000 members through its public exchange offerings and concluded the year with approximately 791,000 individual exchange enrollments. The company\u2019s small group business, however, suffered a loss of about 100,000 enrollments in 4Q15.\n\nWhy are Anthem\u2019s revenues down?\n\nDespite the rise in total commercial enrollments, Anthem\u2019s revenues have suffered. This is on account of the increasing number of employer-sponsored members who continue to shift from fully insured to administrative services only or self-insured plans. Additionally, the company also failed to meet revenue targets in its public and private exchange businesses in 4Q15.
