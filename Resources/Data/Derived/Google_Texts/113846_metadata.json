The bill protects businesses and individuals from having to do things \u2013 and to obey laws \u2013 that would be a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on their religious freedom.\n\nGay marriage is the most visible and politicized arena where this rights conflict is being fought. Some businesses and individuals say it would violate their religious freedom if they had to, say, provide flowers, pastries or appetizers to a gay wedding. Indiana\u2019s new law agrees and would protect them. This is a radical new understanding of the right of religious expression that would trump the civil rights of others.\n\nThe Indiana law is the wholly predictable and unfortunate consequence of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell last summer. In that famous case, the Supreme Court said that by forcing Hobby Lobby to provide its employees with health insurance that covered some forms of contraction, the Affordable Care Act violated the company\u2019s religious rights.\n\nOne odd facet of the decision is that for-profit companies have the same religious rights as individuals, something common sense has a very hard time with.\n\nMore importantly, the court majority in Hobby Lobby said religious freedom no longer only meant protecting how one worships in private and in church, bought also means protection from any compromise of beliefs that may come up in the public world of business and everyday life. \u201cIn a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in her dissent.\n\nDissenters correctly predicted that the decision would set the table for continuing course of new litigation, new laws and new ways to justify old discrimination. That is exactly what is happening.\n\nIf it is legal for a company to refuse to cover contraception in its insurance plan, couldn\u2019t a Christian Scientist company refuse to provide health insurance at all? If it\u2019s okay to refuse catering services at a gay wedding, what about at an interracial marriage? They violate some religious beliefs, too. What if a corner store owned by Muslims didn\u2019t want to serve Jews, or vice versa?\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to make this a long list. Indiana is on the verge of sanctioning and empowering this very un-American mutation of a fundamental American principle.\n\nEarlier this week, Senator Ted Cruz launched his presidential campaign at a convocation service at a Christian fundamentalist university. What a powerful message that sends to Americans who aren\u2019t Christian \u2013 Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, atheists and, the biggest category of all, \u201cnone of the above. The message is simply: We don\u2019t want you.\n\nIndiana is at crossroads and is about to send that very same message, enshrined in a law.\n\n[Also by Dick Meyer: Do permits tread on the Second Amendment?]\n\nWant to keep up with all the latest DecodeDC stories and podcasts?
