MARYS | With just 10 days before the July 22 primary runoffs, the two Republicans left in the race for Georgia\u2019s 1st Congressional District fielded questions Saturday from voters in St. Marys.\n\nState Sen. Earl \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter of Pooler and physician Bob Johnson of Chatham County want to replace U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, who has his own Republican runoff against David Perdue for the U.S. Senate seat Saxby Chambliss is vacating.\n\nModerator Jeremy Spencer told the audience that neither Carter nor Johnson carried Camden County in the May 20 primary in what was then a six-man race.\n\n\u201cI like to think Camden County is the county win,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThis is their Waterloo.\u201d\n\nThe race between Carter and Johnson has grown contentious in recent months, a development Spencer said had generated a number of \u201cinteresting ads and accusations.\u201d He said he hoped the forum would help clear up some of the issues for voters.\n\nJohnson, who has never held political office, played up his long military service as an Army Ranger and his continued career as a surgeon. The tea party-backed candidate emphasized his conservative values with strong language, referring to President Barack Obama as a \u201ccurse on our nation\u201d and a \u201cstupid, erratic president.\u201d Johnson promised be a true fiscal conservative and a \u201ctax warrior\u201d who would \u201cstarve the federal government.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Carter merely \u201cclaims to be a conservative\u201d but is actually a \u201ccareer politician\u201d and an \u201cambitious man who wants to get ahead.\u201d\n\nJohnson spent a good deal of his allotted time speaking about term limits, something he supports. He has pledged to adhere to a self-imposed limit of three two-year terms.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get anything done as long as we have a professional, career class legislative body,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe need term limits in Congress. I have been a staunch advocate of term limits since the beginning of my campaign.\u201d\n\nCarter countered those attacks by saying he wouldn\u2019t apologize for the time he spent serving as the mayor of Pooler, Ga., and for the time he has spent in the General Assembly. He added that, as mayor, he donated his salary back to the city and that he doesn\u2019t participate in the state\u2019s retirement plan for legislators.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my public service,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you want to have term limits, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut you have to be careful. If you are going to have term limits on elected officials you better have term limits for bureaucrats, because they get out of control, too.\u201d\n\nHe cited the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Veterans Affairs and those agencies\u2019 recent scandals as evidence of bureaucracies run amok.\n\n\u201cLook at what we\u2019re going through there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we need term limits.\u201d\n\nHe added that voters should think twice about imposing term limits on elected officials and what that would ultimately mean.\n\n\u201cPlease be careful ever to give up your right to vote,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you would be doing.\u201d\n\nCitizens, by exercising their right to vote, have all the power necessary to limit terms of their representatives, Carter asserted.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t think voting works, ask Eric Cantor,\u201d he said, referring to the Virginia congressman who just lost a Republican primary to a tea party candidate.\n\nThe candidates did agree on two things. One is that the federal Department of Education should be completely defunded and the other is that they both oppose the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have to turn Obamacare into a 3-D movie.\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe have to delay it, defund it and defeat it.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the new health care law was just as much a curse on the nation as he claimed Obama is. Playing on the words of Carter\u2019s claims, he said there should be no \u201cdelay\u201d in getting rid of it.\n\nMost of those who attended the forum walked away saying they had made up their minds who they were going to vote for.\n\nJim Stein, who practices law in St. Marys, said he planned to vote for Carter but hoped whoever won would be able to stay in Washington for a while.\n\n\u201cI like both of them,\u201d he said, adding that it would take at least one term in office for either candidate to get the lay of the political landscape in Washington.\n\n\u201cFor two years they won\u2019t even know where the bathroom is,\u201d Stein said.\n\nNeither candidate would have any political power in his first term because veteran legislators would simply watch them to find out if they were capable of being re-elected before deciding whether to build coalitions with them, he said.\n\nKingston represented the 1st District for 22 years. Even Johnson, who decries \u201ccareer politicians,\u201d admits he was effective \u2014 dismissing the effectiveness as an anomaly among long-serving legislators.\n\nKingston leaves \u201cbig shoes to fill,\u201d according to Camden County School Board chairman Herbert Rowland.\n\nDespite the district having a longtime, popular incumbent, Rowland said he is supporting Johnson who has pledged to leave after six years.\n\nRowland said he supports Johnson because he is a fellow veteran.\n\nJeanne and Bill Robertson said they arrived undecided, although early in the race they had supported Carter. They both said after listening to the candidates field questions they had decided to stick with Carter.\n\n\u201cBasically we were both undecided and came here thinking that maybe we needed to clarify some things\u201d Jeanne Robertson said. \u201cBut we have gone back to our original decision [Carter].\u201d\n\nWhoever Republican voters decide to send to the general election will face the winner of the Democratic runoff between Amy Tavio and Brian Reese.\n\nEarly voting is underway until Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ST.
