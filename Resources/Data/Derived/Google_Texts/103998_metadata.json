The KRG says it needs the oil revenue because it is weighed down by the costs of fighting Islamic State militants.\n\nThe move is hard for the central government to ignore, analysts say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a provocative step,\u201d said Jordan Perry, lead Iraq analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a risk consultancy based in the United Kingdom. \u201cBaghdad will not look kindly on that, and it\u2019s entirely possible that it could return to the kind of legal challenges that we have seen in the past year.\u201d\n\nLast year, Baghdad froze all transfer payments to the KRC after the Kurds first sold oil themselves. Also, legal action by the central government, which deterred buyers from KRG crude, disrupted independent Kurdish exports via the pipeline to Ceyhan in southern Turkey.\n\nBecause of the legal wrangle, the Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker United Kalavryta was moored off Galveston, Texas, for months last summer, unable to offload its cargo of Kurdish crude. The tanker slinked away after a U.S. court upheld Baghdad\u2019s claim.\n\nStill, the Islamic State\u2019s blitz last summer across Iraq right up to the gates of Baghdad and the Kurdish capital of Irbil prompted the central government and the KRG to put aside their differences. In a December deal, the Kurds agreed to export oil via Turkey under the auspices of the government in return for a slice of the federal budget.\n\nIn exchange for sending 550,000 barrels a day through a pipeline connecting northern Iraq to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan starting in January, the KRG expected to receive $1 billion a month from Baghdad.\n\nBut the precipitous fall in global oil prices has strained Baghdad\u2019s finances. Oil has been hovering around $50 a barrel after more than halving over the past 12 months.\n\nAt the same time, the fight against the Islamic State group has become an immense drain on resources in spite of billions of dollars in U.S. military aid.\n\nAs a result, payouts from Baghdad remained far short, with monthly transfers never exceeding $450 million, according to the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe do understand that Baghdad faces some financial difficulties,\u201d said KRG spokesman Safeen Dizayee. \u201cBut salaries in all provinces in Iraq, including areas under Daesh control, have been paid, while those in the KRG were not.\u201d\n\nDaesh is a term the Kurds and others use for the Islamic State and could be considered derogatory.\n\nAnalysts say the Iraqi government has been opaque and inconsistent with its disbursements to the Kurds, adding to the irritation in Irbil.\n\n\u201cIf Baghdad has problems, then it has to be transparent and open with the KRG,\u201d said Falah Mustafa Bakir, the KRG\u2019s minister of foreign relations. \u201cWhat hurts the region is if Baghdad unilaterally decides to cut [payments] without any consultation.\u201d\n\nYet Irbil does not always act in accord with Baghdad. In June, its forces occupied the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, which Kurds historically have considered their territory despite their minority in the town\u2019s ethnic mix.\n\nOil and money\n\nKirkuk\u2019s oil is produced by Iraq\u2019s state-owned North Oil Co. Like KRG oil, it should be sold abroad by the State Organization for Marketing Oil.\n\nIn June, average exports from the state organization dropped sharply while Kurdish exports outside the state marketer\u2019s jurisdiction increased. Last month, the Kurds independently sold about 2 million barrels of the North Oil Co.\u2019s Kirkuk oil.\n\nThe KRG said it failed to compensate the State Organization for Marketing Oil because of an attack on the pipeline within Turkey, which interrupted oil flows for several days late last month.\n\nThe central government sees Kurdish oil sales as infringements on state sovereignty. It is also wary of Kurdish ambitions to break away from Iraq and wants to keep Irbil financially dependent. Baghdad fears that Kurdish independence would encourage separatism in the southern city of Basra, Iraq\u2019s major oil hub and the site of the country\u2019s largest fields.\n\nBaghdad has not responded to Irbil\u2019s renewed independent exports. Oil Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi met with KRG leaders in May, and the central government is making a payment for June exports, suggesting a will to compromise. Preoccupied with battling the Islamic State in Fallujah and Ramadi, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi may feel his priorities lie elsewhere.\n\nBaghdad also has tacitly acknowledged that the Kurds are major contributors to the fight against the Salafist Sunni militant group.\n\nKurdish armed forces, known as the peshmerga, are fending off a large number of militants along a 600-mile front in the north, where daily coalition airstrikes are pounding Islamic State positions. The Kurds have agreed to play a part in the liberation of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, which fell to the Islamic State in June. The Kurdish region also hosts more than 1 million Iraqis displaced by the conflict.\n\nA need for unity\n\nDelays in paying its troops could undermine the KRG\u2019s ability to fight. Since December\u2019s oil deal, the arrearage for salaries to the peshmerga has grown from one month to three, said Mr. Dizayee, the KRG spokesman.\n\nGovernment salaries total around $700 million a month, a huge amount for a region with 5 million inhabitants. By selling its oil, the KRG is able to raise at least $850 million a month, Mr. Dizayee said.\n\nThe central government could pressure the Kurds by restricting the flow of military aid to the KRG. Under present arrangements, weapons deliveries from the U.S. and Europe are routed via Baghdad International Airport, giving the government an opportunity to intervene.\n\nSuch a move would alienate foreign military donors, who already are pressuring Baghdad to maintain security cooperation. Congress in June only narrowly voted down a bill to send weapons straight to Irbil, and Baghdad\u2019s denial of military aid to the Kurds could strengthen U.S.-KRG ties and the Kurdish case for independence.\n\n\u201cBaghdad is aware that the U.S. willingness to directly arm the Kurds will increase if it retaliates by cutting arms supplies to the KRG in response to the collapse of the oil deal,\u201d said Mr. Perry, the Iraq analyst.\n\nThe KRG insists it remains open to negotiations to salvage the deal and that it will not allow squabbling over oil exports to interfere with the war effort.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all of us is to fight ISIS and to eradicate this organization,\u201d said Mr. Dizayee, who notes that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, controls more than a third of the country and already has fractured Iraq.\n\nIn the struggle to rid itself of the Islamic State menace, Baghdad has little choice but to keep the Kurds on its side. With its options limited, it has tacitly acquiesced to renewed independent Kurdish oil exports by taking no action. The central government\u2019s best hope of keeping Iraq intact is to seek compromise with its regions.\n\n\u201c[This] is a further loosening of central government authority in Iraq, though KRG economic divorce from Baghdad is only the recognition of something that has existed for many months, if not years,\u201d said Michael Knights, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Strapped for cash and increasingly frustrated with Baghdad's stingy disbursement of the federal budget, Iraq's autonomous Kurdish government has turned its back on a deal struck last year to patch over a long-standing oil feud between the Kurds and the federal government.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Strapped for cash and increasingly frustrated with Baghdad\u2019s stingy disbursement of the federal budget, Iraq\u2019s autonomous Kurdish government has turned its back on a deal struck last year to patch over a long-standing oil feud between the Kurds and the federal government.", "title": "Iraq oil feud renewed as cash-strapped Kurds turn backs on deal with Baghdad", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/16/iraq-oil-feud-renewed-as-cash-strapped-kurds-turn-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/8_162015_ap4951867386328201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/8_162015_ap4951867386328201.jpg", "description": "Strapped for cash and increasingly frustrated with Baghdad's stingy disbursement of the federal budget, Iraq's autonomous Kurdish government has turned its back on a deal struck last year to patch ove", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Iraq oil feud renewed as cash-strapped Kurds turn backs on deal with B"}, "Author": "Florian Neuhof - Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Irbil, Jordan Perry, Baghdad"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe077b\"", "article_summary": "With its options limited, it has tacitly acquiesced to renewed independent Kurdish oil exports by taking no action.\nOil and moneyKirkuk\u2019s oil is produced by Iraq\u2019s state-owned North Oil Co.
