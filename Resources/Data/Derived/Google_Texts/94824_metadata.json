She led a free and unbiased educational session on the ACA for nursing students and faculty Nov. 6 at the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis.\n\n\u201cI have read the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act multiple times. I don\u2019t recommend it unless you have insomnia,\u201d she joked.\n\nHer presentation, \u201cThe State of Missouri and the Affordable Care Act,\u201d touched on everything from what\u2019s in the law, what the impact will be in Missouri and how individuals will be affected.\n\nShe emphasized that the ACA is building on the existing health-care system and the existing health-care infrastructure and is not dramatically changing the way people access and get health care. She said there are just new coverage options available for people.\n\nHowever, despite her organization\u2019s efforts to educate the public about the ACA, she said she continues to see a knowledge gap.\n\n\u201cPeople have lots of questions. People are confused. There have been lots of rumors and misinformation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe try and be a nonpartisan source of information.\u201d\n\nSome in the audience voiced concern that staffing levels wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the influx of newly insured. Coleman said the ACA is trying to account for that.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act does provide tuition reimbursement and loan forgiveness to help folks who are going into health careers,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, those are more long-term solutions.\n\nAndrea Jones, a senior nursing student at UMSL, found the discussion enlightening. But she does admit to harboring some concerns.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that so many more people are going to be getting coverage. It\u2019s great to put more responsibility on the individual. I just don\u2019t think that we should be putting more of a strain on hospitals since they\u2019re going to be seeing a lot more patients with more issues,\u201d she said.\n\nJones wishes the ACA would \u201cgive the hospitals a break at first,\u201d until the newly uninsured are properly educated on how to use the health-care system so they\u2019re not flooding emergency rooms with simple ailments.\n\nThe Missouri Foundation for Health is a private nonprofit organization working to improve the health of Missourians.\n\nThe ACA educational effort is part of Cover Missouri, the foundation\u2019s project to increase access to quality, affordable health insurance for every Missourian.\n\nThe foundation provides grant funding and education and serves as the leading nonpartisan voice of health system topics of importance to Missouri. MFH is the largest health-care foundation in the state and has provided more than $470 million in grants and contracts since its founding in 2000.\n\nThe educational session was organized by Sheila Grigsby, assistant teaching professor in the College of Nursing at UMSL.\n\nShort URL: http://blogs.umsl.edu/news/?p=42753", "article_metadata": {"description": "One thing is for sure, few people are short on opinions when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.
