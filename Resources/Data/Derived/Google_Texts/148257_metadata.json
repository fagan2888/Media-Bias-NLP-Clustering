Jason Andrew for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSeattle psychiatrist Anna Ratzliff oversees mental-health care for nearly 500 patients\u2014most of whom she will never meet.\n\nAs the consulting psychiatrist for four primary-care practices, Dr. Ratzliff confers weekly with 10 care managers who follow the patients closely, provide counseling and chart their progress in electronic registries. She helps devise treatment plans and suggests changes for those who aren't improving.\n\n\"I get to touch so many more lives than I would if I were seeing these patients in person,\" she said.\n\nThe Health Law Rollout ENLARGE Explore how America's health-care overhaul will affect you on this first-person adventure. CLICK THE IMAGE to start interactive experience.\n\nDr. Ratzliff's practice is part of a burgeoning effort to integrate psychiatric care into primary-care practices, in a bid to make more efficient use of a limited number of mental-health professionals. Providers are bracing for a surge of new patients seeking mental-health care under the federal health law, and some are using new ways to deliver more care to more patients at less cost.\n\nStarting next week, plans sold on the new insurance exchanges must provide at least some mental-health coverage; existing plans must do so when they come up for renewal. And a 2008 federal \"parity\" law bars insurers from putting more restrictions on mental-health benefits than on medical services. As a result, as many as 62 million more Americans will have access to mental-health coverage, by White House estimates.\n\nBut using those benefits may be difficult in some areas. Some 90 million Americans live in communities with fewer than one psychiatrist per 30,000 residents, according to government surveys.\n\nThe idea of having primary-care providers treat mental-health issues with psychiatrists' oversight isn't new, but it is catching on in community health centers, large health systems including Kaiser Permanente and the Veterans Health Administration, and pilot Medicaid and Medicare projects.\n\n\"We're seeing more interest in this in the last five years than the last 20,\" said University of Washington psychiatrist Wayne Katon, who pioneered the concept in the early 1990s.\n\nAlso spurring interest is the growing awareness that medical and mental-health problems are often linked. Patients with diabetes and heart disease have twice the rate of anxiety and depression as the general population, which in turn makes it harder to make healthful changes like losing weight, studies have shown. Approximately 25% of primary-care patients have one or more psychiatric disorders\u2014mostly anxiety, depression or substance abuse, according to a JAMA study.\n\nTime-pressed Primary-care doctors typically hand such patients a referral to a mental-health specialist, but only 60% of patients followed through, according to a 2002 study in Seattle conducted by the University of Washington.\n\nIn an integrated-care practice, doctors can do a \"warm handoff\" instead, personally introducing patients to a counselor on site.\n\n\"It's so important to capture that moment,\" said internist Thomas Goforth, medical director of the Family Health Center of Harlem, an integrated-care center in New York City. \"If a patient gets comfortable with a counselor before ever leaving the building, he's much more likely to return.\"\n\nRelated Reading The Family That Fights Together\n\nIn some practices, psychiatrists and psychologists work alongside primary-care providers on cases. In others, primary-care doctors prescribe antidepressants or other medications, and care managers\u2014typically licensed clinical social workers\u2014confer weekly with patients to monitor progress, often using a standardized nine-question depression quiz.\n\nMany care managers also provide cognitive behavioral therapy and other counseling. \"The goal is to give patients the skills to approach problems differently,\" said J\u00fcrgen Un\u00fctzer, a University of Washington psychiatrist, who has helped more than 1,000 clinics nationwide adopt the model.\n\nMany studies have shown that integrated care can reduce patients' depression and cut costs. One University of Washington study of 1,800 patients found that providing a year of integrated care cost $600 a patient but saved an average of $4,000 in lower medical bills over the next four years.\n\nStill, integrated care is a big adjustment for psychiatrists, whose training typically focuses on one-on-one relationships.\n\nMoreover, some critics say it provides superficial, cookie-cutter care and relies too heavily on medication. In cities where psychiatrists are plentiful and patients can pay for traditional therapy, \"this is a really hard sell,\" Dr. Un\u00fctzer said.\n\nTraditional fee-for-service reimbursement does pose problems for integrated practices. Psychiatrists usually can't bill for patients they don't see in person. Many insurers won't pay for telephone consultations, and some Medicaid plans will pay for only one service a day, even if a patient sees multiple providers at the same clinic.\n\nHealth plans that pay capitated fees, or flat fees per patient, have been faster to adopt the integrated-care plans. The American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians have all endorsed the concept.\n\nAnd many patients like the approach. Magali King, 54 years old, gets treated for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and diabetes at Dr. Goforth's clinic in Harlem, and joins in his monthly fitness sessions. \"They are helping me keep everything in balance,\" she said.\n\nBody and Mind\n\nWho needs, gets, gives care\n\n25% of U.S. adults experience a mental-health issue in a given year\n\n60% of them receive no treatment\n\n68% of adults with a mental-health disorder have at least one medical condition\n\n29% of those with a medical condition have a mental-health issue\n\n50% of care for mental-health disorders is delivered by primary-care providers\n\n66% of visits to family physicians involve stress-related symptoms\n\nSources: National Alliance on Mental Illness;
