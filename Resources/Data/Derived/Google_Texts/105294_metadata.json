Instead, Democrats expanded their House majority from 50-46 to 53-47 and are expected to hold onto the chamber for at least the rest of the year until the fall elections.\n\nTwo of the vacancies were created when Gov. Bevin appointed Democratic House members John Tilley to run his Justice Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a judge position. Despite Democrat Jack Conway losing handily in those districts to Republican Matt Bevin in last November\u2019s gubernatorial race, Democrats Jeffery Taylor and Lew Nicholls won blowout victories in Districts 8 and 98.\n\nIn the District 62 race to replace Republican Ryan Quarles \u2014 who vacated his position when he won his race to become Commissioner of Agriculture last year \u2014 Democrat Chuck Tackett won a closely contested upset victory over Republican Phillip Pratt. Republicans avoided a sweep by holding onto District 54 \u2014 vacated by current state Auditor Mike Harmon \u2014 with Daniel Elliott handily defeating Democrat Bill Noelker in the solidly conservative district.\n\nSannie Overly, new chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party, said her party\u2019s victories served as a rejection of Gov. Bevin\u2019s new administration and budget proposal, as Bevin made an effort to campaign for Republican candidates in each race.\n\n\u201cKentuckians have spoken, and this is a repudiation of Gov. Bevin\u2019s efforts to dismantle public education and healthcare,\u201d said Overly. \u201cTrying to dismantle Kynect, which has helped more than half a million Kentuckians obtain health insurance, is a perfect example of the bad decisions Bevin is making that will hurt the people of the Commonwealth. These Democrats won because they are all good leaders \u2013 and they will serve Kentucky well. Tonight is not just a victory for them, but it is a victory for every Kentuckian.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidates hammered Bevin\u2019s current budget proposal that includes steep cuts to higher education, as well as his intention to end Kynect and roll back the Medicaid expansion reforms of former Gov. Beshear. Labor unions also spent significant effort warning about the potential of Republicans passing \u201cright to work\u201d legislation that would hurt their membership.\n\nThe Mitch McConnell-affiliated Kentucky Opportunity Coalition spent significant money airing TV ads that hit Kentucky Democrats for supporting \u201cObamacare\u201d and praising Republican leaders for wanting to end it \u2014 but unlike last year, Democrats took that issue head-on in the District 8 race. Instead of running from the president and his signature legislation, Taylor \u2014 an African-American \u2014 had robocalls from President Barack Obama to voters in his district in which he praised the expansion of health insurance in Kentucky due to the Affordable Care Act, and said that Taylor would help protect it from Gov. Bevin and Republicans.\n\nDistrict 8 is mostly made up of Christian County, which Bevin won by 16 percent last year over Conway. The Democrat Taylor won his race by nearly 19 percent on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican Party of Kentucky Chairman Mac Brown cast the elections as a win for the party, claiming that Republicans are now \u201cone seat closer to taking the majority\u201d in the House.\n\n\u201cWith Republican candidates running in 91 House districts and the Democrats tied to the Obama-Clinton agenda, I am confident we will take the majority and turn Kentucky in a new direction in November,\u201d said Brown.\n\nWith three more weeks until the veto session of the General Assembly begins, Bevin\u2019s budget will now take center stage the rest of the way. Democratic House leaders say they will present their budget next week, which is expected to differ dramatically from Bevin\u2019s \u2014 despite the governor warning that he would veto any budget that was significantly different from the one he proposed in January.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "In a special election to fill four state House seats, KY Democrats preserved control of the chamber and defied expectations by expanding their majority.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "In a special election to fill four state House seats, KY Democrats preserved control of the chamber and defied expectations by expanding their majority.", "title": "Kentucky Democrats win three of four special elections, maintain and expand majority in state House - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kycap-e1454435424761.jpg", "height": 448}, "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/metro/kentucky-democrats-win-three-of-four-special-elections-maintain-and-expand-majority-in-state-house/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Government", "tag": "Republican Party of Kentucky", "published_time": "2016-03-09T11:11:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09d6\"", "article_summary": "In Tuesday\u2019s special elections to fill four vacated seats in the state House, Kentucky Democrats not only preserved their control of the chamber, but defied expectations by expanding their majority with three victories.\nDistrict 8 is mostly made up of Christian County, which Bevin won by 16 percent last year over Conway.\nWith three more weeks until the veto session of the General Assembly begins, Bevin\u2019s budget will now take center stage the rest of the way.\nThese Democrats won because they are all good leaders \u2013 and they will serve Kentucky well.\nBevin appointed Democratic House members John Tilley to run his Justice Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a judge position."}
