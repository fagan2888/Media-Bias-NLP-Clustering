It clearly was an attempt to secure a legacy of accomplishment. That attempt is at best questionable.\n\nIt is important to divide Obama\u2019s record between what he failed to do and what he has succeeded in doing\u2014most of it bad. Either way, it is not a record to be proud of.\n\n\n\nStart with his failures. In foreign affairs, he has barely changed course from the disastrous policies of George W. Bush. \u201cRegime change\u201d remains the order of the day: Bush had his in Iraq; Obama had Libya and has tried, but so far failed, in Syria. The \u201cArab Spring\u201d has become the \u201cJihadist Winter.\u201d Obama pretends the Islamic State is just a rag-tag band with some pickup trucks\u2014at least he refrained from again calling them the \u201cJ.V.\u201d About the only specific difference is that Bush \u201crenditioned\u201d suspected terrorists and water-boarded them, Obama just kills them with drones. The Ukraine crisis, in which Obama\u2019s administration has played a destabilizing role, festers.\n\n\n\nThis continuity reflects the fact that Obama doesn\u2019t much care about foreign policy. He reads what Samantha Power and Susan Rice (and before that, Hillary Clinton) put on his teleprompter. His real mission is to fundamentally transform America domestically. On that, he has largely succeeded\u2014to the detriment of our country.\n\n\n\nHis signature \u201caccomplishment\u201d is Obamacare. While perhaps providing some expansion of healthcare availability, it has made health services more expensive for most Americans. It also has expanded the federal purview over previously private activity.\n\n\n\nObama wants to decrease the prevalence of guns in American life. On that score, his leaving office can only help, because every time he opens his mouth, millions of Americans run out to buy weapons. An armed citizenry is fundamental to Americans\u2019 traditional notion of ourselves as a free people. Some people disagree, they would prefer to be more like England or other countries where private citizens don\u2019t have guns, only the police and army do. That\u2019s a legitimate opinion to hold, but it\u2019s not the American tradition. Tens of millions of us distrust Obama when he proposes \u201cmoderate, common-sense reforms\u201d\u2014none of which will reduce violence anyway\u2014because we suspect what he really wants is move the ball from where we are now to a disarmed public.\n\n\n\nHe promised the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will support \u201cmore good jobs.\u201d Translation: get ready for massive job losses after the GOP helps pass TPP.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s contempt for the traditional American identity is palpable. His guests at the speech featured an illegal alien \u201cDreamer\u201d from Mexico and a plaintiff in the case that forced same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d on all 50 states. He slandered as people who vandalize mosques and bully kids Americans who worry that Syrian \u201crefugees\u201d (most of whom are neither Syrians nor refugees but Muslim migrants from many countries) might include terrorists like the Tsarnaev brothers. He won\u2019t be happy until we duplicate in America what we saw on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne care of \u201cMutti Merkel.\u201d Characteristically, he calls for mutual respect and accord among Americans while caricaturing and demonizing those who disagree with him.\n\n\n\nObama has made great strides in transforming a center-right, basically conservative country with a recognizable national culture and historic traditions into a mini-United Nations: a multicultural, multiethnic, multireligious microcosm of the world with no defining core and devoid of a moral center-of-gravity except a gender-bending attitude of \u201cif it feels good, do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll in all, even with a year left to go Obama should go down in history as our second worse president ever. I make that caveat only because first prize should go to his predecessor. On top of his own considerable errors, George W. Bush made the GOP brand so toxic, we ended up with Obama. So Bush needs to take the blame not only for his own poor performance but for Obama\u2019s too. Of course it might get even worse, if Hillary Clinton is our next president. Or for that matter, most of the Republican contenders.\n\nJim Jatras, a former US diplomat and foreign policy adviser to the Senate GOP leadership, comments on financial and foreign policy topics and on U.S. politics in his publication TheJIM!gram.
