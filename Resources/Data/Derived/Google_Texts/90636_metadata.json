I gave it to six people, and apparently it\u2019s gotten out today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave it to one of the producers on \u2018Django Unchained,\u2019 Reggie Hudlin, and he let an agent come to his house and read it,\u201d he told Deadline. \u201cThat\u2019s a betrayal, but not crippling because the agent didn\u2019t end up with the script. There is an ugly maliciousness to the rest of it. I gave it to three actors: Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth. The one I know didn\u2019t do this is Tim Roth. One of the others let their agent read it, and that agent has now passed it on to everyone in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nMr. Tarantino told the website that he believes the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which reps Mr. Dern, is responsible for the leak. The CAA, however, denied the allegations and said it\u2019s possible the director leaked the script himself, whether intentionally, without a watermark.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to publish \u2018The Hateful Eight,\u2019 and that\u2019s it for now,\u201d Mr. Tarantino told Deadline. \u201cI give it out to six people, and if I can\u2019t trust them to that degree, then I have no desire to make it. I\u2019ll publish it. I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll move on to the next thing. I\u2019ve got 10 more where that came from.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Award-winning director Quentin Tarantino learned Tuesday that someone in his small circle of actors chosen for \"The Hateful Eight\" has leaked his script, and he is bitterly shelving the movie until the not-so-near future.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Award-winning director Quentin Tarantino learned Tuesday that someone in his small circle of actors chosen for \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d has leaked his script, and he is bitterly shelving the movie until the not-so-near future.", "title": "Quentin Tarantino angrily shelves \u2018The Hateful Eight\u2019 after script leak", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/22/quentin-tarantino-angrily-shelves-hateful-eight-af/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2010/09/01/Italy_Venice_Film_Festival_Jury_photocall_.sff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2010/09/01/Italy_Venice_Film_Festival_Jury_photocall_.sff.jpg", "title": "Quentin Tarantino angrily shelves \u2018The Hateful Eight\u2019 afte", "description": "Award-winning director Quentin Tarantino learned Tuesday that someone in his small circle of actors chosen for \"The Hateful Eight\" has leaked his script, and he is bitterly shelving the movie until th", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Quentin Tarantino"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08d3\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Tarantino told Deadline.com that he will possibly revisit the movie in the next five years.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to publish \u2018The Hateful Eight,\u2019 and that\u2019s it for now,\u201d Mr. Tarantino told Deadline.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a betrayal, but not crippling because the agent didn\u2019t end up with the script.\n\u201cI finished a script, a first draft, and I didn\u2019t mean to shoot it until next winter, a year from now.\nI gave it to three actors: Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth."}
