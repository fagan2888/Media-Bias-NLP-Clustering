Authorities say they will be increasing patrols and saturating roads in Jefferson, Gilpin and Clear Creek counties on Saturday night into Sunday seeking out impaired drivers for arrest.

The Colorado State Patrol says its troopers will be on the prowl from 9 p.m. on Saturday until 3 a.m. on Sunday.

“The effort is part of the year-long push to reduce injury and fatal crashes caused by (driving under the influence of alcohol) and (driving under the influence of drugs) drivers,” the state patrol said Friday in a news release. “With Memorial Day seen as the kick-off to summer, the message is timely.”
