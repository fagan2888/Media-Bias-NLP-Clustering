ICAP agreed to pay $87 million to regulators in the U.K. and U.S. over its role, while the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against three former brokers at ICAP.\n\nDarrell Read, Daniel Wilkinson and Colin Goodman were charged with criminal fraud including for their involvement with the man alleged to be at the center of the scandal, former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes.\n\n(Lawyers for the three couldn\u2019t be reached Wednesday, and Mr. Hayes has said in a text message to WSJ previously that this goes much higher than him.)\n\nMr. Wilkinson was the supervisor of the desk of brokers. That included Mr. Read, who executed trades for Mr. Hayes in the Yen Libor rate. Mr. Goodman, dubbed Lord Libor, was in charge of emailing taders at large banks \u201csuggested Libors,\u201d a daily email with his firm\u2019s predictions for where Yen Libor would fall.\n\nMr. Hayes bet on the directions of Yen Libor, which was set in various month durations, such as six-month, or 6m, in their parlance.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of their electronic conversations, taken from CFTC and the DOJ complaint.\n\nOctober 23, 2006 \u2013 Read set the tone early in the day: He lost his credit card bowling but promises curry if Goodman can come through for Hayes.\n\nRead: \u201cMorning Lad [Goodman], On the scrounge again, if possible keep 3m the same and get 6mos as high as you can. My guy has an enormous fix on Wednesday in 6mos and will want it as high as possible. Waiting for my credit card to get returned to me from a drunken night out bowling, but will be supplying you with copious amounts of curry on it\u2019s imminent return. Cheers\u201d\n\nOctober 24 2006 \u2013 More curry is promised.\n\nRead: \u201cRealise it might be getting harder but need 6m kept as high as possible \u2026.tomorrow I have a massive fix, today just large. Ta mate Get your curry order ready will send [someone] round tomorrow.\n\nGoodman: How high \u2026 above 552?\n\nRead: If you can get them up there and keep them there tomorrow reckon the trader from ubs Tokyo will cover over and buy you a curry himself!\n\nIn a separate chat Read and Hayes discuss what is needed.\n\nRead: let me know a little later what you need . . . i know u want 6\u2032s high tomorrow\n\nHayes: well today and tomorrow then i can breath a little! 2morrow fix is huge 400b\n\nRead: i know you told me . . . ok as long as the futs don\u2019t get outdone by any libor moves south?\n\nHayes: \u2026libors going up saved me one day looked like i was going to lose 50m jpy on futs vs libs\n\nRead: ouch!\n\nHayes: but then 6m went up a bp and i was saved well almost\n\nRead: curry was cheap then :- D\n\nHayes: yes mate seriously whatever it takes bill me!\n\nOctober 25 2006 \u2013 Goodman makes a demand for more than curry. And signs it Mlord.\n\nGoodman: Depending where it sets k10 [a restaurant] for lunch or cash would be preferable!! Out or curry tonite. Mlord\n\nApril 18 2007 \u2013 Goodman gets fed up about not getting paid and complains to the boss Wilkinson.\n\nGoodman: \u201cwith ubs how much does he appreciate the yen libor scoop? It seems to me that he has all his glory etc and u guys get his support in other things. I get the drib and drabs. Life is tough enough over here without having to double guess the libors every morning and get zipper-de-do-da. How about some form of performance bonus per quarter from your b bonus pool to me for the libor service.\n\nWilkinson: Lord Baliff, I would suggest a lunch over golden week. Monday or Tuesday if you are around. As for kick backs etc we can discuss that at lunch and I will speak to Tom about it next time he comes up for a chat\n\nApril 19, 2007 \u2013 Goodman threatens to end the whole process if he isn\u2019t paid.\n\nFrom the DOJ complaint: Goodman sent Wilkinson an email with the subject line \u201cLIBORS NO MORE\u201d in which Goodman threatened to discontinue sending out misleading \u201cSUGGESTED LIBORS\u201d after Wilkinson informed him that a brokerage fee paid by Hayes was intended for the Yen MIRS desk brokers and not for Goodman. \u201cAs far as I was concerned tom was paying for the libor assist for my assistance. You have as far as I am concerened have charged him bro on the deal. Happy days for u. fyak all for me again!!\u201d Goodman signed the email \u201cMlord no more mr. libor.\u201d\n\nWilkinson responded \u201cI have been thinking of ways of sorting you out. If the needs be I will look into it on a bigger scale eg your salary package.\u201d\n\nJune 28, 2007 \u2013 Read, who emails in all caps, told Wilkinson that Hayes was getting hit hard.\n\n\u201cDAN THIS IS GETTING SERIOUS TOM I S NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE PROGRESSING . . . CAN YOU PLEASE GET HOLD OF COLIN AND GET HIM TO SEND OUT 6 MOS LIBOR AT 0.865 AND TO GET HIS BANKS SETTING IT HIGH. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE [HAYES] IS QUESTIONING MY (AND OUR) WORTH.\u201d\n\nNovember 1, 2007 \u2013 Read tells Hayes that they need to be \u201ca little more subtle.\u201d\n\nRead in an email to Hayes: \u201cHI MATE, JUST HAD DAN BACK ON RE-LIBORS, HAD A LOT OF COMPLIACNE PRESSURE RECENTLY DUE TO THE CREDIT PROBLEMS, WE BOTH NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE IN OUR \u2018VIEWS\u2019 \u2026 IE\u2019 I THINK FWDS ARE SUGGESTING THIS 6MOS LIBOR SHOULD BE LOWER \u2026 ETC. MY E-MAILS ETC. NEED TO BE WORDED MORE CAREFULLY.\u201d\n\nDecember 7, 2007: Read thanks Goodman and says champagne is coming.\n\nRead: Hi [Goodman], Thanks again for all your efforts, \u2026 Can you do your best to drive these libors higher,especially 3 mos if you can and it is still well bid\u2026.UBS had to stagger their move up but will definitely be in the count today. \u2026 p.s Bubbly on its way\n\nJanuary 2009 -- Read to an unnamed broker spells it out.\n\nRead: I hope Tom is not being too painful, he has had a storming start and is very happy with the libors Colin and yourselves re managing to fudge for him (as long as he thinks you are trying!).", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Libor Scandal has a new set of embarrassingly blatant instant messages and emails between top players.", "title": "Lord Libor Was Promised Curry: Highlights From the ICAP Libor Case", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/25/lord-libor-was-promised-curry-highlights-from-the-icap-libor-case/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-BY686_ICAP_G_20130924183956.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Lord Libor Was Promised Curry: Highlights From the ICAP Libor Case", "description": "The Libor Scandal has a new set of embarrassingly blatant instant messages and emails between top players.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "David Benoit", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The Libor Scandal has a new set of embarrassingly blatant instant messages and emails between top players.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-25T15:39:46-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/25/lord-libor-was-promised-curry-highlights-from-the-icap-libor-case/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-8813", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Libor Scandal has a new set of embarrassingly blatant instant messages and emails between top players.", "title": "Lord Libor Was Promised Curry: Highlights From the ICAP Libor Case", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/25/lord-libor-was-promised-curry-highlights-from-the-icap-libor-case/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-BY686_ICAP_G_20130924183956.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-8813", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-25T15:40:46-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9b1\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Goodman, dubbed Lord Libor, was in charge of emailing taders at large banks \u201csuggested Libors,\u201d a daily email with his firm\u2019s predictions for where Yen Libor would fall.\nHayes: \u2026libors going up saved me one day looked like i was going to lose 50m jpy on futs vs libsRead: ouch!\nMr. Hayes bet on the directions of Yen Libor, which was set in various month durations, such as six-month, or 6m, in their parlance.\nThat included Mr. Read, who executed trades for Mr. Hayes in the Yen Libor rate.\nGoodman: \u201cwith ubs how much does he appreciate the yen libor scoop?"}
