Enrollment had dipped below 600 \u2014 the lowest enrollment since at least World War II \u2014 and the school was operating at a deficit, with a crushing debt load.\n\nEnrollment has surged to nearly 1,300 today, but Sasse\u2019s detractors suggest that\u2019s largely due to an influx of students after Dana College in nearby Blair closed in 2010. Sasse said about 300 students \u2014 mostly freshmen and seniors \u2014 transferred from Dana, but most of those students are gone now, with about 67 remaining.\n\n\u201cThe Dana kids have nothing to do with Midlands\u2019 current enrollment,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nMidland began to falter in 2005; its audited financial statements show multimillion-dollar operating deficits from 2007 to 2010. In fiscal year 2010-2011, the school\u2019s revenue increased by $8.3 million, to $29 million, but it also increased its operating deficit from $2.8 million to $3.3 million. By 2012, the school was no longer in the red, generating $6.3 million in net income. According to the school\u2019s unaudited 2013 financial statement, net income was nearly $6 million.\n\n\u201cWhen we brought Ben on board the university was really in a crisis situation,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nIt takes time to right a ship unless you want to make draconian changes, he said. The college did have to spend money in 2010 to create new programs, including an MBA program that is now paying dividends, he said.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, we had the big turnaround,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nIn August, Forbes magazine dinged Midland for being one of the least financially fit four-year, nonprofit, private schools in the nation, giving the school a D, based on its 2010-2011 financial data. Out of the 900 schools analyzed by Forbes, just 108 got Ds, the lowest grade possible.\n\nPerkins said that analysis was based on 2009-2010 \u2014 the year Midland was considering filing for bankruptcy \u2014 and 2010-2011 financial statements. Sasse said it\u2019s not surprising Midland got a poor grade for those years.\n\n\u201cThey took a snapshot in time on two of the worst years the university had had,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cWhen you take a snapshot and it takes you more than a year to publish the information \u2026 a lot can happen in a 12-month period of time.\u201d\n\nForbes noted that financial woes are the leading cause of accreditation problems, and Midland is no stranger to that. After a campus visit in 2009, Midland\u2019s regional accrediting agency, the Higher Learning Commission, put the college \u201con notice\u201d in November 2012 due to concerns about its finances, planning and assessment processes.\n\nSasse reiterated that 2009 was the year Midland was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Midland has since filed audited financial statements with the Education Department in late 2012 and 2013 showing the gains it had made in finances and enrollment.\n\n\u201cTwo of the three things we were in trouble for went away,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nThe remaining issue, assessments, will be the focus of a campus visit by the commission later this year.\n\nAnother way to measure a school\u2019s financial health is to look at its credit ratings. Fitch credit rating agency has given Midland a B or \u201chighly speculative\u201d rating since 2011 based on its weak financial cushion and high debt burden.\n\nHowever, for the first time in years, the rating agency revised its outlook from negative to stable last year based on enrollment growth reaching the highest level in school history, successful fundraising, improved operations and debt reduction.\n\nMidland spokesman Nate Neufind said the outlook upgrade was the first in the school\u2019s bond rating history \u201cand came at a time when nearly the entire small-college sector was facing warnings and downgrades.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s whistling Dixie about the challenging environment for small colleges,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nPerkins said the ratings agencies have become more cautious after getting burned for being too generous with their ratings of financial institutions.\n\nFitch noted Midland\u2019s sizeable surplus in 2012, but also noticed its financial cushion declined as its endowment was tapped for operational support. The school borrowed $1.5 million from its endowment last year, leaving a modest balance of $6.8 million, a \u201clow level of operating flexibility\u201d that Fitch views as a \u201ckey vulnerability.\u201d\n\nPerkins said borrowing money was part of its turnaround plan. Sasse said the school began repaying the money in late 2013, a year earlier than required. Wall Street bond analysts would like to see endowments of $150 million to $300 million, which would mean most private schools are falling short, Sasse said. Midland\u2019s is about $10 million.\n\nNeufind said Midland is very \u201ctuition-driven,\u201d saying, \u201cFor us, enrollment\u2019s kind of everything.\u201d Forbes considers schools that rely on tuition for more than 60 percent of revenue to be at high risk, and calls tuition dependency the most serious risk facing \u201cmiddling colleges\u201d today.\n\nSasse said Midland\u2019s tuition dependency rate dropped from about 90 percent in 2010 to 76 percent this year.\n\n\u201cShould we work on it? Absolutely,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cWe would love the $300 million donor. Of course we want that, but the reality is we serve a lot of kids and we\u2019re changing a lot of people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nFitch noted the school\u2019s relatively high tuition subsidies and discounts for students transferring from Dana College, although the discounts dropped from 62 percent in 2011 to 55 percent in 2012.\n\nSasse said Midland honored the scholarships those students had at Dana.\n\n\u201cWe were just helping kids out,\u201d he said. \u201cDana did go bankrupt. Those kids didn\u2019t do anything wrong. So we had seriously discounted tuition.\u201d\n\nFitch expects Midland\u2019s discounts to normalize at around 50 percent, a level it still considers \u201cquite high.\u201d The school\u2019s regular tuition increases were partially offsetting the discounts. Tuition at Midland has increased an average of 4.4 percent since 2009, less than the 6-percent hikes the university had been averaging the five years prior. Sasse said nationally, 40 to 50 percent discounts are pretty typical for small colleges.\n\nFitch also said Midland has a high debt burden, noting that the lender of its biggest note, $3.6 million, forgave half of it in 2012. The school\u2019s annual debt service payment of $2 million amounts to nearly 9 percent of its operating revenue \u2014 although that\u2019s an improvement from nearly 14 percent previously.\n\nSasse said a lending group led by a Fremont bank had agreed to forgive that debt as a condition of his taking the job at Midland.\n\n\u201cWe have had two great fund raising years in a row,\u201d he said.\n\nPerkins said that shows how valuable Midland is to the community.\n\nFitch expects the school\u2019s financial performance to stabilize by fiscal year 2014.\n\nAnother measure of a university\u2019s financial fitness is the U.S. Education Department\u2019s \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d score, which uses colleges\u2019 audited financial statements to gauge their financial health, with scores ranging from -1 to 3. Anything above 1.5 is considered financially responsible.\n\nMidland\u2019s score dropped from 2.4 in 2009-2010 to 1.1 in 2010-2011, the most recent score available. That\u2019s considered financially responsible but requiring additional oversight, such as cash monitoring.\n\nAgain, those figures are computed using \u201clagging financial data,\u201d Sasse said, and although the latest scores aren\u2019t out yet, Midland\u2019s auditors can calculate what they will be, and he expects the new score to be \u201cwell north of that 2.4.\u201d\n\nPerkins said it\u2019s unfortunate that there\u2019s a \u201ca lot of false information going around\u201d now that Sasse is running for a major political office and in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cBen\u2019s been a great leader,\u201d he said. \u201cBen and his team have been very effective in engaging our donor in the university. That is a very tough thing to do. Ben was instrumental in getting the performance turned around.\u201d\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
