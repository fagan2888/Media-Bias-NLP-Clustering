Yet fermented foods, like sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, and prosciutto, are technically rotten. How can rotten food also be considered good food? The team behind MinuteEarth, a YouTube channel devoted to \u201cscience and stories about our awesome planet,\u201d breaks it down in their latest video.\n\nTurns out, our favorite foods are home to millions of microbes. In fact, many of the tastes and textures we love are because of tiny bacteria and fungi. Ninety-nine percent of these microbes are harmless to humans; it\u2019s the one percent that is gross enough to influence a natural aversion to anything that might harbor the nasty germs we think of when we think of rotten food.\n\nTake cheese, for example. Blue cheese's strong smell stems from the same bacteria responsible for foot odor. However, \u201cmold spores populate smalls holes and cracks in soon to be blue cheese[\u2026]giving it its smoothness and rich, funky flavor.\u201d This process is known as fermentation.\n\nFermented foods tend to be the ones people explain will \u201cgrow on you.\u201d These foods have been exposed to bacteria and yeasts, resulting in the flavors, textures and smells, that take time to get used to\u2026 because they're somewhat spoiled. But rest assured these friendly, fermented microbes are healthy and safe to consume.\n\nIn addition to sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, and kombucha are examples of good, albeit rotten food. Watch MinuteEarth's entire video for more on the process of fermentation \u2014 and why it\u2019s necessary for some foods to spoil a little bit.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "science, fermentation, when, rotten, food, actually, good, food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Rotten isn't a word we like to associate with food; it conjures stomach-upsetting tastes and smells.
