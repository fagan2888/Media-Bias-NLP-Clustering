John Barrow John BarrowDem files Ethics complaint on Benghazi panel Barrow thanks staff in farewell speech The best and the worst of the midterms MORE has heard the refrain before \u2014 this is finally the year Republicans will take him down.\n\nBut the Georgia Democrat is unfazed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think they have to make a different case than they\u2019re making now,\u201d he said of Republicans during a phone interview Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making the same case they\u2019ve made five times in a row,\u201d Barrow said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying the same case to the same jury.\u201d\n\nTo Barrow, the hits are familiar: he votes with President Obama 85 percent of the time, he hasn\u2019t cut spending enough and he\u2019s been in Washington too long.\n\nThe secret to his success, he says, and why he\u2019s again in a good position to win reelection is, \u201cIf you\u2019re working like the dickens for the people, they can judge for themselves.\u201d\n\nBarrow is far better off than fellow Blue Dog Democrats who are facing vigorous challenges, including Reps. Nick Rahall (W.Va.) and Ron Barber (Ariz.), or members like Reps. Mike McIntyre (N.C.) and Jim Matheson (Utah), who opted for retirement instead of another tough reelection slog.\n\nRepublicans hold out hope that lightning will strike, thanks to a combination of the president\u2019s unpopularity, frustration with Washington and depressed midterm turnout.\n\nThey note that this is the first time Barrow will face midterm voters in a more conservative district, redrawn to the GOP\u2019s advantage, that\u2019s taken out much of Barrow\u2019s Savannah base.\n\nTwo years ago, Republicans fumbled their first chance at defeating Barrow in the new district, but that was a year when Obama was at the top of the ticket. State Rep. Lee Anderson, Barrow\u2019s 2012 opponent, is still derided by many operatives as one of the worst candidates of all time.\n\nIn 2014, Republicans have turned to wealthy businessman Rick Allen, who came in third in the GOP race two years ago. Allen surprised many by winning the primary this time without a runoff, and by all accounts he\u2019s a much stronger opponent.\n\nStill, Barrow\u2019s bipartisan credentials are strong. He\u2019s one of just a handful of Democrats the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has endorsed this cycle and he frequently splits from his party on major votes, including on ObamaCare.\n\nHis ads are always among the best, showcasing his homespun, folksy approach. A 2012 spot, for example, showed him brandishing his grandfather\u2019s \u201clittle Smith & Wesson\u201d and rifle, declaring \u201cain\u2019t nobody gonna take \u2019em away.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans to win, they have to tie Barrow to Obama at every turn. Watching Allen\u2019s ads, one would think he\u2019s running against Obama, not Barrow; most ads don\u2019t even mention Barrow\u2019s name, blasting the president over healthcare and the Veterans Affairs scandal.\n\n\u201cEvidently my opponent is running against someone other than me for a different job,\u201d Barrow laughed.\n\nAllen, a wealthy construction company owner, argues Obama and Barrow are the same.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday on Capitol Hill, Allen said he learned a lot from his first loss and that this time will be different.\n\nThe challenger comes from the new part of the district, near Augusta. Raised on a farm in Columbia County, he left to attend Auburn University but returned to eventually found his own commercial construction company. He talks of his business experience, in which he struggled to build his company up and to create hundreds of jobs, as traits he would bring to Congress.\n\nIn 2012 and again this year, some Republicans privately expressed concern he would be painted as a \u201ccountry club Republican\u201d and wouldn\u2019t appeal to the district\u2019s more rural, Southern base, but Allen says that\u2019s unfounded.\n\n\u201cI love to get my hands dirty. I\u2019ve got a pickup truck, I like to get out in those fields, and mix it up with the farm,\u201d Allen says with a smile, talking excitedly about cotton that will soon be ripe for picking and baling.\n\nBoth parties are spending big on the race, but Democrats are especially going all in.\n\nAccording to a source tracking ad buys, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has reserved $1.2 million so far through Election Day. The National Republican Congressional Committee has reserved $925,000, but that could increase.\n\nDemocratic ads have already tried to sully Allen\u2019s business record, hitting his company for accepting millions of dollars in government contracts that went over budget.\n\nAccording to Republicans in the state, this could be the make-or-break year to take out Barrow finally.\n\n\u201cIf [Barrow] survives this race, then he\u2019s probably going to be there as long as he wants to, but I think this may actually be the year that something happens,\u201d predicted Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Georgia GOP operative.\n\nTanenblatt called Allen a strong candidate and said that in the current political climate, \u201call bets are off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t look at past elections. [Barrow has] never been in a situation with a president of his party in his second term who has such a dismal approval rating,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat John Barrow. He is a very aggressive campaigner. He blocks and tackles very well,\u201d Georgia GOP consultant Chip Lake admitted. \u201cAt the end of the day, all we need to do is defeat him once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this will be Barrow\u2019s biggest test and his biggest challenge because of math,\u201d he added.\n\nIf Barrow goes down, though, it might end up being more about the political climate than his opponent or even himself, and likely means Democratic losses are widespread.\n\nStill, Republicans have learned time and again, to their frustration, never count John Barrow out.\n\n\u201cBarrow is a savvy politician, and I think he still has the advantage in the race,\u201d one Georgia Republican strategist said.\n\n\u201cEventually, he will go down,\u201d the strategist said of Barrow. \u201cHe can\u2019t fight that tide forever. There\u2019s a plausible case for how Rick Allen wins this race, but it\u2019s heavily reliant on things outside his control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
