To alleviate traffic snarls, the university is limiting all parking lots to move-in traffic only. Tuesday: 6 to 9 p.m., 500 students Wednesday: 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., 1,400 students 6-9 p.m., 2,500 students Thursday: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., 3,700 students For information about move-in: housing.colorado.edu\n\nCU-Boulder payment plan options bursar.colorado.edu/payments/payment-plans/ or call 303-492-5381\n\n\"Question: is the amount on our bill for the whole year or just fall semester???\"\n\n\"Just for the fall semester.\"\n\n\"Sweet God that is a lot of money.\"\n\nThat exchange on the University of Colorado Class of 2019 Facebook group exemplifies the sticker shock many CU freshmen are feeling this week as they look at their first-ever tuition bill before the start of the fall semester.\n\nThough many students have been estimating what college will cost for them for months or years, nothing prepared them \u2014 or their parents \u2014 for staring at that often five-figure lump sum a few weeks before their first class.\n\n\"Actually my mom was there with me,\" said Juan Guevara, 18, of Thornton. \"My mom freaked out. She's like 'Are you freaking serious? Is that just for fall?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tuition bills, which went out by email last week, didn't yet account for financial aid, scholarships and loans, so Guevara tried to comfort his mother by assuring her that the number on the screen in front of them would decrease.\n\nEven so, Guevara's grandmother is taking money from her retirement savings to help him cover tuition, room and board and fees, and he's planning to take out some student loans. He hopes to earn an ROTC scholarship for the final three years of college at his \"dream school.\"\n\n\"Half of me is just like, wow, the school of my dreams is sucking the living crap out of me,\" Guevara said. \"They're squeezing every last penny they can.\"\n\nFor in-state students taking 30 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences, tuition and fees for the 2015-2016 academic year total $11,091. That total can increase depending on a few factors, such as whether or not the student enrolls in CU's health insurance or if the student selects a more expensive major, such as engineering or business.\n\nRoom and board costs can range from roughly $13,000 to $17,000 per year.\n\nWhen compared to peer institutions, CU-Boulder's in-state tuition rates, plus fees, are average \u2014 the campus falls in the middle of many other public schools. When state support gets factored in, the campus's in-state tuition and fees fall near the very bottom of the peer spectrum.\n\nBut of course, none of that matters to incoming freshmen, who only see what they'll be paying at CU, not what they could have been paying elsewhere.\n\nThe Bursar's Office, which sends bills and collects tuition, fees, room and board and other university-related expenses for the campus, calls this time of year their \"Superbowl,\" said Jean Thomson, the bursar.\n\n\"We take lots and lots of phone calls this time of year,\" she said. \"Hundreds a day. It's the beginning of the semester, and for the new students, they do have a bit of sticker shock, but they also have an awful lot of other new experiences so I think it's easy to become overwhelmed.\"\n\nThe Bursar's Office connects students and parents to financial aid and other resources on campus. Thomson said they've also been people letting people know about the new interest-free payment plan options offered by the campus, which can make that cringe-worthy total a bit easier to stomach.\n\n\"What the payment plan does is allows people to manage their cash flow, so I may not have $10,000 today, but I know that over the next four months I'm going to have $2,500 a month that I can pay toward my tuition and then I've paid off the bill,\" Thomson said.\n\nThough Thomson said it's a bit too late in the process for students to apply for financial aid, the campus has increased its investment in institutional financial aid from $59.6 million in 2007 to $121.2 million in the current fiscal year and university budget officials say they've done their best to keep tuition increases low.\n\nEven with CU's middle-of-the-pack tuition and investments in financial aid, college is expensive, no matter where students enroll, and CU's new freshmen are getting their first taste of the cost of their degree.\n\nMarisa Rincon, an incoming freshman who lives in Erie and plans to study marketing, said she was \"terrified\" when she saw her bill for $17,685 for the semester, before financial aid, scholarships and grants were applied later in the week.\n\nRincon said she'd been applying for loans for \"24 hours straight\" without much luck because she has no credit and her parents have poor credit, she said.\n\n\"As I get older and I have to do this on my own, I don't think people realize how much of a burden it is to go to school,\" she said. \"If you don't come from money, how much of a struggle it is and I know that this will affect me for the rest of my life. This decision is going to determine my financial stability for the rest of my life, which is terrifying.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28642891/cu-boulder-freshmen-facing-sticker-shock-first-tuition", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28642891:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-16T11:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "\"Question: is the amount on our bill for the whole year or just fall semester???\"", "title": "CU-Boulder freshmen facing sticker shock with first tuition bill", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28642891/cu-boulder-freshmen-facing-sticker-shock-first-tuition", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-08-18T13:08:51-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-14T16:18:08-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-08-14T16:24:17-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-16T11:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder freshmen facing sticker shock with first tuition bill", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "\"Question: is the amount on our bill for the whole year or just fall semester???\"", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28642891/cu-boulder-freshmen-facing-sticker-shock-first-tuition", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "\"Question: is the amount on our bill for the whole year or just fall semester???\"", "title": "CU-Boulder freshmen facing sticker shock with first tuition bill"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd918e\"", "article_summary": "When state support gets factored in, the campus's in-state tuition and fees fall near the very bottom of the peer spectrum.\nEven with CU's middle-of-the-pack tuition and investments in financial aid, college is expensive, no matter where students enroll, and CU's new freshmen are getting their first taste of the cost of their degree.\nThat exchange on the University of Colorado Class of 2019 Facebook group exemplifies the sticker shock many CU freshmen are feeling this week as they look at their first-ever tuition bill before the start of the fall semester.\nThe Bursar's Office connects students and parents to financial aid and other resources on campus.\nFor in-state students taking 30 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences, tuition and fees for the 2015-2016 academic year total $11,091."}
