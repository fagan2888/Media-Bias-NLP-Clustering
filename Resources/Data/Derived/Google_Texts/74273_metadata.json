Following raccoons and bats, domestic cats are the animal third most likely to test positive for rabies in Florida.\n\nAn unvaccinated pet increases your family\u2019s risk for exposure to this deadly disease. Dogs and cats without a current veterinarian-administered rabies vaccination should not be left outside unsupervised.\n\nThis is the eighth Bay County animal testing positive for rabies in 2013. Other Bay County animals testing positive for rabies in 2013 include six raccoons and one domestic cat, the most recent being rabid raccoons killed near the south end of the Baily Bridge in October and near the intersection of East 12th Street and Bob Little Road at the end of November.\n\nRaccoons and bats are the Florida animals most frequently testing positive for rabies. Raccoons can secrete the rabies virus in their saliva before they have noticeable symptoms. All contact with raccoons and bats should be avoided. As well, it is illegal to feed raccoons, either directly or indirectly. Feeding raccoons artificially increases their population and increases the likelihood diseases like rabies will spread and conflicts with dogs or cats will occur.\n\nThe following advice is issued:\n\n\uf097 Secure outside garbage in covered containers to avoid attracting wild animals.\n\n\uf097 Do not leave pet food outside overnight as this attracts wild animals to your home and increases the chance of a pet-raccoon conflict.\n\n\uf097 If bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the wound immediately with soap and water. Seek medical treatment as needed and report the injury to the Florida Department of Health in Bay\n\nCounty at (850) 872-4455, X1125. If the animal is stray or wild, call 911 or Bay County\n\nAnimal Control at (850) 248-6034 and report the animal\u2019s location. Follow up. Rabies is\n\npreventable when treatment is provided in a timely manner.\n\n\uf097 If your dog or cat fights with a wild animal, contact the Florida Department of Health in Bay County immediately. The wild animal will need to be tested for rabies. Your animal may need to be quarantined. Do not shoot suspected rabid animals in the head.\n\n\uf097 Do not touch animals that are not yours. Avoid contact with all wildlife, especially raccoons, bats, bobcats, otters, foxes, skunks and coyotes. No animal is too young to have rabies. A rabid animal may act friendly.\n\n\uf097 Wear rubber gloves and protective eyewear when dressing/butchering wild animals to avoid exposure to rabies and other diseases. Cook all meat thoroughly to 165 degrees.\n\n\uf097 For general questions pertaining to stray animals or odd acting wild animals, contact your area\u2019s animal control department.\n\n\uf097 For questions regarding the health of an animal, contact a veterinarian.\n\n\uf097 Teach your children about rabies and to never touch a bat.\n\nFor further information on rabies, go to the Florida Department of Health website: website http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/medicine/rabies/rabies-index.html or contact the Florida Department of Health in Bay County at 850-872-4720, X1125.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A raccoon killed in a neighborhood between the west ends of Venetian Way and Kristanna Drive has tested positive for rabies", "language": "english", "author": "Joe Moore    Twitter: @TV7NewsGuy", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Rabid-Raccoon-Killed-North-of-Venetian-Way-in-the-City-of-Panama-City-236876061.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/525*315/AnimalsRabies.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A raccoon killed in a neighborhood between the west ends of Venetian Way and Kristanna Drive has tested positive for rabies", "title": "Rabid Raccoon Killed North of Venetian Way in the City of Panama City"}, "twitter": {"description": "A raccoon killed in a neighborhood between the west ends of Venetian Way and Kristanna Drive has tested positive for rabies", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Rabid-Raccoon-Killed-North-of-Venetian-Way-in-the-City-of-Panama-City-236876061.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/525*315/AnimalsRabies.jpg", "title": "Rabid Raccoon Killed North of Venetian Way in the City of Panama City", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Rabid Raccoon Killed North of Venetian Way in the City of Panama City", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Rabid Raccoon Killed North of, Venetian Way in the City"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde6b\"", "article_summary": "\uf097 For general questions pertaining to stray animals or odd acting wild animals, contact your area\u2019s animal control department.\n\uf097 If your dog or cat fights with a wild animal, contact the Florida Department of Health in Bay County immediately.\n\uf097 Do not leave pet food outside overnight as this attracts wild animals to your home and increases the chance of a pet-raccoon conflict.\nThe following advice is issued:\uf097 Secure outside garbage in covered containers to avoid attracting wild animals.\nA raccoon killed in a neighborhood between the west ends of Venetian Way and Kristanna Drive has tested positive for rabies."}
