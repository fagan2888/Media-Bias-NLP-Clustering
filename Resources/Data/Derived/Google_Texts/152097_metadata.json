Nobody.\u201d The word \"Christ\" is crossed out, just in case their message wasn't clear enough.\n\nThe American Atheists maintain that their latest entry in the annual \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d saga is a message to other atheists that they are not alone.\n\nIn a recent Fox News appearance, American Atheists President Dave Silverman said, \u201cThe point that we\u2019re trying to make is that there\u2019s a whole bunch of people out there for whom religion is the worst part of Christmas, but they go to church anyways, and we\u2019re here to tell them they don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nWhile that intention is important and admirable, very few people\u2014atheist or theist\u2014seem to interpret the message as welcoming to anyone. Many of the responses I\u2019ve seen have been vitriolic and disturbingly anti-atheist.\n\nWhich raises the question: If the goal truly is to reach isolated atheists, why does the advertisement read as a dig at Christians? A better billboard for American Atheists\u2019s stated aim might read: \u201cDon\u2019t celebrate Christmas? You\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nAs atheists become more visible in our society, the entire \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d back-and-forth feels ugly and unnecessary. Worse still, it seems to do little more than offer ammunition to those claiming atheists are just mean-spirited grinches. Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2014one of the major \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d soldiers\u2014made that clear when he and I discussed the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d a couple of weeks ago.\n\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: There is no war on Christmas.\n\nWe live in a culture that privileges stories of conflict, so it\u2019s understandable that this narrative would gain traction\u2014with or without billboards. Much of this narrative is a manifestation of religious fears about our increasingly secular society, and it reflects widespread anxieties about atheists and religious differences. But it doesn\u2019t reflect reality.\n\nRather, as religious diversity in the U.S. has become more recognizable, Americans have largely broadened their approach to this time of year. According to new data from the Public Religion Research Institute, the percentage of Americans who prefer the inclusive \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d or \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings\u201d has now exceeded the percentage that prefers \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Christmas is under attack; instead, our society is becoming better at embracing its religious diversity and challenging the notion that a single majority religion should dominate public expressions of belief.\n\nSo why does the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d narrative persist?\n\nBased on how much play they give it each December, the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d narrative seems to be good for Fox News ratings. And American Atheists has openly admitted that it is good for their pocketbooks, as their talk show appearances bring in a swell of donations.\n\nConsider this from a recent profile of Silverman:\n\n\u201cSilverman\u2019s notorious anti-Christmas billboards and subsequent TV appearances have breathed new life into American Atheists and are often followed by an uptick in subscribers and donations. ... According to Silverman, the primary objective of the billboards is to get invitations to talk shows.\u201d\n\nIn other words: American Atheists and Fox News - alongside conservatives like Sarah Palin - seem to have discovered a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nBut does this relationship benefit atheists more broadly? Does it accurately represent the sentiments of nontheists in this country? Does it improve atheist-theist relations?\n\nDoes it lessen the widespread stigma and distrust that exists between atheists and theists, which enables atheist marginalization across the U.S.? Does it invite Christians to think critically about religious privilege?\n\nMany atheists, myself included, suspect that there are more effective approaches to tackling these important issues.\n\nTo start, atheists can build positive relationships with believers to humanize our communities and educate one another about our differences. That\u2019s something that billboards, for all of their flash and fundraising capabilities, likely won\u2019t accomplish.\n\nAtheists face real marginalization in the U.S., and it should be robustly challenged.\n\nBut we also have good tidings and great joy to offer\u2014important contributions to the public square that are currently being drowned out by attention-grabbing billboards claiming \u201cnobody\u201d needs Christ in Christmas.\n\nIn the spirit of generosity, compassion, and kindness so often associated with this time of year, let\u2019s ditch the billboards and build relationships of goodwill.\n\nChris Stedman is the Assistant Humanist Chaplain at Harvard University, Coordinator of Humanist Life for the Yale Humanist Community, and author of \"Faitheist: How an Atheist Found Common Ground with the Religious.\" You can follow him on Twitter at @ChrisDStedman.\n\nThe views expressed in this column belong to Stedman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by Chris Stedman, special to CNN (CNN) -- The \u201cWar on Christmas:\u201d \u00a0what \u2014 or who\u2014is it good for?
