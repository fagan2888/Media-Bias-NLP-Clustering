That was true for 54% of respondents in 2012 and 52% the next year.\n\nAs a result of a service that often hurts as much as it helps, 68% of bank consumers say they prefer that a transaction be declined rather than processed at the cost of a penalty fee, and 28% of overdrafters say that they closed a checking account in the past because of overdrafts.\n\n\"Bank account overdraft protection is just a marketing term,\" says Brian Penny, a banking industry veteran who's worked at Bank of America, Chase and American Express. \"In my view, having your checking pull from your savings account to avoid overdrafts defeats the purpose of a separate savings account.\"\n\nIf you're going to have overdraft protection, Penny advises negotiating it at the right level. \"Always ask for a supervisor when negotiating overdraft refunds \u2014 they have higher limits of credits to give customers, and at Bank of America and other banks, once the associate gives a credit, the manager is locked out of giving an additional credit,\" he says. \"This is to ensure nobody at the bank is overly generous.\"", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "More than half of bank customers don't even recall 'opting in' to overdraft coverage despite having paid a penalty fee, and that's just the start of overdraft issues.", "author": "Brian O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "More than half of bank customers don't even recall 'opting in' to overdraft coverage despite having paid a penalty fee, and that's just the start of overdraft issues.", "title": "What You Need to Know to Minimize Those Costly Bank Overdrafts", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/what-you-need-to-know-to-minimize-those-costly-bank-overdrafts", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/overdraftshock.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/overdraftshock.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "banks, bank overdrafts, overdraft fees, bank fees, checking accounts, Pew", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "Pew", "published_time": "2015-04-15T10:00Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/459200"}, "date": "2015-04-15T10:00Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13110501, "twitter": {"description": "More than half of bank customers don't even recall 'opting in' to overdraft coverage despite having paid a penalty fee, and that's just the start of overdraft issues.", "title": "What You Need to Know to Minimize Those Costly Bank Overdrafts", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/what-you-need-to-know-to-minimize-those-costly-bank-overdrafts", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/overdraftshock.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/overdraftshock.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "banks, bank overdrafts, overdraft fees, bank fees, checking accounts, Pew"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb43a\"", "article_summary": "\"In my view, having your checking pull from your savings account to avoid overdrafts defeats the purpose of a separate savings account.\"\nADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 Many consumers don't even know if they have or have not opted out of bank overdraft protection.\n\"Bank account overdraft protection is just a marketing term,\" says Brian Penny, a banking industry veteran who's worked at Bank of America, Chase and American Express.\nIf you're going to have overdraft protection, Penny advises negotiating it at the right level.\nThat's dangerous when a bank charges a \"$35 or so\" overdraft penalty fee every time it covers the difference between an everyday debit or ATM charge and what's in your account."}
