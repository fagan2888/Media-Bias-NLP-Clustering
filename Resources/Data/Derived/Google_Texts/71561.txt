President Obama should have seen the sign.

The White House Twitter account posted a picture of Obama grinning widely holding a placard encouraging Americans to enroll for Obamacare, but thanks to the magic of Photoshop, the sign soon became a message board for all kinds of spoofs.

First in line was Obama's nemesis, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who changed the President's message from "Get covered because ... nobody should go broke because they get sick!" to "Get covered because Obamacare cancelled the plan that you had and liked!"

Other messages included "Get covered because I said so," and NowThis News emblazoned Obama's visual aide with its company logo.

Yet another manipulation shows Obama holding the infamous photo of himself posing for a selfie Tuesday at Mandela's memorial service.

The #GetCovered hashtag on social media met with another embarrassment: A spelling error in an image said people should enroll because "it'll give your mom piece of mind."

Despite the typo, the White House left the image posted.

A caption for the tweet did have the correct spelling of "peace."

"Get Covered" is a slogan used by the nonprofit Enroll America, a grassroots campaign closely tied to the White House that is promoting the Affordable Care Act.
