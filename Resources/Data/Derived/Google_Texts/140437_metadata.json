However, if a recent survey is any indication, it could be difficult to get those two sides of healthcare to cooperate with one another for a smooth process.\n\nThe 2014 FTI consulting Payer-Provider Survey found that 41 percent of primary care physicians not currently in a value-based relationship say their biggest obstacle before entering one is their distrust of payers. That could be a big issue for payers to overcome, as provider buy-in and engagement are typically cited as critical to the success of value-based arrangements, the report said.\n\nAdditionally, just 16 percent of surveyed physicians were willing to accept the financial risk, which is an important aspect of many value-based relationships sought by insurers, the report\u2019s author\u2019s explained.\n\nMark Fish, Managing Director of the FTI Consulting Health Solutions team, discussed the survey results with RevCycleIntellegence.com, and said that while a transformation is happening in healthcare, there is clearly still a ways to go.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in reality is that the transition is probably [happening] at a slower pace or more cautious pace than what we had really kind of expected,\u201d Fish said. \u201cAdditionally, there are some barriers that people really need to overcome to make that happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fish, the three main barriers that healthcare payers and providers need to overcome are: providers being willing to take on risk, information technology, and clinical integration and scale.\n\nFor example, only 16 percent of providers said that they were willing to accept financial risk. However, 92 percent of providers said that contracts for value-based arrangements incentivized by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are either \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d to them.\n\n\u201cRight now a lot of the models are shared savings, where providers have the ability to share in savings if they\u2019re generated,\u201d Fish explained. \u201cBut if there\u2019s any sort of negative aspect or if there are years that don\u2019t meet up to expectations, then the providers aren\u2019t at risk of that. I think that for this really to move forward, what we\u2019re hearing from the payers is they\u2019d like to see the providers willingness to take on more risk.\u201d\n\nThe second barrier discussed in the survey is IT integration. While there has been a lot of investment in those areas, particularly electronic health records and population health management tools (PHM), Fish said that different tools and products can\u2019t always \u201ctalk to one another.\u201d\n\nEssentially, physicians may have made investments, but the products are on different platforms or are different versions. Then, they cannot always communicate with other hospitals or practices.\n\nThe survey found that only 50 percent of healthcare providers said their organizations have implemented new technology or software to support PHM and value-based reimbursement, while 32 percent have not. However, 80 percent of payers say they would be likely to contract with a clinically-integrated hospital and provider system.\n\nClinical integration and scale was the last major barrier in the payer-provider relationship, according to the survey. According to Fish, for clinical integration to be successful, there has to be outreach to independent physicians. But it must be done in a way that is nonthreatening.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of clinical integration is doing [outreach] in a way information is equally shared and can be acted upon so that you\u2019re really capturing all the activities for a given population in a given community,\u201d Fish said. \u201cThere needs to be more effort around that outreach, which hasn\u2019t always happened.\u201d\n\nWhile the process might not happen overnight, Fish explained that the payer-provider gap can shrink with the right approach. The key is to not \u201cjump into it full steam,\u201d he said. Instead, expectations need to be set up front so both parties understand what is required. From there, see how it works over the next few years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 2014 FTI consulting Payer-Provider Survey found that there is a gap between healthcare payers and providers about value-based reimbursements.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/how-value-based-reimbursement-created-a-payer-provider-gap", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2014-10-02-474237059.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "How Value-Based Reimbursement Created a Payer-Provider Gap"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 2014 FTI consulting Payer-Provider Survey found that there is a gap between healthcare payers and providers about value-based reimbursements.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2014-10-02-474237059.jpg"}, "title": "How Value-Based Reimbursement Created a Payer-Provider Gap", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcf4\"", "article_summary": "As the transition from volume-based reimbursement to value-based reimbursement continues, it is essential for healthcare payers and providers to work together.\nThe survey found that only 50 percent of healthcare providers said their organizations have implemented new technology or software to support PHM and value-based reimbursement, while 32 percent have not.\nThe 2014 FTI consulting Payer-Provider Survey found that 41 percent of primary care physicians not currently in a value-based relationship say their biggest obstacle before entering one is their distrust of payers.\nClinical integration and scale was the last major barrier in the payer-provider relationship, according to the survey.\nHowever, 92 percent of providers said that contracts for value-based arrangements incentivized by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are either \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d to them."}
