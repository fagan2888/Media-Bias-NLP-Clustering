The young lady was very distraught and screaming ... I took ahold of her, then she kinda just collapsed in my arms. I just tried to encourage her to hold on.\"\n\nHer identity remains a mystery, but Gilmore believes she had a close connection to the victim.\n\nIt's a moment Gilmore said will live forever in his memory.\n\n\"At the time, I thought I was gonna just lose myself, but I tried to hold it together for her.\"\n\nPolice are still looking for Morency's killer. They said the car used in the drive-by was a 1980's to early 90's black two-door Chevrolet Monte Carlo, recognizable by its red pinstripes, stock wheels and lack of tinted windows.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call Detective Al Antonini of the Fort Myers Police Department at (239) 321-7700, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS or text message C-R-I-M-E-S (274637) Keyword FMPD. Tipsters can remain anonymous.\n\nFort Myers Councilman Johnny Streets said Thursday the home where the killing happened belongs to his nephew, a Lee County deputy.\n\nNeighbors said they watched the family put shutters over the windows of the home shortly after the shooting.\n\nMany in the neighborhood said Morency was dating someone who lived there and said there was a gathering outside the home before the shooting.\n\nThey don't believe Morency was the target, but like police, are fed up with the violence and hope someone comes forward.\n\n\"The community is tired of falling for anything, seeing our young men die, it's time out for it,\" Gilmore said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Fort Myers pastor gave his first-hand account of a Thanksgiving Day murder as police continue to hunt for suspects.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/30620170/dunbar-pastor-gives-account-of-fatal-thanksgiving-day-shooting", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Fort Myers pastor gave his first-hand account of a Thanksgiving Day murder as police continue to hunt for suspects.", "title": "Dunbar pastor gives account of fatal Thanksgiving Day shooting"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/9349378_G.jpg", "description": "A Fort Myers pastor gave his first-hand account of a Thanksgiving Day murder as police continue to hunt for suspects.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dunbar pastor gives account of fatal Thanksgiving Day shooting"}, "wnreadableurl": "dunbar-pastor-gives-account-of-fatal-thanksgiving-day-shooting", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2015/11/28", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS31"}, "article_summary": "A Fort Myers pastor gave his first-hand account of a Thanksgiving Day murder as police continue to hunt for suspects.\nFort Myers Pastor Maurice Gilmore was inside his home on Barden Street when he heard the unmistakable sound of gunfire.\nFort Myers Councilman Johnny Streets said Thursday the home where the killing happened belongs to his nephew, a Lee County deputy.\n\"It sounded like something you would try to duck, and try and hide being hit by,\" Gilmore said.\n\"At the time, I thought I was gonna just lose myself, but I tried to hold it together for her.\""}
