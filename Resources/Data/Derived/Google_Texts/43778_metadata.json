Friday said that it is spending nearly $1.2 billion to build its stake in AmerisourceBergen, the pharmaceutical wholesaler that supplies its drugstores, mail order and specialty pharmaceutical businesses.\n\nThe nation's largest drugstore chain says it will own a 15 percent stake after exercising warrants to purchase 22.7 million shares.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. started building that stake in 2013, when the companies entered a 10-year supply agreement. Walgreens still holds warrants to buy another 22.7 million shares in the Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, company.\n\nBy combining its distribution in the United States and Europe with AmerisourceBergen, Walgreen will be able to negotiate better prices for those bulk drugs, the company has said. In addition, it said it will have new access to more specialized drugs.\n\nThere is pressure on the health care industry, from pharmaceutical makers to sellers, to cut medical costs, especially as millions of Americans adapt to the Affordable Care Act. Consumers have also reduced their own spending on prescriptions, making it even tougher to increase profitability in the business, experts say.\n\nThe deal gives AmerisourceBergen and Walgreen a boost in size that can help them negotiate better prices.\n\nWalgreens runs more than 13,000 drugstores in 11 countries. It plans to boost that total by buying rival drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp. for more than $9 billion, a deal expected to close later this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. bought $1.17 billion share of Amerisource Bergen, a global generics purchasing company and specialty pharamacy.", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. bought $1.17 billion share of Amerisource Bergen, a global generics purchasing company and specialty pharamacy.", "title": "Walgreens Boots buys bigger stake in AmerisourceBergen", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160318/business/160318688/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160318/business/160318688/AR/0/AR-160318688.jpg&updated=201603181603&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. bought $1.17 billion share of Amerisource Bergen, a global generics purchasing company and specialty pharamacy.", "title": "Walgreens Boots buys bigger stake in AmerisourceBergen", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160318/business/160318688/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160318/business/160318688/AR/0/AR-160318688.jpg&updated=201603181603&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "Business, Health Care, Deerfield", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2016-03-18", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T20:03:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Walgreens Boots buys bigger stake in AmerisourceBergenhelloDeerfield-based Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.
