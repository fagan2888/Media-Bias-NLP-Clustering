The subject of the chief\u2019s presentation was one of Mr Roberts\u2019s predecessors: Charles Evans Hughes, the white-bearded, aquiline-nosed figure who steered the Supreme Court through the fraught New Deal era in the 1930s. Though the programme\u2019s sponsors promised an exploration of Mr Hughes's \"impact on our legal history\", nary a word was heard about doctrine or jurisprudence. Specific cases were mentioned only in passing. The focus of the evening was on the whiskers and spirit of the man Teddy Roosevelt once called a \u201cbearded iceberg\u201d and whose career included stints as associate justice of the Supreme Court, governor of New York, secretary of state and Republican nominee for president before he was tapped by Herbert Hoover to return to the Supreme Court to take the chief's gavel in 1930.\n\nThough clean-shaven and undoubtedly perkier than his stiff forebear, Chief Justice Roberts offered a jaunty analysis of Chief Justice Hughes that betrayed important similarities between the two men. Mr Hughes oversaw a \u201csharply divided court\u201d, Mr Roberts noted, and helped the justices learn how to \u201cdisagree without being disagreeable\u201d. As the leader of a similarly riven bench today, Chief Justice Roberts has attracted strong criticism from both left and right. Liberals lament Mr Roberts\u2019 votes to unleash outside campaign spending five years ago in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission and, in 2013, to gut the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder. Meanwhile, Mr Roberts was pronounced an \u201coutcast among conservatives\u201d after he saved Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act from constitutional and statutory challenges in 2012 and 2015.\n\nThe equal-opportunity criticism that has been heaped upon Mr Roberts may be a sign he is no slave to ideology, though any fair accounting of his record would find him landing in the conservative camp much more often than on the side of the liberals. A roughly comparable ideological mix defined the tenure of Chief Justice Hughes. Shepherding the Court through the fight over Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programmes, Chief Justice Hughes took a centrist approach. At times he voted with the Court\u2019s conservatives (and, in the unanimous 1935 decision in Schechter Poultry Corp. v US, with its liberals too) to strike down as unconstitutional legislation that may have gone too far in regulating the economy. But in 1937, Mr Hughes authored West Coast Hotel v Parrish, a major decision upholding a minimum-wage law in the state of Washington. From that year until his retirement in 1941, Mr Hughes voted consistently to let President Roosevelt\u2019s policies well alone. In Mr Roberts\u2019s words, he moved the court beyond one in which \u201cnine old men were striking down everything FDR tried to do\u201d.\n\nIn a dialogue with Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann after his presentation, Mr Roberts praised Mr Hughes\u2019s understated but effective effort to resist President Roosevelt\u2019s plan in 1937 to pack the Supreme Court with six additional appointees. It was widely understood that FDR\u2019s true motivation for adding justices was to build a majority that would uphold his New Deal policies, but he proposed the plan as a way to help the justices get their work done more efficiently. Deftly calling FDR\u2019s bluff, Mr Hughes wrote a letter to the Senate detailing just how effectively the nine justices were already acquitting themselves and arguing that a bench of 15 would make the institution slow and unwieldy. The letter \u201cfought against the fig leaf\u201d justification and \u201ctook the air out\u201d of FDR\u2019s scheme, Mr Roberts said. The plan soon fizzled out without undue drama or confrontation.\n\nAddressing the contours of a chief justice\u2019s leadership, Mr Roberts acknowledged that his vote is just one of nine and that Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, with 30 and 25 years on the bench, respectively, exercise their own degrees of authority. He quipped that unlike a CEO, he could neither fire his subordinates nor \u201cdock their pay\u201d. But a chief justice must lead by \u201cmoderat[ing] the discussion\u201d during hearings, Mr Roberts said, and can bestow \u201corder and decorum\u201d on the institution by establishing an appropriate \u201ctone\u201d and keeping an eye out for the justices\u2019 relationships on the court. Martha Minow, dean of the Harvard Law School, wrote recently that Mr Roberts has, \u201cright from the start\u201d, shown \u201cmastery and deft management\u201d in his leadership of the Court. A couple of somewhat intemperate dissents to one side\u2014in the same-sex marriage case last summer, he wrote that \u201c[f]ive lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage, [s]tealing this issue from the people\u201d\u2014Ms Minow\u2019s assessment is just about right.\n\nChief Justice Roberts comes off as disarmingly charming, exuding fair-mindedness and an understated wit. (Flashing a photo of his subject at age 6 during last week\u2019s talk, he deadpanned that Charles Evans Hughes \u201cwas not born with a beard\u201d.) With all the bracing controversies on his docket\u2014including, this year, abortion, affirmative action, the fate of public unions and Obamacare (yet again)\u2014John Roberts keeps his focus on the integrity of his court and how it is perceived, both at home and abroad. The Supreme Court stands as a beacon for similar courts around the world, he said, particularly for judges hailing from countries where the concept of an independent judiciary is novel. When his counterparts from other countries visit Washington, DC, \u201cthey are coming for inspiration.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s building, the justices\u2019 majestic home first presided over by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, is celebrating its 80th anniversary this year. The Corinthian courthouse is, in the current chief's estimation, \"the best symbol of the rule of law worldwide.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/11/blogs/democracy-america/20151128_usp503_apple_news.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "The chief justice speaks", "description": "A tale of two chiefs", "pubdate": 20151124, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "A tale of two chiefs", "title": "John Roberts reflects on leadership at the Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/11/chief-justice-speaks", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/images-magazine/2015/11/28/US/20151128_USP503_facebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "A tale of two chiefs", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-24 21:20:45", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/11/blogs/democracy-america/20151128_usp503_apple_news.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2015/11/blogs/democracy-america/20151128_usp503_apple_news.jpg", "articleid": 21678992, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2015/11/blogs/democracy-america/20151128_usp503_apple_news.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "The chief justice speaks", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/11/blogs/democracy-america/20151128_usp503_apple_news.jpg", "news_keywords": "The chief justice speaks"}, "article_summary": "Though clean-shaven and undoubtedly perkier than his stiff forebear, Chief Justice Roberts offered a jaunty analysis of Chief Justice Hughes that betrayed important similarities between the two men.\nAs the leader of a similarly riven bench today, Chief Justice Roberts has attracted strong criticism from both left and right.\nChief Justice Roberts comes off as disarmingly charming, exuding fair-mindedness and an understated wit.\nMr Hughes oversaw a \u201csharply divided court\u201d, Mr Roberts noted, and helped the justices learn how to \u201cdisagree without being disagreeable\u201d.\nShepherding the Court through the fight over Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programmes, Chief Justice Hughes took a centrist approach."}
