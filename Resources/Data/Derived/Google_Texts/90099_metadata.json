Then, about 18 months ago, Chinese labs began flooding the local drug market with a strange white powder.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting different batches that do different things. We\u2019ll get a batch that elevates hospital stays. I know Broward Health, the four hospitals that they have, they\u2019re seeing an average of 11 patients a day that are experiencing overdoses from Flakka.\u201d\n\nSome dealers try to pass Flakka off as the club drug, \u201cMolly.\u201d Flakka is actually a chemical cousin to bath salts. A 5 dollar hit gives a crystal meth-like high for up to four hours.\n\nOverdosing is easy and leads to \u201cexcited delirium.\u201d Temperatures soar as high as 107. Paranoid delusions flood the brain. Overheated victims tear off their clothes and flee in horror.\n\n\u201cA woman experiencing excited delirium covered herself in black tar from head to toe, all over her face, her body, she was completely naked and started walking down the street. So, you know, you can only imagine, once they get to the hospital, what do you do with a patient that\u2019s covered in black tar?\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of story Tianga and a team of his colleagues bring with them as they cross the state to share their experiences with other law enforcement.\n\nMajor Shawn Wood of the Gadsden County Sheriff\u2019s Office scheduled one of the training sessions for September 9th at the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Academy. Fllakka isn\u2019t flooding the streets of Northwest Florida, so there\u2019s still time circle the wagons, Wood says.\n\n\u201cIt takes everyone. Like I said, as law enforcement you have only so many tools. And it\u2019s not going to stop people just by incarcerating people that sell or possess it.\u201d\n\nSo far, Wood says he\u2019s signed up about 50 participants.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Deputies, EMTs and investigators from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office are fanning out across the state to teach their colleagues about the highly", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/broward-sheriff-sharing-flakka-expertise", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201508/431688471.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Deputies, EMTs and investigators from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office are fanning out across the state to teach their colleagues about the highly", "title": "Broward Sheriff Sharing Flakka Expertise"}, "story_id": 431688450, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Jim Ash", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Broward Sheriff Sharing Flakka Expertise"}, "nid": 11605, "datePublished": "2015-08-12", "keywords": "flakka", "wordCount": 454, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A 15-year veteran of the war on drugs, Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Lieutenant Ozzy Tianga thought he had seen it all.\nLike I said, as law enforcement you have only so many tools.\nMajor Shawn Wood of the Gadsden County Sheriff\u2019s Office scheduled one of the training sessions for September 9th at the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Academy.\nDeputies, EMTs and investigators from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office are fanning out across the state to teach their colleagues about the highly addictive street drug, \u201cFlakka.\u201d Florida law enforcement agencies are bracing for a wave of bizarre behavior and vicious crimes.\nThat\u2019s the kind of story Tianga and a team of his colleagues bring with them as they cross the state to share their experiences with other law enforcement."}
