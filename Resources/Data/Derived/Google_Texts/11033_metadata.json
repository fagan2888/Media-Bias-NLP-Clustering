Did they do anything for the taxpayers while they were in office? Did they vote themselves in for a raise? How many of their friends and family members did they create jobs for? All things to consider.\n\nBe a little smarter voters. That pretty face isn\u2019t cutting it for me.\n\nTo all you Obama lovers, the world been laughing for the last seven years now.\n\nWhy is Europe the epicenter of Muslim extremist\u2019s attacks right now? One single fact. They have tried to be so politically correct and allow just anyone to enter Europe at any time. Belgium\u2019s liberal views and laws help terrorists hide and flourish. Views like that are the problem that Europe faces. They are weak.\n\nYou know that if Hillary Clinton wins the election in November, she could be the first president to ever pardon themself. As the FBI offers more and more of her staff immunity, they will start to save their own skins and tell all that she has done. I can\u2019t wait.\n\nIn an attempt to get at least one positive comment in the Readers\u2019 Vent column, may I commend the folks who did the new sidewalk and fencing around our Governor\u2019s Mansion? Good work, a good classy look in keeping with the Georgian mansion. I was a skeptic. I was wrong. Nice job.\n\nYou\u2019re proud of how Obama has stood strong against his opponents. Yay. While he stood up against the GOP, ISIS has spread their reign of terror across Europe.\n\nOh, yes! Definitely allow guns at the Republican National Convention. Nothing could go wrong there.\n\nI live in a small five-room garage apartment-like house. I have gas heat, water heater and range. My electric budget bill just went from $92.00 per month to $103.00 per month. Thanks AEP and PSC!\n\nHow many of our legislators voted themselves in for a raise this term? And where did that money come from? Most of these folks have another full-time job. Maybe they should ask for a raise from that job \u2014 not the taxpayers. And if they succeed in raising PEIA I will not vote for any incumbents again.\n\nWhy fight terrorism in smaller countries? It\u2019s like a cancer that spreads if not stopped. We almost had it contained when your beloved Obama stopped treatments. In seven years it has spread across Europe and now heading to the U.S.\n\nOver 25,000 signed a petition to allow guns to be carried inside the Republican National Convention meeting hall. Not gonna happen. When it comes right down to it, the Republicans on a national level are as afraid of fools with guns as are West Virginia legislators. They all talk the talk, but don\u2019t walk the walk.\n\nWho does Uncle Joe think he\u2019s fooling? Hillary is notorious for telling an audience exactly what they want to hear. In fact, if we could have heard her response to Joe regarding coal, I\u2019m sure we could\u2019ve heard the strong Appalachian dialect that she possesses.\n\nHey Joe, you\u2019re no friend of coal, you\u2019re no friend of guns, and you\u2019re no friend of West Virginia.\n\nThis is in response to the Attorney General\u2019s offices warning of a health care scam. The biggest health care scam in history is the Affordable Care Act. It is bankrupting this state and country by subsidizing health care for tens of millions of people that refuse to work.\n\nHave you noticed the same people who didn\u2019t care about Obama\u2019s past being locked up and hidden or Hillary being able to remember most of hers, are now upset about Trump\u2019s.\n\nHow can Joe Manchin look the people of West Virginia in the eye after endorsing Hillary Clinton after what Obama has done to us and our state?\n\nWhen you purchase a new set of windshield wiper blades from car parts stores, they come to the parking lot with you and install them. Not to be outdone, I\u2019m told that the big gun stores will go to the parking lot with you and load your new pistol for you so as to avoid folks getting shot in the store.\n\nWe would be so much better off if the Democrat agenda would have been passed by the obstructionist GOP. We hear how they could do so much better, but they have done nothing while in power, blocking help the 99 percent in favor of their rich masters.\n\nThe science camp for brilliant students from across the country needs to be moved out of West Virginia this summer and in the future. Those forward-thinking young men and women need to go somewhere that is not heading backward in science.\n\nI enjoy listening to the intellect and thought process used in voting for candidates. \u201cI\u2019m voting for him because he\u2019s a Republican\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m voting for her because she\u2019s a Democrat.\u201d As someone once said, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix stupid!\u201d\n\nThe GOP members of the U.S. Senate saying they won\u2019t consider Obama\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court keep using their lock-step talking point, \u201cLet the people decide.\u201d The people did decide; Obama was elected twice and it is his job to select a nominee. It is the U.S. Senate who are not doing their job.\n\nAt the beginning of the election process I was hopeful that someone would stand tall and rally the country in the way President Reagan did. Well, so much for that thought. It\u2019s sad seeing our country go down the path it\u2019s presently on.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, ISIS\u2019s second in command died in a U.S. raid this week. Also under his administration, Osama Bin Laden was killed. And conservatives are saying Obama has no backbone? He not only has a backbone, but a brain \u2014 something Trump lacks.\n\nThanks to the Legislature the lady in front of you at the Wal-Mart check out counter rummaging through her purse looking for her coupons might well have a loaded Glock 9mm pistol in there with zero training how it even works. Be very afraid.\n\nIt seems the Republican party doesn\u2019t want anyone to vote. After years of trying to suppress the voting rights of the poor, blacks and Latinos, they now want to suppress the votes of Trump supporters. This leads one to believe that the Republican party is the biggest threat to democracy in the history of our country.\n\nAll you Republicans that keep saying that Trump tells it like it is. I would like to know what he tells like it is because every second word he utters is a lie and a proven lie. Can you imagine that hothead with a finger on the button.\n\nIsn\u2019t it terrible that you believe in a politician and what he promises you and you vote for him to represent you and just as soon as he or she gets into office they completely forget about you and their promises and become just as crooked like all the others that are there with them.\n\nIt was hard to watch Joe Manchin try to talk his way out of the mess he is in with Obama and then endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. Hillary just recently said all the coal mines will be closed and more miners will lose their jobs in West Virginia. I wonder if Joe knew that when he endorsed her because very few who voted for Joe will vote for Hillary or Joe. The next time around, I know I will not.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports-mitch-vingle/20160524/mitch-vingle-examining-the-states-d-i-baseball-crop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg"}, "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cd9\"", "article_summary": "The science camp for brilliant students from across the country needs to be moved out of West Virginia this summer and in the future.\nHillary just recently said all the coal mines will be closed and more miners will lose their jobs in West Virginia.\nWhen it comes right down to it, the Republicans on a national level are as afraid of fools with guns as are West Virginia legislators.\nHey Joe, you\u2019re no friend of coal, you\u2019re no friend of guns, and you\u2019re no friend of West Virginia.\nI wonder if Joe knew that when he endorsed her because very few who voted for Joe will vote for Hillary or Joe."}
