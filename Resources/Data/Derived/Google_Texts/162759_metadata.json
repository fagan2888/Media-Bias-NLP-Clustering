But it was actually a model tutorial on why no GOP contender should be president, as follow-up events underscored.\n\nIt began with Bush telling Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly that he\u2019d still invade Iraq, even \u201cknowing what we do now,\u201d to which Laura Ingraham replied, \u201cThere has to be something wrong with you.\u201d Bush then fumbled Sean Hannity\u2019s attempt to help clean up the mess, saying \u201cI interpreted the question wrong, I guess,\u201d then admitting, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that decision would have been.\u201d Then in a Nevada town hall meeting he tried to turn the tables, saying that folks like Kelly even daring to ask the question \u201cdoes a disservice\u201d to the troops who \u201csacrificed a lot,\u201d adding that \u201cWhat we ought to be focusing on is what are the lessons learned.\u201d Which, of course, was the reason behind Kelly\u2019s question in the first place. Finally, in Arizona the next day, Bush broke down and confessed, \u201cKnowing what we know now, I would have not engaged.\u201d\n\nTaking four long, painful days spouting shibboleths and fighting family ghosts to reluctantly, resentfully answer the simplest of questions gave America the clearest possible picture of why Jeb Bush would be a disaster as president. But in that, he\u2019s no different than anyone else in GOP race\u2014whether announced or not.\n\nWe saw that quite clearly the following week, when Chris Christie\u2019s vulgar anti-press rant was leaked (\u201cwe don\u2019t give a s\u2013t about this or any of you\u201d), and the gay-bashing Mike Huckabee rushed to the defense of child molester Josh Duggar on Facebook (\u201cJosh\u2019s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself, \u2018inexcusable,\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t mean \u2018unforgivable\u2019\u201d).\n\nSome in the press corps defended Christie, saying that being \u201crude\u201d was he whole point of the event, and it was supposed to be off the record. True, but this is New Jersey, and Christie has long made a habit of blurring such lines with leaks when it suited him, as well as an arrogant taunting of the press. It\u2019s pretty much reap-what-you-sow time for him. When it suits him, Christie\u2019s vulgarity and indiscriminate hostility is something he touts. As for Huckabee, his past involves pardoning a man who went on to kill four police officers, so the actions of both read as typical, rather than aberrations. (The ick factor with Huckabee may now be off the charts\u2014but in a crowd this packed with clowns, it\u2019s hard to tell what impact that\u2019s had.)\n\nThe pattern should be clear: It\u2019s a crowded GOP field in which everyone\u2019s fatal flaws are exposed for all to see, and the media works overtime to minimize them, or outright pretend they don\u2019t even exist. And the first tier of candidates comes off as poorly as the third and fourth.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s no real quality difference between the top tier and the third or fourth. For example, Rick Santorum\u2014a fourth-tier candidate at 1.3 percent in a recent Real Clear Politics polling average (current version here)\u2014acted eerily like second-tier Mike Huckabee defending a child molester back in 2012, when he blasted the Freeh report on the Penn State coverup of Jerry Sandusky\u2019s decades of molestation. Find any sort of outrageous act one with one candidate, and you will find echoes among others in this field.\n\nIt might seem ludicrous to pay attention to the bottom of the GOP field, since, as the Washington Post noted, \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign has more support than Lindsay Graham, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich combined.\u201d On the other hand, what sets Sanders apart is precisely that he differs in deeply substantive ways both from Hillary Clinton and from the rest of the Washington consensus. What sets the third- and fourth-tier GOP candidates apart is\u2026 virtually nothing. Kasich, for example, is supposedly sane and pragmatic. He accepted Medicaid expansion, after all. But just after Christie and Huckabee\u2019s performances, Kasich stepped up and proved himself as an out-of-touch moral nonentity.\n\nAfter Cuyahoga Country Judge John O\u2019Donnell acquitted Cleveland Police Officer Michael Brelo of killing Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, when he mounted the hood of their car and fired 15 shots through its windshield, calling his use of force \u201ca constitutionally reasonable response,\u201d ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl asked Kasich, \u201cWas justice served in this verdict?\u201d Kasich refused to answer, instead praising Cleveland for not breaking out in a riot, and calling it \u201ca model,\u201d ignoring everything wrong with the city, which publicly agreed to a sweeping DOJ consent decree shortly after the verdict came down.\n\n\u201cWell, look, the verdict is the verdict, John,\u201d Kasich responded, dodging the question of justice entirely. \u201cWhat I will say is that I think the people of Cleveland handled this; I mean, they should be so proud of themselves and we should look at Cleveland as a model.\u201d There\u2019s no sign of justice anywhere on Cleveland\u2019s horizon. Many believe that things didn\u2019t get worse because no one expected justice to begin with, and prosecutors have since asked an appeals court to correct three \u201cegregious\u201d errors of law in the judge\u2019s ruling, so they do not \u201ccontaminate future rulings in the trial court and the entire Court of Common Pleas.\u201d But not to worry, Kasich assures us, Cleveland\u2019s \u201ca model.\u201d\n\nOr consider Bobby Jindal, polling just above 1 percent. He did make a rather extreme fool of himself a few months back, hyperventilating about nonexistent \u201cno go zones\u201d in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. But this is really just an offshoot of what the Atlantic called \u201cThe Sophisticated Bigotry of Bobby Jindal,\u201d which Peter Beinart described thus:\n\nIf Bobby Jindal runs for president, he will likely campaign on two major themes. The first, which he outlined last February at the Reagan Library and last May at Liberty University, is that Christians are at war with a liberal elite that is trampling religious liberty and secularizing American culture. The second, which he laid out this month at London\u2019s Henry Jackson Society, is that \u201cnon-assimilationist Muslims\u201d are endangering America and Europe. Unfortunately for Jindal, these two arguments contradict each other.\n\nAnd, unfortunately for the GOP, Jindal is anything but alone. The whole party is caught in the grip of this ludicrous contradiction (and all the governors\u2014Walker, Christie, even Kasich\u2014would rather not talk too much about their economic records). The contradiction is obvious: Christians who refuse to compromise with secular Western culture are heroes, whereas Muslims who refuse to compromise are demons. That\u2019s not necessarily a contradiction, though: it could be just plain old-fashioned bigotry. In which case, the \u201carguments\u201d aren\u2019t really arguments, they\u2019re camouflage. As Beinart himself later concludes, \u201cThe only principle he\u2019s really defending is anti-Muslim bigotry.\u201d Jindal just makes this contradiction a bit clearer than most\u2014at the same time that he\u2019s trying to distract from the financial disaster he\u2019s created as Louisiana governor.\n\nJindal is a fourth-tier candidate, locked in a three-way tie for 12th place, with 1.3 percent, along with Graham and Fiorina in that RCP poll average, which doesn\u2019t include Donald Trump. But there were a couple of first-tier candidates tied at 13.2 percent with similarly disastrous budget situations (Scott Walker), as well as ones who strike similar appeals to Christian victimhood (Marco Rubio). Walker\u2019s doing much better in the polls than any other GOP governor\u2014nearby rivals Mike Pence and Rick Snyder have both recently dropped, while John Kasich appears to be in the sub-1-percent range, at least for now. Christie at 5.4 percent defines the third tier, the only other governor who really registers so far.\n\nBut Walker\u2019s record as governor is abysmal. He faces a $2.2 billion budget deficit, as Wisconsin blogger Jimmy Anderson explains:\n\nAnd he\u2019s paired with Jindal in the \u201clet\u2019s destroy our state universities!\u201d derby:\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, both potential 2016 presidential candidates, are pushing to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from higher education \u2013 about $300 million over the next two years in Wisconsin and $141.3 million next year in Louisiana.\n\nAlso, like most governors who\u2019ve never served in Washington, he has zilch in the way of foreign policy experience. Which helps explain why Islamic State terrorists instinctively reminded him of schoolteachers. \u201cI want a commander in chief who will do everything in their power to ensure that the threat from radical Islamic terrorists does not wash up on American soil,\u201d he told a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cIf I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world.\u201d\n\nHe later tried to \u201cclarify,\u201d but much like Bush, he didn\u2019t seem to fully grasp the extent of his folly. To start with, as Salon\u2019s Joan Walsh explained:\n\nFrom the left, you can be disgusted by Walker comparing legal protests by labor unions and their supporters to the barbaric, blood-thirsty terrorism of ISIS. From the right, you can be appalled that Walker is clueless enough to suggest that standing up to peaceful protesters is remotely comparable to fighting a multi-national terror threat. Many people probably have both reactions; I know I did.\n\nWalker struck back at the first take, but seemed utterly oblivious to the second. As the Wisconsin State Journal explained:\n\nWalker immediately sought to clarify his comments as he shuttled between media interviews after the speech. His political nonprofit group also issued a statement. \u201cLet me be perfectly clear: I\u2019m just pointing out the closest thing I have to handling this difficult situation is the 100,000 protesters I had to deal with,\u201d Walker told reporters. Asked if he regretted the statement, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYou all will misconstrue things the way you see fit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the closest thing I have in terms of handling a difficult situation, not that there\u2019s any parallel between the two.\u201d\n\nAside from blaming others for \u201cmiscontruing\u201d things in a straightforward manner, Walker\u2019s response actually deepens the second concern, even if you buy into it completely. If there\u2019s no parallel, then why bring it up? Because you have nothing better. Because you have zero relevant experience. Which is precisely the problem. What\u2019s more, this was not a mistake on Walker\u2019s part, it was part of a pattern. The very next part of the Wisconsin State Journal story made this clear:\n\nMarquette Law School political science professor Charles Franklin said Walker \u201cmay have crossed the line\u201d by linking international affairs and union protests. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a brand new thing for him to connect toughness in Act 10 and toughness in international affairs.\u201d Walker has also previously cited President Ronald Reagan\u2019s firing of striking air traffic controllers as one of the most powerful foreign policy decisions he made, Franklin said.\n\nSo Walker\u2019s equation of fighting unions with fighting foreign enemies is a feature, not a bug, further underscored by his childishly self-conscious invocation of the Ronald Reagan mythos, which Jud Lounsbury explored here recently as another systematic feature of Walker\u2019s modus operandi. Naturally, Walker forgets\u2014and the press does, too\u2014that when faced with real terrorists who blew up the Marine barracks in Lebanon, killing 241 American service members, Reagan responded first by pulling back, then pulling out, turning tail, and coincidentally, invading Grenada two days after the bombing, to help sooth American machismo. No matter, it\u2019s the Reagan mythos we\u2019re talking about here, history be damned. (A good 2016 campaign slogan, come to think of it.)\n\nWalker\u2019s first-tier rival, Marco Rubio, hews much closer to Jindal\u2019s rhetoric on the social issues side. While the media played up the idea that Rubio might attend a friend\u2019s gay wedding, they left out the matter of timing: a quarter after hell freezes over. In reality Rubio\u2019s hostility to gay rights is profound. He recently used gay rights as part of a slippery-slope argument that ended with \u201ca real and present danger\u201d as reported by Right Wing Watch:\n\n\u201cWe are at the water\u2019s edge of the argument that mainstream Christian teaching is hate speech because today we\u2019ve reached the point in our society where if you do not support same-sex marriage, you are labeled a homophobe and a hater,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo what\u2019s the next step after that? After they\u2019re done going after individuals, the next step is to argue that the teachings of mainstream Christianity, the catechism of the Catholic Church, is hate speech. That\u2019s a real and present danger.\u201d\n\nPrior to the Civil War, the Bible was the No. 1 source of Confederate arguments supporting slavery, yet Christianity somehow managed to survive Lincoln\u2019s hateful Emancipation Proclamation. So Rubio\u2019s hysterics would be laughable, were they not so widely shared. He\u2019s a top-tier candidate, and similar views have been expressed by Huckabee (\u201cWe are moving rapidly towards the criminalization of Christianity\u201d), Cruz (\u201cthe greatest threats we\u2019ve ever seen\u201d to religious liberty, also \u201ca real risk\u201d that pastors will be jailed for preaching \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d), Carson (gay marriage is a Marxist plot to impose a \u201cNew World Order\u201d), Santorum (\u201cyou can be persecuted and maybe even prosecuted\u201d) and Jindal (\u201cThe left no longer wants to debate. They simply want to silence us.\u201d)\u2014all offering slightly different variations on the same paranoid theme.\n\nA month prior to his \u201creal and present danger\u201d comments, in late April, Rubio called it \u201cridiculous and absurd\u201d to believe gays have a constitutional right to marry, in an interview with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network:", "article_metadata": {"description": "It might be a deep pool of GOP candidates, but are they ever swimming in the shallow end", "title": "Step inside the GOP clown car!
