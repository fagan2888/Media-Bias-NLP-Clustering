But he missed a contested jumper on New Orleans\u2019 final possession of regulation, and the Heat controlled the extra session.\n\nRyan Anderson scored 18 points, including a tip-in with 1:45 left in regulation that gave New Orleans its first lead, and Eric Gordon finished with 16 for the Pelicans. Gordon\u2019s four-point play with 31 seconds left in overtime got New Orleans within four, but they got no closer.\n\nThe Heat had 18 turnovers in the game \u2014 and New Orleans scored on only one of them. Miami outrebounded the Pelicans 57-45.\n\nDavis had more points than his teammates combined in the first half, the reason why New Orleans still had a shot.\n\nNew Orleans\u2019 largest first-half deficit was 13 points, which was trimmed to 42-38 going into intermission after Davis\u2019 follow-slam closed the scoring. He had 20 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three blocks at the break \u2014 according to STATS, no player had done that in any half since at least the start of the 2002-03 season.\n\nFriday\u2019s game started a Miami\u2019s first and only stretch of four contests in five days this season. The Heat play 26 times in 47 days going into the All-Star break.\n\nTIP-INS\n\n-Pelicans: There have been two noon starts in the NBA this season and the Pelicans were the visitors in both, the other being a loss at New York in November. \u2026 This was the first of three consecutive one-game trips for the Pelicans, who are back in Florida on Monday to play Orlando. \u2026 Gordon celebrated his 27th birthday.\n\n-Heat: Miami (.833) moved past Portland (14-3, .824) for the NBA\u2019s best Christmas record. \u2026 Instead of leaving quickly for Orlando after the game as usual, the Heat gave players and staff a few hours for extra holiday celebrating before planning to convene in the evening for the 30-minute flight north.\n\nWADE\u2019S HISTORY\n\nThe Heat are now 10-1 when Wade plays on Christmas \u2014 no player has a better record \u2014 and only seven players in NBA history have appeared in more Dec. 25 games than the Heat star. Wade ranks among the top five all-time in Christmas Day points (277), assists (70) and steals (19).\n\n\u201cHOME STRONG\u201d MOMS\n\nMiami has honored soldiers before home games for years as part of its \u201cHome Strong\u201d program, and Friday\u2019s instance was a family affair. Heat guards Tyler Johnson and Josh Richardson presented their mothers, U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Jennifer Johnson and Lt. Col. Alice Richardson, with the plaques and commerative coins that the team gives servicemen and women as a thank-you for their service to the country.\n\nCOLE\u2019S HOLIDAY STREAK\n\nPelicans guard Norris Cole, in his fifth pro season, played in his fifth Christmas Day game. His first NBA game was on Dec. 25, 2011 when he and the Heat \u2014 the team he spent parts of his first four seasons with \u2014 opened what became a championship season with a win at Dallas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\n-Pelicans: Host Houston on Saturday.\n\n-Heat: At Orlando on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade carry Heat to OT win over Pelicans", "title": "Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade carry Heat to OT win over Pelicans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/chris-bosh-dwyane-wade-carry-heat-to-ot-win-over-pelicans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__502466958p1.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__502466958p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T19:44:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:32:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chris Bosh scored 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, Dwyane Wade added 19 points, and the Heat survived some shaky moments late to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 94-88 in overtime on Friday.\nMIAMI \u2014 There\u2019s no team better on Christmas than the Miami Heat.\nThe win was Miami\u2019s seventh straight on Christmas and moved the Heat to an NBA-best 10-2 all-time on the holiday.\n-Heat: Miami (.833) moved past Portland (14-3, .824) for the NBA\u2019s best Christmas record.\nAnthony Davis was stellar in his Christmas debut, leading the Pelicans with 29 points and 15 rebounds."}
