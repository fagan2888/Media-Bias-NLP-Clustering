INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller is making his first bid for federal office, announcing Monday he will join a crowded field seeking to replace 9th District Congressman Todd Young.

Zoeller says, as Attorney General, he’s repeatedly battled what he sees as overreach by the federal government, defending Indiana’s right to make its own decisions on everything from EPA regulations to the Affordable Care Act. The southern Indiana native says he’s running for Congress to continue that battle.

“We really need to get somebody in Washington who can get them to ‘Yes’ – you know, kind of my theme about trying to get people to work together – and address the problems that aren’t being addressed,” Zoeller said.

Zoeller joins a GOP primary race that also features State Senators Brent Waltz and Erin Houchin and Robert Hall, leader of the group Grassroots Conservatives.

If Zoeller’s bid in the primary fails, he could still make another run for Attorney General next fall.
