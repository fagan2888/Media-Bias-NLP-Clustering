Is the group smart political theater or real religion? Both, says Temple co-founder and leader Doug Mesner, aka Lucien Greaves.\n\nSatanic Controversies\n\nIn Orange County, Florida, members applied to give out Satanic Coloring Books alongside Christian propaganda being distributed in Florida elementary schools by a group called World Changers. For three years, the school board had ignored complaints about the World Changer materials, but after the Satanic Temple applied to distribute its own child-friendly materials, the practice ended.\n\nAccording to Greaves, \u201cAt first they tried to allay the fears of the public by saying they reserved the right to reject material if it wasn\u2019t fit. They hoped our children\u2019s activity book would violate community standards so it could be discarded without blatant discrimination. But our book has simple pro-social messages. When we gave that to them, they were utterly resigned. Their law was saying there was nothing they could object to. So they closed down the forum entirely.\u201d\n\nWhen the state of Oklahoma decided to display a version of the Ten Commandments, carved in granite, on courthouse grounds, members of the Satanic Temple again treated this as an open forum for religion in the public square. They raised $28,000 in crowdfunding and hired a sculptor who created a 6-foot bronze monument depicting the Satanic avatar Baphomet blessing two children, with the Temple\u2019s seven precepts below. The finished statue was unveiled in a dramatic ritual in Detroit last July.\n\nThe list goes on: In Western Washington, Temple members seized an opening created by a Christian coach who was leading football prayers in his public capacity on public school grounds. Members of the Seattle temple asked that they, too, be allowed to lead after-game prayers on the field. The school district responded by suspending both the coach and the prayers but not in time to prevent footage of black-robed Satanists and jeering Christian students from hitting national media.\n\nIn Missouri, the Temple has waded into the reproductive freedom fight by filing suit on behalf of a member, \u201cMary Doe,\u201d who says she is entitled to religious exemption from odious abortion restrictions. The Temple\u2019s \u201cSeven Tenets\u201d include two that provide the basis for the court case: One\u2019s body is inviolable, subject to one\u2019s own will alone\u2014and\u2014Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. Lawyers for the Temple argue that forcing Doe to read scientifically bogus warnings against abortion (for example, that abortion causes cancer) and then contemplate the warnings for three days prior to the procedure violates her religious freedom. Once again, the Temple is crowdfunding the campaign and to date has raised about half of the anticipated $80,000 in legal costs.\n\nUsing Privilege to Challenge Privilege?\n\nIs the Satanic Temple simply a political or secular advocacy group using religious privilege to challenge religious privilege? Co-founder Lucien Greaves says it\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\nWe\u2019re not trying to destroy religious privilege and exemption; we are coming at it in a way that we can find a legitimate plateau on which religious privilege can work in a pluralistic society. During our Oklahoma campaign to place our statue of Baphomet alongside the Ten Commandments, people kept asking what were we looking for? What was our preferred outcome? For the Ten Commandments to come down or ours to go up? But either one of those outcomes was OK with us. What we were fighting against was that one perspective enjoyed the power of state government. We were just fighting against the worst-case scenario\u2014that the Christian point of view had a preferred place in a government institution. I\u2019m not sure that people can make the appeal that because of deeply held beliefs they shouldn\u2019t be held accountable to laws. But the courts need to be prepared to acknowledge that if they can, then a diametrically opposed claim can also be made on the basis of sincere belief.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Smart political theater or real religion?
