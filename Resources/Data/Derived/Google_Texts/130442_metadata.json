Only those who want to enroll in a different plan or whose income has changed will have to take action to keep the insurance.\n\nAutomatic renewal is being implemented in a bid to avoid a repeat of the problems consumers faced when trying to enroll in the program's initial open enrollment period, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told the Times. The next open enrollment period runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15, 2015.\n\nAbout 5.4 million policies were sold through the federal ACA exchange. Alabama was among the states that declined to create its own exchange, opting instead to let its residents buy insurance through the federal system. More than three quarters of the policies are subsidized using tax credits that are deducted from premiums.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Most Affordable Care Act policies and premium subsidies will automatically renew, Obama administration says", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Automatic renewal is bid to avoid repeat of problems with website in initial enrollment period.", "title": "Most Affordable Care Act policies and premium subsidies will automatically renew, Obama administration says", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/06/most_affordable_care_act_polic.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/joe-biden-sylvia-mathews-burwell-stephen-burwell-f73fdfac7a77c0ce.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Automatic renewal is bid to avoid repeat of problems with website in initial enrollment period.", "creator": "@Stan_Diel", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/joe-biden-sylvia-mathews-burwell-stephen-burwell-f73fdfac7a77c0ce.jpg", "title": "Most Affordable Care Act policies and premium subsidies will automatically renew, Obama administration says", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, June 27, 2014, 12:28 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, June 27, 2014, 12:11 PM", "article_author": "Stan Diel", "Description": "Automatic renewal is bid to avoid repeat of problems with website in initial enrollment period."}, "article_summary": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama \u2013 Most people who bought insurance under the Affordable Care Act will be able to renew their plans and their subsidies next year without filing an application, the Obama administration announced.\nThe next open enrollment period runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15, 2015.\nMore than three quarters of the policies are subsidized using tax credits that are deducted from premiums.\nAbout 5.4 million policies were sold through the federal ACA exchange.\nUnder procedures announced this week about 95 percent of those who bought the insurance through the federal government's exchange will have their policies and financial assistance automatically renewed, The New York Times reports."}
