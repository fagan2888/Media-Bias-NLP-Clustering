America\u2019s allies and foes alike became convinced that Reagan was serious enough to take action and that \u201cwe weren\u2019t to be messed with,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker has said something like this before when he claimed that there were \u201cdocuments\u201d that proved that this had influenced the way that the Soviets viewed Reagan. That wasn\u2019t true, but that didn\u2019t discourage Walker from using this line again. It\u2019s a ridiculous claim on its face, but a few things need to be said about it anyway.\n\nEven if one grants that Reagan\u2019s decision to fire the striking workers had some effect on the way he was perceived by other governments, it is just painfully ignorant to call a purely domestic decision the \u201cmost significant foreign policy decision\u201d of the last five decades. There have to be numerous examples of far more significant policy decisions from Reagan\u2019s presidency alone, to say nothing of the decisions made by other presidents during that time. Walker thinks he\u2019s making a clever point about displaying \u201ctoughness,\u201d but just keeps drawing attention to the fact that he has nothing substantive to say about foreign policy. He insists on using the crutch of Reagan nostalgia, but he can\u2019t even cite examples from Reagan\u2019s real foreign policy record to make his point.\n\nIf Walker believes what he\u2019s saying, he is endorsing an absurdly extreme version of the \u201ccredibility\u201d argument. He not only wants us to think that this display of \u201ctoughness\u201d made other states take Reagan more \u201cseriously,\u201d but that a purely domestic decision had such far-reaching international consequences that it was the most significant foreign policy decision made in almost half a century. If this was supposed to allay concerns that Walker isn\u2019t prepared to be president, it didn\u2019t work. Indeed, it is becoming very difficult to take anything Walker says on foreign policy seriously.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "If Walker believes what he's saying, he is endorsing an absurdly extreme version of the \"credibility\" argument.", "title": "Walker\u2019s Reagan Nostalgia and Foreign Policy", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/walkers-reagan-nostalgia-and-foreign-policy/", "image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/8569580189_19061083e3_z.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following up on his silly foreign policy remarks earlier this week, Scott Walker made another statement that was no better:Walker contended that \"the most significant foreign policy decision of my l", "title": "Walker\u2019s Reagan Nostalgia and Foreign Policy", "image": {"src": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/8569580189_19061083e3_z.jpg"}, "creator": "@amconmag", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce323\"", "article_summary": "He insists on using the crutch of Reagan nostalgia, but he can\u2019t even cite examples from Reagan\u2019s real foreign policy record to make his point.\nIndeed, it is becoming very difficult to take anything Walker says on foreign policy seriously.\nFollowing up on his silly foreign policy remarks earlier this week, Scott Walker made another statement that was no better:Walker contended that \u201cthe most significant foreign policy decision of my lifetime\u201d was then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s move to bust a 1981 strike of air traffic controllers, firing some 11,000 of them.\nWalker thinks he\u2019s making a clever point about displaying \u201ctoughness,\u201d but just keeps drawing attention to the fact that he has nothing substantive to say about foreign policy.\nThere have to be numerous examples of far more significant policy decisions from Reagan\u2019s presidency alone, to say nothing of the decisions made by other presidents during that time."}
