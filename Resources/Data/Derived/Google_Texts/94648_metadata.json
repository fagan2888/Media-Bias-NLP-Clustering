Joni Ernst returned to Iowa this weekend, fresh off her freshman introduction to the U.S. Congress.\n\nErnst is the first woman to be elected to Congress in Iowa. She is also the first female combat veteran in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cNow I will be the first first-year senator to give the Republican response to the State of the Union address,\u201d she said.\n\nErnst was tight-lipped as to what she would say in the speech, but said she would drink plenty of water beforehand.\n\n\u201cI will make sure I\u2019m hydrated, yes,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople in Red Oak, Iowa, had other questions for Ernst, ranging from subjects such as Cuba and the Affordable Care Act. Some wondered what it was like to live in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cComing from Iowa with low cost of living and going to Washington, D.C., it\u2019s a little bit of a sticker shock, but we\u2019ll make it. I\u2019m thrifty,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said things are a little faster paced in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cSo, I was sworn in on Jan. 6, and that was between noon and 1 and at 2 o\u2019clock we had our first committee meeting, so jumped right into armed services,\u201d she said.\n\nErnst said she is up for the challenge.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working for the people of Iowa. We have a lot of issues coming up. The budget, Keystone XL, a number of things that are very important to Iowans,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 17 Jan 2015 21:22:46 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Molly Miles", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "U.S. Sen.
