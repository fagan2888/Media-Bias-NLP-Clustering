In recent discussions of the future of veterans\u2019 healthcare in the country, a few stakeholders have presented a false dichotomy: Either keep the status quo or privatize the system.\n\nHowever, fixing veterans\u2019 healthcare is going to require a blend of care through the VA healthcare system and the private sector. After all, even the Department of Veterans Affairs admits that it needs to reform itself and that it needs help from the private sector in serving our nation\u2019s veterans.\n\nThe current VA health care infrastructure is inadequate to serve our nations\u2019 veterans\u2014something the Department of Veterans Affairs itself has admitted. But even if the VA had no access problems, no wait lists and the scandal had never become part of the national conscience, the department will face pressure to change the way it does business soon, due to current and developing demographic changes in the veterans population: Projections from the VA show the veteran population will decline in the coming decades, and populations are currently shifting to the growing states in the south and the west.\n\nFurthermore, there is one considerable change in the state of health care available in the U.S. now versus when the VA began building hospitals: The civilian infrastructure is very developed and more advanced than the VA hospitals in many areas.\n\nThe changing context of the health care market in the country and the composition of the veterans\u2019 population has resulted in the VA admitting that it needed the assistance of the private sector in order to provide health care services for our veterans. This impulse led to the creation of the multiple current programs that allow veterans to seek private sector health care services.\n\nIn this regard, we need to do a better job leveraging the comparative advantages that each of the different providers bring to the delivery of veterans health care.\n\nTo achieve this, we as a nation need to empower our veterans to choose where they would be best served. This will introduce competition into the system and, in turn, force the VA to either focus on the needs of veterans or continue with the status quo.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs faces inevitable changes to the way it operates\u2014even if VA leaders maintain course. It is now up to VA leadership to determine if they will embrace change to become a more accountable organization\u2014or continue on as a dysfunctional and unaccountable bureaucracy.\n\nSelnick, a veteran of the United States Air Force, was an appointee for the Bush administration at the Department of Veterans Affairs from 2001-2009 as special assistant to the Secretary and associate dean of VA Learning University.
