Tammy and Tim Berndsen are tired of people driving through their fields in their big four wheel drive pickups.

Tammy Berndsen hits the nail on the head pointedly saying, "We don't go into town and drive through their front yards."

Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet says the off road vandalism is a growing problem in rural areas. Herzet says, "People are tired of it. We get calls about that every time we get a large rain." "It's been an on-going problem for years."

He says last week deputies spotted a driver in a four wheel drive Dodge pickup driving in ditches and gave chase. He says there were four 22 year old's in it.

Herzet says 22-year-old Luke Henning was charged. "D.U.I., flee and allude, criminal damage to property, some pretty serious offenses."

The off road sport is called "mudding." But there are sanctioned designated events for that. When it's done in farm fields, on township roads and ditches it's breaking the law.

Berndsen says, "Every time it rains these kids come out and four wheel through ditches and through the farmer's fields and tear up the crops. It's disheartening because this is our livelihood."

The Berndsen's say drivers have attached mattresses to their pickups and driven through their standing corn fields damaging the crop.

"These kids come out and have no remorse tearing up what we make a living out of."
