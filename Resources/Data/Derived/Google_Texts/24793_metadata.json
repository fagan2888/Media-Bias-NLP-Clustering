Why? Once again, he had his own agenda on the brain. It seems as though he\u2019ll celebrate anything at any time if he gets to go on a \u201cpolitical tirade\u201d in the process. What\u2019s next? A presidential address for the two-year anniversary of the invention of twerking?\n\nPirro\u2019s theory on Benghazi is that the most powerful man in the world couldn\u2019t be bothered with the attack as it unfolded. Many Americans agree. And it\u2019s a disturbing image to picture the president sleeping or watching television during a crisis that would have had Ronald Reagan drinking pots of coffee and handing out orders. Is Obama plain lazy?\n\nBy the time Pirro got to the Internal Revenue Service being dispatched to the doorstep of Obama\u2019s political opposites, viewers like myself were already hot under the collar. It\u2019s the totality of these examples of routine blunder, attack and lying day after day that sticks in my craw.\n\nAll of this embarrassment comes under the umbrella of impunity that Obama\u2019s skin color seems to provide in an era of diversity training and political correctness, above all else. But why isn\u2019t the definition of \u201cpolitically correct\u201d to do what is right as a politician? Why should the definition have anything to do with holding your tongue or parsing words \u2014 especially when our nation, our security, our children\u2019s future is on the line?\n\nObamacare is like your father threatening to move the family to Alaska when you\u2019re 14 and just fell in love with the pretty girl next door. No one wants this thing. Small businesses are terrified. Yet, our president wants to force it on us. It\u2019s the liberal way. Every issue is has to be forced. Big government means little room for choice.\n\nAnd U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi calls Obama \u201cbrilliant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "America\u2019s favorite judge, Fox News\u2019 Jeanine Pirro, knows how to barbeque \u2013 and President Obama is among her most effective targets to roast.
