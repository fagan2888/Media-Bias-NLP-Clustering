As people fill out their tax returns prior to the April 15 deadline, it will be the first time they deal with the requirement that all Americans, with a few exceptions, have health insurance.

But about 75 percent will simply have to check a box on their tax return indicating they have coverage, according to federal officials who spoke to reporters Wednesday about tax return implications of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

This will include people who get health insurance through work or are covered by a government program such as Medicare, Medicaid or military health benefits.

It will be more complicated for people who obtained coverage through the online marketplaces known as exchanges, and who obtained an advance tax credit to help cover the cost of their coverage. Most exchange customers received an advance tax credit, which was applied to their monthly premium throughout 2014.

When they applied for their coverage and the tax credit, they had to provide an estimated household income, which determined the size of their tax credit.

If their income turned out to be more then they estimated, they might have to pay back part or all of the credit, which would likely be done through a reduction in their tax refund.

Within a week they should receive, or already have received, a document from the federal government stating the the amount of their tax credit, and containing the information they need to fill out their tax return.
