Beyond his enormous success in business, he may be best known as the man who was profiled by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for owning The Maltese Falcon, one of the largest privately owned sailing yachts in the world (he\u2019s since sold it). He\u2019s the former husband of Danielle Steel, one of the most successful authors ever, and he owns many mansions all over the world. All in all, it\u2019s pretty good to be Tom Perkins.\n\nOr so you would think! Yet according to a letter to the editor he wrote to the Wall Street Journal, the reality of being Tom Perkins isn\u2019t so much defined by extravagant wealth, luxury, comfort, and power, but rather a growing sense of fear and dread. It\u2019s so bad, Perkins says, that being a member of the American 1% today is actually comparable to being a Jew in Nazi Germany.\n\nSeriously. He wrote this.\n\nHere\u2019s Perkins\u2019 letter, in full:\n\nWriting from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its \u201cone percent,\u201d namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the \u201crich.\u201d From the Occupy movement to the demonization of the rich embedded in virtually every word of our local newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, I perceive a rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent. There is outraged public reaction to the Google buses carrying technology workers from the city to the peninsula high-tech companies which employ them. We have outrage over the rising real-estate prices which these \u201ctechno geeks\u201d can pay. We have, for example, libelous and cruel attacks in the Chronicle on our number-one celebrity, the author Danielle Steel, alleging that she is a \u201csnob\u201d despite the millions she has spent on our city\u2019s homeless and mentally ill over the past decades. This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent \u201cprogressive\u201d radicalism unthinkable now?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, Perkins warns of a \"progressive Kristallnacht\"", "title": "Wealthy venture capitalist Tom Perkins says the 1% in America are treated like Jews in Nazi Germany", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, Perkins warns of a \"progressive Kristallnacht\"", "title": "Wealthy venture capitalist Tom Perkins says the 1% in America are treated like Jews in Nazi Germany", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/wealthy_venture_capitalist_tom_perkins_says_the_1_in_america_are_treated_like_jews_in_nazi_germany/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/gordon_gekko.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, Perkins warns of a \"progressive Kristallnacht\"", "title": "Wealthy venture capitalist Tom Perkins says the 1% in America are treated like Jews in Nazi Germany", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/gordon_gekko.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1%, 60 Minutes, Holocaust, Jews, Kristallnacht, Nazi Germany, The Maltese Falcon, Thomas Perkins, Tom Perkins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc347\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 1%, 60 Minutes, Holocaust, Jews, Kristallnacht, Nazi Germany, The Maltese Falcon, Thomas Perkins, Tom Perkins, News, Politics NewsThomas Perkins is a hyper-wealthy venture capitalist.\nAll in all, it\u2019s pretty good to be Tom Perkins.\nIt\u2019s so bad, Perkins says, that being a member of the American 1% today is actually comparable to being a Jew in Nazi Germany.\nKristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent \u201cprogressive\u201d radicalism unthinkable now?\nHe\u2019s the former husband of Danielle Steel, one of the most successful authors ever, and he owns many mansions all over the world."}
