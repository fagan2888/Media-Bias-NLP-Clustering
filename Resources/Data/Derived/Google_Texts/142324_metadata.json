While Halperin has his better moments, Heilemann has defended Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s reprehensible remark about the possibility of Israel becoming an apartheid state, told Rand Paul to \u201cstick\u201d his thoughts on the unemployed \u201cwhere they belong,\u201d and warned readers that should Romney lose to Obama, the \u201cferocity of the reaction of many of his supporters \u2014 those who despise Obama with a passion so raw and burning it\u2019s hard to comprehend \u2013will be breathtaking, and perhaps not a little scary.\u201d\n\nHeilemann has also compared opponents of gay marriage to racists, has never hid his love for ObamaCare on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d and is curiously selective when it comes to reporting and making issue of the tax rates paid by wealthy presidential candidates.\n\nMoreover, if Heilemann has ever used an ounce of his oh-so legendary reportorial skills to dig into even one of the many scandals dogging President Obama, Google can\u2019t find it. Why here\u2019s Heilemann admitting he did not dig into Obama\u2019s Solyndra scandal right before agreeing there is no scandal.\n\nOh, and here\u2019s Heilemann making a gay joke about engaging in \u201ca three-way\u201d with Republican Rick Santorum. Oddly enough, Heilemann has been much more charitable towards serial child rapist Jerry Sandusky than Santorum and us scary, ferocious Republicans.\n\nI\u2019m not sure \u201cideological\u201d and \u201csewer\u201d means what Bloomberg thinks it means.\n\nHalperin is the more quiet and thoughtful of the duo, but when he senses Obama might be in real danger, he can literally and very publicly freak out. Halperin\u2019s meltdown during the 2012 election when Drudge teased video of Obama\u2019s \u201cother race speech,\u201d was one of the media\u2019s 2012 lowlights in an election filled with them.\n\nTo his credit, Halperin has castigated the media plenty of times over their glaring pro-Obama biases. But he\u2019s also been caught talking out both sides of his mouth.\n\nOn Fox News, after the disastrous rollout of ObamCare in late 2013, Halperin criticized the media for not vetting ObamaCare \u201cat the time of passage\u201d (but also dishonestly blamed Romney for the media\u2019s failings). But at that particular time of passage in 2010, in Time Magazine, Halperin boasted about how the media wouldn\u2019t vet ObamaCare and by doing so, Halperin encouraged them not to.\n\nOne big reason to remain skeptical about the duo is a suspicion that rather than report what is happening in real time, they save juicy political stories up for later in order to sell more books.\n\nReports say both will be paid more than $1 million a year by Bloomberg. History suggests that, in front of cameras manned by those making a fraction of what they do, they will praise any candidate who seeks to exploit income inequality for votes.\n\nIf past is prologue, Halperin and Heilemann\u2019s new Bloomberg television show will also be filled with little to no actual reporting and a whole lot of conventional wisdom, elite opinion, elite talking head and guests, and rhetoric disguised as analysis in favor of empowering the federal government.\n\nIn other words, \u201cMorning Joe: After Dark.\u201d\n\nThen, sometime in early 2017 after Hillary is safely sworn in, the duo will release yet another page-turner about the presidential election, this one titled, \u201cSex Change: What We Were Too Greedy And Biased To Tell You During The Campaign.\u201d\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bloomberg Editor On Halperin and Heilemann: 'We Are Not Ideological'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Bloomberg Editor On Halperin and Heilemann: 'We Are Not Ideological'", "title": "Bloomberg Editor On Halperin and Heilemann: 'We Are Not Ideological' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/07/02/John-Heilemann_Mark-Halperin-Game-Change-Premiere-618x400.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/07/02/bloomberg-editor-o-halperin-heilemann-not-ideological/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bloomberg Editor On Halperin and Heilemann: 'We Are Not Ideological'", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/07/02/John-Heilemann_Mark-Halperin-Game-Change-Premiere-618x400.jpg", "title": "Bloomberg Editor On Halperin and Heilemann: 'We Are Not Ideological' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Drudge, Morning Joe, Twitter,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-07-02T11:52:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Oh, and here\u2019s Heilemann making a gay joke about engaging in \u201ca three-way\u201d with Republican Rick Santorum.\nWhy here\u2019s Heilemann admitting he did not dig into Obama\u2019s Solyndra scandal right before agreeing there is no scandal.\nOddly enough, Heilemann has been much more charitable towards serial child rapist Jerry Sandusky than Santorum and us scary, ferocious Republicans.\nBut at that particular time of passage in 2010, in Time Magazine, Halperin boasted about how the media wouldn\u2019t vet ObamaCare and by doing so, Halperin encouraged them not to.\nI\u2019m not sure \u201cideological\u201d and \u201csewer\u201d means what Bloomberg thinks it means."}
