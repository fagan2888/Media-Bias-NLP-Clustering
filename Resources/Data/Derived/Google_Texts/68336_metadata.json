Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley participated separately in a candidate discussion moderated by journalist and illegal alien Jose Antonio Vargas. Both speakers were interrupted by shouting protesters from the #BlackLivesMatter movement and were unable to continue.\n\nO\u2019Malley was being interrupted by protesters and, after pleas from the stage and event organizers, was allowed to continue. He went on to say, \u201cI know, I know\u2026Let me talk a little bit\u2026Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter,\u201d which the crowd did not appreciate. The chants and boos got louder and the candidate left the stage.\n\nO'Malley gaffes with this crowd: \"Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter.\" Huge groans and boos. #NN15 \u2014 daveweigel (@daveweigel) July 18, 2015\n\nO'Malley just said #AllLivesMatter which means he just doesn't get it. #NN15 \u2014 Emily Epstein White (@EmEps) July 18, 2015\n\nO'Malley time on stage has basically been shut down by #blacklivesmatter demonstrators at #nn15 pic.twitter.com/3B5jLHQ1kr \u2014 Chris Moody (@moody) July 18, 2015\n\nLol Martin OMalley disrupted by protesters chanting \"what side are you on\" #nn15 https://t.co/a3BsiyPgfc \u2014 el Sooper \u0646 (@SooperMexican) July 18, 2015\n\nNext came Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist and favorite of the far left. It did not start well and went downhill from there.\n\nSanders, a long-time advocate against \u201cincome inequality,\u201d attempted to make opening remarks on the subject, but was shouted down by the same protesters. He replied, \u201cBlack lives of course matter. But I have spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and if you don\u2019t want me to be here, that\u2019s OK. I will answer your question but I\u2019d like to speak for a couple of minutes, I was told\u2026\u201d\n\nNever able to speak for any amount of time, Sanders soon left the stage long before his discussion was scheduled to end.\n\nThis Sanders/#NN15 event is a fascinating clash between social democratic class politics and new left identity politics. \u2014 daveweigel (@daveweigel) July 18, 2015\n\nBernie Sanders refusing to address white supremacy. Where's the courage? #nn15 \u2014 Hairo Cortes (@HCortes96) July 18, 2015\n\nBernie Sanders tries out some \"immigrants hurt our jobs\" rhetoric at #nn15, and then he gets booed loudly. That's nice to hear. \u2014 Barry Deutsch (@barrydeutsch) July 18, 2015\n\nBernie Sanders touts Obamacare at #nn15.
