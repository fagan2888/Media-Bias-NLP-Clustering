When the pills ran out she started thinking about hurting herself.\n\n\u201cOnce the meds start coming out of my system, in the past, it\u2019s always caused me to relapse,\u201d she said. \u201cI start self-medicating and trying to stop the crazy thoughts in my head.\u201d\n\nJail officials gave her neither prescription refills nor a Medicaid card to pay for them, she said. Within days she was back on heroin \u2014 her preferred self-medication \u2014 and sleeping in abandoned homes around Baltimore\u2019s run-down Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood.\n\nThousands of people leave incarceration every year without access to the coverage and care they\u2019re entitled to, jeopardizing their own health and sometimes the public\u2019s.\n\nAdvocates for ex-convicts held high hopes for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion that promised to deliver insurance to previously excluded single adults starting in 2014, including almost everybody released from prisons and jails.\n\nMany former inmates are mentally ill or struggle with drug abuse, diabetes or HIV and hepatitis C infection. Most return to poor communities such as West Baltimore\u2019s Sandtown, which exploded in violence a year ago after Freddie Gray died from injuries sustained in police custody.\n\nBut Maryland\u2019s prison agency, which three years ago said it was \u201cwell positioned\u201d to enroll released inmates in Medicaid, is signing up fewer than a tenth of those who leave prisons and jails every year, according to state data. Few other states that have expanded Medicaid under the health law are doing any better, specialists say.\n\nMany of them will end up in the emergency departments if we don\u2019t attempt to connect them to services prior to release. Traci Kodeck\n\nOfficials of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services say they do the best they can with limited resources, enrolling the most severely ill in Medicaid while letting most ex-inmates fend for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are battling, every one of us,\u201d to maximize coverage, said prison medical director Dr. Sharon Baucom, pointing to efforts to train sign-up specialists, get Medicaid insurance for hospitalized inmates and share information on mentally ill inmates with other agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are handoffs that could be improved,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the resources that we currently have, and the process that we have in place, we could do more \u2014 and we just need some more help.\u201d\n\nCoverage under Medicaid was seen as an unprecedented chance to transform care for ex-inmates by connecting them to treatment, reducing emergency room visits, controlling disease and putting them on a path to rehabilitation.\n\nAs many as 90 percent of people leaving prisons and jails are eligible for Medicaid in states such as Maryland that expanded the federally supported program for low-income residents under the health act, experts estimate. The law gave states the option of extending Medicaid coverage to all low-income adults under 65, not just the children, pregnant women and disabled adults who were mainly included before.\n\nSickest Inmates Are First In Line\n\nSome 12,000 of Maryland\u2019s 21,000 prison inmates are designated at any given time as chronically ill with behavioral problems, diabetes, HIV, asthma, high blood pressure and other conditions, according to prison officials. But given limited means and the already tall order of connecting emerging prisoners with transportation, shelter and employment, the system focuses on enrolling the very sickest, Baucom said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame to have to make that call,\u201d she said.\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nA Double Burden Of Prison And Disease By Naema Ahmed, Marissa Laliberte, Catherine Sheffo and Daniel Trielli\n\nCAPITAL NEWS SERVICE Areas with high incarceration rates also tend to be sicker than average, as shown by HIV and imprisonment data for Baltimore. Linking released inmates to coverage and care could improve public health in these neighborhoods, advocates say.\n\nSources: Justice Policy Institute, Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission\n\nDr. Rosalyn Stewart saw what happened to many chronically ill ex-offenders when she ran a recently completed pilot program to enroll former inmates in Medicaid and get them treatment and shelter.\n\n\u201cPeople frequently ran out of their medications and did not have access to the care they needed,\u201d said Stewart, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University medical school.\n\nMcHoul, 40, spent two short stays last year in Baltimore\u2019s Women\u2019s Detention Center. The first time the facility released her without Medicaid coverage. Shortly afterwards she landed in a hospital with an inflamed esophagus. She got out after a second jail stay in August without knowing the hospital had enrolled her in Medicaid between incarcerations, she said.\n\nAt neither time did she have more than two weeks\u2019 supply of any medication, including Depakote, a mood stabilizer, she said. For some prescriptions there was less than a week\u2019s store.\n\n\u201cIt was whatever was left in the blister pack,\u201d said McHoul, who\u2019s now in a Baltimore drug treatment program. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Here\u2019s your supply. Sign this that we gave them to you. See you later.\u2019\u201d\n\nState policy is to give exiting prisoners 30 days\u2019 worth of medicine. But a court ordered McHoul released shortly after she was arrested the second time, which didn\u2019t give the jail enough time to prepare medications, said a corrections spokesman.\n\nThere are many Stacey McHouls.\n\n\u201cMaybe somebody needs prescription services and they\u2019re not enrolled and they don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d said Traci Kodeck, interim CEO of HealthCare Access Maryland, a nonprofit that connects consumers to coverage and has worked with the prison system. \u201cAbsolutely it happens. Many of them will end up in the emergency departments if we don\u2019t attempt to connect them to services prior to release.\u201d\n\nMark Pruitt, 46, was released from a Baltimore facility in October with no Medicaid card and a craving for heroin, which he said he had used before he was incarcerated for a parole violation.\n\nHe desperately wanted to enter a drug treatment program, but signing up for Medicaid to pay for it was going to take weeks \u2014 far longer than he could wait.\n\n\u201cI knew what I wanted. I wanted help,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wanted help. But it\u2019s a struggle when you\u2019re broke \u2014 no money, no insurance, feeling defeated. Where do you turn?\u201d\n\nIf administrators at a Baltimore recovery facility hadn\u2019t gotten him enrolled in Medicaid, he said, \u201cI think I\u2019d be dead.\u201d\n\nFrom January 2014, when the Medicaid expansion took effect, through this March, Maryland released almost 16,000 people sentenced to prison or jail, according to state data. Thousands more cycle in and out of jails each year without being convicted.\n\nThis KHN story also ran in The Baltimore Sun . It can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nBut the corrections department said it enrolled only 1,337 released inmates in Medicaid from the beginning of 2014 through late March. Another 1,158 prisoners joined Medicaid over that time when they were hospitalized. (Medicaid covers inmates if they spend 24 hours as hospital inpatients; most return to prison.)\n\nMany ex-prisoners are enrolled only when they experience a crisis and end up in an emergency room \u2014 the kind of expensive care health officials are trying to reduce. The law requires hospitals to treat emergency cases regardless of insurance coverage. They can retroactively sign those patients for Medicaid.\n\n\u2018They Don\u2019t Want To Do The Paperwork\u2019\n\nMonique Wright, 35, got out of Jessup Correctional Institution last fall and began suffering acute head and neck pain caused by scoliosis, a spine curvature. Without Medicaid coverage or a doctor, she said she had to seek emergency care at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the paperwork\u201d that keeps prison officials from making sure people like her have Medicaid upon release, Wright said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do the paperwork. They don\u2019t have the staff to do the paperwork.\u201d\n\nAdvocates wonder why the corrections system is so poor at enrolling what, they often point out, is \u201cliterally a captive audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had them housed for the past 10, 15 years,\u201d said a frustrated Andre Fisher, a case manager for ex-inmates at Druid Heights Community Development Corp., a nonprofit in West Baltimore. \u201cWhat\u2019s so hard about it?\u201d\n\nTeressa Jackson learned the prison system hadn\u2019t reactivated her Medicaid eligibility when she got out last year. Jackson called the medical hotline at her Medicaid managed care organization. \u201cThey said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do because the jail still has a hold on your Medicaid. We can get it lifted but it may take a couple days.\u2019\u201d (Doug Kapustin for KHN) Jesse Fields is a former inmate who had trouble getting drug-addiction treatment last year. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get on the methadone program because I didn\u2019t have insurance. I was pretty much just out panhandling every day. Holding up a sign, \u2018Need Money for Food.\u2019 Anything I could do to get money.\u201d (Doug Kapustin for KHN) John Whitaker is a former inmate who discovered his Medicaid coverage had expired when he went to the hospital recently. \u201cThat\u2019s when the lady said, \u2018You know, you\u2019re not covered with insurance.\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m supposed to be. I got my insurance card\u2026\u2019 She said, \u2018No, you\u2019re not in the system right now.\u2019 So she came back up and she put it back through for me again.\u201d (Doug Kapustin for KHN) Robert Alston is a house manager at A Step Forward, a Baltimore nonprofit supporting recovering drug users. \u201cSometimes, you know, the system doesn\u2019t send [ex-inmates] home with that monthly supply\u201d of medicine. \u201cSo we have to work rapidly if we come across this.\u201d (Doug Kapustin for KHN) Nichole Franklin is a volunteer for A Step Forward. \u201cYou need your health insurance. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t play with.\u201d (Doug Kapustin for KHN) Travis Howell is a house manager for A Step Forward. When ex-prisoners emerge without insurance, \u201cwe have to reapply and take them through the steps. It\u2019s really time consuming, depending on the person. Depending on the situation, it can easily be a month.\u201d (Doug Kapustin for KHN)\n\nEnrolling inmates in Medicaid can take weeks, prison officials said. Sometimes the card doesn\u2019t arrive until after they\u2019re out. Computer problems slowed sign-ups in late 2014.\n\nOne mistake made by Maryland and most other states is not considering inmates for Medicaid until their release dates approach, said Colleen Barry, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has studied the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad way to do it because you\u2019re getting a very small number\u201d of enrollees by waiting, she said. A better alternative is to enroll inmates when they are booked, as Chicago\u2019s Cook County Jail has demonstrated, she said. Those incarcerated are generally ineligible for Medicaid, but putting them in the system when they enter makes it easier to trigger coverage when they leave, she added.\n\nEx-Inmates Struggle To Get Medicaid Without Help\n\nIf it\u2019s hard for the prison system to enroll inmates, it\u2019s even harder for the individuals to enroll themselves. Those who emerge without Medicaid face a maze of applications, bus trips, phone calls and queues if they want to sign up. Many don\u2019t bother.\n\nFor most leaving incarceration, \u201cit\u2019s up to you to go there, make sure you get your health insurance,\u201d said Jamal McCoy, 21, who was living with family in West Baltimore on home detention before he was released. \u201cMost people don\u2019t go. Some people take it easy when they get home.\u201d\n\nThose who try often find that lack of identification is the first challenge. To prevent fraud, Maryland and other states require Medicaid applicants to show verified Social Security numbers.\n\nBut jails frequently lose inmate IDs, say prisoners and enrollment officials. Those locked up for years are non-persons for much of the system, with no credit records or driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThat can mean delays of many weeks when released prisoners are especially vulnerable. Gaps in coverage and care of even a few days after fragile patients leave the corrections health system can make the difference between life and death.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the diabetic that hasn\u2019t been compliant with your medication, you need your medication now,\u201d said Henrietta Sampson, director of treatment coordination at Powell Recovery Center, a Baltimore addiction recovery agency that works with ex-inmates. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait two weeks because you may drop dead.\u201d\n\nCompared to the rest of the population, ex-prisoners in Washington state were a dozen times more likely to die in the first two weeks after release, according to research by Dr. Ingrid Binswanger, lead researcher for Kaiser Permanente Colorado\u2019s Institute for Health Research. Drug overdose, cardiovascular disease, homicide and suicide were the leading causes of death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to manage that transition, to make sure people have continuity of care,\u201d she said. (Kaiser Permanente has no relationship with Kaiser Health News.)\n\nYet in some cases the prison system has stymied outside groups trying to arrange inmates\u2019 coverage. Stewart\u2019s group repeatedly sought permission \u2014 \u201ccontinuously, for about three years,\u201d she said \u2014 to meet vulnerable prisoners inside the facility to get an early start on enrollment and post-release appointments. It never happened.\n\nBaucom blamed the problem on \u201ccompeting priorities\u201d and staff turnover.\n\nAcceptance into Medicaid by the state isn\u2019t the end of the story. Released inmates then must enroll in a private managed-care organization hired by Maryland to provide coverage. That can take weeks longer.\n\nEven when insured, ex-inmates face the same barriers to care experienced by other low-income Baltimoreans \u2014 or worse.\n\nMany prison inmates are infected with hepatitis C, which can cause liver damage or cancer over time. But the high cost of curing the disease has prompted Maryland\u2019s and other Medicaid programs to limit access to treatment to those whose livers are already compromised.\n\n\u201cI guess I got to wait until damage is done to my liver,\u201d said William Carter, 50, adding that prison officials initiated Medicaid enrollment when he got out last year.\n\nReleased prisoners often have no idea that some Medicaid managed-care contractors allow them to use only certain doctors and pharmacies.\n\nIf you\u2019re the diabetic that hasn\u2019t been compliant with your medication, you need your medication now. You can\u2019t wait two weeks because you may drop dead. Henrietta Sampson\n\n\u201cSo a patient goes to Walgreens or wherever to fill something and it\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019ll be $150,\u2019\u201d because he should have gone somewhere else, said Stewart. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand what the problem was.\u201d\n\nEven checking all the right boxes sometimes isn\u2019t enough for ex-inmates, who bear the double stigma of poverty and a criminal history.\n\nOne released prisoner got an appointment to renew his mental health prescription with a facility in Carroll County, Maryland \u2014 his home \u2014 that also accepted his Medicaid card, said Baucom. After the clinic learned he had a prison record it cancelled the visit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have a card,\u201d Baucom said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have access.\u201d\n\nNeighborhoods are at risk when former inmates with chronic illness return.\n\n\u201cYou really need to think about this as a public health issue,\u201d said Scott Nolen, director of drug treatment programs for the Open Society Institute\u2013Baltimore, a nonprofit that works on criminal justice policy. \u201cThere is transmission of communicable diseases that happens in prison, in confined spaces. And now those folks are coming back into communities, and we want to make sure they get health care.\u201d\n\nIn few places is the burden greater than Sandtown-Winchester. Gray, 25, died of spinal injuries that prosecutors filing manslaughter and assault charges blamed on police who arrested him.\n\nThe Justice Policy Institute, a nonprofit, called Sandtown \u201cground zero for the use of incarceration\u201d in Baltimore last year, estimating that nearly one resident in 30 is in prison.\n\nAt the same time, three West Baltimore ZIP codes including Sandtown showed the highest rates of HIV infection in Maryland in 2014, according to hospital data from the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission obtained and analyzed by Kaiser Health News and Capital News Service.\n\nThe corrections department could use more computers, release planners and other enrollment resources, Baucom said.\n\n\u201cIf you do the checkoff list, we\u2019ve checked off everything we can do,\u201d she said, noting efforts to increase enrollment capacity and cooperate with the Maryland motor vehicle agency to get inmates state IDs.\n\nJesse Jannetta, a specialist at the Urban Institute in prisoner re-entry, believes Maryland\u2019s low sign-up rate \u201cis not unusual\u201d in other states. A study published in Health Affairs found prisons and jails nationwide had enrolled 112,520 people in Medicaid from late 2013 up to January 2015, although the authors believe the actual figure was higher.\n\nFederal and state prisons released 636,000 people in 2014, according to the Justice Department. Millions more are estimated to cycle through jails each year.\n\nFew independent experts expect Maryland \u2014 let alone most other states \u2014 to come anywhere close to full enrollment of emerging inmates anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re just at the tip of the iceberg\u201d in prisoner enrollment, said Johns Hopkins\u2019 Barry, a coauthor of the Health Affairs study. \u201cMaryland is always an innovator. If Maryland is still at the cutting edge of how to do this, many areas of the country don\u2019t have any of these types of programs in place.\u201d\n\nThis story is a partnership with The Baltimore Sun and Capital News Service, which is run by the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.
