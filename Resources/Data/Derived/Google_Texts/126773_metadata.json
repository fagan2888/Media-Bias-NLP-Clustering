(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nRTR host communities eligible for grant As a host town for the Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, nonprofit organizations in Ca\u00f1on City are eligible to apply for a $5,000 grant. The Denver Post Community Foundation, in partnership with Wells Fargo, will award grants in each host community during the 30th annual Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, June 13-20. These grants will support programs that benefit children and youth; arts and culture; education and literacy; and the provision of basic human services. Beginning in 2001, Ride The Rockies host communities have been invited to apply for funding as part of the Ride The Rockies Community Grant Program. During the past 14 years, 96 grants have been distributed totaling more than $520,000. The grants are awarded in each community on the same day the cyclists arrive in town. \"Every year our host communities go out of their way to make the cyclists feel welcome,\" said Chandler Smith, tour director. \"By providing a grant to each town, we are able to give back to the communities which help to make this event possible.\" Grant applications are only available to nonprofit agencies in towns where Ride The Rockies stay overnight or where the Tour concludes. Qualifying towns for 2015 include: Grand Junction, Hotchkiss, Gunnison, Crested Butte, Salida, Ca\u00f1on City and Westcliffe. Award announcements for The Denver Post Community Foundation/Ride The Rockies Grant Program will be made in mid-April. For more information or to request a grant application, contact Renee Wheelock, Community Relations manager, at (303) 954-6704 or rwheelock@denverpost.com, or visit www.ridetherockies.com. \u2014 Information provided by Ride The Rockies\n\nCa\u00f1on City once again has been selected to be a host community for the Ride The Rockies 30th Anniversary Bicycle Tour.\n\nRoute for the 30th annual Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour. (Ride the Rockies / Courtesy)\n\nThis year's tour will be June 14-20, spanning 465 miles and ascending 40,537 vertical feet through Grand Junction, Hotchkiss, Gunnison, Crested Butte, Salida and Ca\u00f1on City; and joining the cast for its first time is the town of Westcliffe. The tour will roll into town June 19 and spend the night before heading to its final stop in Westcliffe on June 20.\n\n\"We are just thrilled, thrilled, thrilled,\" said Ca\u00f1on City Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Lisa Hyams on Saturday after the official release of this year's tour schedule.\n\nCyclists were slated to ride across the Royal Gorge Bridge during the 2013 tour, but they were rerouted because of the Royal Gorge Fire that had sparked just days before the event. The alternate route made the trip longer and more strenuous, but they did make it to Ca\u00f1on City, where they spent one night.\n\nThis year, the trek from Salida to Ca\u00f1on City is 66 miles, and local headquarters will be set up at Ca\u00f1on City Middle School. Hyams said a party is being planned from about 2 to 9 p.m. on the edge of the Arkansas River at Centennial Park.\n\n\"Since we are their last overnight stop, we hope to make it their biggest party night,\" Hyams said.\n\nShe said a large amount of volunteers will be needed for the event, and she would like to see schools and youth take part, as well.\n\n\"We need charities that want to be involved because Ride The Rockies gives a $5,000 check to the charity that is most involved,\" she said.\n\nThe 49-mile Day 7 of the tour begins in Ca\u00f1on City, then runs through Brookside, Florence, Wetmore and Silver Cliff and ends at Westcliffe.\n\nRide The Rockies generates more than $1.5 million in economic impact annually in Colorado, according to Ride The Rockies' official website. Each day of the ride brings an average of $250,000 in economic impact to its host communities. Local businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, bike shops and retailers, benefit from the tour.\n\nAccording to information provided by ridetherockies.com, the tour will bring in 3,000 to 3,500 people, which includes more than 2,000 registered cyclists, event staff, family and friends of riders, unregistered cyclists and others. Ride The Rockies also receives extensive media coverage. In 2014 alone, the Tour generated more than 210 million media \"impressions\" through radio, television and digital and print media.\n\nFor more information, visit http://ridetherockies.com/ or call Hyams at the Chamber at 275-2331.\n\nCarie Canterbury: 719-276-7643, canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/bulletin-board/ci_27485738/rtr-will-roll-into-town-june-19", "modificationDate": "2015-02-08T15:48:31-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0208/20150208__09DRRIDEROCKIESw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "RTR host communities eligible for grantAs a host town for the Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, nonprofit organizations in Ca\u00f1on City are eligible to apply for a $5,000 grant.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:27485738:view"}, "startDate": "2015-02-08T09:07:17-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/bulletin-board/ci_27485738/rtr-will-roll-into-town-june-19", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0208/20150208__09DRRIDEROCKIESw~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "RTR host communities eligible for grantAs a host town for the Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, nonprofit organizations in Ca\u00f1on City are eligible to apply for a $5,000 grant.", "title": "Ride the Rockies Bicycle Tour coming this summer to Ca\u00f1on City"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "RTR host communities eligible for grantAs a host town for the Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, nonprofit organizations in Ca\u00f1on City are eligible to apply for a $5,000 grant.", "title": "Ride the Rockies Bicycle Tour coming this summer to Ca\u00f1on City", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/bulletin-board/ci_27485738/rtr-will-roll-into-town-june-19", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0208/20150208__09DRRIDEROCKIESw~2.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-08T09:07:17-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-02-08T15:46:22-0700", "sailthru.title": "Ride the Rockies Bicycle Tour coming this summer to Ca\u00f1on City", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Calendar", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie CanterburyThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0208/20150208__09DRRIDEROCKIESw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-02-08T09:12:22-0700"}, "article_summary": "This year, the trek from Salida to Ca\u00f1on City is 66 miles, and local headquarters will be set up at Ca\u00f1on City Middle School.\nCa\u00f1on City to be host community for 30th annual Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, set for June 14-20.\nBeginning in 2001, Ride The Rockies host communities have been invited to apply for funding as part of the Ride The Rockies Community Grant Program.\n\u2014 Information provided by Ride The RockiesCa\u00f1on City once again has been selected to be a host community for the Ride The Rockies 30th Anniversary Bicycle Tour.\n(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)RTR host communities eligible for grant As a host town for the Ride The Rockies Bicycle Tour, nonprofit organizations in Ca\u00f1on City are eligible to apply for a $5,000 grant."}
