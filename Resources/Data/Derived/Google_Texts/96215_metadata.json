So in desperation he called a Vietnamese friend, Phuong Hang Phi Duong, to interpret for him.\n\n\n\nA series of blood tests later, he was quickly wheeled into surgery to remove an inflamed appendix.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was luckily at home when he called,\u201d noted Duong, whose timely arrival at the hospital Vu believed saved his life.\n\n\n\nThough medical interpreters play a vital role in providing medical care, there\u2019s a shortage in these professionals, in part because the state currently does not reimburse language interpreters.\n\n\n\nWith health care coverage expanded to an additional 2 million Californians through the Affordable Care Act, community clinics are seeing a need for interpreters like never before.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a number of newly eligible with huge language needs,\u201d asserted Cary Sanders, director of policy analysis with the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network.\n\n\n\nA new state bill seeks to boost the number of medical interpreters in the state.\n\n\n\nVu, as well as one other patient, Ti Wu, a native of Myanmar, shared his experience at a June 20 discussion hosted by Assemblymember Rob Bonta, the Democrat who represents the state\u2019s 18th district, on the critical need for interpreters. California has the nation\u2019s largest immigrant community, and 40 percent of its residents speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\nFor people like them, Bonta said, as he stumped for former Speaker John Perez\u2019s bill, AB 2325, which would create a system \u2013 called CommuniCal -- to improve Medi-Cal beneficiaries\u2019 access to interpreters at physician offices and hospitals in the state, interpreters could make the difference between life and death. Medi-Cal is California\u2019s health care program for its low-income population, known as Medicaid in the rest of the nation.\n\n\n\nAn identical bill introduced by Perez last year was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown, who cited the bad timing created by unprecedented Medi-Cal expansion.\n\n\n\nAt the Asian Health Care Services (AHCS) in Oakland, where care is provided in 15 languages to its patients who are mostly limited in English proficiency, there was a waiting list of some 5,000 patients prior to the full implementation of the ACA, noted its executive director, Sherry Hirota. That was before it opened its new facility last year. Many of those 5,000 people, Hirota said, preferred to wait to be seen at the AHCS because they knew they would encounter language barriers at other clinics.\n\n\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, associate director of the Oakland-based Community Health for Asian Americans, said interpreter services are especially important for patients \u201cwith stigmatized conditions\u201d such as mental health and HIV. Doctors often tap family members to interpret for them.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine how shameful it must be for (patients) to talk about their condition\u201d with family members, he said, noting that interpretation services is not \u201cjust about language alone, but the interpreter should be competent in social and cultural\u201d issues.\n\n\n\nCarlos Garcia, an interpreter, said the bill would also help interpreters as a whole by funding the industry, creating many opportunities for language professionals and companies.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that California, with a population of 38 million, has only 800 certified medical interpreters. A more adequate number, if Minnesota is to be considered a role model for the interpreting industry, would be around 120,000, pointed out an aide to Bonta.\n\n\n\nAB 2325 has sailed through the Assembly and is currently before the Senate Appropriations Committee. If it becomes law, CommuniCal will be funded 50-50 by the state and federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "medi-cal medical interpreters translators AB 2325 John Perez Rob Bonta health care", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
