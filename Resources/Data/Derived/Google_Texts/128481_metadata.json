Tom Corbett\u2019s Healthy PA Medicaid proposal would repeal a program that provides assistance for low- and middle-income workers with disabilities, many of whom would be forced to pay higher health insurance rates in the commercial marketplace.\n\nThe state\u2019s Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities program provides medical benefits to more than 33,000 Pennsylvania workers. Participants pay 5 percent of their monthly earnings toward Medicaid premiums in exchange for need-based benefits that might include clinical visits, medical transportation, drug and alcohol treatment, and dental care.\n\nThe state estimates it would save about $7 million a year by eliminating the program. Under the Healthy PA plan, most new Medicaid recipients would use federal government subsidies to pay for private insurance plans. Healthy PA would offer \u201cpremium assistance\u201d to those earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\nWorkers currently are eligible for the Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities program if they have less than $10,000 in resources \u2014 including retirement savings \u2014 and their household income does not exceed 250 percent of the federal poverty level. That means individual beneficiaries can earn up to $29,175 and a household of four can make up to $59,625 this year.\n\nThat exceeds the typical financial eligibility threshold of Medicaid because the program was designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities who wish to work.\n\n\u201cFor these workers, it can be very rewarding and fulfilling to get a paycheck,\u201d said Steve Christian-Michaels, COO of Family Services of Western Pennsylvania. Jobs can help workers with disabilities better integrate into their communities.\n\nThe insurance subsidy is particularly beneficial to persons with disabilities who do not work a full 40-hour week, a common eligibility requirement in order to receive employer-sponsored medical coverage.\n\nPart-time employment is prevalent among workers with disabilities, many of whom do not have the physical or emotional stamina to work full time. According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013, 34 percent of workers with disabilities are employed part time, in contrast with 19 percent of those with no disability.\n\n\u201c[The Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities program] is the mechanism that allows part-time workers to maintain insurance,\u201d said Mr. Christian-Michaels.\n\nUnder the Corbett administration\u2019s Healthy PA proposal, Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities recipients earning between 134 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty line would lose state-subsidized coverage altogether. Instead, they would rely on federal subsidies through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cThey will be provided with redesigned benefit packages that are consistent with national standards pertaining to essential health benefits, mental health parity and preventive services,\u201d said Kait Gillis, press secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare. \u201cThese services will allow them to maintain their health, remain in a community setting and continue working.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese folks can\u2019t earn a living wage and also pay for the supports they need,\u201d said David Gates, a senior attorney with the Pennsylvania Health Law Project in Philadelphia, adding that the repeal of coverage might even provide a systemic disincentive for these workers to exceed the 134 percent line in earnings.\n\n\u201cHealthy PA is based on the assumption that a different population with different needs can get those supports in the marketplace like other individuals,\u201d said Mr. Gates. \u201cThat fundamental premise \u2026 is flawed.\u201d\n\nThe final review of Healthy PA is due to be announced by the Department of Public Welfare within the month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many people with disabilities would be forced to pay higher health insurance rates in the commercial marketplace.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "If enacted, Republican Gov.
