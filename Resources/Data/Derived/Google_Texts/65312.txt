TWIN FALLS, Idaho (AP) -

A south-central Idaho school district has cut hours for more than 150 workers to avoid having to provide health insurance mandated under the Affordable Care Act.

The Times-News reports in a story on Wednesday that the Twin Falls School District made the move after administrators concluded maintaining work hours would cost the district $1 million.

The board cut weekly hours for teaching aids, food service employees and other non-professionals down to 27.5 hours from previous workweeks of 30 to 34 hours.

Under the Affordable Care Act, employees working 30 or more hours in 2015 will be eligible for full insurance benefits in 2016.

Other school districts in the region tell the newspaper they have no plans to reduce hours for workers.
