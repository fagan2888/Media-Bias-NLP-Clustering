(Reuters)\n\nTHE MORNING PLUM:\n\nThe Washington Post has published an extraordinary and damning report on the rising alarm among Marco Rubio\u2019s top supporters about his faltering campaign and his failure to emerge as the leading alternative to Donald Trump. Buried in the article is an anecdote that helps explain why Rubio \u2014 and, perhaps, other establishment Republicans \u2014 have come up short in halting Trump\u2019s momentum, even after Rubio\u2019s newly aggressive approach to the Donald earned so much empty hype.\n\nWith Rubio coming in third place or worse in the Super Saturday contests, the Post article reports that top Rubio supporters are worried that diving into the gutter with Trump has only diminished Rubio\u2019s \u201cyoung, optimistic image.\u201d It relates that the Rubio campaign strategy of hyping his supposed \u201cMarco-Mentum\u201d on social media has only been \u201ccovering up massive deficiencies inside the states that were voting,\u201d a polite way of saying that the Rubio spin machine failed to manufacture momentum that wasn\u2019t really there.\n\nAnd the piece reports that other Rubio backers are \u201cworried that the freshman senator is not doing enough to make an effective case against the billionaire.\u201d Why? This helps explain it:\n\nAs more than two dozen senior GOP Senate aides looked on Thursday afternoon at a private lunch presentation about the 2016 presidential race, conservative scholar Henry Olsen turned to Rubio\u2019s chief of staff, Alberto Martinez, and offered a candid assessment of the senator\u2019s campaign pitch. Olsen said that while he appreciates Rubio\u2019s sweeping call for building a \u201c21st-century economy,\u201d he worries that speaking in such broad terms in a year of populist unrest may be a political mistake. Later, Olsen gently suggested that Rubio might be better served by fine-tuning his message with a more visceral appeal to working-class Americans who feel left behind and say he\u2019s got their backs. Martinez listened politely, and the conversation moved on.\n\nThis tracks with what I\u2019ve suggested, which is that Rubio is constrained from going hard at precisely the things that have enabled Trump to succeed among GOP voters. Rubio\u2019s selling point to GOP elites had long been that he\u2019d be best positioned to run a general election campaign shaped around the idea that Republicans need to make peace with demographic and cultural change. Trump, by contrast, is plainly running a campaign designed to capitalize on white backlash. But as it turns out, Trump\u2019s call for proactive mass deportations and a ban on Muslims is, well, working among downscale Republican voters. So Rubio has not gone as hard at he might have at those things, even though that might appeal to the younger, suburban, better-educated GOP voters he\u2019s trying to reach, perhaps because he hopes to avoid alienating working class Trump backers he might inherit later.\n\nMeanwhile, Rubio has not prosecuted a strong ideological case against Trump, either. Trump does not argue that the answer to working class voters\u2019 economic woes can be found in idealized notions of free markets and limited government. Instead, he says that stupid, corrupt or weak elites are the problem, promising good trade deals, as opposed to \u201cfree\u201d ones. As Jonathan Chait notes, Trump envisions a government role of some kind in covering the uninsured (Obamacare may be stupid and a failure, but its ideological goals are defensible). Trump vows not to touch the entitlements of aging Republican voters. In sum, Trump combines virulent xenophobia (he would crush the dark forces that make these voters feel economically and physically insecure) with scalding ridicule of the GOP donor class (who is sponsoring Rubio and bankrolling the Stop-Trump campaign) and its domestic agenda for failing those voters, too.\n\nUnlike Trump, Rubio has mostly shaped his agenda around the idea that restraining government is the answer to those voters\u2019 economic woes (though he has nodded towards an affirmative middle class agenda by proposing middle class tax relief and an Obamacare replacement that would cover at least some people). But Trump\u2019s success has exposed limits to that vision\u2019s appeal among GOP voters. That has left Rubio attacking Trump in specific terms on his most glaring non-policy-oriented flaws (his murky business dealings, his disgusting public comments) while mostly defending the conservative vision in very general terms, promising to give conservatism a shot of youthful energy that will make it more palatable to demographically and culturally changing 21st century America.\n\nAll of this could help explain why Rubio has not been able, as the above anecdote relayed by the Post puts it, to make a \u201cvisceral appeal to working-class Americans who feel left behind and say he\u2019s got their backs.\u201d Trump has their backs.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Rubio is toast. If he wins winner-take-all Florida, perhaps he can muddle through to a contested convention and somehow come out of it with the nomination. But if Rubio does ultimately crash and burn, all this could help explain why.\n\n*************************************************************\n\n* CLINTON AND SANDERS BATTLE IN \u2018REAL DEBATE': Jonathan Cohn has a very good piece on the real differences between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders that were on display at last night\u2019s debate. A taste:\n\nThe contrast to the Republican debate from last week, with its juvenile insults, could not have been more stark. Instead of discussing penis length, Clinton and Sanders argued over the sizes of their respective infrastructure programs\u2026.the sharp debate offered Democratic Party voters a clear sense of the choice they face in this primary campaign. Stylistically, Clinton measures her words carefully, while Sanders relishes every chance to say something blunt or bold. Clinton talks about programs, while Sanders likes to invoke big themes. Clinton talks about what she can do, while Sanders talks about what he\u2019d like to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders won more contests on Super Saturday than Clinton did, but Clinton emerged with more delegates.\n\n* TRUMP CRUSHING IT IN MICHIGAN: With the Michigan GOP primary set for tomorrow, a new NBC/Marist poll finds Donald Trump way ahead of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich, at 41-22-17-13. A new CBS News poll finds it at 39-24-16-15. Note this from CBS:\n\nThe poll provides a look at why the so-called establishment voices attempting to slow Trump\u2019s momentum haven\u2019t succeeded, at least not so far. By four to one, Michigan Republicans say they\u2019re less likely to vote for a candidate with establishment backing, not more so.\n\nSurely some tough words from failed billionaire plutocrat dream candidate Mitt Romney will be just the thing to turn this around.\n\n* HILLARY LEADS BIG IN MICHIGAN: The NBC poll finds Hillary Clinton well ahead of Bernie Sanders there (57-40) and the CBS poll puts her up 55-44. From the NBC write-up:\n\nClinton is ahead of Sanders among African Americans (76 percent to 21 percent), those ages 45 and older (68 percent to 27 percent), Democrats (63 percent to 33 percent), women (61 percent to 36 percent), men (51 percent to 47 percent) and whites (49 percent to 48 percent). Sanders, meanwhile, leads among independents (60 percent to 36 percent) and those under 45 years old (61 percent to 39 percent).\n\nIn other words, in the Dem primary, it\u2019s still the same old story.\n\n* MONEY POURS IN TO STOP-TRUMP EFFORT: The New York Times reports that outside groups are ramping up their spending big time to stop Trump from winning the nomination:\n\nFour different groups have reserved at least $10 million in airtime in Florida so far, according to trackers of media spending\u2026.Two from the American Future Fund, which has spent $2 million so far in Florida and Illinois, show decorated veterans assailing Mr. Trump as a poseur on military matters\u2026.Club for Growth Action\u2026has placed $2 million in commercials attacking him in Illinois on top of $1 million in Florida\u2026.Our Principles PAC, which was created to defeat Mr. Trump, has reserved $3.5 million in Illinois and Florida and is also sending direct mail to voters\u2019 homes in Florida.\n\nIn other words, all the cash is pouring into states that vote on March 15th. If Trump does well that day, the panic will grow to a deafening roar.\n\n* IS ROMNEY ANGLING FOR NOMINATION AT CONVENTION? On Meet the Press, Romney was asked point blank if he\u2019d accept the nomination at a contested convention. His answer:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything like that happening. And I don\u2019t think anyone in our party should say, \u2018Oh no, even if the people in the party wanted me to be the president I would say no to it.\u2019 No one\u2019s going to say that. But\u2026I\u2019m not going to be a candidate, I\u2019m going to be endorsing one of the people who\u2019s running for president. And one of the people, I can guarantee you this, one of the people running for president, one of the four, is going to be the Republican party nominee\u2026But I\u2019m not running and I\u2019m not going to be running.\u201d\n\nThat seems to come very close to ruling it out, but what happens if none of the current contenders is close to Trump in delegates, despite him falling short of a majority?\n\n* SOME REPUBLICANS EYE CRUZ AS ALTERNATIVE TO TRUMP: The Associated Press reports that some Republicans are beginning to see Ted Cruz, not Marco Rubio, as the most likely candidate to emerge as a serious competitor to Trump. But there\u2019s a problem with this scenario. As the AP notes, Cruz is \u201cthe only candidate who causes as much heartburn among party elites as the billionaire businessman, if not sometimes more.\u201d\n\nThose silly GOP voters are being so dang uncooperative, aren\u2019t they?\n\n* AND THE QUOTE OF THE DAY, WISHFUL THINKING EDITION: Top Sanders adviser Tad Devine tells Glenn Thrush that Sanders is not going to get out of the race anytime soon, adding: \u201cMaybe they\u2019re going to put him on the ticket then.\u201d\n\nI agree that Sanders has every incentive to stay in as long as possible, but this isn\u2019t the likely conclusion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An epic, damning report on Rubio's failings sheds new light on why he has failed to stop the Donald.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "An epic, damning report on Rubio's failings sheds new light on why he has failed to stop the Donald.", "title": "Panic time: Inside Rubio\u2019s epic failure to stop Trump", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/03/07/panic-time-inside-rubios-epic-failure-to-stop-trump/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Videos/201603/Reuters/Images/2016-03-06T015736Z_1_OV47NK3BZ_RTRMADC_0_USA-ELECTION-RUBIO-NEWSER-ROUGH-CUT.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/03/07/panic-time-inside-rubios-epic-failure-to-stop-trump/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "marco rubio, donald trump, gop presidential primaries, democratic presidential primaries, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, ted cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "marco rubio, donald trump, gop presidential primaries, democratic presidential primaries, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, ted cruz"}, "article_summary": "But Trump\u2019s success has exposed limits to that vision\u2019s appeal among GOP voters.\nThis tracks with what I\u2019ve suggested, which is that Rubio is constrained from going hard at precisely the things that have enabled Trump to succeed among GOP voters.\nAs the AP notes, Cruz is \u201cthe only candidate who causes as much heartburn among party elites as the billionaire businessman, if not sometimes more.\u201dThose silly GOP voters are being so dang uncooperative, aren\u2019t they?\nBut\u2026I\u2019m not going to be a candidate, I\u2019m going to be endorsing one of the people who\u2019s running for president.\nIf Trump does well that day, the panic will grow to a deafening roar."}
