I want to be sharper, not make as many mistakes.\u201d\n\nLast Tuesday, Gray got a no-decision in Colorado\u2019s 10-4 loss to Seattle at Coors Field. The rookie allowed three runs \u2014 two earned \u2014 in four innings. Gray surrendered five hits and two walks while striking out four batters. He threw 77 pitches, 43 of which went for strikes.\n\nThe first inning was not pretty. Gray threw 33 pitches to six batters. To lead off, he threw three 96 mph fastballs and two 95 mph fastballs to Austin Jackson before the Mariners center fielder lined out to DJ LeMahieu at second base. Gray then walked Kyle Seager, struck out Nelson Cruz ,and gave up an RBI double to Robinson Cano and a run-scoring single to Jesus Montero.\n\nGray said he\u2019ll be a different pitcher Monday and hopes to display the things he learned at Triple-A Albuquerque.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m more aggressive now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pitching more to contact now, and I\u2019m not letting my pitch count go up.\u201d\n\nGray gained notoriety at the University of Oklahoma for a fastball that topped 100 mph. He doesn\u2019t cut loose like that now, but he said the firepower is still there when he needs it.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a time and a place for that. If a guy is fouling off pitches, that might be the best time to cut loose, but you have to make sure it\u2019s the right guy you\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nStreak stopper. Before taking two of three games from the Nationals, the Rockies had lost eight consecutive road series. According to Stats, Inc., that stretch tied for third-longest stretch in franchise history.\n\nFootnotes. Two-time Gold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado committed two errors Sunday, with another play originally ruled an error, then changed to a fielder\u2019s choice. \u2026 LeMahieu, who hit the go-ahead, game-winning single in the eighth inning Sunday, is batting .382 since July 4, hitting safely in 24-of-29 games.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Jon Gray (0-0, 4.50 ERA) at Mets\u2019 Jonathon Niese (6-9, 3.51), 5:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nNiese, at one time rumored to be a trade target by the Rockies, has turned his season around. Since the beginning of June, the left-hander owns a 2.78 ERA with 49 strikeouts against just 20 walks in 71 innings. He has had a tough time against the Rockies, going 1-3 with a 4.98 ERA. Gray, Colorado\u2019s top pitching prospect, is making his second big-league start. He was so-so in his debut against Seattle, getting a no-decision in Colorado\u2019s 10-4 loss at Coors Field. He allowed three runs (two earned) on five hits in four innings.\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (3-4, 4.66 ERA) at Mets\u2019 Matt Harvey (10-7, 2.76), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-4, 4.85) at Mets\u2019 Jacob deGrom (10-6, 2.13), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (3-9, 5.50) at Mets\u2019 Noah Syndergaard (6-6, 3.01), 10:10 a.m., no TV\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray expects better things in second career start", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray expects better things in second career start", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/09/rockies-jon-gray-expects-better-things-in-second-career-start/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150804__bbn-grayp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150804__bbn-grayp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-09T17:36:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T10:56:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb364\"", "article_summary": "Gray, Colorado\u2019s top pitching prospect, is making his second big-league start.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In his second start, Jon Gray wants a better beginning.\nGray threw 33 pitches to six batters.\nThe Rockies\u2019 prized right-hander takes the mound for the second time in his major-league career Monday night against the New York Mets at Citi Field.\nGray said he\u2019ll be a different pitcher Monday and hopes to display the things he learned at Triple-A Albuquerque."}
