SEASIDE HEIGHTS—Blocks away from sections of the boardwalk that were destroyed in Thursday's massive fire, Seaside Heights will host a festival today and tomorrow to honor the town's 100th anniversary.



The anniversary party and Boy Scouts Camporee—an annual event that's expected to draw thousands of scouts and their families from across the state— are both "on," according to a statement from Stronger than the Storm, a publicity campaign developed to raise awareness about the shore's recovery from Hurricane Sandy.



The free admission festival will feature live music, surf lessons and skateboard stunts, among other things on the Seaside Heights boardwalk between Sherman and Carteret avenues near Casino Pier until 9:30 p.m. tonight and 7:30 p.m. tomorrow night.
