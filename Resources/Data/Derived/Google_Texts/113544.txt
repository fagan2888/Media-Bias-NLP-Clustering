Radiohead’s Thom Yorke released a surprise album, “Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes,” today via BitTorrent.

Last week, Yorke sparked a flurry of Internet rumors after he and the music artists, Nigel Godrich — a frequent collaborator, and Radiohead producer — posted images of white vinyl on Tumblr.

In a letter Yorke and Godrich, explained why they selected BitTorrent — the peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that does not rely on a single server:

“As an experiment we are using a new version of BitTorrent to distribute a new Thom Yorke record. The new Torrent files have a pay gate to access a bundle of files.. The files can be anything, but in this case is an ‘album’. It’s an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around … If it works well it could be an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work. Enabling those people who make either music, video or any other kind of digital content to sell it themselves. Bypassing the self elected gate-keepers. If it works anyone can do this exactly as we have done. The torrent mechanism does not require any server uploading or hosting costs or ‘cloud’ malarkey. It’s a self-contained embeddable shop front… The network not only carries the traffic, it also hosts the file. The file is in the network. Oh yes and it’s called Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes.
