About 48 million Americans \u2014 including more than 6 million Texans \u2014 were uninsured in 2011 and 2012.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s signature health reform law requires most Texans to carry health insurance by March 31. Texas is one of 36 states participating in the federal marketplace because Texas' Republican majority, which vehemently opposes the federal health law, declined to establish a state-based insurance marketplace.\n\nSebelius has been under fire since Oct. 1, when the launch of the federal marketplace proved disastrous. Although the federal government has brought in new leadership and staff to fix the website, state officials are still concerned that the website is not running smoothly. For example, Texas Health and Human Services Commissioner Kyle Janek has questioned the accuracy of patient information sent to his agency to enroll applicants in Medicaid.\n\nState leaders have also raised concerns that the federal navigator program, which trains people to help the uninsured find health coverage in the federal marketplace, does not offer adequate consumer privacy protections. The Texas Department of Insurance is in the process of approving additional regulations on federal \u201cnavigators,\u201d which would require additional training, background checks and prohibit conflicts of interest.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, also scheduled a federal hearing in Richardson next month to investigate the navigator program in response to a series of videos released by Project Veritas, a conservative group led by James O\u2019Keefe. The videos show federal navigators in Texas breaking program rules. Project Veritas released its fourth video on Wednesday, and says five navigators have been fired as a result of its investigations.\n\n*Editor's note: The original version of this story incorrectly reported that Texas had the highest number of people who had purchased a health plan in the federal marketplace. More people have purchased a plan in Florida.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
