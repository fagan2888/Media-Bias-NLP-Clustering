And at night, have your child write in the journal where you\u2019ve been,\u201d his teacher said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d I said. \u201cTemple.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m Jewish. My people like to joke, especially in the face of sorrow, like when my son comes home from school singing, \u201cGod is great. He is awesome,\u201d or \u201cGod is so good, he\u2019s so good to me.\u201d It\u2019s like living with Billy Graham. Last Christmas, with his mild speech impediment, he sang, \u201cNo woom at da inn, no woom at da inn, but you will find woom in my heart\u2014\u201d and I almost wept because it was so lovely, until he got to the next line, \u201cLord Jethuth.\u201d\n\nSo why send my kid to daycare in a church? It was close to our house, the teachers really are kind, and it was cheap! And so I suffer the songs and stories, the glitter crucifixes, and the occasional houseguests \u2013 and their donkey.\n\nMy husband is actually Christian, which means by default, so is a part of my son. But like an open magic marker on a tablecloth, the Christian side of my son is bleeding over to my side, and I feel a need to protect my turf. And so every December, I give a little pushback, trying to extol the virtues of Hanukkah. It\u2019s not easy. Comparing Christmas to Hanukkah is like asking, \u201cWould you rather have ice cream or fiber?\u201d But I stand firm. Every time he says, \u201cAfter Thanksgiving comes Christmas,\u201d I say, \u201cActually Hanukkah comes first. Then Christmas,\u201d to which he replies, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d And then I find myself in an argument with a 3-year-old, which I never win because he doesn\u2019t give a lick about being right.\n\nThe other day, we bought some Hanukkah gel window decorations, and by the time my son went to bed, he had turned the candles into rocket ships with little flames coming out the back. By morning, the menorah was gone entirely.\n\n\u201cI threw it out,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to celebrate Hanukkah,\u201d I said, but like a dog that can\u2019t stop itself from growling, I added, \u201cI\u2019ll just send back your Hanukkah presents.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I like Hanukkah,\u201d he cried. Sure you do, I thought. Two-timer.\n\nMy son\u2019s teacher told me they were going to discuss all of the holidays, so I lent them my menorah and candles. My husband said I should lend them my electric menorah, which has little light bulbs instead of candles, because he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d let children near an open flame, but I thought, fire\u2019s all we got.\n\n\u201cDid your teachers talk about Hanukkah at school?\u201d I asked my son.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a star. We made candy. We made everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you talked about Hanukkah?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThey said Hanukkah has a little star,\u201d he said, barely listening to himself.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cthey make it sound very exciting.\u201d\n\nIt was sort of an inopportune time to bring home Mary, Joseph and the donkey, in the midst of my efforts to resurrect my son\u2019s Jewish side, but I had no choice. As we walked out of his school with the bag of cardboard cutouts, my son bumped into some classmates, and they began playing tag in front of the school. As we were leaving, one of the mothers began waving her arms urgently to get me to stop.
