John Eichelberger believes that the time has come for Pennsylvania to stop using its payroll system to collect political money for government unions, and plenty of his fellow lawmakers agree.\n\nThe state Senate on Wednesday passed Eichelberger\u2019s paycheck protection legislation in a 26-23 vote, sending it to the state House for consideration.\n\nOriginally, the bill prohibited the state from collecting all dues, fees, and political action committee money for all government unions, except for those representing public safety employees. Republican state senators tweaked it Tuesday, approving an Eichelberger amendment that still bars the collection of political money but allows the deduction of fair-share fees that fund representational activities for unions.\n\n\u201cWhere we have to draw the line\u2014which seems very reasonable\u2014is that they cannot any longer collect political money,\u201d said Eichelberger, R-Blair.\n\nConservatives have tried to muscle through paycheck protection for about two years, and the tenor of the debate has changed little.\n\nRepublicans contend that public resources and politics should never mix. Democrats respond that conservatives want to stifle the political voice of middle-class workers and scoff at comparisons to past scandals in which public officials went to prison for using state resources for political purposes.\n\nGovernment unions, which would have to collect money directly from their members if the bill became law, sharply criticize the legislation.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 represents employees who work in state-run liquor stores. Its president, Wendell Young IV, said Republicans are wasting time and taxpayer money pushing ahead something Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf would likely oppose.\n\n\u201cIt kind of reminds me of the exercise in Washington, where Republicans keep voting to repeal Obamacare knowing the president will never sign such a thing,\u201d Young said.\n\nPreviously, Republicans haven\u2019t had much success with paycheck protection, even when they had a GOP governor, Tom Corbett, who would have signed the legislation. In 2014, a scaled back version of paycheck protection that would have stopped school districts from collecting union dues from employee paychecks failed in the Senate.\n\nBut Wednesday went much better for conservatives, who hailed the Senate vote as a step forward.\n\n\u201cWorkers should be free to make their own decisions about the organizations and political candidates they support and pay directly out of their own pocket for any candidate they want to see elected,\u201d said Kevin Shivers, executive state director of the National Federation of Independent Business in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s just dead wrong for the state government, which is supported by tax dollars, to do the union\u2019s bidding by collecting funds that, in turn, are used for political purposes.\u201d\n\nEichelberger\u2019s amendment was considered key to persuade enough senators to support the measure.\n\nStill, some lawmakers might take issue with another change made Tuesday: The amendment also moves public safety unions under the prohibition.\n\nState Sen. John Rafferty, a Montgomery County Republican running for attorney general, unsuccessfully lobbied to keep the exemption in place for police and firefighters, who in the past were exempted from legislation such as pension reform.\n\nThe state should collect money those employees\u2019 unions could use for politics, Rafferty said, because it\u2019s their way \u201cto show their support for candidates running for election or re-election who represent their values and stand with them as a law-enforcement community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are men and women that work shift work leave their homes and don\u2019t know if they\u2019re coming back to their families. They are different,\u201d Rafferty said.\n\nThe plea didn\u2019t resonate. Including carve-outs, Eichelberger says, would create a \u201cvery dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nRafferty\u2019s political ambitions also opened a window for more targeted criticism.\n\n\u201cI guess considering he\u2019s a candidate for the top law enforcement job in the state, he\u2019s pandering to those particular people,\u201d Young said. \u201cYou either believe people have the right to do this or you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think you get to pick between which people do or don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRafferty\u2019s chief of staff, Ryan Boop, could not be reached to comment.\n\nThe vote came just after the Commonwealth Foundation, a free-market think-tank, found that 67 percent of 700 registered voters polled last month support paycheck protection. Backing was strongest among Republicans (75 percent), but even most Democrats (59 percent) agreed. The margin of error was 3.7 percent.\n\n\u201cMore than two-thirds of Pennsylvania voters believe we should end the use of taxpayer resources for the collection of union dues and campaign contributions,\u201d said Nathan Benefield, vice president of policy analysis for the Commonwealth Foundation. \u201cThis support transcends all political parties.\u201d\n\nLawmakers should rally behind the reform, Eichelberger said.\n\n\u201cHow we\u2019ve allowed, and how the courts have allowed, unions to continue to collect political money through government payrolls is something that I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Eichelberger said. \u201cAnd many others are asking that we correct this loophole in the law to make sure that nobody is doing what most of us know we can\u2019t do and our staff cannot do as we go about our business here in this building.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A state senator believes it's time for Pennsylvania to stop using its payroll system to collect political money for government unions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A state senator believes it's time for Pennsylvania to stop using its payroll system to collect political money for government unions.", "title": "Pa.
