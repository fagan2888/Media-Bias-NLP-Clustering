They get sent to me.\"\n\nWhen Weininger opened his practice, fairly affluent families from the city often would visit him, he said.\n\nWhen those families moved away and the city's economy declined, the eye doctor said he was determined to remain in his neighborhood.\n\n\"It sounds corny, but it's nice to be needed,\" he said. \"My primary goal in life is not to make a million bucks, but to make enough to survive and help my fellow man. Unfortunately, that doesn't help pay the bills.\"\n\nA past Lions Club president, Weininger now serves as the organization's secretary.\n\nHe said he noticed that as New Brunswick redevelops, needy families are \"pushed\" into other towns, such as Franklin, North Brunswick or Highland Park. He said he continues to serve them.\n\nWeininger said that he expects New Brunswick to have a much different economic mix in 10 years as renovations continue. And while the job climate seems to have improved for his patients' families within the past five years, needs remain great, he said.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. David Weininger, an optometrist, stands outside of his office in New Brunswick.

I don't know if it's that the parents who don't know how to dress them or if that's all they got. Most of the time, their clothes aren't clean, so I think for a lot of people, getting by isn't as apparent as it might have been at one time.\"\n\nStaff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319; bmakin@MyCentralJersey.com\n\nHow you can help\n\nFrom Nov. 30 to Dec. 7, we are highlighting the stories of eight organizations helped by the Needy Cases Fund.
