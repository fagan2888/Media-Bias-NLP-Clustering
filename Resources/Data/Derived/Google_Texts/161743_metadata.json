The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the National Coalition of Civil Rights, half of the U.S. Senate, and the President have each voiced their support for a name change. A regional umbrella church group is even calling for a boycott. For me, as a Washington, D.C, area resident for the past 28 years, I have never felt comfortable rooting for the team because of its name. Many arguments have been made to keep the name, but none stand up to even a simple critique. Here is my view on each.\n\nThe word \u201credskins\u201d is not racist; this is political correctness run amok. Nearly every modern American dictionary classifies the word as \u201cracist\u201d or \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has now twice ruled the word is disparaging. Random House Dictionary listed it as racist in 1966. The Oxford English Dictionary says it is \u201cdated or offensive.\u201d The Merriam-Webster dictionary says it is \u201cusually offensive.\u201d No source classifies the word as an honor or term of respect. \u201cPolitical correctness\u201d has always played a role in the social and cultural development of our country. We have, thankfully and belatedly, virtually banned the use of the \u201cn-word\u201d and avoided or stopped using derogatory terms such as \"queer\" and \"retard,\" for example. Why is it that the ones who cry \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d are usually never the focus of it?\n\nIt is part of the history of Washington, D.C. True, \u201credskins\u201d was the name of the team when it moved to D.C. in 1937. But just because something is historical doesn\u2019t make it right or insulate it from change. Examples include: Jim Crow laws, non-integrated sports teams, Confederate flags on government buildings, a segregated military, voting rights for women, marriage, and the Washington Wizards.\n\nWhy bring it up now? This is not a new issue, it is just receiving more attention. NCAI, the umbrella organization of roughly 165 federally recognized tribes in the U.S., started its efforts to eliminate negative stereotypes in 1968. A group of Indian leaders sent a letter in 1972 to the NFL president stating the name was disparaging. The first lawsuit was filed in 1992. The NCAI passed a resolution in 1993 calling for a name change, and the NAACP did the same in 1999. The U.S Commission on Human Rights called for an end to such mascots in 2001.\n\nWhat\u2019s the harm? it's only a word. A newly released report from the Center for American Progress shows that such words create an \u201cunwelcome and hostile learning environment\u201d for American Indian students that \u201cdirectly results in lower self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Imagine if you were considered a mascot and not a person, someone to be caricatured on the sidelines for others' enjoyment and profit. How would you feel seeing a banner which read: \u201cSend them on a Trail of Tears!,\u201d an event which resulted in the removal or death of thousands of your ancestors, as was displayed at a recent high school game.\n\nIf we change the name of the Redskins, what about the Cowboys, Saints, and Vikings? These names have never been used to vilify or denigrate an entire group of people, and this argument only minimizes the negative impact words can have. Being real \u201cCowboys\u201d is a professions and is no more offensive to those who settled the West than \u201cSaints\u201d is to religious people. \u201cRedskins\u201d was used as a way to de-humanize American Indians just as other words are still used to debase racial and ethnic groups: the \u201cn-word\u201d for African Americans, \u201cwetback\u201d for Latinos, \u201cKike\u201d for Jews, and \u201cWop\u201d for Italians, for example. The Florida State University Seminoles exist today because the university consulted with the Seminole Nation, a sovereign tribe, and agreed on how the name would be used.\n\nThe first coach was an Indian, and the team was named in his honor, so it\u2019s okay. Historian Linda M. Waggoner\u2019s account of \u201cLone Star\u201d Dietz\u2019, the team\u2019s first coach, found that he faced a federal trial for falsely representing himself as an Indian to avoid the draft. When that trial ended in a hung jury, he later plead no contest to the same charges and served 30 days in jail. George Preston Marshall, the original owner, dismissed claims that the team name was linked to Dietz\u2019s heritage. In a 1933 comment in the Hartford Courant: \u201cSo much confusion has been caused by our football team wearing the same name as the Boston National League baseball club \u2026 that a change appeared to be absolutely necessary. The fact that we have in our head coach, Lone Star Dietz, an Indian, together with several Indian players, has not, as many suspected, inspired me to select the name Redskins.\u201d Other sources have found the name was a marketing ploy so the team could keep the logo and play off the popularity of Indian culture. Having coaches and players dress in \u201cIndian-themed\u201d uniforms and wear face paint only contributed to the marketing of the team.\n\nThere are schools on Indian reservations that use \u201cRedskins\u201d as their mascot. Why is that okay? True, there are a number of high schools on Indian reservations that use this mascot. In reality, the vast majority of high schools using this word have now changed it. When an Indian school uses that mascot, it is one they have adopted as their own, not one that a multi-billion dollar corporation making millions in profits uses to market a football team. The word is still disparaging, no matter who uses it.\n\nThe name is meant to honor Native Americans. Many Native American do not consider this word to be an \u201chonor,\u201d especially given the historical connection with the payment to bounty hunters for scalps and other body parts of \u201cRedskins.\u201d Combine that with some of the items that are sold with the team logo, such as beer koozies, trash cans, door mats, diapers, and G-strings, it is clear that the word is not used in an \u201chonorific\u201d way. Did the \u201cHogettes,\u201d people dressed in feathered headdresses wearing pig snouts, honor American Indians? Are women dressed in skin tight shorts and halter tops dancing to drumbeats on the sidelines respecting Native culture? Did Chief Zee, a non-Indian wearing a replica of a headdress and carrying a tomahawk, honor Indians, or make fun of them?\n\nThe team logo was designed by an Indian therefore it can\u2019t be racist. One of the many logos used by the team was designed by a then former leader of the NCAI. But this is not the same as saying you agree with the name. Recently the team brought out a group of Native American Code Talkers to honor them at a game. Each wore a jacket given by the team right before the ceremony. Some took this to mean they supported the team name. Just a few days later the national organization of surviving Code Talkers passed a resolution calling for a name change.\n\nThere are other issues more important to AI/AN. Indian country continues to have big problems with substance abuse, diabetes, and unemployment. Each of these issues requires long term, sustained efforts involving tribes, the government and the private sector. Changing the name requires the action of only one person\u2014the owner.\n\nBut surveys say\u2026 Supporters like to cite a 10-year-old survey of Native Americans which found that 90 percent had no problem with the name. They don\u2019t, however, point out a survey in 2014 where two-thirds of respondents living on a reservation supported a name change. Opinions change over time as more people pay attention to and become educated about an issue.\n\nA name change will cost too much money. A recent article in The New York Times titled, \u201cRedskins is Bad Business,\u201d shows just the opposite. \u201cControlling for the other variables, we found an insignificant effect on revenue in the year immediately following a name change, and a positive revenue trend in the subsequent years.\u201d Does anyone doubt that fans of the team will buy a new jersey and all the related paraphernalia, making even more money for the owner?\n\nThe facts are clear. Support the team. Change the name.\n\nMatthew Murguia is a 25-year career federal employee living in the Washington, D.C. area.
