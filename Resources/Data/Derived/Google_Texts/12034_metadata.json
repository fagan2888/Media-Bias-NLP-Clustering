Summertime is often the chosen season for shows with a little more genre appeal\u2014the idea is that in order to get audiences to pay attention, TV will have to offer up more blood, more sex, more glory. But in the case of Showtime\u2019s \u201cPenny Dreadful,\u201d you will have to turn the brightness all the way up on your television and close the curtains against possible distracting sunlight, because this show is not just thematically dark, it\u2019s also literally saturated in shadows all the damn time. The characters are alternately wearing 18 layers of clothing, shivering, or, in a move that sure adds a pop of color to the viewing experience, covered in blood. As I suppose the signers of the Declaration of Independence could have told you: Britain? Nicer in theory than in practice. Better to watch on this side of the pond, with the A/C on full blast.\n\nPerhaps because the show is so hilariously unsuited for summer weather, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is a bit overlooked, both by audiences and the critical community. It has a campy, thriller appeal that it shares with another forlorn summer show, \u201cHannibal,\u201d which got the ax from NBC a few weeks ago. But while \u201cHannibal\u201d is, to my mind, merely fine, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is fantastic\u2014and tonight it concludes one of the most astounding dramatic runs on current television. \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d has pulled together a constellation of incredible actors, sumptuous production design and the fascinating world-building of showrunner John Logan (the writer behind several James Bond films) for an immersive, careening and daring second season. I can\u2019t predict how tonight will shake out\u2014but based on the dozen or so cliffhangers laid out in last week\u2019s \u201cAnd Hell Itself My Only Foe,\u201d it will at the very least be interesting.\n\nAnd that is, in some ways, the best and most useful aspect I can use to try to sell new viewers on \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d\u2014it\u2019s never boring. The show is always reaching for new, unbelievable goals, whether that\u2019s setting a superhero origin story in an abortionist\u2019s cottage or plotting a romance between the bride of Frankenstein and Dorian Gray. This is a show that inspires its fans to write with exclamation points and capital letters. But it\u2019s also a show that engages with history, politics and theology with incredible sophistication\u2014making it that rare type of show that can inspire both impassioned caps lock and impassioned think pieces.\n\nBut that duality, at the same time, makes it hard to get new viewers to try it out\u2014it\u2019s difficult to get someone on board a show that appears to be everything and nothing at the same time\u2014historical and magical, romantic and campy, comedic and downright horrific. It\u2019s also difficult to explain that the driving plot of the show is nothing less than the battle of good against evil\u2014in the form of demon possession, the lost writings of Lucifer, and witches that cast spells in secret tongues. On top of that, half the characters in the show are characters recognizable from major works of Victorian literature: Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway) and his creature (Rory Kinnear), the woman who becomes the creature\u2019s unholy bride (Billie Piper), and Oscar Wilde\u2019s twisted hero who never shows the effects of evil and sin on his own face, Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Showtime series about supernatural forces in Victorian England ends its second season tonight", "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Showtime series about supernatural forces in Victorian England ends its second season tonight", "title": "\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d finishes strong: This sophisticated, evocative Victorian thriller appeals to fantasy and history fans alike", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/penny_dreadful_finishes_strong_this_sophisticated_evocative_victorian_thriller_appeals_to_fantasy_and_history_fans_alike/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/penny_dreadful_sembene.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Showtime series about supernatural forces in Victorian England ends its second season tonight", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/penny_dreadful_sembene.jpg", "title": "\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d finishes strong: This sophisticated, evocative Victorian thriller appeals to fantasy and history fans alike", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d finishes strong: This sophisticated, evocative Victorian thriller appeals to fantasy and history fans alike", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Eva Green, john logan, penny dreadful, Showtime, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Perhaps because the show is so hilariously unsuited for summer weather, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is a bit overlooked, both by audiences and the critical community.\nBut while \u201cHannibal\u201d is, to my mind, merely fine, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is fantastic\u2014and tonight it concludes one of the most astounding dramatic runs on current television.\n), I declare it time to hole up with some gloomy Victorian Gothic television, set in cold, damp and mostly sooty London.\n\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d has pulled together a constellation of incredible actors, sumptuous production design and the fascinating world-building of showrunner John Logan (the writer behind several James Bond films) for an immersive, careening and daring second season.\nAnd that is, in some ways, the best and most useful aspect I can use to try to sell new viewers on \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d\u2014it\u2019s never boring."}
