Shortly after announcing it, CEO Trevor Fetter hopped on the line with D CEO partner David Johnson, who heads KRLD\u2019s interview program CEO spotlight. Here is that interview in full.\n\nDavid Johnson: It\u2019s horrible to be judged, I guess, every three months but that\u2019s a fact of life. The Street has expectations, but in the broad view it seems you guys are doing very well.\n\nTrevor Fetter: The fourth quarter volume growth was actually the highest in a decade for us, and even if you eliminate all of the benefit that we got from newly insured people under the Affordable Care Act, it was the highest volume growth we\u2019ve had in five years.\n\nJohnson: Well isn\u2019t this one of the fall-outs of the Affordable Care Act, that more people are going to the doctor, getting tests done, taking care of themselves?\n\nThere are people now who have insurance who didn\u2019t have it before, and they are presumably taking care of health needs that they may have known about\u2014and maybe they didn\u2019t know about\u2014and that\u2019s a relatively small part of the story for us. The bigger part of the story is we\u2019ve been doing a lot of things right in our markets, and we\u2019re gaining market share, and I think the economy\u2019s better; people are feeling a little bit more confident, and I\u2019m glad to see people who have health needs take care of them.\n\nJohnson: You\u2019ve also gone after the people who are taking revenue out of your pocket all of these individual clinics\u2014you drive down Central Expressway and you\u2019ll see them\u2014but you\u2019ve got, what, 214 outpatient facilities from none?\n\nFetter: We do, we do.\n\nListen, the reason that you see all of these clinics is that that\u2019s what consumers want. They want to be able to drive up, park in a place that\u2019s convenient, see a physician, maybe get a surgery done, and walk out. As long as that\u2019s what the consumers want, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to provide to them\u2014even if it cannibalizes business that was in our hospitals traditionally.\n\nJohnson: But I would assume that you would adjust the business your hospitals are doing. Would your hospitals actually refer someone out to your outpatient clinics?\n\nFetter: Yes, that could happen. The outpatient clinics operate on a more limited number of hours, and they perform services that have lower acuity. So what actually happens is that the patient flow goes the other direction, where people, let\u2019s say, come into a surgery center or they go into an urgent care center, and at that point they may be referred to the hospital for a more intensive level of treatment. But the simple things that are very routine can be done\u2014even things that are done in emergency rooms\u2014can be done in these less intensive settings.\n\nJohnson: We\u2019ve followed you as you\u2019ve gone through this long and sometimes excruciating period of getting rid of non-performing hospitals; you were a big seller for a long time, now you\u2019re a buyer and your\u2019e expanding. So what\u2019s next for Tenet? You\u2019re not right-size, I assume.\n\nFetter: I think we have great opportunities both in our markets and in some new markets. We announced on the call, and we\u2019ve announced previously, that we\u2019re expanding dramatically in Birmingham, Alabama; we\u2019re expanding into Tuscon, which is a place we\u2019ve never been; we decided not to pursue an acquisition of several hospitals that was pending in Connecticut; but we have other markets where we have acquisitions, we have joint ventures, we have partnerships\u2014really a tremendous pipeline of opportunities for us.\n\nJohnson: It sounds like you\u2019re also seeing organic growth.\n\nFetter: The business, and what we really report to The Street is the organic growth numbers\u2014those are quite strong, like I said, record-setting growth over the last decade.\n\nJohnson: We\u2019ve also been following this service of yours, Conifer, which does businesses for hospitals and in many cases other people\u2019s. What\u2019s the growth there? How is that coming along?\n\nFetter: Oh, it\u2019s incredible. Confier, which we started in 2008, is now exceeding $1.3 billion in revenues. They are growing so fast that they\u2019re already outgrowing the new headquarters they moved into just last year up in Frisco. Demand for the services that Conifer performs, which it performs very well in the revenue cycle and in helping hospitals make this transition to value-based care, the demand is high and the customer base is growing quickly.\n\nJohnson: So tell me about The Street. Healthcare stocks, or healthcare in general, has been a hot area for Wall Street. What sort of analyst, Street reaction are you getting? Are your conference calls crowded?\n\nFetter: Our conference calls are more crowded, the number of \u201cbuy\u201d recommendations we have is at an all-time high. I can never figure out what The Street is thinking, that\u2019s your job, David! Why are you asking me to do it? But they understand we have a solid business, it\u2019s a growing business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s not subjected to all of these risks that you read about, about currency fluctuations and the West Coast ports and oil prices or anything else. This is a solid business of Americans helping other Americans right in their hometown.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Tenet's Trevor Fetter Dallas' Tenet Healthcare Corp. closed 2014 with its most successful quarter in a decade.
