Some of it is that they are not eligible for a lot of the things that other people are eligible for. Health insurance is costly and they don\u2019t make enough money to pay the regular cost, and there are a number of cultural barriers as well. I think that\u2019s a big problem.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act bars about 11 million undocumented immigrants nationwide from benefiting from any of its provisions, according to figures provided by the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nNew York State was relatively successful in its first year operating a state-run health care exchange, but had less success reaching new enrollees immigrant communities.\n\nThe city does not know exactly how many immigrants in the city are living without access to health care. The deputy mayor described it as a \u201cvery tough number to arrive at,\u201d citing difficulty in reaching each different group due to cultural barriers such as language and communities\u2019 lack of knowledge about existing programs.\n\n\u201cWe do know it\u2019s probably very large, we have a good relationship with different consulates, they\u2019re being very helpful and are calculating those types of things,\u201d Barrios-Paoli said.\n\nBarrios-Paoli said the working group is still in its first phase, holding meetings with local organizations and other nonprofits, such as the Hispanic and Asian federations.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges, the deputy mayor said, will be to change the culture among immigrant communities, which often see the doctors and hospitals as the last line of defense when they fall ill.\n\n\u201c[We] are used to the doctor being somebody you go to when you\u2019re sick, and the hospital you go to when you are terribly sick,\u201d said Barrios-Paoli, whose family immigrated from Mexico.\n\n\u201cThere is not a lot of prevention in between, and the idea that there is a health insurance product is something that is alien to a lot of people from different countries,\u201d Barrios-Paoli said. \u201cWe have to convey that there are other things they could potentially have access to, and they should use.\"\n\nThe group will focus on increasing trust in city government among immigrant communities, and try to raise awareness about preventative care, in part by using the Health and Hospitals Corporation network as a pipeline to distribute information.\n\n\u201cThe government is not an entity that [immigrants] like to relate to. They are on unfriendly terms generally, although most of the health care that they do get, they get through the municipal hospital system,\u201d Barrios-Paoli said. \u201cThe idea is to use whatever connection they have to the emergency room or to the doctor in the hospital and begin to talk to them about how to prevent disease as opposed to remediating it.\"\n\nThe working group will be divided into four subgroups, each led by a top city official. The recommendations will first be submitted to the mayor, then the City Council and eventually the state.\n\nThe administration has not finalized a figure for how much the outreach will cost. Barrios-Paoli said the working group is still conducting a cost-benefit analysis, adding they are hoping to find savings by focusing on preventative care. She also acknowledged it would be a \u201cbig expenditure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do preventive work, if we work closely with them, if the outcomes become better and better, and they come into the hospitals not as sick as they have been coming in, we can have savings while getting them better health care,\u201d Barrios Paoli said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/10/8555218/de-blasio-forms-task-force-immigrant-health-care", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20LilliamBarrios-Paoli_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "De Blasio forms task force on immigrant health care"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio is asking his top health policy team to come up with a plan to better reach immigrant communities and connect them to healthcare."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9977\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are concerned about access to health care by immigrant groups that are not eligible for traditional Medicaid or low-cost insurance,\u201d Barrios-Paoli said.\nMayor Bill de Blasio is asking his health policy team to formulate a plan for how the administration can better reach immigrant communities and connect them to health care.\nThe city does not know exactly how many immigrants in the city are living without access to health care.\nNew York State was relatively successful in its first year operating a state-run health care exchange, but had less success reaching new enrollees immigrant communities.\nThey are on unfriendly terms generally, although most of the health care that they do get, they get through the municipal hospital system,\u201d Barrios-Paoli said."}
