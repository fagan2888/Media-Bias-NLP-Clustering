How much could that penalty be? How does that get figured out in my tax return?\n\nA: You have to pay a penalty if you were uninsured in 2015, and were required to have insurance because you didn't qualify for an exemption. (Officially, it's not a penalty, but an \"individual responsibility payment,\" and not Obamacare, but the \"Affordable Care Act.\")\n\nThat payment is added in the \"other taxes\" part of your tax return. For individuals, the minimum penalty is $325, and the maximum penalty appears to be $2,484. For households, that maximum increases by $2,484 for each uncovered member, and maxes out completely at $12,420.\n\nIf you were insured, you'll be getting an IRS Form 1095 saying so. A 1095-C verifies coverage through employers, and may not arrive until March 31. But you can file without it, by checking the box saying you were insured on Line 61 of your 1040 form.\n\nCalculating the penalty isn't easy. So first see if you're exempt from having to be insured in 2015. If you're exempt, there's no penalty for being uninsured.\n\nClaiming an exemption requires filling out IRS Form 8965.\n\nYou're exempt and not liable for a penalty if you were uninsured for less than two consecutive months. They must be two full consecutive calendar months. As a government example says, if you were uninsured from March 2 to June 15, you were only uninsured for the two full months of April and May, so you're exempt.\n\nIf you were uninsured for more than two full consecutive months in 2015, there's two ways to qualify for an income-based exemption. One is if your 2015 income was so low you're not required to file taxes \u2014 less than $10,300 for single filers, or $20,600 for married filers. But to claim an exemption and avoid a penalty you must go ahead and file a tax return.\n\nThe other income-based exemption is if buying insurance in the \"marketplace\" or from your employer would have cost more than 8.05 percent of your household income.\n\nThen there are hardship exemptions. Healthcare.gov lists 14 different ones. Examples: evictions, domestic violence, a death in the family and getting a utility shutoff notice. You're exempt from being insured for the months a hardship lasted in 2015.\n\nYou have to apply for a hardship exemption with the \"Health Insurance Marketplace.\" If you qualify, they'll give you an \"exemption certificate number.\" That goes on Form 8965.\n\nIf you're NOT exempt, then you use the instructions to Form 8965 to calculate your penalty. Any penalty goes on Line 61 of your 1040 form, in the \"other taxes\" section.\n\nThat's the really tricky part. It's the larger of two possible numbers. One number is 2 percent of your household income (different from your adjusted gross income), up to a maximum between $2,484 and $12,420, depending on household size. The other number is $325 per uninsured adult, and $162.50 per child under 18, up to a maximum $975.\n\nThose are really just broad generalities. Figuring out whether you're exempt, or the penalty if you're not, can be tough without help.\n\nJohn Roska is a lawyer with Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation.
