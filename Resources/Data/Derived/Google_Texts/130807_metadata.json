Here are some nuggets of wisdom from the event:\n\nRETALIATION\n\n\u201cRetaliation is like staring at the clouds; employees see what they want to see,\u201d said Jim Dale, an attorney with Stoel Rives in Boise. \u201cDon\u2019t focus so much on what is the legal standard of retaliation. Focus instead on how it would look to a jury ... Retaliation isn\u2019t just the most frequent claim, it\u2019s the most dangerous.\u201d\n\nHEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste a good crisis. The Affordable Care Act is one of the biggest HR crises of this generation and it gives you a clean sheet of paper to design a new comp and benefits program at your organization, and you can blame it on the ACA,\u201d said Karl Ahlrichs, an insurance expert at Gregory & Appel in Indianapolis\n\nHANDBOOKS\n\n\u201cRemember that every state has weird, quirky laws that you have to incorporate into your employee handbook,\u201d said Steven Suflas, an attorney at Ballard Spahr in New Jersey. \u201cAlso, there are always new things coming down the pike in employment law, so make sure to keep your handbook updated. HR can get into a lot of mischief by letting their handbooks go stale.\u201d\n\nIN THE COURTROOM\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most anger I\u2019ve seen against corporate America in the 30 years I\u2019ve been doing this,\u201d said Dan Gallipeau, co-founder of Dispute Dynamics and an expert on U.S. juries. \u201cIf jurors are angry, it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s on the\n\nverdict form. They will find a way (to make employers liable).\u201d\n\nUNIONS\n\nRegarding the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) revived \u201cquickie election\u201d rules that could shorten the time from petition to union vote from 38 days to 21 days, attorney Jonathan Kaplan of Littler in Memphis said, \u201cYou can no longer wait until a petition gets filed. This places a much greater premium on being proactive in preparing for union activity and creating a rapid-response team ... Staying nonunion is going to become a 24-7-365 activity.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE EEOC\n\n\u201cThe EEOC has very broad investigative powers,\u201d warned EEOC commissioner Constance Barker during her lunchtime keynote session. \u201cAny little tidbit of information we get (during an EEOC investigation) can lead us to investigate that matter, too, which can lead to a systemic case.\u201d Barker also noted that \u201cthe biggest mistake employers make is a lack of communication\u201d by failing to make sure lower-level managers know about company policies and follow through on enforcing them.\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER\n\nAndrew Rempfer has practiced employment law from both the employer and employee sides and he currently represents employees for the Cogburn Law Offices in Las Vegas. Here is some of the insider advice from \u201cthe other side\u201d that Rempfer gave to the HR professionals in attendance:\n\n\u2022 \u201cI get more calls about retaliation than anything else. A lot of their initial claims don\u2019t have much merit until they tell me about their retaliation story.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cHR needs to make sure their investigations are clean and precise, because we dig into those very deeply.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cCompanies still don\u2019t regularly audit their job descriptions \u2026 I cannot fathom to this day why employers don\u2019t look at the job duties to see if they match\u201d the FLSA exemptions.\n\n\u2022 \u201cI do believe there are a few rotten apple companies out there, but in most lawsuits we file, it\u2019s just bad managers and bad training that cause HR nightmares.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "4994136bc793ed9927db8cecc3707c22"}, "twitter": {"description": "<i>From March 12-14, 2014, hundreds of HR professionals from across the  country gathered at the Bellagio in Las Vegas for the 10th annual Labor & Employment Law Advanced Practices (<a href='http://www.leap2014.com'>LEAP</a>) Symposium, hosted by Business Management Daily and <a href='http://www.theHRSpecialist.com'>The HR Specialist</a>.
