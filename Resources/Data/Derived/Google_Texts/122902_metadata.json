Of this total, 1,466 primary care physicians are needed because of population growth, 360 because of increased utilization, and 115 because of insurance expansions that occur as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"With these projections, people can understand the different sources for the increases. There is no mystery behind it,\" said Petterson.\n\nEach state workforce brief is illustrated with graphs showing the current number of primary care physicians in the state and the projected number of primary care physicians each state will need every five years for the next 25 years. Another graph shows how the demand for primary care physicians in a particular state compares with the demand for primary care physicians in that state's region and the nation as a whole.\n\nThe workforce projections also contain potential solutions to strengthen the primary care pipeline, including via physician payment reform, dedicated funding for graduate medical education, increased funding for primary care training and medical school debt relief.\n\nThe projections demonstrate the differences that exist among the states in terms of workforce needs, Petterson said. In some states, populations are rapidly increasing, and in other states, population growth is much slower or even declining, creating much different workforce needs in the various states.\n\nAccording to the Graham Center, the projections are based on calculations that are not \"set in stone.\" For example, the nation's immigration policies will play a large role in driving future population growth in certain states, thereby determining how many primary care physicians are needed, Petterson said.\n\n\"Imagine, if we close the borders or lessen restriction on immigration -- those kinds of changes could throw the projections off,\" Petterson said.\n\nRelated ANN Coverage\n\nGaps in Health Care Safety Net Identifiable Thanks to Graham Center Mapper Program\n\n(8/27/2013)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "AAFP News", "description": "The AAFP's Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care recently issued primary care physician workforce projections for each state for the next 25 years, thus putting important informational and advocacy tools in the hands of policymakers, advocates and researchers.", "pubdate": "2013-10-07", "author": "James Arvantes", "og": {"image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/logos_internal/og/AAFP-capital-RGB2_1024x512B.png", "description": "The AAFP's Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care recently issued primary care physician workforce projections for each state for the next 25 years, thus putting important informational and advocacy tools in the hands of policymakers, advocates and researchers.", "title": "State Workforce Projections Document Future Demand for Primary Care Physicians"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aafp", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2013-October/Graham%20WF%20Proj_Map.jpg", "description": "The AAFP's Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care recently issued primary care physician workforce projections for each state for the next 25 years, thus putting important informational and advocacy tools in the hands of policymakers, advocates and researchers.", "card": "summary", "title": "State Workforce Projections Document Future Demand for Primary Care Physicians"}, "lastreviewdate": "2013-10-07", "news-category": "Practice & Professional Issues", "nav-title": "Graham Center Projects Future Demand for Physicians", "image": "http://www.aafp.org/content/dam/AAFP/images/ann/2013-October/Graham%20WF%20Proj_Map.jpg.daijpg.90.jpg", "keywords": "Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care, workforce projections, primary care physicians, Affordable Care Act, primary care pipeline", "content-type": "news-article", "archive": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "subcategory": "Practice & Professional Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2845\"", "article_summary": "Each state workforce brief is illustrated with graphs showing the current number of primary care physicians in the state and the projected number of primary care physicians each state will need every five years for the next 25 years.\nAnother graph shows how the demand for primary care physicians in a particular state compares with the demand for primary care physicians in that state's region and the nation as a whole.\nThe workforce projections also contain potential solutions to strengthen the primary care pipeline, including via physician payment reform, dedicated funding for graduate medical education, increased funding for primary care training and medical school debt relief.\nFor example, according to the projection for Arizona(www.graham-center.org), the state will need an additional 1,941 primary care physicians by 2030, a 50 percent increase from the state's current number.\nThe projections demonstrate the differences that exist among the states in terms of workforce needs, Petterson said."}
