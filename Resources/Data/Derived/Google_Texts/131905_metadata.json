David Vitter finally got a win on his eponymous amendment \u2014 sort of.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican\u2019s proposal to force members of Congress and their staffs onto the Obamacare health exchanges was approved by the Senate Republican Conference during a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon. Earlier Wednesday, Vitter said he was unsure whether the controversial measure would be approved, but the toothless provision easily passed by voice vote, drawing little opposition.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cRepublican senators made a strong, principled statement today in passing my resolution. Washington should have to live under Obamacare just like everybody else until we repeal it. And we won\u2019t be complicit in Obama\u2019s illegal rule designed to protect Washington insiders,\u201d Vitter said after the triumphant vote.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Budget winners and losers)\n\nThe Louisiana Republican\u2019s proposal to the conference \u2014 which is nonbinding, according to Senate aides \u2014 says that it\u2019s the \u201cpolicy\u201d of Senate Republicans that all of their employees are deemed as \u201cofficial\u201d staff. In practice, that means everyone would be pushed onto the Obamacare exchanges; some aides, such as committee or leadership staffers, have been allowed to keep their previous health care plans.\n\nVitter has been a one-man crusade pushing for a measure that would attack Obamacare coverage in another way: to get rid of what Vitter has called a \u201csubsidy\u201d for lawmakers\u2019 and aides\u2019 health care plans. And Senate Republican leaders moved to place their staffers on the exchanges more than a year ago when Vitter began his quest, led by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who put his aides on the D.C. exchange in October 2013.\n\nThe so-called \u201cVitter amendment\u201d would drop the current employer contributions for health care received by lawmakers and congressional aides, and he pressed for it to be attached to everything from a bipartisan energy-efficiency bill to noncontroversial pharmaceutical legislation. His insistence on its vote famously led to the failure of the energy-efficiency bill last year and has been a hallmark of his policy portfolio as he prepares to run for governor. He never did get that legislative vote, but making it GOP policy marked a significant achievement for the conservative Republican after railing against the \u201cWashington exemption for Obamacare\u201d for months.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Budget bill shows GOP's new muscle)\n\nPrivately, congressional aides have fumed about Vitter\u2019s proposal every time it comes up, because leaving the subsidized federal health insurance program might require them to pay more and change their doctors. It\u2019s unclear if Vitter\u2019s amendment will force GOP senators to change their aides\u2019 insurance plans, but at least one colleague said even before the vote that he would take Vitter\u2019s cue.\n\n\u201cThe law will never change if those who write the law are protected from its effects,\u201d said Sen.-elect Bill Cassidy on Tuesday, just three days after defeating Louisiana Democratic Sen.
