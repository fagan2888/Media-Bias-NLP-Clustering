USI Insurance Services L.L.C. this week became the latest U.S.-based insurance brokerage to offer a private insurance exchange for all USI clients seeking greater control of their group benefit costs.

The Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.-based broker announced Thursday that it has adopted the Bright Choices Exchange, a proprietary health insurance marketplace designed and operated by New York-based Liazon Corp.

The exchange is designed to ease employers' transition toward a defined contribution funding strategy for their group health benefit programs, USI said Thursday in a statement.

Within the exchange, employers set a fixed per-employee premium allowance for health, dental, vision and other coverage options selected by the employees themselves according to their individual needs. The Bright Choices platform also provides employees with decision support tools to help them navigate the various coverage options.

“We will be integrating the Bright Choices Exchange with our extensive set of solutions to help consumers and the employers who help subsidize their choices better control costs as the (Patient Protection and) Affordable Care Act plays out in the commercial market,” Michael Sicard, USI's president and CEO, said in the statement.

USI is one of several large and midsize insurance brokerages to launch private insurance exchanges in the past 18 months using Liazon's Bright Choices platform. This month, Chicago-based Hub International Ltd. announced the national expansion of the private exchange it launched with Liazon in September 2012.

Gallagher Benefits Services Inc., the employee benefits consulting arm of Itasca, Ill.-based brokerage Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., also launched a private insurance exchange using the Bright Choices platform, in July 2012.
