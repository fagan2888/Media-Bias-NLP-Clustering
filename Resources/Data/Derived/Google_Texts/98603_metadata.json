The suit, first reported by GeekWire, follows an undercover investigation by Amazon.\n\n\u201cWhile small in number, [fake] reviews can significantly undermine the trust that consumers and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, which in turn, tarnishes Amazon\u2019s brand,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmazon strictly prohibits any attempt to manipulate customer reviews and expressly prohibits compensated reviews. Nonetheless, an unhealthy ecosystem has developed outside of Amazon to supply reviews in exchange for payment.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Amazon, Apple and Google are Stomping Out Competition\n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t name the individuals it\u2019s suing, but identifies them via their Fiverr handles.\n\nAmazon\u2019s rules, agreed to buy customers in order to set up an account, ban illegitimate reviews. In April, the company sued several websites that sold fake online reviews.\n\nIt is not suing Fiverr, which prohibits the sale of such services. Fiverr spokesman Channing Barringer told Bloomberg that the company is cooperating with Amazon on the issue.\n\nOnline reviews have become a key source of information for consumers. Nearly eight in 10 Americans read customer reviews before making a purchase, and 44 percent of Americans have written online reviews, according to a report released last year by YouGov. One in five people surveyed said that they had written reviews for products or services they never used.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As online reviews become a more important part of the consumer buying process, Amazon", "title": "Are Online Reviews a Sham?
