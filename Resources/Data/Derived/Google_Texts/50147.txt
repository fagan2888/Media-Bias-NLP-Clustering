Australian surgeons transplanted “dead” hearts into patients for the first time ever.

The procedure, which was performed on three patients on Friday, uses hearts that have stopped beating for up to 20 minutes. Previously surgeons only performed heart transplants with only “still-beating” hearts from patients who are brain-dead, which limited number of heart transplants that could be done. Using a “dead” heart could potentially “save the lives of 30 percent more heart transplant patients,” the Guardian reported.

Two of the patients who received the “dead” heart transplants have recovered; one is still in intensive care, the hospital reported.
