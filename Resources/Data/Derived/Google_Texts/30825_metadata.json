He ran the floor to score on a transition stick-back through a foul. And there was the frequent sight of Okafor palming the basketball as though it was a baseball, including once in the second half when he grabbed a board with his massive hands against Big Ten rebounding leader Branden Dawson.\n\nSophomore teammate Matt Jones said he knew Okafor would be ready Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI mean, you could just tell,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around him so long, you can just tell when Jah is ready to play and when you just know he\u2019s going to be the best player on the court.\u201d\n\nOkafor had combined for 15 points on 7-for-16 shooting in last weekend\u2019s wins over Utah and Gonzaga to get to the Final Four.\n\nHe said Friday he wasn\u2019t disappointed by his performance. Rather, he was excited by the prospects of arriving in Indianapolis with the chance to win a national title, and the knowledge that his team made it to the Final Four when he could have played better.\n\nHe was certainly prepared for any look Tom Izzo\u2019s club could give him, too.\n\nFew teams tried to play him 1-on-1 this year, and instate rivals North Carolina and North Carolina State didn\u2019t just send double teams \u2014 they doubled with big men to make it tougher for Okafor to see and pass over the pressure.\n\nHe had no such trouble Saturday night. Okafor had 10 points on 4-for-6 shooting in the opening half, helping the Blue Devils gain momentum after a slow start. And he often made it look easy in the paint, even scoring on a layup while Schilling tugged at the back of his jersey.\n\n\u201cWhenever you can establish the inside, that frees everyone up,\u201d Duke assistant coach Nate James said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be guarded 1-on-1 \u2014 and he knows that.\u201d\n\nOkafor\u2019s putback dunk on Justise Winslow\u2019s miss midway through the first half gave Duke its first lead at 18-16. It was part of a 14-2 run in which Okafor had half of his team\u2019s points.\n\n\u201cYou know, you can blame me for Okafor, because personally that\u2019s exactly what we wanted to do \u2014 if we could hold him to under 20 points, take away their 3s,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cWe did exactly what we wanted to do to be honest with you. \u2026 In the halfcourt, I thought we did a decent job on him.\u201d\n\nDuke never trailed the rest of the way as it advanced to another title game in Indianapolis, where the Blue Devils captured national championships in 1991 and 2010.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Duke tops Michigan State, advances to national title game", "title": "Duke tops Michigan State, advances to national title game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/04/duke-tops-michigan-state-advances-to-national-title-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150404__dukep1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150404__dukep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T18:38:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T04:57:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201c\u2026 We\u2019ve been successful the entire year when teams play both me ways.\u201dPHOTOS: Duke tops Michigan State, 81-61 in NCAA Men\u2019s Final FourDuke will face fellow No.\nIt was part of a 14-2 run in which Okafor had half of his team\u2019s points.\nOkafor had 10 points on 4-for-6 shooting in the opening half, helping the Blue Devils gain momentum after a slow start.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be guarded 1-on-1 \u2014 and he knows that.\u201dOkafor\u2019s putback dunk on Justise Winslow\u2019s miss midway through the first half gave Duke its first lead at 18-16.\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re playing me with one man, my job is to dominate and then to score,\u201d Okafor said."}
