Paula Braun, a data scientist with Charlottesville, Va.-based consulting firm Elder Research, is embedded in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to devise a better Electronic Death Registration System, so that the CDC can refine its analytics and predictive modeling.\n\nDavid Portnoy, chief technology officer of Chicago start-up Symbiosis Health, an Internet service that compares prices for medical treatment, is working with the HHS chief information officer\u2019s team to link disparate data sets, so that HHS can analyze a broader scope of information from other agencies along with its own data.\n\nDanny Boice, chief technology officer and co-founder of Sterling-based conference-call company Speek, is working with the HHS Administration for Community Living to help aging and disabled citizens keep track of health services. Mark Scrimshire, chief technology officer at New York start-up Medyear \u2014 a service pulling patients\u2019 records from disparate doctors into once place \u2014 is working with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to redesign the Blue Button, which lets federal beneficiaries view health records electronically.\n\nAmid recent scrutiny about rising premiums under the Affordable Care Act and the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov in October 2013, the yearlong program is one of several ways HHS has been encouraging creativity during the past couple years. On Monday, it plans to announce a new class of employee-led start-ups slated to participate in its internal start-up \u201caccelerator.\u201d Selected teams get $5,000 in funding, and access to software and other resources for three months. (One team, from the CDC, has proposed an open-access Web site where researchers can collaborate on epidemic forecasting.)\n\n\u201cWhat the administration is trying to do is encourage agencies to use a broad range of approaches to solving problems,\u201d said Tom Kalil, deputy director for technology and innovation at the Office of Technology and Policy. Often, start-ups favor what is known as an agile approach to product development \u2014 rapidly experimenting with prototypes and making frequent adjustments, instead of waiting until a product is fully developed before testing.\n\nThe program is part of a growing federal effort to nurture entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship. In April, for instance, the General Services Administration created an IT problem-solving service, called 18F, to help other agencies create new products quickly. Two years ago, the Department of Homeland Security introduced its own entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00ads-in-residence program at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nIn their first week at HHS, the entrepreneurs are still in the research phase. Over the next few months, they \u2014 along with HHS project leads \u2014 will start developing products or systems for the groups for which they are working.\n\nBoice said he was drawing on product development at Speek \u2014 which lets users dial into conference calls with one click. He hopes to simplify the Web experience for aging and disabled populations, like he did for those making conference calls.\n\nScrimshire said the brief crossover into the federal government gives him access to a larger volume of users. If the project is successful, he said, patients could eventually add apps to Blue Button \u2014 tracking the interactions between medications they\u2019re taking, for instance.\n\n\u201cMedicare has something like 50 million beneficiaries,\u201d he said. \u201cSo just simply dealing with the sheer scale is a challenge that you don\u2019t always get unless you\u2019re a Google or similar in industry.\u201d\n\nExpanding Blue Button so that more health-care providers offer electronic access to records could eventually generate more business for his start-up, and similar services, Scrimshire said.\n\n\u201cIf we implement [Blue Button] for all the Medicare beneficiaries, it makes a difference to the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the entrepreneurs-in-residence program\u2019s third year, HHS is still working on how to evaluate whether it\u2019s worth the time and financial investment, Kalil said. Each agency hires and pays the entrepreneur for the year. The entrepreneurs are then bound by the same conflict-of-interest restrictions that federal employees face when they leave public service.\n\nIf agencies ask to keep the products the entrepreneurs developed \u2014 even after the residence ends \u2014 that\u2019s a sign of success, he said. (An HHS spokesman said that at least one software project during the past three years has been officially implemented. He said the agency is planning an event to announce details.)\n\nAnother measure, Kalil said, is the impact on employees.\n\n\u201cA harder one to evaluate, but probably more evident, is the cultural change issue \u2014 demonstrating [to federal employees] that there are other ways to get things done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health and Human Services", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services brought in four entrepreneurs for a 12-month stint.", "title": "HHS adds new class of \u2018entrepreneurs-in-residence\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/hhs-adds-new-class-of-entrepreneurs-in-residence/2014/12/05/92a4cfd6-7a71-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/05/Others/Images/2014-12-04/DR2A02561417744386.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ravindranize"}, "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services brought in four entrepreneurs for a 12-month stint.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/hhs-adds-new-class-of-entrepreneurs-in-residence/2014/12/05/92a4cfd6-7a71-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Health and Human Services", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "92a4cfd6-7a71-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we implement [Blue Button] for all the Medicare beneficiaries, it makes a difference to the industry,\u201d he said.\nIf the project is successful, he said, patients could eventually add apps to Blue Button \u2014 tracking the interactions between medications they\u2019re taking, for instance.\nIn the entrepreneurs-in-residence program\u2019s third year, HHS is still working on how to evaluate whether it\u2019s worth the time and financial investment, Kalil said.\nDanny Boice, chief technology officer and co-founder of Sterling-based conference-call company Speek, is working with the HHS Administration for Community Living to help aging and disabled citizens keep track of health services.\n(An HHS spokesman said that at least one software project during the past three years has been officially implemented."}
