James is a likely candidate to fill the production void left with the graduation of Shaquil Barrett. ( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 Let's get something straight. Cory James is not Shaquil Barrett.\n\nIt's tempting to cast the two in the same light because both are linebackers and each player posted impressive numbers. But Barrett left Colorado State as the football program's first Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year in 13 years.\n\nHe earned his way into the conversation as one of the most productive defensive players in school history, crowned by a senior season where Barrett ranked fifth nationally with 20.5 tackles for loss (a MW record) and 12 sacks.\n\nSo how does James' name find its way to the tip of peoples' tongues when looking for someone to fill at least part of Barrett's missing production?\n\n\"I think that's a good question for those new guys who are trying to block him,\" CSU coach Jim McElwain said.\n\nJames has proven to be an uncanny playmaker in his first two seasons as a Ram, racking up 15.5 sacks and 22.5 tackles for loss, figures far out-doing Barrett's first two-year totals.\n\nScary part is the redshirt junior's only getting better this spring.\n\n\"Cory is definitely a gifted athlete. The thing he really picked up was his mental part of the game. Not so much on his assignments, but understanding how offenses are trying to attack him,\" linebackers and assistant head coach Tim Skipper said. \"Seeing splits, seeing postures of the O-lineman and knowing run-pass before it even happens is the main area I see him really improving.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkipper sees James in a different mold than Barrett. The latter was bigger, built more like a defensive end than a linebacker, whereas James is a quick and better in space. James won't be asked to play the same position as Barrett did in 2013, yet he will be looked upon to seize those sack opportunities and help develop a second edge rusher.\n\nHis versatility is a valuable weapon for co-defensive coordinator Marty English, who is in charge of the Rams' front seven. James is a three-down player, playing his usual linebacker spot in base packages and equally dangerous as an end in nickel.\n\n\"He's coming along really well. I would tell you he understands his role. He knows exactly,\" English said.\n\nAt 6-feet, 240-pounds, James is electric on the edges and in open space, something he's shown since his first season setting the CSU freshman record for sacks with 7.5. His numbers grew as a sophomore leaving high expectations for his junior campaign.\n\n\"Well I hope I can do the same thing (Barrett) did,\" James said. \"He knows how to place hands on the offensive lineman and stuff like that, so I need to work on that more and my overall awareness on the field.\"\n\nThat's where spring practice becomes so important for James and the rest of the Rams. While he hones is skills and becomes a more complete player, James simultaneously forces his opposing teammates in practice to be that much sharper.\n\n\"He's a sneaky guy in pass rush, so I think in the long run he's going to really help our tackles and our tight ends when they get into their protection stuff,\" McElwain said.\n\nJames is a man of few words at best, described by English as \"a quiet kid.\" He prefers to let his play do the talking, which says plenty. However, the guys who know him best are seeing a change in his demeanor this spring as a leader.\n\n\"I think he's a little more vocal, a lot more comfortable with the defense and we all have a couple years; it's most of the same guys in there,\" senior linebacker Aaron Davis said. \"I think it's easier for him to talk to us and communicate on the field, and I think that's going to help us in the long run.\"\n\nSo no, James isn't Barrett \u2014 not yet. But given time, he may be even better.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Sports Writer Cris Tiller at 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/csu/ci_25503973/colorado-state-junior-cory-james-has-chance-fill", "modificationDate": "2014-04-05T17:46:12-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0405/20140405__06rhscfbw_TEST~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Cris Tiller \n \n  Reporter-Herald Sports Writer", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Let's get something straight.
