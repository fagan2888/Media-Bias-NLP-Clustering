Because if something goes wrong, that vehicle could be up there without a pilot.\u201d\n\nOne factor that helped speed up the process was the fact the team\u2019s Sensefly SwingletCAM drone - which looks to be not much more than a black foam wing with a propeller - already was authorized for use on the island. They simply worked with the FAA to allow them to fly it in the area of the lava, and they were off and running - or flying.\n\nThe team\u2019s first flight was Oct. 22, according to Ryan Perroy, UH-Hilo assistant professor of geography and environmental science, and since then they\u2019ve been flying every three to seven days, sometimes making repeat flights every other hour all day long.\n\n\u201cWe keep it within line of sight of our platform, and it flies around the area we\u2019re mapping out, making sure to get a good overlap. It takes photos every second or so,\u201d he said.\n\nThe team uses mostly off-the-shelf equipment, including a point-and-shoot Canon camera attached to the drone, to create truly stunning, three-dimensional, high-resolution images of the lava flow.\n\nThe drone also has instruments to keep track of flight telemetry and GPS coordinates so the team knows exactly when and where photos were snapped, including the pitch of the vehicle, its speed and more.\n\nThe secret, Perroy explained, is in taking enough photos to create plenty of overlap in the areas of ground they cover, and from various perspectives. That allows the research team to stitch the photos together using specialized software, creating large \u201corthomosaics,\u201d which give very precise and accurate information for Civil Defense to assess the situation on the ground.\n\n\u201cOne of the first missions they flew was up above the Apa\u2019a Street area, and they had done some mapping of the flow field, and that was extremely valuable,\u201d said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Darryl Oliveira. \u201cThey validated some of our measurements of where the flow was widening, and demonstrated their aircraft and program as far as what they were capable of doing.\u201d\n\nOliveira added the team\u2019s drone has proven to be especially useful on days when the county\u2019s helicopter has been unavailable to provide Civil Defense officials an in-person bird\u2019s eye view of the situation on the ground.\n\n\u201cAt least twice, they (the county\u2019s helicopters) have been unavailable because they were involved in other missions, and having a pre-arranged agreement with them (SDAV) to do surveying and mapping has been truly valuable. Not to mention the quality of their imagery is exceptional. The resolution is just phenomenal. In place of having a person up there, we\u2019re able to make the same assessment of what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the members of the team, they say the opportunity to work on the project has been personally and professionally rewarding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been unbelievable for me,\u201d Perroy said. \u201cWe\u2019re very aware how important this is, and we want to support the citizens of Pahoa as much as we can. And this has also been a pretty amazing opportunity for the students. . To work on something like this is an unbelievable opportunity. We\u2019re all very humbled to contribute.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the laboratory, visit http://geodata.sdal.hilo.hawaii.edu/.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Hawaii Tribune-Herald, http://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Predicting where the June 27 lava flow will go next is a fluid undertaking.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Predicting where the June 27 lava flow will go next is a fluid undertaking.", "title": "UH-Hilo researchers, drone map lava flow", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/22/uh-hilo-researchers-drone-map-lava-flow/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/22/5ba7bc01c89f162d660f6a7067006561.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/22/5ba7bc01c89f162d660f6a7067006561.jpg", "description": "Predicting where the June 27 lava flow will go next is a fluid undertaking.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "UH-Hilo researchers, drone map lava flow"}, "Author": "COLIN M.
