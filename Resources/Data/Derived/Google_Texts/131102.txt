TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Sean Maguire lost the faith of Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher after struggling in last week's loss at Clemson. He might have gained it back by coming off the bench Saturday and rallying the 19th-ranked Seminoles past North Carolina State 34-17.



Maguire replaced an ineffective Everett Golson in the second quarter and directed four straight scoring drives as Florida State (8-2, 6-2 ACC, No. 16 CFP) took control. The junior was 18 of 28 for 231 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.



Boxscore | Recap

Fisher named Golson the starter on Thursday and said that he fit in better with the game plan. Golson started the first seven games but missed the Oct. 31 contest against Syracuse due to a concussion. He did not play last week.



Golson's struggles started in the Oct. 24 loss at Georgia Tech and continued on Saturday. He committed turnovers on three of five drives, including two interceptions, and was taken out with the Seminoles trailing 17-7.



That opened the door again for Maguire, who threw for 348 yards and three touchdowns against Syracuse but only 169 yards and an interception against Clemson. Maguire completed five of his first six passes and gave the passing game a spark.



Kermit Whitfield had his second 100-yard receiving game of the season with six receptions for 117 yards and two touchdowns. Jesus Wilson added 78 yards on seven receptions.



Golson finished 5 of 9 for 52 yards and two interceptions. After not throwing a pick in 210 attempts dating back to last season at Notre Dame, Golson has three in his past 17.



Dalvin Cook, who set Florida State's single-season rushing record, had 138 yards on 22 carries, including a 30-yard touchdown in the second quarter where he broke four tackles. Warrick Dunn, who had held the record with 1,242 yards in 1995, was in attendance.



For the second straight year, the Wolfpack got out to a 17-7 first-quarter lead against the Seminoles but were unable to sustain it. Ten of the points came via Florida State turnovers.



Jacoby Brissett accounted for 236 all-purpose yards for N.C. State (6-4, 2-4 ACC). He was 27 of 47 for 209 yards and a touchdown along a rushing touchdown. Florida State was able to get consistent pressure on Brissett all day long, recording four sacks.
