The poll found that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of the president\u2019s performance, a sharp rise compared to 42 percent last year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Obama\u2019s approval rating is even lower than President George W. Bush\u2019s at this point in his presidency. By the end of Bush's fifth year in office, roughly 47 percent of Americans approved of his performance, four points more than Obama currently enjoys. Of all post-World War II presidents, only President Richard Nixon faced worse numbers at this point in his second term \u2013 a brutal 29 percent thanks to the damaging Watergate scandal.\n\nAs another point of reference, Obama\u2019s approval rating stood at 49 percent when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and narrowed Democrats\u2019 supermajority in the Senate in 2010.\n\nLast week, a CBS News/New York Times poll pegged Obama with a 42 percent approval rating.\n\nThe sinking numbers have been linked to gridlock in Washington, the controversial surveillance program run by the National Security Agency, as well as the terrible rollout of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Healthcare.gov website, which has only recently shown signs of improvement. Only 34 percent of Americans approve of the way the ACA has been implemented so far, though Obama is still favored on the issue against Congressional Republicans by a 42 - 37 percent margin.\n\nThe Post/ABC poll also found the president tied with his opponents on the issue of who could be trusted more to deal with the nation\u2019s problems: Both Obama and Congressional Republicans stood at 41 percent. Meanwhile, Republicans are currently favored 45 - 41 percent against Obama when it comes to who could better handle the economy.\n\nWhether or not the poll\u2019s results indicate movement concerning next year\u2019s midterm elections remains to be seen, but the eight-point advantage Democrats enjoyed over Republicans during the government shutdown has all but disappeared. Forty-seven percent of voters now say they\u2019d vote for a Democrat on a \u201cgeneric ballot\u201d in 2014, while 45 percent leaned Republican", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the end of the year approaches, President Barack Obama is suffering the worst approval rating at this point in a two-term presidency since the Nixon administration.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "As the end of the year approaches, President Barack Obama is suffering the worst approval rating at this point in a two-term presidency since the Nixon administration.", "title": "Obama\u2019s rating worse than Bush\u2019s, worst since Nixon", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/8e/70/00/obama-rating-worst-since-nixon.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/obama-rating-worst-since-nixon-447/", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimzied": "width", "twitter": {"description": "As the end of the year approaches, President Barack Obama is suffering the worst approval rating at this point in a two-term presidency since the Nixon administration.", "creator": "@RT_com", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/8e/70/00/obama-rating-worst-since-nixon.si.jpg", "title": "RT International", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "navigation": "tabbed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7b0\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s more, Obama\u2019s approval rating is even lower than President George W.
