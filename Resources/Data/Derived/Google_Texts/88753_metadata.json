Bevin ran on an anti-Obamacare platform and had vowed to make Kentucky the first state to reject Medicaid expansion after already embracing it.\n\nThree months later, the landscape is far more encouraging for ACA proponents. Bevin has effectively blinked , grudgingly endorsing a version of Medicaid expansion, and soon after his election, Louisiana\u2019s John Bel Edwards (D) was elected on a pro-Medicaid platform. This week, the Democratic governor made Louisiana the 31st state to accept the ACA policy, extending coverage to hundreds of thousands of low-income residents.\n\nWhich state will be the 32nd? South Dakota, Wyoming, Alabama, and now even Idaho are discussing the possibility. Last night, the L.A. Times reported that the Obama administration has a new proposal in mind to \u201cpersuade more states\u201d to follow suit.\n\nThough the law provided federal funding to fully pay for the expansion in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the aid is gradually phased down so that states will ultimately foot 10% of the cost in 2020, a prospect many state lawmakers find worrisome, given doubts about the price tag. That means that if a state such as Florida, which has opposed the law, decides in 2017 to expand Medicaid, the state would never get the full federal support. Obama\u2019s new proposal would change that, allowing any state that decides to expand Medicaid eligibility under the law to get three years of full federal funding, no matter when the expansion starts.\n\nIn a statement, the White House called this a \u201c common-sense proposal ,\u201d but added, \u201cWe hope Congress will act to provide this extra incentive to states that haven\u2019t yet expanded, encouraging them not to miss out on the benefits other states are already enjoying.\u201d\n\nThe five words that should jump out are, \u201cWe hope Congress will act,\u201d as in, this is a good idea that will need lawmakers\u2019 approval, which means it probably won\u2019t happen.\n\nI wonder, though, if even the proposal itself has some beneficial effects. The administration probably won\u2019t get what it wants from Capitol Hill, but this nevertheless serves as a reminder to states considering Medicaid expansion: the sooner you act, the more you\u2019ll benefit.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "With 31 states now on board with Medicaid expansion, the White House has an idea to help encourage the remaining 19.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/31-down-19-go-medicaid-expansion", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "With 31 states now on board with Medicaid expansion, the White House has an idea to help encourage the remaining 19.", "title": "31 down, 19 to go on Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/31-down-19-go-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=r7ZUIbER", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/31-down-19-go-medicaid-expansion", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=VlkmNjZk", "height": 553}, "title": "31 down, 19 to go on Medicaid expansion", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "With 31 states now on board with Medicaid expansion, the White House has an idea to help encourage the remaining 19."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-14T10:40:53-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "31 down, 19 to go on Medicaid expansion", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,louisiana,medicaid,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "01/14/2016 10:40:53 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/31-down-19-go-medicaid-expansion"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "With 31 states now on board with Medicaid expansion, the White House has an idea to help encourage the remaining 19.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Louisiana, Medicaid, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Bevin ran on an anti-Obamacare platform and had vowed to make Kentucky the first state to reject Medicaid expansion after already embracing it.\nBevin has effectively blinked , grudgingly endorsing a version of Medicaid expansion, and soon after his election, Louisiana\u2019s John Bel Edwards (D) was elected on a pro-Medicaid platform.\nThe administration probably won\u2019t get what it wants from Capitol Hill, but this nevertheless serves as a reminder to states considering Medicaid expansion: the sooner you act, the more you\u2019ll benefit.\nObama\u2019s new proposal would change that, allowing any state that decides to expand Medicaid eligibility under the law to get three years of full federal funding, no matter when the expansion starts.\nThat means that if a state such as Florida, which has opposed the law, decides in 2017 to expand Medicaid, the state would never get the full federal support."}
