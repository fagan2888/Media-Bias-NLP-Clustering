And that type of powerfully uplifting advertising will likely work, according to Red Alert Politics editor Francesca Chambers.\n\nFrancesca was a guest on PBS\u2019 To the Contrary this week, along with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Democratic commentator Megan Beyer and Republican strategist Rina Shah.\n\nAll the women liked the commercial, but would it result in shampoo sales? Francesca thought so, because women will likely be drawn to the product itself or to the ad campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of advertising,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cSo I absolutely think more women will probably think about buying Pantene now.\u201d\n\nFrancesca argued that the ad was much more effective than Victoria\u2019s Secret advertisements, which never depict real women and come off as sexist. And despite the success of Pantene\u2019s ad, which has more than 8 million YouTube views, Francesca pointed out that sexist depictions of women are likely to continue for the time being.\n\nThe ladies also talked about the growing number of female CEOs and top-tier business executives. The panelists, including Francesca, praised the development as something that is beneficial to women everywhere.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the women who advanced this year into these positions, they didn\u2019t always have the most positive stories coming out about them,\u201d Francesca said, referencing the negative and judgmental rhetoric that surrounded Marissa Mayer and Jill Abramson as they rose to the top.\n\nThe women also talked about a tattooed Lutheran pastor, Nadia Bolz-Weber, and whether or not her style will continue drawing people into the church. Francesca said that young people especially will respond well when people try to make church fun \u2014 though she thought Bolz-Weber might be taking the concept too far.\n\n\u201cIt certainly works to a certain extent to get more young people interested if there\u2019s nachos and games and fun music,\u201d Francesca joked. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do to get young people listening to the word of God, then hallelujah.\u201d\n\nWatch the episode below. Also be sure to watch the TTC Extra here. The panelists discuss the top stories of the year for women.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "You probably saw the startling Pantene ad that depicted the gender stereotypes women commonly encounter and encouraged ambitious ladies to not let labels hold them back.
