Coli and connected to a massive beef recall.\n\n\n\n- Mobile users click here to watch video.\n\nBy profession, he\u2019s a carpenter. But Kevin McDermed isn\u2019t working much these days.\n\n\u201cI just needed a bottled-jack, and I need to be better. So, I don\u2019t pass out while I\u2019m doing all of this stuff,\u201d said McDermed.\n\nSo what happened to send the 41-year-old tradesman to the hospital doubled over in pain? He ate a hamburger \u2013 rare.\n\n\u201cYeah, almost died. I feel that way, yeah,\u201d said McDermed.\n\nThe Michigan man believes he was one of 11 people in four states sickened by E. Coli tainted ground beef.\n\nWolverine Packing Company has recalled 1.8 million pounds of beef, in cooperation with the government.\n\nWolverine Packing says none of their meat has tested positive.\n\n\u201cI went to a restaurant. I ordered a burger. And four days later, I had to go to the hospital because I was violently ill,\u201d said McDermed, \u201cExtreme abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea. Lots of blood loss. Very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nSo far, government officials believe restaurants and retailers in nearly 40 states may be affected. It\u2019s one of the biggest recalls of its kind in years.\n\nOne lawyer representing one of the presumed victims thinks it\u2019s only going to get bigger.\n\n\u201cI expected the number of ill people to rise into the 20s or 30s as state and local governments count those people and report it to the CDC,\u201d said food safety attorney Bill Marler, \u201cI also expect that the amount in poundage of the meat will also go up well about 1.8 million; probably into the 2 million range over this week or early next week.\u201d\n\nUSDA officials have publicly names retailers in nine states that may have sold the tainted meat. But they haven\u2019t released the names of the restaurants affected \u2013 where 10 of the 11 victims ate before falling ill.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with McDermed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Sounds a little shady to me,\u201d said McDermed, \u201cBecause we should be informed. If there\u2019s a deadly bacteria that can kill people, you should be told right away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Michigan man says he almost died after eating a rare hamburger.
