Foreign-born Hispanics are generally less likely to suffer from cancer, heart disease, obesity and hypertension, though they are more likely to face barriers to healthcare.\n\nMuch of the disparity can be attributed to the lower smoking rates among Hispanics, especially those born abroad, as well as \u201chigher levels of family support\u201d and a pattern of \u2018reverse migration\u2019 of sicker or older immigrants,\u201d the report stated.\n\nFrieden said the report offers \u201cgood news and not so good news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that there are wide variations in disease and health risk depending on where someone was born,\u201d Frieden, who speaks fluent Spanish, said in a call with reporters.\n\nHispanics in the U.S. are three times less likely to have insurance than whites. About 41 percent of Hispanics lack insurance, the survey said, a figure that is on par with a 2011 survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe Obama administration had put a strong focus on enrolling Hispanics during the latest round of healthcare signups, devoting about one-third of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 media budget to reaching that community.\n\nStill, officials have acknowledged that they have struggled to reach the population. Only about 1 in 10 ObamaCare customers is Hispanic, according to data from the federal government this year.\n\nNearly 50 percent of Hispanics said they knew little or nothing about the ObamaCare exchanges, according to a national poll in March 2015.\n\nHealth risks vary greatly depending on a person\u2019s country of origin, which often influences behavior, the report said.\n\nFor example, people who were born in Puerto Rico had higher mortality rates than people who were born in Mexico, which the CDC attributes to the overall higher smoking rate. Smoking prevalence is nearly two-thirds higher among Puerto Ricans than Mexicans, according to the CDC\u2019s report.\n\n\u201c[Smoking] is a major, major risk factor for mortality in the United States,\u201d Dr. Ken Dominguez, a medical epidemiologist for the CDC, said Tuesday. \u201cWe think that is probably the biggest factor.\u201d\n\nBoth Frieden and Dominguez stressed that smoking rates and drinking were major contributors to higher death rates among certain sub-groups of the Hispanic population.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Much of the disparity can be attributed to the lower smoking rates among Hispanics.", "description": "Much of the disparity can be attributed to the lower smoking rates among Hispanics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Much of the disparity can be attributed to the lower smoking rates among Hispanics.", "title": "CDC: Hispanics in US living longer than whites", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/241078-cdc-hispanics-outlive-whites-despite-gaps-in-health-coverage", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cdc.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/241078-cdc-hispanics-outlive-whites-despite-gaps-in-health-coverage", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-05T13:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-05T13:00:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/241078-cdc-hispanics-outlive-whites-despite-gaps-in-health-coverage", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Much of the disparity can be attributed to the lower smoking rates among Hispanics.", "card": "summary", "title": "CDC: Hispanics in US living longer than whites"}, "dcterms.title": "CDC: Hispanics in US living longer than whites"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of that \u2014 perhaps even most of it \u2014 is the lower smoking rate,\u201d Frieden told reporters Tuesday.\nThe Hispanic population has a lower death rate than whites for most leading causes of death, with even better health reported among Hispanics who were born abroad.\nFor example, people who were born in Puerto Rico had higher mortality rates than people who were born in Mexico, which the CDC attributes to the overall higher smoking rate.\nHispanics in the U.S. are three times less likely to have insurance than whites.\nHispanics in the United States are living an average of two years longer than white people, despite having less access to healthcare, according to the first national survey of the population's health."}
