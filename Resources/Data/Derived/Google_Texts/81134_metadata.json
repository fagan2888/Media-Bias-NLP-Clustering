Rick Scott made a \u201crequest\u201d to all of Florida\u2019s hospitals for financial and clinical information going back to 2006. He wanted the information by Monday, for review by his Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding at its first meeting Wednesday. This would be the commission whose nine members include just one person from the health care industry\u2014an orthopedic and reconstructive surgeon from Gainesville. In his form letter to hospitals and insurers, Scott asked for \u201cinformation on your services, profits, costs and patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn roughly a month, Scott has turned his mismanagement of negotiations with the federal government over health care money into a political crisis and an attack on hospitals that support continuation of that money, known as the Low Income Pool (LIP), and expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Rather than referee a dispute between the Florida House and Senate over Medicaid expansion and that LIP money, Scott allowed the House to leave early. The session ended without a budget.\n\nA three-week special session will start June 1. It could last for three weeks. The new budget year starts July 1. The governor is rattling nerves with talk of a potential state government shutdown. Last week, as legislative leaders announced progress in their budget talks, he asked agency leaders for a list of essential services.\n\nScott also has puzzled and annoyed hospital administrators with his idea that health care facilities should share profits to avoid the need for that LIP money. The share for hospitals is slightly more than $1 billion. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has told Scott since 2011 that the money would end unless the state found a better way to spend it than just reimbursing hospitals for emergency room care.\n\nThe Obama administration wants to solve that problem by getting health insurance to more Floridians, which supposedly would reduce the use of emergency rooms for non-emergency care. Before 1.6 million Floridians signed up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act exchange, the state had the second-highest rate of uninsured. To cover nearly 900,000 more less-affluent Floridians, the state could use money from the Affordable Care Act, under a Senate plan that would call it the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange, not Medicaid expansion. Scott and the Florida House, however, don\u2019t want to approve anything related to the health care law, which the governor sued to overturn.\n\nThe call for profit-sharing is especially odd, since Scott in his former life ran a for-profit hospital company and left with $300 million in stock when the board forced him out during an investigation that resulted in Columbia/HCA being fined $1.7 billion for Medicare and Medicaid fraud. The governor also has a law degree, but he ignored legal issues in asking hospitals to share the wealth.\n\nBoca Raton Regional Hospital, for example, is a non-profit, run by a community-based board. So is Boynton Beach-based Bethesda Health. But West Boca and Delray medical centers are part of investor-owned, for-profit Tenet Healthcare, which a national board oversees. Board members have different obligations to their institution based on the type of institution. What if sharing profits jeopardized bond payments? What about hospitals that\u2014 unlike those four\u2014receive direct taxpayer support, not just Medicaid and Medicare money? What about Lakeside Medical Center in Belle Glade, which depends on the Health Care District of Palm Beach County\u2014the only such agency in the state?\n\nAmong the four area hospitals, the fight over Low Income Pool money and Medicaid expansion matters least to Boca Regional. According to the Senate, the hospital would lose $935,000 if the LIP money stopped and there was no Medicaid expansion. According to the governor\u2019s figures, Boca Regional made $10.6 million in fiscal year 2014, a total margin of 3.1 percent. The bulk of Boca Regional\u2019s revenue comes from Medicare, not Medicaid.\n\nWest Boca and Delray have more to lose. In the same scenario\u2014LIP money stops; the Legislature doesn\u2019t expand Medicaid\u2014West Boca would lose $2.5 million and Delray would lose $2.7 million. Their reported profits for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2013 were $7.6 million and $19.8 million, respectively.\n\nAs I wrote last month, though, the fight matters a lot to Bethesda. The company provides a lot of care to uninsured patients, especially pregnant women, and could lose $7.2 million if that federal reimbursement money ends. Bethesda also has the most to gain from Medicaid expansion. Scott\u2019s figures showed Bethesda\u2019s 400-bed main hospital on Seacrest Boulevard losing just under $300,000 for the year that ended Sept. 30, 2014. Bethesda also owns an 80-bed facility west of Boynton.\n\nScott did not order hospitals to send their information. One wonders, though, if he will keep a list of those that refused. The governor\u2019s health care commission is not serious, but his capacity for trying to dodge blame and make villains of others is real.\n\nAtlantic Crossing\n\nNothing goes easily when the Delray Beach City Commission discusses Atlantic Crossing. Wednesday night will not break that pattern.\n\nOn the commission\u2019s agenda is a recommendation from City Attorney Noel Pfeffer that Delray Beach hire land-use lawyer Debbie Orshefsky\u2014in Pfeffer\u2019s words\u2014\u201cfor the task of reviewing the amended development agreement (with Atlantic Crossing) and any proposed settlement agreement with respect to this project.\u201d Mayor Carey Glickstein and Commissioner Jordana Jarjura will agree. Commissioner Shelly Petrolia will not.\n\nIt\u2019s all a matter of perspective. Glickstein and Jarjura are lawyers themselves. Glickstein also is a developer. Jarjura is a land-use lawyer. With the goal of getting a site plan for Atlantic Crossing that includes the Atlantic Court easement and a development agreement that protects the city, Glickstein and Jarjura like the idea of hiring Orshefsky, who is nationally known and has spent her career representing developers, mostly in Broward County. Find someone who knows the tricks and the angles. \u201cShe would be a great card to have in our pocket,\u201d Jarjura said. The bill would not be more than $15,000.\n\nPetrolia, however, sees Pfeffer\u2019s recommendation of Orshefsky as too exclusive and as his latest in a pattern of controversial actions regarding Atlantic Crossing.\n\nPetrolia starts with the first development agreement that Pfeffer proposed last fall, having been hired in June. (Petrolia voted to hire him.) A lawsuit against Atlantic Crossing was active\u2014the developers since have prevailed\u2014 and Petrolia believed that the agreement aligned the city with the developers regarding the litigation. Petrolia also noted the tumultuous Planning and Zoning Board meeting on Atlantic Crossing three months ago\u2014the subject was a new plat\u2014that Pfeffer aborted two hours in because the meeting hadn\u2019t been properly noticed. She believes that Pfeffer all along has been timid in making the case that the city did not give up Atlantic Court in January 2014, when the commission approved a new site plan without the road.\n\nNow Petrolia disagrees with Pfeffer\u2019s choice of Orshefsky because she prefers the Weiss Serota law firm that helped Delray Beach get out of the Waste Management contract, so the city could choose a different, cheaper trash hauler. Because of that work, Petrolia said, the firm \u201chas the public\u2019s trust to deliver good news or bad news\u201d from negotiations over a project that so many Delray Beach residents dislike to varying degrees of intensity. If her previous concerns \u201cshouldn\u2019t give me pause for concern over your single recommendation,\u201d Petrolia wrote in an email to Pfeffer, \u201cshame on me.\u201d\n\nThe irony, based on my conversations Monday with Glickstein, Jarjura and Petrolia, is that all three want the same result: Atlantic Court back in the project and the city protected. Example: Atlantic Crossing\u2019s parking will be underground. Glickstein wants the city indemnified if \u201ca Sandy-like storm surge\u201d floods that parking. \u201cThis is not just a land-use issue,\u201d Glickstein said. \u201cThis is a risk-management issue.\u201d\n\nGlickstein, Jarjura and Petrolia also all dislike Atlantic Crossing\u2014too big, wrong spot\u2014and would not have voted for it in December 2012. Delray Beach, Glickstein said, should have appreciated the location of the property and reduced the zoning years ago, at least the block east of Northeast Seventh Avenue that borders Veterans Park. All realize, however, that Delray Beach at this point can\u2019t change the size and scope of the mixed-use project. Getting the road back in with no other surprises, Petrolia said, \u201cwould be worth a victory lap.\u201d Petrolia wonders, though, why only Glickstein, Jarjura and Pfeffer have seen the new preliminary, revised site plan that includes Atlantic Court.\n\nCommissioner Mitch Katz shares Petrolia\u2019s concern about the attorney choice, but he won\u2019t be at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. It was moved from Tuesday at the request of Glickstein and Petrolia, so they could attend a year-end concert at their children\u2019s school.\n\nPetrolia and Katz are right that choosing an attorney\u2014to buttress Glickstein\u2019s negotiations with Atlantic Crossing\u2014is on a tight schedule. But the city needs a resolution before too much more time expires and the city\u2019s position weakens. There\u2019s also precedent for a Palm Beach County city hiring a developers\u2019 lawyer and making it work.\n\nWhen Nancy Graham was mayor of West Palm Beach, she hired Bob Sanders for the city\u2019s legal department. He had been the builders\u2019 go-to guy, even getting Palm Beach to approve the Esplanade\u2014against all expectations. Sanders then helped West Palm Beach condemn and acquire the land that became CityPlace\u2014also against all expectations. Graham wanted Sanders\u2019 talent on her side, not against her.\n\nPetrolia makes a good case that Pfeffer moved too fast early on regarding Atlantic Crossing. His job, though, is to protect Delray Beach from dangerous legal exposure. Pfeffer is correct that Orshefsky\u2019s qualifications are superb. Since Glickstein, Jarjura and Petrolia agree on the goal, you hope that even as they disagree they can work with Pfeffer on the best way for Delray Beach to get there.\n\nBridge alert!\n\nIf you plan to be in downtown Delray Beach tonight, leave early or plan your departure in a way that doesn\u2019t involve crossing the Atlantic Avenue bridge.\n\nThe city advises that the bridge will be closed from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. Wednesday for maintenance and repairs. Alternatives are the George Bush Boulevard bridge to the north and the Linton Avenue bridge to the south.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nYou can email Randy Schultz at randy@bocamag.com\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRandy Schultz was born in Hartford, Conn., and graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1974.
