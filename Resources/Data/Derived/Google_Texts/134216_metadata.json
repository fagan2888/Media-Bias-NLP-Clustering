Chris Christie (R) and Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) have opted in, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) have remained staunchly opposed.\n\nThe issue of Medicaid expansion made it onto the agenda of a closed-door meeting at the White House last week with a handful of governors.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has taken a cautious approach, encouraging governors to craft their own expansion plans without making a hard push.\n\nFamilies USA, a longtime proponent of ObamaCare, touted the healthcare law\u2019s \u201chistoric achievement\u201d of guaranteeing the right to health coverage. Still, it warned that the job is far from complete.\n\n\u201cEnacting this unprecedented legal right is not the same as making it a living reality,\u201d according to the report.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Medicaid expansion is next top healthcare challenge, advocates say", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Medicaid expansion is next top healthcare challenge, advocates say", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/229920-medicaid-expansion-is-next-top-healthcare-challenge-advocates-say", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/229920-medicaid-expansion-is-next-top-healthcare-challenge-advocates-say", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-19T11:42-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T11:42:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/229920-medicaid-expansion-is-next-top-healthcare-challenge-advocates-say", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Medicaid expansion is next top healthcare challenge, advocates say"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0781\"", "article_summary": "The issue of Medicaid expansion made it onto the agenda of a closed-door meeting at the White House last week with a handful of governors.\nMedicaid expansion in two dozen states remains one of the biggest hurdles to guaranteeing healthcare coverage after the rollout of ObamaCare, according to a new report from Families USA.\nFamilies USA, a longtime proponent of ObamaCare, touted the healthcare law\u2019s \u201chistoric achievement\u201d of guaranteeing the right to health coverage.\nUnless the remaining 23 states opt to expand the eligibility for the low-income insurance program, millions of people will continue to lack affordable coverage, the healthcare advocacy group warned.\n\u201cEnacting this unprecedented legal right is not the same as making it a living reality,\u201d according to the report."}
