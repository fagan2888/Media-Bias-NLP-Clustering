This shift is even more critical to the healthcare industry, which is now onboarding millions of more consumers due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The application of mobile communications strategies in this industry will have a tremendous impact to multi-hundred-billion-dollar problems, such as diabetes, medication adherence and high patient remittance rates.\n\nIn an effort to address the new challenges and opportunities in healthcare communications, mobileStorm Founder and CEO Jared Reitzin announced today that he has laid off a \u201csignificant portion of his staff,\u201d including the entire executive team, and rehired them for the newly-formed healthcare-focused spin-off mPulse Mobile. mPulse is a mobile communications startup that will focus on helping health plans, hospitals, pharmacies, wellness companies and exchanges better engage their consumers and tackle some of the most expensive and complex challenges impacting the nation\u2019s health. The new company will extend the technology and capabilities developed by mobileStorm over the past 15 years towards, including its HIPAA-compliant, intelligent, cloud-based mobile communication platform and extensive experience in helping marketers engage and influence consumer behavior.\n\nReitzin also confirmed the appointment of Christopher Nicholson as Chief Executive Officer of the new organization.

He also has spoken nationally and internationally on messaging and communications strategies and holds multiple patents for consuming-facing communications solutions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud to be have been selected to lead this new business and am excited about the opportunity to build on mobileStorm\u2019s legacy of building impactful SaaS platforms, providing legendary customer service, and driving new opportunities,\u201d says Nicholson. \u201cI see mPulse as a \u2018triple threat\u2019 business \u2013 the convergence of mobile, cloud, and healthcare \u2013 will dramatically improve the lives of Americans. The culture and energy of the team we\u2019ve assembled is truly amazing, and I am very confident about what we\u2019ll achieve together.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaunching a new business on the 15-year milestone anniversary of mobileStorm is a true testament of the success we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d says Reitzin. \u201cOur team has successfully grown our healthcare division into a world-class business that has attracted numerous Fortune 100 healthcare clients. What we\u2019ve accomplished as a team is remarkable, and I see even more opportunities for mPulse to further drive results for our clients and help them engage their consumers through mobile messaging solutions designed specifically for the healthcare segment.\u201d\n\nmPulse will be roaring out of the gate with an impressive client roster including the largest hospital system in the country, the largest dental insurance company, one of the largest pharmacies and 50 percent of the largest health plans.
