Rubio has enjoyed rising poll numbers after his strong third-place finish last week in Iowa , where Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump narrowly edged him out .\n\nAs first reported by The Resurgent and Mother Jones , these mailings were paid for by an upstart group called America Needs Leadership .\n\nMailers sent to New Hampshire residents have criticized Rubio, a senator from Florida, for not being tough enough on illegal immigration and for utilizing a subsidy under the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nAs New Hampshirites prepare to vote in their state\u2019s Republican presidential primary, allies of Chris Christie have launched an 11th-hour, dark money attack on Marco Rubio .\n\nThe ad\u2019s sponsor\n\nAmerica Needs Leadership is not organized as a super PAC that must disclose its donors. Rather, it\u2019s a nonprofit group under section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code, which means the group is generally allowed to keep the names of its donors secret.\n\nThat designation also means that, by law, the group\u2019s primary purpose must be \u201cto promote social welfare,\u201d not to engage in electoral politics \u2014 although it may advocate for or against candidates to a limited degree.\n\nWhat exactly is the group\u2019s mission?\n\nAccording to its all-but-empty Facebook page, America Needs Leadership wants \u201ca new generation of leaders to step up to move our country forward with strength and resolve.\u201d\n\nRecords with the Internal Revenue Service show that America Needs Leadership was awarded tax-exempt status as a social welfare nonprofit in December 2015.\n\nAmerica Needs Leadership\u2019s bare-bones website was registered in October 2015 by Kurt Luidhardt, an Indiana-based political consultant at the Prosper Group, a digital agency he co-founded in 2006. Campaigns & Elections magazine has described Luidhardt as \u201cone of the GOP\u2019s top thinkers in online campaigning.\u201d\n\nAccording to his official biography, Luidhardt has worked with Republican politicians including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, former Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts \u2014 and Christie.\n\nCampaign finance filings show two groups connected to Christie paid Luidhardt\u2019s the Prosper Group nearly $300,000 last year.\n\nOne is America Leads, a super PAC backing Christie\u2019s presidential bid, which paid the Prosper Group about $255,000 last year. Press reports describe Luidhardt as leading the super PAC\u2019s digital efforts.\n\nThe other is Leadership Matters for America, a federal political action committee Christie launched last year ahead of his official presidential campaign, which paid the firm about $41,000 in 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, IRS records list Virginia-based political consultant Timothy Koch of the firm Koch & Hoos as a contact for America Needs Leadership, the sponsor of the anti-Rubio mailers. According to The Resurgent, the address of Koch\u2019s firm was listed as the return address on the recent mailings to New Hampshire voters.\n\nKoch also serves as the treasurer of America Leads, which paid Koch & Hoos about $32,000 last year for accounting and compliance services. The now defunct presidential campaign of Republican Rick Santorum was also among Koch & Hoos\u2019 clients, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\nNeither Luidhardt nor Koch responded to requests for comment from the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s unclear who is funding America Needs Leadership. The mailers sent to New Hampshire voters note that contributions from foreign nationals and government contractors are prohibited. They say that the group may accept \u201cunlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and other U.S. organizations\u201d and that America Needs Leadership \u201cdoes not make contributions to or coordinate its spending with any candidates or political parties.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much America Needs Leadership is spending. The group\u2019s first official tax return \u2014 which would provide insights into how much money America Needs Leadership raised and spent during its first year of existence \u2014 will not be required to be filed with the IRS until after the November 2016 general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dark money outfit with ties to allies of NJ governor behind mudslinging mailers", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/9/stealth-christie-group-attacks-rubio-ahead-of-new-hampshire-primary.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2016/2/9/stealth-christie-group-attacks-rubio-ahead-of-new-hampshire-primary/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Rubio_020116.1455055272831.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Dark money outfit with ties to allies of NJ governor behind mudslinging mailers", "title": "Stealth Christie group attacks Rubio ahead of New Hampshire primary"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Tue, 09 Feb 2016 22:01:23 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2016/2/9/stealth-christie-group-attacks-rubio-ahead-of-new-hampshire-primary/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Rubio_020116.1455055272831.jpg", "description": "Dark money outfit with ties to allies of NJ governor behind mudslinging mailers", "card": "summary", "title": "Stealth Christie group attacks Rubio ahead of New Hampshire primary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "New Hampshire, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The ad\u2019s sponsorAmerica Needs Leadership is not organized as a super PAC that must disclose its donors.\nAs first reported by The Resurgent and Mother Jones , these mailings were paid for by an upstart group called America Needs Leadership .\nFor now, it\u2019s unclear who is funding America Needs Leadership.\nAccording to its all-but-empty Facebook page, America Needs Leadership wants \u201ca new generation of leaders to step up to move our country forward with strength and resolve.\u201dRecords with the Internal Revenue Service show that America Needs Leadership was awarded tax-exempt status as a social welfare nonprofit in December 2015.\nChristie, New Jersey\u2019s governor, desperately needs to beat Rubio in New Hampshire to energize his sputtering campaign."}
