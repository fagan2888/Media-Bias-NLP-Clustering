Adeline Gray captured her second gold medal when she defeated Brazil’s Aline da Silva 2-1 on Thursday at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships at the Gymnastics Palace in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

The 23-year-old Denver native who wrestled at Chatfield High School, recorded five victories en route to her title in the women’s freestyle at 75 kg/165 pounds. Gray won gold in 2012 at 67 kg, and earned bronze in 2011 and 2013 at the same weight.

“I don’t know if women get the same credit for winning the 2012 world championship,” Gray said in a statement. “It’s the same year as the Olympics and some countries don’t come. In my heart, I consider it a world championship. I definitely earned the world championship this year. I’m the best girl in the world and that’s an amazing feeling.”

Gray scored early, connecting on a single-leg attack on da Silva, which resulted in a takedown in the first period.

It was all the points she needed.

“She’s always dangerous,” Gray said in a statement. “I tried to play it a little more safe this time. But a win’s a win. I got that gold medal and that’s what matters.”

Gray becomes the fourth American woman to win at least four medals at the world championships, joining Kristie Marano, Trish Saunders and Shannon Williams.
