And here I thought that\u2019s what teenagers were for.\n\nThe prototype smart home offers a peek at what\u2019s to come. Hint: houses that talk back. Their mission is to help you eat right, exercise more and take better care of yourself.\n\nBeing that I am both a health reporter and a home-design columnist, the idea of a home that helps you stay healthy hit the bull\u2019s eye on my interest target.\n\nBut then terror hit.\n\nDo I really want a mirror that tells me the truth? (No.) Or a refrigerator that tells me to eat this, not that? (Shut up!)\n\nIntrigued, I walked right in.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to design a home that uses technology to help those living in it be healthier,\u201d said Michael Voll, vice president of Dais Technologies, the company behind many of the Intelligent Home\u2019s smart features. Voll led me through the futuristic model, which is in Lake Nona, Fla., a growing health-centric community in southeast Orlando.\n\nThe house represents big-time thinking from big-time companies like Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Cisco, Ashton Woods Home, Canyon Ranch and others. Together, they hope to reduce not just Americans\u2019 waistlines, but also the $3 trillion a year this country spends on health care \u2014 70 percent of which we bring on ourselves because of lousy lifestyles.\n\nWe start in the kitchen. There, a color-coded refrigerator and pantry offers a low-tech way to make healthier food choices. A digital cookbook calls up recipes based on what ingredients are in the house. No eggs? No omelets.\n\n\u201cIt knows?\u201d I asked wide-eyed.\n\n\u201cNew kitchen technology helps with healthy, convenient meal planning,\u201d Voll said.\n\nI flash on a vision of my future relationship with my freezer.\n\n\u201cDo you really need that?\u201d My freezer asks as I reach for the Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream.\n\n\u201cYes, actually, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have a lower-sugar, lower-calorie alternative?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t know what my day has been like. I haven\u2019t had dessert in three days. Can we negotiate?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw you eat that cupcake yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to give me a hard time, I\u2019ll just move onto the pantry, and you know how many trans fats are in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Not the trans fats!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only that, but high-fructose corn syrup!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, but only four ounces, deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nNext, we head upstairs where a full-length, interactive mirror gives out like-it-or-not feedback, along the lines of, \u201cBob, looks like you\u2019re up a few pounds, and your blood pressure is high. Better hit the treadmill and up your diuretic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to program homes so they make people healthier by giving them information that makes healthier choices easier,\u201d Voll said.\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d I said, fairly horror-stricken: \u201cYou stand in front of a mirror that tells you how much you weigh, even when you\u2019re fully dressed and have just eaten three slices of Lou Malnati\u2019s pizza?\u201d\n\nVoll is awkwardly silent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather walk on burning barbed wire, barefoot.\u201d\n\nHe wisely moves beyond the subject of weight, and runs through a series of options on the giant touch pad, where he can call up dozens of exercise routines from free weights to indoor cycle to yoga. While he amuses himself, I glance around for the inevitable ugly hardware \u2014 the black boxes, cords, remotes, monitors \u2014 that tend to accompany technology.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the icky-looking stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find it,\u201d Voll said. \u201cThe technology is invisible and ambient.\u201d\n\n\u201cRats,\u201d I said. There went my last good excuse not to like it.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).

You be the judge\n\nBrace yourself: Here are some of the healthy home features and technologies that may be coming to a future near you:\n\nMirror, mirror on the wall. A look in this full-length, interactive mirror tells you not just whether your slacks are wrinkled, but also your blood pressure, weight, BMI, hydration level, pulse-oxygen level, and, oh, when your next doctor\u2019s appointment is. Tailored to each family member, the mirror serves as a personal health coach. (\u201cJoe, you\u2019re down 2 pounds. Way to go, buddy!\u201d) It can probably even do a vet check on your pets.\n\nPersonal trainer. The same mirror can then turn into your personal trainer, helping you track your workouts, and see how you\u2019re doing compared to your fitness goals. Some of the workout sessions videos have famous athletes leading you through routines. Afterward, your automated coach will let you know how you did (\u201cSue, that was your best yet!\u201d)\n\nColor-coded pantry. Different colors of tape bordering shelves in the pantry and refrigerator offer an easy way to help family members reach for healthier choices. Items on the green shelf are for healthiest any-time foods; those on the yellow-coded shelf should be eaten in moderation, and items on the red \u2014 and hardest-to-reach shelf \u2014 make you think again. For those on special diets or with allergies, one shelf could be coded in blue for low-sodium or nut-free foods.\n\nNo more excuses to not cook. A GE Advantium oven speed-cooks food up to seven times faster than a regular oven, eliminating one more excuse (not enough time) for not cooking at home. Advantium technology cooks the outside of the food like a conventional oven, with radiant heat produced by halogen bulbs above and below food, so it browns. The halogen heat gets a boost of microwave energy, so foods also cook evenly and fast. Breaded fish filets that would take 30 minutes in a conventional oven are done in 4\u00bd minutes. Faster cooking means fewer fast-food meals, which leads to better control over the family\u2019s nutrition.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Smart home gets healthy, aided by tech that talks", "title": "Smart home gets healthy, aided by tech that talks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/15/smart-home-gets-healthy-aided-by-tech-that-talks/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131115__20131116_C2_FE16AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131115__20131116_C2_FE16AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-16T03:32:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:25:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ba1\"", "article_summary": "I just toured a home so smart it tells you when you\u2019re being stupid.\nA look in this full-length, interactive mirror tells you not just whether your slacks are wrinkled, but also your blood pressure, weight, BMI, hydration level, pulse-oxygen level, and, oh, when your next doctor\u2019s appointment is.\nVoll led me through the futuristic model, which is in Lake Nona, Fla., a growing health-centric community in southeast Orlando.\nDo I really want a mirror that tells me the truth?\nThe halogen heat gets a boost of microwave energy, so foods also cook evenly and fast."}
