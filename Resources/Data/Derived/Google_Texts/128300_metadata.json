It turned out that our national health plan for the elderly was paying double for the devices compared with the Department of Veterans Affairs and everyday online shoppers, shelling out a grand total of $172 million between 2006 and 2011.* The media, of course, had a field day, in part because Republicans were raging over the possibility that employers would have to cover birth control under Obamacare.\n\nFast-forward a year later, and it appears that the penis pump\u2019s days as a federal budget item could be numbered. Congress may be nearing a vote on the ABLE Act, a long-gestating piece of legislation that would create special bank accounts to let disabled Americans save money without losing their government benefits. In order to pay for it, lawmakers would ban Medicare from paying for any penis pumps, freeing up an estimated $444 million over 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know much about the ABLE Act. It seems like a worthwhile bill that may well be worth funding somehow or another. (For what it's worth, it currently has 380 co-sponsors in the House.) But preventing Medicare from assisting elderly couples suffering from intimacy problems is cruel, and only entrenches the federal government\u2019s bizarre stance that sexual health isn\u2019t really part of human health. There is, after all, a very good reason why Medicare had to purchase 473,000 penis pumps over six years: In 2006, Congress banned the federal government from covering erectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra under Medicare Part D. As the New York Times wrote last year:\n\nThe bill\u2019s chief sponsor scoffed at \u201cGrandpa\u2019s recreational sex\u201d\u2014his language suggesting that if he couldn\u2019t avoid paying for seniors\u2019 health care, he at least wanted to be sure they didn\u2019t have any fun.\n\nThe vacuum tubes seem to have been a second best option. In an ideal world, we\u2019d acknowledge that nonprocreative sex isn't just a recreational activity that would be absurd for the government to fund but is in fact pretty fundamental to people's (even old people's) happiness, and let grandma and grandpa have their little blue pills. But at the very least, we shouldn\u2019t be robbing them of their fallback.\n\nTo be sure, Medicare shouldn\u2019t have been paying anything more than market rates for the pumps. The program was overpaying largely because, instead of using a competitive bidding process to get the best deal from suppliers like it does with some other items, it relied on an outdated payment formula that relied on historical prices. That should be fixed.\n\n\n\nIn short, penis pumps are inherently kind of funny.
