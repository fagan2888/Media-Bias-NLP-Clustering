Of the Illinois enrollees, 241,590, or 82 percent of the state's total enrollment, came from an area that stretches from west suburban Naperville to northwest suburban Elgin to Chicago.\n\n\u201cThere are just 11 days before the Feb. 15 deadline and the end of this year's open enrollment,\u201d HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. \u201cTime is running out.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmong Illinois enrollees, 78 percent qualify for a financial subsidy from the government to help pay for their premiums.\n\nThe federal government hosts the online exchange in partnership with Illinois. During the first year of the exchange, in 2014, 217,492 consumers enrolled in Obamacare plans in Illinois. The signup period lasted six months, twice as long as the current enrollment period.", "article_metadata": {"taxo_People": "Barack Obama", "timeCrawled": "20160525_00:21:43", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150204/NEWS03/150209893/AR/0/Illinois-Obamacare-enrollment-nears-300000.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Illinois Obamacare enrollment nears 300,000"}, "published_at": "2015-2-4", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "title": "Illinois Obamacare enrollment nears 300,000", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Illinois enrollment on the health care exchanges is already running 36 percent above of last year, with just one week to go before the signup period ends.", "title": "Obamacare enrollment in Illinois nears 300,000", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150204/NEWS03/150209893/obamacare-enrollment-in-illinois-nears-300-000", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150204/NEWS03/150209893/AR/0/Illinois-Obamacare-enrollment-nears-300000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150204/NEWS03/150209893/AR/0/Illinois-Obamacare-enrollment-nears-300000.jpg", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Illinois Dept. of Healthcare and Family Services", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "taxo_Sections": "News", "taxo_Industries": "State Government", "summary": "Illinois enrollment on the health care exchanges is already running 36 percent above of last year, with just one week to go before the signup period ends.", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150209893", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf312\"", "article_summary": "Illinois enrollment on the Obamacare health exchanges is approaching 300,000 with about two weeks to go before the signup period ends.\nThe signup period lasted six months, twice as long as the current enrollment period.\nDuring the first year of the exchange, in 2014, 217,492 consumers enrolled in Obamacare plans in Illinois.\nOf the Illinois enrollees, 241,590, or 82 percent of the state's total enrollment, came from an area that stretches from west suburban Naperville to northwest suburban Elgin to Chicago.\nThat's 2 percent more than the last time enrollment figures were released, on Jan. 23."}
