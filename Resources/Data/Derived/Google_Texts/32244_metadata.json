Nearly 1,000 people were in attendance for the rally, which was held at the Grand Wayne Center.\n\nIn his speech, Cruz touched on repealing the Affordable Care Act, eradicating ISIS and protecting religious liberty in the United States. He also referenced North Carolina\u2019s controversial transgender bathroom bill.\n\n\u201cThis is basic common sense,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to allow grown, adult men -- strangers -- to be alone in a bathroom with little girls. And anyone who says differently is political correctness on steroids.\u201d\n\nCruz also used the bill to take a shot at two of his main political opponents.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can\u2019t use the little girl\u2019s restroom!\u201d he said. Last week, Trump said he supports transgender people using the bathroom they want.\n\nFormer GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina began her tour with the Cruz campaign after officially being announced as the candidate\u2019s running mate Wednesday afternoon in Indianapolis.\n\nHer support of Cruz is linked by a mutual passion for the Constitution, which she credits for her success in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt is only in this nation that a young woman can start out typing and filing and answering phones for a nine-person company in the middle of a deep recession, go on one day to become the chief executive of what we turned into the largest technology company in the world, run for the presidency of the United States and be named to be another candidate\u2019s running mate,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nShe also believes the Constitution is being abused by the current administration.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is not just about the protection of our rights and liberties,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Constitution is about restraining power. And here\u2019s the truth folks: we have had, for too long, too much money and too much power concentrated in the hands of too few people.\u201d\n\nCruz also wasted little time singing the praises of his new running mate, as well -- again, at the expense of an opponent.\n\n\u201cCarly terrifies Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI can just picture Hillary thinking about Carly, tossing and turning and tossing and turning\u2026 in her jail cell.\u201d\n\nAs primary season draws to a close with delegates still in play, Cruz says he\u2019s confident in his chances as the GOP nomination hangs into balance in Indiana.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, the eyes of the entire country are on Indiana right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could not be happier to have this race decided using the Midwestern common sense -- the good judgment -- of Hoosiers.\u201d\n\nCruz supporters at the Grand Wayne Center varied in age, from young children to seniors. Levi Nelson just finished his freshman year at Indiana Wesleyan University, and came to the rally wearing a Captain America hat and jacket sporting the American flag.\n\n\"I really like his stance on security and foreign policy, along with the private sector, and ending the war on coal would be very, very good.\" Nelson said.\n\nFiorina and Cruz emphasized their partnership is the clear choice in the Republican party to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election. Cruz is expected to return to the Grand Wayne Center Monday for another speaking engagement.\n\nIndiana\u2019s primary election is Tuesday, May 3.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz and his new running mate Carly Fiorina made a campaign stop in Fort Wayne Thursday morning, five days before", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wboi.org/post/cruz-fiorina-visit-fort-wayne-ahead-primary", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wbni/files/styles/medium/public/201604/IMG_6835.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz and his new running mate Carly Fiorina made a campaign stop in Fort Wayne Thursday morning, five days before", "title": "Cruz, Fiorina Visit Fort Wayne Ahead Of Primary"}, "story_id": 476091751, "twitter": {"site": "@WBOI", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@ZachBernardWBOI"}, "author": "Zach Bernard", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Cruz, Fiorina Visit Fort Wayne Ahead Of Primary"}, "nid": 59466, "datePublished": "2016-04-28", "keywords": ", , ,", "wordCount": 615, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz and his new running mate Carly Fiorina made a campaign stop in Fort Wayne Thursday morning, five days before Indiana\u2019s May 3 primary.\nNearly 1,000 people were in attendance for the rally, which was held at the Grand Wayne Center.\nCruz is expected to return to the Grand Wayne Center Monday for another speaking engagement.\nFormer GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina began her tour with the Cruz campaign after officially being announced as the candidate\u2019s running mate Wednesday afternoon in Indianapolis.\nFiorina and Cruz emphasized their partnership is the clear choice in the Republican party to defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election."}
