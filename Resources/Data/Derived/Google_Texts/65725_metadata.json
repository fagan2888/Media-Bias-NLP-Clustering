Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal insists that liberals are declaring war on families and religious liberty; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has been beating the culture war drum and railing against abortion, gay rights, feminism, same-sex marriage and sexy images in pop music. And as usual, Republicans are overlooking the real reason why so many Americans are either delaying or opting out of parenthood: economic stress. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that the average cost of raising a child born in 2013 will exceed $245,000, and birth rates among women in their 20 have reached an historic low in the U.S. (according to the Centers for Disease Control). America\u2019s middle class has been facing a full-fledged economic assault, making it harder and harder to take on the colossal expense of parenthood.\n\nBelow are nine major reasons why the U.S., more and more, has become a terrible place to raise a family unless you\u2019re rich.\n\n1. The High Cost of Childcare\n\nAmerican families are facing a variety of rising costs in 2015, from food to housing. But one of the biggest expenses of all is turning out to be childcare. A 2014 report by Child Care Aware of America found that daycare could be as high as $14,508 per year for an infant and $12,280 per year for a four-year-old. And that is, in a sense, more troubling for new parents than the high cost of college tuition: while that expense is 17 or 18 years in the future, daycare is an expense working parents face right away.\n\n2. Stagnant Wages Combined With Ever-Increasing Cost of Living\n\nA 2014 report by the Center for American Progress offered little reason to be optimistic about family life in the U.S. The Center found that \u201cinvesting in the basic pillars of middle-class security\u2014child care, housing and healthcare, as well as setting aside modest savings for retirement and college\u2014cost an alarming $10,600 more in 2012 than it did in 2000.\u201d To make matters worse, the Center reported, incomes for most Americans remained stagnant during that 12-year period.\n\n3. Public Education Is Struggling, and Private Schools Are Unaffordable\n\nThe economic meltdown of September 2008 has been bad news for American families on multiple levels. When families are struggling financially and have less money to spend, that harms a variety of businesses. And lower income also means less tax revenue, which harms public education because public education is funded with income taxes as well as sales and property taxes. In 2014, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that at least 35 states had less funding per student than they did before the Great Recession\u2014and 14 of those states had cut per-student funding by over 10%. Some parents will send their kids to private schools, but only if they can afford to: in 2014, the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) found that annual tuition for private high schools in the U.S. ranged from an average of $13,500 in the southern states to $29,000 in the western states to over $30,000 in the northeastern states.\n\n4. Astronomical College Tuition\n\nDuring the Fathers Knows Best/Leave It to Beaver era Republicans romanticize, a college degree practically guaranteed a middle-class income for families. College was much more affordable in those days, but now, a college education is more expensive than ever\u2014tuition costs have more than doubled since the 1980s, and there is no guarantee that a four-year degree or even a masters will lead to the type of job one needs to support a family. A college degree costs more now but delivers less. In the 1950s and 1960s, college graduates working in low-paying, dead-end service jobs was unheard of; now, it\u2019s common. And someone making $8 or $9 an hour is going to have a very hard time paying off a six-figure student loan debt and starting a family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With income inequality on the rise, only the rich can afford to raise their children with any degree of comfort", "title": "9 reasons America is a lousy place to raise kids", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With income inequality on the rise, only the rich can afford to raise their children with any degree of comfort", "title": "9 reasons America is a lousy place to raise kids", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/17/9_reasons_america_is_a_lousy_place_to_raise_kids_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_140010346.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With income inequality on the rise, only the rich can afford to raise their children with any degree of comfort", "title": "9 reasons America is a lousy place to raise kids", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_140010346.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Henderson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Department of Agriculture, Income inequality, poor, Rich", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The High Cost of ChildcareAmerican families are facing a variety of rising costs in 2015, from food to housing.\nBelow are nine major reasons why the U.S., more and more, has become a terrible place to raise a family unless you\u2019re rich.\nAstronomical College TuitionDuring the Fathers Knows Best/Leave It to Beaver era Republicans romanticize, a college degree practically guaranteed a middle-class income for families.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, college graduates working in low-paying, dead-end service jobs was unheard of; now, it\u2019s common.\nBobby Jindal insists that liberals are declaring war on families and religious liberty; former Arkansas Gov."}
