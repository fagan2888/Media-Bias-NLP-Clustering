Your plan will probably auto-renew for 2016 \u2014 but you shouldn\u2019t necessarily let it.\n\nThat\u2019s because plan costs change from year to year. According to a new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the consumers who stick with last year\u2019s most popular choice (the lowest-cost silver plan) will see an average premium increase of 15% for 2016.\n\nYet consumers who shop again for 2016 can often find a better deal. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 73% of U.S. counties, consumers will be able to find a new, more affordable silver plan. On average, enrollees who switch from last year\u2019s cheapest silver plan to this year\u2019s cheapest silver plan will be able to save $322 in premiums by making a change for in 2016, the study found.\n\nAverage monthly premium increase (in U.S. counties with lower-cost options in 2016) For a single 40-year-old with annual income of: Who stays in the 2015 cheapest silver plan Who switches to the 2016 cheapest silver plan $20,000 $28 $1 $30,000 $28 $1 $50,000 $44 $17 Source: Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDon\u2019t let inertia take over. Last year, 47% of enrollees were renewed automatically, the Kaiser Family Foundation says. People who stayed in the most popular plans from 2014 missed out on savings in competitive markets, where insurers were offering better deals in 2015.\n\nBeyond Premiums\n\nWhile you\u2019re shopping around, also be sure to look beyond the premiums. Co-pays, deductibles and prescription drug benefits may be changing too.\n\nProPublica found last year that some insurers changed the fine print on plan benefits between 2014 and 2015, leaving consumers with higher overall health care costs.\n\nNote that your decision now can affect the tax refund you might get in the spring of 2017. Since coverage subsidies are based on the second-cheapest silver plan in your area, your subsidy amount can change when the plan prices do. Even if you\u2019re not going to change plans, be sure to go to Healthcare.gov to update your income information and check your subsidy for this year.\n\nOne word of caution: If you do switch to a cheaper plan, make sure your doctors are still in-network. Getting care from out-of-network health care providers is a sure way to rack up bills, even if you\u2019ve reduced your premium costs.\n\nGet more help with Obamacare:", "article_metadata": {"description": "During open enrollment, switching from last year's cheapest silver health insurance plan to this year's could save you $322 in premiums.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "You could save hundreds of dollars in premiums.", "title": "Why Obamacare Enrollees Should Shop for Health Insurance -- Again", "url": "http://time.com/money/4118157/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/151118_ff_obamacareshopagain.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/151118_ff_obamacareshopagain.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "You could save hundreds of dollars in premiums.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Obamacare Enrollees Should Shop for Health Insurance -- Again"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", affordable care act, health care, health care premiums, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health insurance, Obamacare, open enrollment, affordable care act"}, "article_summary": "Last year, 47% of enrollees were renewed automatically, the Kaiser Family Foundation says.\nSince coverage subsidies are based on the second-cheapest silver plan in your area, your subsidy amount can change when the plan prices do.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 73% of U.S. counties, consumers will be able to find a new, more affordable silver plan.\nOn average, enrollees who switch from last year\u2019s cheapest silver plan to this year\u2019s cheapest silver plan will be able to save $322 in premiums by making a change for in 2016, the study found.\nYet consumers who shop again for 2016 can often find a better deal."}
