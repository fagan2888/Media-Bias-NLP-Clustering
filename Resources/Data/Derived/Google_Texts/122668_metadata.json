Adjunct faculty and graduate assistants are also seeing their hours reduced in response, according to Campus Reform.\n\nFor example, Campus Reform reported that Middle Tennessee State University has barred both students and part-time employees from taking more than one job on campus.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily maintains a running tally of businesses that have cut their employees\u2019 hours in response to Obamacare, a list that includes more than 100 colleges and universities.\n\nJonathan Lockwood, Colorado state director for Generation Opportunity, a Koch-affiliated free-market millennial group, released a statement Tuesday blasting the ACA\u2019s employer mandate and taking a swipe at Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who voted for Obamacare and faces a tough re-election battle.\n\n\u201cAs if we needed more proof that Obamacare is dunking young people: CU Boulder has announced that it\u2019s cutting hours for student employees on campus,\u201d Mr. Lockwood said. \u201cThe \u2018Affordable\u2019 Care Act, which has increased the cost of healthcare for my generation, is also killing our chances at future success here in Colorado. This is what Senator Mark Udall calls a \u2018success\u2019?\u201d\n\nA study released Tuesday by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University called the 30-hour cut-off \u201can explicit tax on full-time work\u201d and predicted a 3 percent drop in weekly per-person employment.\n\nRyan Huff, spokesman for CU Boulder, said only about 10 percent of students employed on campus would be affected by the change, given that most were already working less than 25 hours a week.\n\nHe said Obamcare was \u201ca catalyst to look at our student employment data, but not the sole reason we\u2019re making this move.\u201d Another motivation was to ensure that students\u2019 primary focus remains earning their degree.", "article_metadata": {"description": "College students overwhelmingly swung for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but they're now finding their on-campus work hours cut back, thanks to Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "College students overwhelmingly swung for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but they\u2019re now finding their on-campus work hours cut back, thanks to Obamacare.", "title": "CU Boulder becomes latest university to cut student work hours under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/9/cu-boulder-becomes-latest-university-to-cut-studen/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/12/ce81f12bec4581235f0f6a7067002027.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/12/ce81f12bec4581235f0f6a7067002027.jpg", "description": "College students overwhelmingly swung for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but they're now finding their on-campus work hours cut back, thanks to Obamacare.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "CU Boulder becomes latest university to cut student work hours under O"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Labor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e4d\"", "article_summary": "DENVER \u2014 College students overwhelmingly swung for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but they\u2019re now finding their on-campus work hours cut back, thanks to Obamacare.\nUnder Obamacare, employers must provide health insurance coverage to employees working 30 hours or more per week or face fines.\n\u201cAs if we needed more proof that Obamacare is dunking young people: CU Boulder has announced that it\u2019s cutting hours for student employees on campus,\u201d Mr. Lockwood said.\nCutting student work hours is increasingly becoming the standard at universities as they move to comply with the ACA\u2019s rules on insurance coverage, but students aren\u2019t the only ones affected.\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily maintains a running tally of businesses that have cut their employees\u2019 hours in response to Obamacare, a list that includes more than 100 colleges and universities."}
