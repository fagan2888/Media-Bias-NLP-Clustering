(AP) \u2014 Long after the last barge dredging toxins from the bottom of the upper Hudson River moves on, scientists will track the slow fade in contamination levels.\n\nGeneral Electric Co. expects this year to finish removing some 2.7 million cubic yards of contaminated river sediment \u2014 enough to fill two Empire State Buildings \u2014 under a Superfund agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency. After six years of digging, crews will have removed most of the PCBs on the river bottom discharged decades ago from two GE plants upriver.\n\nEPA officials say it\u2019s too early to tell how quickly PCB levels in the water and fish will drop in the coming decades. And they don\u2019t know precisely when it will be safe to eat fish caught along the 200-mile stretch down to New York City, a primary reason for the cleanup. But as calls intensify for additional dredging \u2014 which could speed the river\u2019s recovery \u2014 the agency says it is already seeing early signs of success.\n\n\u201cThe river is open for recreation. The challenge now is to assess the fish over time,\u201d said Gary Klawinski, the EPA\u2019s project director. \u201cOnce we get a better idea of at what rate \u2026 fish are recovering, we\u2019ll be able to lift those advisories with New York state.\u201d\n\nThe Hudson was a notoriously dirty river decades ago, littered with everything from old tires to sewage. Tighter environmental rules have helped revive the river, which even boasts some spots to swim along once-polluted beaches.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, there were old boat parts and cardboard and garbage,\u201d said Carlos Francisquini, fishing for striped bass recently along a quiet stretch of river at Kingston. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s nice down here. You can enjoy it again.\u201d\n\nBut fish and other wildlife are still tainted by PCBs discharged into the river until 1977 by GE\u2019s capacitor plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, considered a probable carcinogen, were used as coolants in electrical equipment. Advisories warning about the dangers of fish consumption span 200 miles of river, with warnings to eat no fish caught upriver.\n\nThe estimated $2 billion cleanup of PCB hot spots upriver will reduce the amount of contaminants flowing downriver. It\u2019s expected the warning to limit or avoid eating fish from the river will be lifted near New York City first, then closer to the source. When the EPA called for the dredging in 2002, it estimated it would take around a decade to meet early goals and more than 70 years to meet the hardest-to-attain goal of fish safe enough to eat once a week in the upper Hudson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Huge undertaking, dredging of Hudson for PCBs, nears its end", "title": "Huge undertaking, dredging of Hudson for PCBs, nears its end", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Huge undertaking, dredging of Hudson for PCBs, nears its end", "title": "Huge undertaking, dredging of Hudson for PCBs, nears its end", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/22/huge_undertaking_dredging_of_hudson_for_pcbs_nears_its_end/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/cleaning-the-hudson.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huge undertaking, dredging of Hudson for PCBs, nears its end", "title": "Huge undertaking, dredging of Hudson for PCBs, nears its end", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/cleaning-the-hudson.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Hill", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsWATERFORD, N.Y.
