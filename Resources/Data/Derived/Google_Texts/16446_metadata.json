Those numbers have changed in a big way since the beginning of the year, when CNN found that 51% of Americans favored ObamaCare.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the shift over time, as noted by CNN:\n\nThe most recent CNN poll also found a shift on President Obama\u2019s healthcare policy approval rating, with 54% now disapproving of his performance on the issue, up from 49% at the beginning of the year. Only 44% approval of his approach to healthcare, down from 50% in January.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at selected CNN polls on President Obama\u2019s healthcare approval rating. As you can see, he hasn\u2019t done well on the issue, despite his uptick in January 2013, which appears to be an outlier:\n\nWhile the poll does show that President Obama is struggling to win the narrative on his signature domestic policy achievement, there is some bad news for congressional Republicans. CNN found that 51% of Americans would hold the GOP responsible if the federal government was to shutdown. Only 33% would blame President Obama.\n\nCNN didn\u2019t present offer any indication that disagreements between Republicans and the White House ObamaCare, a law that 57% of Americans view unfavorably, would be the reason for a government shutdown.\n\nThat may somewhat bolster House Republican leadership\u2019s argument that a government shutdown over ObamaCare would be politically damaging to the GOP, as they try push a measure that would continue to fund the unpopular law.\n\nForty-one percent (41%) of Americans say the economy is the top issue facing the United States. Just 16% view healthcare as the biggest issue, followed by Syria (15%) and the federal budget deficit (13%).\n\nJust 43% approve of President Obama\u2019s handling of the economy, with 56% disapproving of his performance on the issue. An eye-popping 61% disapprove of his handling of the federal budget deficit. Those two numbers have stayed relatively the same over the last few CNN polls.\n\nJust a takeaway from this. Yes, Americans disapprove of President Obama\u2019s job performance on various issues as his agenda has continued to fail them. Yes, they oppose ObamaCare, even as the administration tries to shove it down their throats.\n\nBut opposition to President Obama\u2019s agenda isn\u2019t enough to sway voters. They already know that the policies of this White House and administration have failed them. Republicans have won that battle, as reflected in the polls. But they want actual solutions to these problems.\n\nWhile several pieces of legislation have been introduced to replace ObamaCare, House Republicans have yet to coalesce around one particular proposal on which they run in next year\u2019s mid-term elections. That\u2019s a big problem, and it doesn\u2019t appear as though it\u2019ll be going away any time soon.\n\nThere continues to be good news for Republicans in the polls. But what are they going to do about? That\u2019s the real question as we get close to what is shaping up to be a very big election year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Approval rating,Barack Obama,CNN,Congress,Defund ObamaCare,Economy,favorability,government shutdown,Healthcare,healthcare policy,healthcare reform,House Republicans,Obama", "description": "Support for ObamaCare has dropped below 40%, according to a poll conducted by CNN, even as the Obama Administration ramps up its efforts to promote the law before the state insurance exchanges launch at the beginning of October.
