The newspaper had chronicled Mr. Hughes\u2019 plans for at least two months. He also claimed responsibility for his act on his website, thedemocracyclub.org.\n\nThe mailman\u2019s aim Wednesday was to deliver to each of Congress\u2019 535 members a two-page letter outlining his demands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m demanding reform and declaring a voter\u2019s rebellion in a manner consistent with Jefferson\u2019s description of rights in the Declaration of Independence,\u201d Mr. Hughes said in his letters. \u201cAs a member of Congress, you have three options. 1. You may pretend corruption does not exist. 2. You may pretend to oppose corruption while you sabotage reform. 3. You may actively participate in real reform.\u201d\n\nAccording to several reports, federal authorities had been made aware of his protest plans, presumably by the pilot himself.\n\nIn a posting identifying himself and his mission on his website, Mr. Hughes said: \u201cLet me assure you, as I have informed the authorities, I have no violent inclinations or intent. An ultralight aircraft poses no major physical threat \u2014 it may present a political threat to graft. I hope so. There\u2019s no need to worry \u2014 I\u2019m just delivering the mail.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my regular route. I\u2019m a mailman in Riverview, FL \u2014 near Tampa. I\u2019m 61 years old, married, with four children. I flew with my father who was a private pilot, fixed wing and almost helicopter. I\u2019ve been flying gyrocopters for over a year.\u201d\n\nCapitol Police identified the aircraft, which landed about a half city block from the Capitol building, as a \u201cgyro copter with a single occupant,\u201d according to The Associated Press\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said the pilot landed on his own, but that had he made it much closer to the Capitol, authorities were prepared to shoot him down.\n\n\u201cHad it gotten any closer to the speaker\u2019s balcony they have long guns to take it down, but it didn\u2019t. It landed right in front,\u201d said Mr. McCaul, Texas Republican.\n\nWitnesses said the craft approached the Capitol from the west, flying low over the National Mall and the Capitol reflecting pool across the street from the building, the AP reported. It barely cleared a row of trees and a statue of Gen. Ulysses Grant.\n\nJohn Jewell, 72, a tourist from Statesville, North Carolina, said the craft landed hard and bounced. An officer was already there with a gun drawn.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get out until police officers told him to get out. He had his hands up\u201d\u2019 and was quickly led away by the police, Mr. Jewell said. \u201cThey snatched him pretty fast.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Bevins, a tourist from Atlanta, said she was standing across the street from the Capitol when the helicopter flew in around 20 or 30 feet high, and it \u201cjust sort of plopped down on the lawn.\u201d\n\nCapitol Police said they were taking every precaution as they investigated the incident, including deploying the bomb squad to examine the gyrocopter.\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pilot of a gyrocopter is in police custody after landing his single-seat aircraft on Capitol Hill following an unauthorized flight over restricted airspace.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The pilot of a gyrocopter is in police custody after landing his single-seat aircraft on Capitol Hill following an unauthorized flight over restricted airspace.", "title": "Gyrocopter lands on U.S. Capitol grounds; pilot in police custody", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/15/gyrocopter-lands-us-capitol-grounds/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/ce7ef97fe9b0c110730f6a706700637d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/ce7ef97fe9b0c110730f6a706700637d.jpg", "description": "The pilot of a gyrocopter is in police custody after landing his single-seat aircraft on Capitol Hill following an unauthorized flight over restricted airspace.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Gyrocopter lands on U.S. Capitol grounds; pilot in police custody"}, "Author": "S.A.
