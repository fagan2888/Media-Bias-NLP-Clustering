A baby gorilla born at the Oklahoma City Zoo a month ago is being sent to Cincinnati.

Kamina is a female Western lowland gorilla. She was born on Aug. 16, but her mother would not care for her, so zookeepers were hand-rearing the baby. The zoo worked with the Gorilla Species Survival Plan and determined that the best plan for Kamina was to send her to the Cincinnati Zoo.

Kamina will have a surrogate mother and will eventually have a gorilla family.

The Oklahoma City Zoo said Cincinnati has a stable family group of gorillas and Kamina will likely be raised with other young gorillas.
