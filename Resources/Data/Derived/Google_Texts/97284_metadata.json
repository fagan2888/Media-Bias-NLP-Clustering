Credit: Rebecca Gustaf\n\nA longtime University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center professor and nationally known innovator in community medicine and medical education, was one of 70 new members elected this week to the National Academy of Medicine.\n\nArthur Kaufman, MD, vice chancellor for community health at the UNM Health Sciences Center and distinguished professor of family and community medicine in the UNM School of Medicine, helped spearhead changes in medical training that have become the standard at medical schools worldwide. He also is a leader in a burgeoning movement to address the social determinants of health.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge honor,\u201d said Paul B. Roth, MD, UNM\u2019s chancellor for health sciences and dean of the School of Medicine. \u201cThere is no greater distinction for medicine. Dr. Kaufman has dedicated his entire career to this cause and allowed us to expand our vision in ways we never could have anticipated. Academic medicine is stronger because of his work.\u201d\n\nMembership in the organization is reserved for those who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and service, Academy president Victor J. Dzau, MD, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur newly elected members represent the brightest, most influential, and passionate people in health, science and medicine in our nation and internationally,\u201d Dzau said. \u201cThey are at the top of their fields and are committed to service. The expertise they bring to the organization will help us respond to today\u2019s most pressing health-related challenges and inform the future of health, science and medicine.\u201d\n\nKaufman\u2019s election came at the inaugural annual meeting as the National Academy of Medicine marked its formal transition from the Institute of Medicine, first established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine and related policy, working alongside the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering to provide independent analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions.\n\nKaufman has been a force on the UNM campus for more than 40 years as a clinician, professor, researcher, administrator, advocate and policymaker. A New York City native, Kaufman first came to New Mexico with the Indian Health Service. After finishing his residency in New York, he and his wife returned to the state in 1974, when Kaufman joined the UNM faculty.\n\nOver the next few years, he and several like-minded colleagues developed the medical school\u2019s landmark Primary Care Curriculum, which helped transform the way medical students are educated by giving them hands-on experience with patients at the outset of their training.\n\nKaufman also helped launch UNM\u2019s Department of Family and Community Medicine, placing medical students in clinical roles in any social setting they could identify as underserved \u2013 from local rock concerts to rural pueblos.\n\nMore recently, Kaufman instituted UNM\u2019s Health Extension Rural Offices program. Based on the agricultural extension model, it places agents throughout the state to serve as community liaisons with the UNM Health Sciences Center. This health extension model is now being disseminated in 18 states under Section 5405 of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nKaufman has also helped to spearhead the \u201cBeyond Flexner\u201d movement, a national effort to change how academic health centers address the social factors that affect health. So-called social determinants \u2013 poverty, limited education, poor access to healthy food, inadequate housing, lack of transportation and social marginalization \u2013 play a pivotal \u201cupstream\u201d role in health risks and outcomes.\n\nKaufman was instrumental in bringing Beyond Flexner to Albuquerque earlier this year, hosting a conference that drew representatives from 84 academic health centers, 70 health-related organizations, 12 international organizations and six federal agencies. Conference attendees strategized best practices, curricular innovations, diversity programs and new learning models to address communities\u2019 social determinants of health.\n\nKaufman has more than 70 publications and four books to his name on such topics as health care for uninsured and marginalized populations and problem-based and community-oriented teaching innovations.\n\nHe has received the Primary Care Award from the Association of American Medical Colleges and an achievement award from the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. He is also director of New Mexico\u2019s World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Innovative Health Workers Education Service and Research Models.\n\nKaufman\u2019s wife, Ellen, and their children Holly and Will are all physicians.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "UNM Health Sciences Center", "description": "Arthur Kaufman, MD, vice chancellor for community health at the UNM Health Sciences Center and distinguished professor of family and community medicine in the UNM School of Medicine, helped spearhead changes in medical training that have become the standard at medical schools worldwide.
