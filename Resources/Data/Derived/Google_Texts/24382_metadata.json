EPA v. EME Homer City Generation arises from the \u201cgood neighbor\u201d provision of the Clean Air Act. In that provision, Congress gave power to the EPA to reduce the emissions of states that \u201ccontribute significantly\u201d to the inability of states downwind of them to meet the law\u2019s standards for air quality. Connecticut, for example, has polluting neighbors: A congressional report found that even if Connecticut turned off every emissions source in the state, pollution from other states would make it fail the test set by federal ozone standards.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s \u201cgood neighbor\u201d regulations, which went into effect in August of 2011, have two steps. First, the agency determines whether an upwind state is responsible for at least 1 percent of any downwind state\u2019s allotted amount for a pollutant. Virtually every upwind state the EPA has studied falls into this category. Second, the EPA imposes on every one of these upwind states the same elaborate set of rules, with the goal of drastically reducing their total emissions.\n\nFourteen upwind states\u2014most prominently Texas\u2014have challenged this process (which is called the Transport Rule). They claim that the EPA exceeded the power Congress delegated to it. They\u2019re irked by the fact that all upwind states got the same federal regulations, whether they are a minor polluter or a major one. The states further object that the EPA imposed its rule without first giving each state the opportunity to develop its own regulations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn a 2\u20131 decision, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the states. They found that the Transport Rule exceeded the power Congress delegated to the EPA. They also said that in order to comply with the statute, the EPA can\u2019t implement its regulations until it has shown exactly how much pollution each upwind state contributes to its neighbors, and given each state a chance to develop its own regulations.\n\nOn the surface, this case is simply about interpreting statutory language. The D.C. Circuit reads the statute to empower the EPA to regulate only that portion of upwind state pollution that qualifies as a \u201csignificant contribution.\u201d The EPA reads the statute as giving it the power to regulate the total emissions of any upwind state.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute may be the more natural one. But in the past, the EPA\u2019s interpretation would probably have been close enough to win in court. Since a major Supreme Court ruling in 1984 (about the Clean Air Act, as it happens), the general rule for courts has been that if Congress writes a law that gives power to an agency, and some of the statute\u2019s language is ambiguous, judges defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. The idea is that the agency has all the expertise and experience. Take air quality measurements, for example. Contrary to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s implicit assumption, determining exactly how much each state is contributing to other states\u2019 pollution is borderline impossible. The pollution pattern for each state is a tangle of interconnected parts that change every day in unpredictable ways. Pinning down an exact contribution from each state is literally like chasing the wind.\n\nAlso, from a cost-benefit standpoint, the EPA\u2019s regulations make sense. The EPA is right to claim that the only way to effectively reduce pollution in downwind states is to reduce the collective emissions of all the upwind states. The agency also set its regulations at cost-effective levels that get the most pollution reduction for the money. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach would make it harder and more expensive to reduce pollution.\n\nThese practical considerations, however, seem to be beside the point for the D.C. Circuit. The court is second in prestige only to the Supreme Court, and wields special power in environmental law cases. Many are speculating that it is actively curtailing the power of the EPA by giving the agency less deference. The D.C. judges themselves have shown frustration at the way the agencies deal with congressional statutes. As Judge David Tatel quipped in a 2009 speech, many agencies promulgate regulations without giving the congressional statutes \u201cso much as a quick skim.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "That\u2019s the question in a case that will be argued on Tuesday.", "fb-share": "Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?", "sailthru.author": "Matt Mellema", "description": "The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case about what the Environmental Protection Agency can do to keep states from spewing pollutio ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case about what the Environmental Protection Agency can do to keep states from spewing pollutio ...", "title": "Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/supreme_court_and_the_epa_s_effort_to_curb_pollution_in_epa_v_eme_homer.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/supreme_court_and_the_epa_s_effort_to_curb_pollution_in_epa_v_eme_homer/96493421.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case about what the Environmental Protection Agency can do to keep states from spewing pollutio ...", "title": "Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/supreme_court_and_the_epa_s_effort_to_curb_pollution_in_epa_v_eme_homer.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/supreme_court_and_the_epa_s_effort_to_curb_pollution_in_epa_v_eme_homer/96493421.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-09T14:13:15Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?", "sailthru.headline": "Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/supreme_court_and_the_epa_s_effort_to_curb_pollution_in_epa_v_eme_homer.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/supreme_court_and_the_epa_s_effort_to_curb_pollution_in_epa_v_eme_homer/96493421.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100131209010\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-09T14:13:15Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Matt Mellema\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"supreme court\",\n    \"environmental regulation\",\n    \"pollution\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Will the Supreme Court Stop the EPA From Fighting Pollution State by State?", "keywords": "EPA, Clean Air Act, good neighbor provision, transport rule, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA v.
