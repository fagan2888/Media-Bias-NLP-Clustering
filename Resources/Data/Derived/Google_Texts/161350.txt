He’s still a ways away from playing but Nuggets rookie center Jusuf Nurkic was back out at shootaround on Monday morning, mostly a spectator as he continues to recover from a sprained right ankle.

“It was really cool to see Juka,” Nuggets interim head coach Melvin Hunt said. “Juka had his abbreviated plan, but he was out there. I just like the feel of him being with our group. I think the guys, they like the feel of him out there. They were razzing him, giving him a hard time. I think that’s good for the camaraderie for our entire group.”

Nurkic, who has missed six games with the sprain, is walking much better lately. There remains no timetable for his return.

Meanwhile, forward Darrell Arthur was a limited participant in shootaround due to a strained right calf. He’ll see how it feels pre-game before a final determination about his availability is made.
