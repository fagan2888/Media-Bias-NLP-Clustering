“The Daily Show” and “The Colbert Report” may be on spring break, but that doesn’t mean you have to miss your dose of political comedy. There are plenty of hilarious clips to watch and rewatch while awaiting their return.

Last week, for example, Samantha Bee (the longest serving “Daily Show” correspondent) found out that although the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare has been attacked more than 40 times in Congress, taxpayer money is going toward $360 penis pumps. Clearly restoring “the glory” of male erections is a more pressing medical matter than women’s reproductive health.

Tune in as Bee comically defends this absurd disparity and you’ll see that all those who speculate the gray-haired male dominated U.S. Congress has a “vested interest” in keeping these contraptions federally funded are clearly out of their minds.
