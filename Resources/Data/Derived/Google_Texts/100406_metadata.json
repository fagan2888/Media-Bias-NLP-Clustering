Employers in this category will need to offer coverage to 70 percent of full-time employees in 2015 and 95 percent in 2016 and later years, or they will be subject to tax penalties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s final regulations phase in the standards to ensure that larger employers either offer quality affordable coverage or make an employer responsibility payment starting in 2015,\u201d said Mark J. Mazur, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy. The purpose of the penalty, he said, is to help offset the cost to taxpayers of providing coverage or subsidies to people who cannot get affordable health insurance at work.\n\nUnder the law, employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees are generally exempt from the requirement to offer coverage.\n\nThe administration described the new policy as a form of \u201ctransition relief\u201d to help employers adjust to requirements of the 2010 health care law.\n\nBut congressional Republicans jumped on the delay as only the latest maneuver by the Obama administration to sidestep the health care law\u2019s legal requirements for political gain. Republicans denounced the unilateral move as a violation of the law and called on the White House to throw out all of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage mandates.\n\n\u201cThe White House seems to have a new exemption from its failed law for a different group each month,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who is in a competitive race himself. \u201cIt\u2019s time to extend that exemption to families and individuals \u2014 not just businesses.\u201d\n\nBut the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, praised the White House, saying the final rules showed \u201cthe administration\u2019s commitment to smoothly implement the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nComing on the heels of a government analysis of the law\u2019s impact on the work force, the delay is likely to breathe new life into the Republican effort to make the health care law the central issue in the coming midterm elections. Several lines of attack, which started with the disastrous rollout of the Healthcare.gov website in October and shifted to a wave of insurance cancellation notices in November, have largely run their course as the website\u2019s problems came under control and canceled policies were replaced.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the president is rewriting law on a whim,\u201d said Speaker John A. Boehner. \u201cIf the administration doesn\u2019t believe employers can manage the burden of the law, how can struggling families be expected to?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat theme was echoed by many Republicans, who say it is unfair for the White House to grant a dispensation to employers but not to individuals and families. Democrats see the individual mandate as more important to the operation of the law.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut lawmakers from both parties have raised questions about unilateral actions by the president to waive or delay various provisions of the law. J. Mark Iwry, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for health policy, said the administration had broad \u201cauthority to grant transition relief\u201d under a section of the Internal Revenue Code that directs the Treasury secretary to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement\u201d of tax obligations. This authority has often been used to postpone the application of new laws that would cause \u201cunreasonable administrative burdens or costs\u201d to taxpayers, Mr. Iwry said.\n\nUnder the law, larger employers may be subject to tax penalties if they do not offer \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d to employees who work at least 30 hours a week, on average.\n\nLarger companies have, for many years, been more likely to offer coverage than smaller ones.\n\nThe Treasury said that companies with 50 to 99 employees accounted for 7 percent of the private sector work force, while businesses with 100 or more workers accounted for 66 percent. Most companies with 100 or more employees already offer health benefits to at least some of their workers. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees account for nearly 28 percent of private sector employees, but 96 percent of all private employers, the Treasury said.\n\nPaul M. Hamburger, a lawyer who advises employers at the Proskauer law firm, said: \u201cThe bottom line is that Obamacare is not going away. The administration is providing another one-year delay, until 2016, for some employers. But they have to take the law seriously and figure out ways to comply. The administration did not provide the relief sought by employers in some high-turnover industries like restaurants and retail.\u201d\n\nIn response to concerns expressed by lawmakers from both parties, the administration said that local government agencies would generally not have to provide health insurance to \u201cbona fide volunteers\u201d who work as firefighters or emergency medical technicians.\n\nThe administration said it was still trying to figure out how to count the hours worked by certain types of employees, including part-time college instructors who are paid for teaching a certain number of classes or courses. Until guidance is issued, Treasury officials said, colleges may assume that such \u201cadjunct faculty\u201d members spend 75 minutes a week outside the classroom, preparing lectures or grading examinations, for each hour teaching in the classroom.\n\nFederal officials said they were also providing some relief to employers of seasonal employees. Those who normally work a half-year or less will generally not be considered full-time employees, the administration said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140210170530, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration announced that it would again delay the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to employees, giving medium-size companies extra time to comply.", "title": "Further Delays for Employers in Health Law", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/politics/health-insurance-enforcement-delayed-again-for-some-employers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002701810"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/jp-HEALTH-1/jp-HEALTH-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/politics/health-insurance-enforcement-delayed-again-for-some-employers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002701810", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/politics/health-insurance-enforcement-delayed-again-for-some-employers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Further Delays for Employers in Health Law", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 10, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Obama  Barack,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Obama administration announced that it would again delay the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to employees, giving medium-size companies extra time to comply.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/jp-HEALTH-1/jp-HEALTH-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration announced that it would again delay the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to employees, giving medium-size companies extra time to comply.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-02-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2014-02-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "11health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140211115344, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/us/politics/health-insurance-enforcement-delayed-again-for-some-employers.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/jp-HEALTH-1/jp-HEALTH-1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration announced that it would again delay the mandate for employers to provide health insurance to employees, giving medium-size companies extra time to comply.", "title": "Further Delays for Employers in Health Law"}, "pdate": 20140210, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002701810, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Further Delays for Employers in Health Law", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/us/jp-HEALTH-1/jp-HEALTH-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd176d\"", "article_summary": "Under the law, employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees are generally exempt from the requirement to offer coverage.\nThe administration described the new policy as a form of \u201ctransition relief\u201d to help employers adjust to requirements of the 2010 health care law.\nMost companies with 100 or more employees already offer health benefits to at least some of their workers.\nLarger companies have, for many years, been more likely to offer coverage than smaller ones.\nIn addition, the administration said the requirement would be put into effect gradually for employers with 100 or more employees."}
