Begrudgingly, the Painesville, Ohio, pastor signed up for health insurance under the federal exchange when he decided he couldn\u2019t afford private options.\n\nMcCurdy told TheBlaze he began the process in October and completed it on Dec. 23 \u2014 or so he thought. It turns out, only he and his wife are currently insured, not his four children, due to a snafu that appears to have originated on the federal end.\n\nMcCurdy explained that as he was applying \u2014 over the phone he said because the website wasn\u2019t working \u2014 he was told he couldn\u2019t sign his children up for insurance on his plan because they might be covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cI was assured a letter would come,\u201d McCurdy said. That letter would advise him on what to do.\n\nBut no instruction came.\n\n\u201cMy kids lost insurance on Jan 1. They have no insurance and there\u2019s no direction on how they can follow and get insurance yet,\u201d McCurdy, still waiting for the letter, said.\n\nHe said he contacted the state\u2019s health insurance department and the Medicaid department, neither of which could provide any information about what he should do.\n\n\u201cI am furious and frustrated,\u201d he told TheBlaze.\n\nBut reports that emerged over the weekend might have pinpointed where things went wrong for McCurdy.\n\n\u201cThey have no insurance and there\u2019s no direction\u2026 .\u201d Share:\n\nA few days before Jan. 1 and into the New Year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were calling individuals who, through the federal exchange application, indicated they might be eligible for Medicaid. The applications had not yet been passed onto the states.\n\n\u201cWe have not received a single application,\u201d Sam Rossi, communications director for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cOhioans who applied for health care benefits on the federal website (www.Healthcare.gov) but were denied because that system determined they might be eligible for Ohio Medicaid instead were notified by the federal government that an application was forwarded on their behalf to Ohio to determine Medicaid eligibility,\u201d a fact sheet from the state about the issue explained. \u201cHowever, because of glitches in Healthcare.gov, the federal government did not transfer those applications to the State.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the widespread issue goes back to software not transferring applications to states as it should.\n\nAs a result, the feds were calling households, not just in Ohio, advising them to sign up for Medicaid through their respective states.\n\n\u201cIn order to get enrolled more quickly, we recommend that you contact your state to complete the state\u2019s application,\u201d the call said, according to the Plain Dealer.\n\n\u201cWe have been reaching out to consumers to let them know the steps they need to take to complete their enrollment and begin coverage,\u201d Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services emailed TheBlaze in a statement. \u201dIf consumers have any questions as to whether they are enrolled in Medicaid or [Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)] or how to use their coverage, they should contact their state Medicaid or CHIP agency.\u201d\n\nSome states have taken informing people into their own hands. Here\u2019s more on those efforts from the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cIt would be ideal if we didn\u2019t have to go through this,\u201d said Jeremiah Samples, assistant secretary of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The department is mailing letters to 10,000 residents indicated by federal records as eligible for coverage under a Medicaid expansion, telling them to apply through a state Medicaid Web site. \u201cFor our consumers,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen the system doesn\u2019t work for them, it just adds unease.\u201d The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare has assembled a team of five workers to send letters to 6,000 people identified through federal records, urging them to submit applications to the state, spokesman Thomas Shanahan said. Agency officials and their mail contractor worked on New Year\u2019s Day to prepare the materials so they could be sent first thing Thursday morning, he added. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for the federal health exchange, has been making calls to those same households.\n\nOverall, White House senior communications adviser Tara McGuinness told the Post that this issue should only impact a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of people who have signed up through the federal exchange.\n\nFor now, McCurdy told TheBlaze he an his wife are \u201creluctantly applying through our local Jobs and Family Services office for the Medicaid for the kids.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Peter McCurdy was informed months ago that his HSA insurance would no longer be allowed under the Affordable Care Act.
