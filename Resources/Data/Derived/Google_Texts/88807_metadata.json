Trey Gowdy promised his party is \u201cgoing to respond\u201d to President Obama\u2019s pledge to use executive orders to work around congressional opposition, saying they would use the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d to cut funding for the White House\u2019s pet projects.\n\nGowdy spoke with Fox News\u2019 Jeanine Pirro about the president\u2019s use of executive orders to change and delay parts of Obamacare and otherwise change legislation without congressional input. The congressman expressed an unwillingness to wait around for judges to rule in Congress\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cWe have appropriations bills that are going to be coming through the House this spring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe oughta strip money away from this executive branch, because our Framers gave us that exclusive right to do so. If one branch overreaches, then maybe the other branch ought to stick up for itself!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. President, you want to run roughshod over the Constitution? We have the power of the purse. We\u2019re not gonna fund your pet projects!\u201d he said later. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna fund your green energy initiatives! We\u2019re not gonna fund your vacations!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a host of my colleagues that are not just going to sit around and mope and cry because this president overreaches,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019re going to respond! And we\u2019re going to respond in the appropriations process.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
