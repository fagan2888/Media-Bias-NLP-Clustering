Here's the opening:\n\nSuffer the little children: When they\u2019re not busy organizing rainbow parties, butt-chugging beer, home-brewing jenkem (look it up, preferably on an empty stomach), or dropping LSD and staring into the sun until they go blind, they are devising far-more pedestrian ways to freak out their parents.\n\nThe latest social panic related to the kids these days involves them \u2013 wait for it \u2013 experimenting with a safer alternative to smoking tobacco. What kind of monsters are we raising, exactly?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that over the past couple of years the percentage of middle- and high-school students who have ever tried electronic cigarettes has doubled.
