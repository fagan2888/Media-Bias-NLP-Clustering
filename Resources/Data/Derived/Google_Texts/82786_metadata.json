He also wants to vote on the GOP\u2019s final budget resolution Thursday, although negotiators from the House and Senate have yet to announce a final deal.\n\nCongress has struggled in recent years to complete the annual appropriations process, relying on short-term spending resolutions instead, so Republican leaders want to get a head start on the 12 spending bills that must wind through the committee process before hitting the floor.\n\n\u201cThis is why you start earlier,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said, boasting that lawmakers are starting the appropriations process earlier than any Congress since 1974.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, is already accusing Republicans of shutting Democrats out of the process.\n\n\u201cRepublican majorities in the House and Senate haven\u2019t even bothered to make a show of finding bipartisan consensus,\u201d he said Tuesday, referring to negotiations over the non-binding budget. \u201cAny meetings they\u2019ve had with Democrats have been strictly \u2018pro forma,\u2019 without any real input from the other side.\u201d\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, left the door open last week to a type of bipartisan deal that Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, struck in late 2013 to avert a government shutdown and ease the sequester limits on defense and domestic programs.\n\nMr. McCarthy, though, said the caps \u201cwill hold\u201d and that his party is trying to balance the budget while staying within mandatory constraints.\n\n\u201cI just assume that Democrats will abide by what current law is,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Republicans will not try to lift \"sequester\" limits during the annual spending process because the caps are written into law and they view President Obama as an uncooperative negotiator.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Republicans will not try to lift \u201csequester\u201d limits during the annual spending process because the caps are written into law and they view President Obama as an uncooperative negotiator.", "title": "Kevin McCarthy: Obama\u2019s demands would ruin attempt to lift sequester", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/28/kevin-mccarthy-obamas-demands-would-ruin-attempt-l/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/13/4_132015_ap872225495258201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/13/4_132015_ap872225495258201.jpg", "title": "Kevin McCarthy: Obama\u2019s demands would ruin attempt to lift seque", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Republicans will not try to lift \"sequester\" limits during the annual spending process because the caps are written into law and they view Presid", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Kevin Mccarthy, House, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff71\"", "article_summary": "Mr. McCarthy, though, said the caps \u201cwill hold\u201d and that his party is trying to balance the budget while staying within mandatory constraints.\n\u201cThis is why you start earlier,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said, boasting that lawmakers are starting the appropriations process earlier than any Congress since 1974.\nBut Mr. McCarthy said the House will begin Wednesday to consider the pair of fiscal 2016 bills that have made it through the Appropriations Committee.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Republicans will not try to lift \u201csequester\u201d limits during the annual spending process because the caps are written into law and they view President Obama as an uncooperative negotiator.\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, is already accusing Republicans of shutting Democrats out of the process."}
