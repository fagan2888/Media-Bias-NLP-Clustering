The nuns have fought a long battle against the healthcare law, and the videos highlight Obamacare\u2019s sticky situation, which the nuns say is forcing them to violate their consciences.\n\nHobby Lobby won a Supreme Court case last year that allowed businesses to opt-out of providing certain contraceptives for religious reasons. The Obama administration hoped to appease religious groups by allowing them to sign a form agreeing to provide the care without having to pay for it. The nuns, however, took issue with this and sued. Now their case is before the Supreme Court.\n\nReligious groups say the exemption still keeps them involved in providing contraception. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), they say, protects them from having to violate their consciences by providing contraception. RFRA law states that there must be a compelling government interest for violating religious beliefs and that it must be done in the least restrictive way possible, a tough burden for the government to prove.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Little Sisters of the Poor is to, as our foundress St. Jeanne Jugan showed to us, is to really care for everyone with great love and respect,\u201d Veronica Susan says in her video. \u201cOur work is to uphold the value of human life, the dignity of every human person.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nSister Georgia:\n\nSister Veronica:\n\n\n\nSister Cornelia:\n\nSister Constance:\n\n\n\nSister Loretto:\n\nSister Therese Marie:\n\nSister Christian Maria:\n\nSister Mary Jamina:\n\nSister Lily:\n\nSend tips to [email protected].
