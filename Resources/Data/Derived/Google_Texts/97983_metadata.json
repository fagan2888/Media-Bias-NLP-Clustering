It is a low-key campaign, but most people greet her by name in this small agricultural town where she grew up.\n\n\u201cI have faith in you,\u201d she says to one man. \u201cYou do not need to ask,\u201d he replies. \u201cWe are with you.\u201d\n\nMrs. Brahmi, 47, a mother of five, is campaigning in Tunisia\u2019s parliamentary election Sunday for the seat of her husband, Mohamed Brahmi, the left-wing politician whose assassination by an Islamist extremist group last year sent Tunisia into a political crisis. Despite her initial reluctance to enter public life, she has emerged unexpectedly from his shadow as a fearless political campaigner in her own right.\n\nShe has proved a scathing critic of Ennahda, the party that led the government at the time of her husband\u2019s death, accusing it of leniency toward Islamist extremists and of failing to act when warned of threats against Mr. Brahmi \u2014 as well as complicity in his assassination. Ennahda has denied any involvement, but she remains unconvinced.\n\nLike her husband, she is a Muslim, but believes in a separation of politics and religion and opposes political Islam. She has excoriated extremists, including a neighboring preacher in Ben Aoun, for importing Wahhabi fundamentalism from Saudi Arabia and radicalizing scores of young Tunisians, leading them toward violence and insurgency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet she is unlike most of Tunisia\u2019s secularists, who are often westernized urban sophisticates. She is a salt-of-the-earth peasant, who leans over a donkey to talk to a farmer, and weeps as a traditional storyteller in the market recites a poem lauding the bravery of her husband.\n\n\u201cHer father was also a militant,\u201d who fought for independence against the French colonial power, said Hssine Abidi Abdili, an elderly man who greeted her in the market.\n\nBoth she and her husband are from Sidi bou Zid, the birthplace of the popular uprising that overthrew President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring. They were both involved in underground politics for years under the rule of Mr. Ben Ali, supporting strikes and discussing politics for hours at the home of her brother, Khaled Aouainia, a human rights lawyer and political activist in Sidi bou Zid. \u201cThat was our daily bread,\u201d she recalls.\n\nShe is representing the Popular Front, the left-wing political alliance that Mr. Brahmi helped form after the revolution. It was hit by two political assassinations last year. Its popular leader, Chokri Belaid, was assassinated in February, and Mr. Brahmi five months later. The police later found the same extremist group used the same gun for both murders.\n\n\u201cI wanted to continue the message of all the martyrs of the Popular Front, especially of my husband,\u201d Mrs. Brahmi said. \u201cI also believe in the role of women in the political process. Women are capable of being leaders. We were in the revolution and in the protests against the government last year.\u201d\n\nThe revolution was driven by poverty and the sense of marginalization in the regions, she said. \u201cThis region is especially deprived,\u201d she went on. \u201cWe have villages that are completely primitive. The resources for normal life do not exist. There is no water even and without water they cannot do anything.\u201d Her job would be to compel the government to meet its obligations, in particular digging deeper wells, she said.\n\nShe sits on the floor of her brother\u2019s home, resting swollen ankles and an aching back after a day of campaigning, but makes a face when asked why she does not just stay at home with her children, including an 11-year-old who has autism.\n\n\u201cI am not doing it for me, because it is a burden,\u201d she says. \u201cDefinitely in my heart I am against it. I am doing it for Mohamed, my husband, and for the people of Tunisia and especially of Sidi bou Zid.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141025193305, "twitter": {"description": "Mbarka Brahmi is campaigning for the seat of her husband, Mohamed Brahmi, the left-wing politician whose assassination by an Islamist extremist group last year sent Tunisia into a crisis.", "creator": "carlottagall", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/world/africa/assassination-in-tunisia-draws-mbarka-brahmi-into-politics.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003197617"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Assassination in Tunisia Draws Spouse Into Politics", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/world/middleeast/26TUNISIA/26TUNISIA-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/world/africa/assassination-in-tunisia-draws-mbarka-brahmi-into-politics.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003197617", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/world/africa/assassination-in-tunisia-draws-mbarka-brahmi-into-politics.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/africa", "hdl_p": "Assassination in Tunisia Draws Spouse Into Politics", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/africa/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Tunisia,Brahmi  Mbarka,Assassinations and Attempted Assassinations,Brahmi  Mohamed,Elections", "description": "Mbarka Brahmi is campaigning for the seat of her husband, Mohamed Brahmi, the left-wing politician whose assassination by an Islamist extremist group last year sent Tunisia into a crisis.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Carlotta Gall", "SCG": "africa", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Brahmi, Mohamed", "slug": "26tunisia", "byl": "By CARLOTTA GALL", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Mbarka Brahmi is campaigning for the seat of her husband, Mohamed Brahmi, the left-wing politician whose assassination by an Islamist extremist group last year sent Tunisia into a crisis.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/world/middleeast/26TUNISIA/26TUNISIA-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Tunisia,Election", "CG": "world", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 25, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/carlotta_gall/index.html", "section": "Africa", "modified": "2014-10-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/africa/index.jsonp", "tag": "Elections", "published": "2014-10-25", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Tunisia", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141030134549, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/world/africa/assassination-in-tunisia-draws-mbarka-brahmi-into-politics.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/world/middleeast/26TUNISIA/26TUNISIA-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mbarka Brahmi is campaigning for the seat of her husband, Mohamed Brahmi, the left-wing politician whose assassination by an Islamist extremist group last year sent Tunisia into a crisis.", "title": "Assassination in Tunisia Draws Spouse Into Politics"}, "pdate": 20141025, "des": "Elections", "articleid": 100000003197617, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Assassination in Tunisia Draws Spouse Into Politics", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/world/middleeast/26TUNISIA/26TUNISIA-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13b0\"", "article_summary": "I am doing it for Mohamed, my husband, and for the people of Tunisia and especially of Sidi bou Zid.\u201d\nLike her husband, she is a Muslim, but believes in a separation of politics and religion and opposes political Islam.\nShe is representing the Popular Front, the left-wing political alliance that Mr. Brahmi helped form after the revolution.\nIts popular leader, Chokri Belaid, was assassinated in February, and Mr. Brahmi five months later.\n\u201cI wanted to continue the message of all the martyrs of the Popular Front, especially of my husband,\u201d Mrs. Brahmi said."}
