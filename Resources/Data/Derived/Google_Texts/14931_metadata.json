The day came; I wore leggings and a dress from the Limited sale rack \u2014 too big for me, but they were clothes that made me feel grown-up. I don\u2019t remember the first part of the afternoon, just that it was sunny, not quite cold, and that my best friend was there with another boy. We sat on hay bales while the boys compared their basketball shoes, and discussed the strangely competitive church basketball league with the swagger of barely pubescent boys whose universe was a small tobacco town. I admired them with the devotion of a pale-haired, barely pubescent girl whose universe was a small tobacco town.\n\nSoon the youth minister \u2014 we\u2019ll call him Steve \u2014 gathered the young people into a dim room in a farmhouse. We sat cross-legged on a harsh rug, half-reverent and overly aware of whom we were sitting next to. I was already starting to sniffle from the hay.\n\n\u201cI want you to close your eyes,\u201d he said. Steve was skinny and his eyes brimmed with passion that made me uncomfortable. The rumor was that Steve wore a hairpiece \u2014 it was a curly hairpiece \u2014 and I was afraid of him, so I did exactly what I was told. He loomed over us. We bowed our heads.\n\n\u201cI want you to raise your hand if you\u2019ve accepted Jesus Christ into your life.\u201d\n\nNow as much as I like doing as I\u2019m told, I also like being honest, and I was working these gray and murky things out for myself, so I didn\u2019t raise my hand. I was unsure, between camps.\n\nApparently I was the only one.\n\nSteve waved the group out toward the hayride, but pointed to me. \u201cMegan \u2014 is that your name?\u201d he said. \u201cCan you stay here with me?\u201d\n\nGulp.\n\nLesson learned: If you choose the wrong moment to express your beliefs, or your lack of clear beliefs, you\u2019re the one who has to sit on the bench next to the youth minister with the hairpiece while your friends go on a hayride. He calls your beloved, but apparently inferior, minister \u201cBrother so and so.\u201d And then he tells you that you\u2019re headed down the wrong path, a dark and restless path, and because you\u2019re in eighth grade and afraid of dark and restless paths and his curly hairpiece and his hand on your leg, you cry \u2014 and can\u2019t stop crying until you get home to your mom. And then your boyfriend realizes that although you masquerade as a goody-two-shoes ballerina, you have a darker soul than he expected, and, although this is in fact true, you don\u2019t want anyone to know it.\n\nCover blown.\n\nFast-forward 20 years and we\u2019re nearly all armchair activists with fewer mysteries, our beliefs and passions often neatly aligned with Facebook likes, pages and categories. We have no shortage of platforms for our polemics and positions. And if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re proud to identify with your ideological heroes and causes. If my friends know I like Wham!, Hillary Clinton and heritage chicken breeds, fine. If you\u2019re anything like me, a small percentage of your social media feed provides anthropological insight into how the \u201cenemy\u201d thinks, and you read their posts with intrigue, knowing they probably dismiss your heartfelt think-posts with the same eye-roll. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re also prone to ill-timed bouts of righteousness.\n\nJust the other week my friends showed me a picture of themselves standing arm-in-arm on an unnaturally green golf course, a picture someone had captioned \u201cspending time in nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cA golf course isn\u2019t nature!\u201d I spat, my vitriol catching them \u2014 and me \u2014 unaware. \u201cGolf courses are saturated in biocides!\u201d\n\nI instantly knew I\u2019d chosen a weird moment to take a stand, and worse than that, I\u2019d taken a shrill and ineffective stand. I hadn\u2019t changed anyone\u2019s mind about pesticides, I\u2019d simply offended people I care about \u2014 at no net gain.\n\nI bump up against this decision point all the time. To speak up or stay quiet? Take, for example, the weddings I\u2019ve been to where the language clearly implies a submissive marriage contract, subservient wifedom. I seethe and hyperventilate and dig my fingers into my husband\u2019s leg, but I know it\u2019s not the moment to climb the banquet table and quote \u201cThe Second Sex.\u201d Or is it?\n\nThere\u2019s the neighbor liberally spraying Monsanto Round-up products across his lawn. A friend going on about delicious foie gras, or another ordering unsustainably caught fish like cod at dinner. There\u2019s the vocal climate change denier in the general store, gregariously holding forth on global warming as a hoax as he tops off his coffee.\n\nOr my family, sitting at the dinner table. Someone has gotten takeout, a Styrofoam container of chicken wings, and orange-hued oil is collecting underneath the waxy-looking, non-organic, non-humanely sourced wings. And my two toddlers want to eat them. They look to me for permission. I grit my teeth and nod. Sure. Yes. OK.\n\nThey see delicious, steaming-hot chicken and I see cheap, abused bird carcass shot through with antibiotics, a dead bird sourced from a factory farm. I\u2019m watching my beautiful children suck the last bits of greasy chicken off of bones and they love it. They L-O-V-E it. They\u2019re blissed out and I\u2019m picking restlessly at my salad, thinking about air pollution, bacteria and animal cruelty. I\u2019m biting my tongue and everyone around me knows why.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes you need to take a stand with kids, friends and even Facebook friends.
