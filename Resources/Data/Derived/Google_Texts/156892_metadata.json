Russell Gold, the senior energy reporter for the Wall Street Journal, has done the math: He found that since 2000, wells have been drilled within a mile of at least 15.3 million Americans \u2014 more people than live in New York City. Economically, of course, it affects even more of us than that \u2014 fracking technology is allowing the U.S. to get an extraordinary amount of natural gas and even oil out of the ground, enough so that by 2020, and perhaps even sooner, America could become the world\u2019s largest oil producer. The name of Gold\u2019s new book sums that up succinctly: it\u2019s called \u201cThe Boom.\u201d\n\nBut as we know, the advantages come at a heavy price \u2014 what Russell describes as a Pandora\u2019s box of consequences both to the people living near those wells while the oil and gas is being extracted, and to the climate. The most disconcerting part of all that is how little we understand those impacts, and how quickly, despite that, we\u2019re continuing to drill: 100 wells a day, every day. Gold contends that it\u2019s unrealistic to stop fracking, but says it\u2019s vital that we slow down and hold the industry accountable \u2014 and not let up on them for an instant.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou start off the book as a reporter having to make a decision about fracking that\u2019s going to have an immediate impact on your family: Chesapeake Energy called your parents and offered them $400,000 plus royalties to drill for natural gas under their property in Pennsylvania. How did that personal angle affect the way you approached the issue?\n\nI think it actually helped me be a better reporter. Sometimes, as a reporter, you can see things on a very 3,000-foot level. You see it as a very abstract issue. And by having to think about this as a personal issue, affecting land that I grew up in and around, made me really see these issues in just finer detail, made me really think and feel it more. And then I would go back to reporting for the Journal, I think it just made me a better reporter.\n\nEven before I got the phone call, I visited my first fracking job in 2003, back before we even called it fracking. We would just talk about the industry, about unconventional gas back then. So I had the experience by the time other people really started talking about fracking, it was a little bit of a head-scratcher because what people were saying didn\u2019t really dovetail with what I had seen, in visiting communities and reporting on this the previous five years. One of the reasons I wanted to write the book is that this polarized dialogue that came out just didn\u2019t really seem to reflect reality as I\u2019d seen it.\n\nIn the book, you make the effort to dispel some of the fictions about fracking coming from both sides. What are the most pervasive myths you\u2019ve encountered?\n\nLet me highlight a couple. One is that, when it comes to this future of energy, you either have to be pro-fossil fuel or pro-renewable \u2014 there\u2019s no middle ground, you have to make a choice. That\u2019s just not true. The people I know who are thinking a lot about the future of energy see a world where the only way we can get to 30 or 40 percent renewables is by using lots of gas from fracking. The two can go together. So that\u2019s one myth, that you either have to be for renewables or for fossil fuels; there\u2019s not a way to bring them together.\n\nThe other myth that I would highlight is that fracking itself \u2014 the act of cracking rocks 7,000 feet deep \u2014 poses a threat to groundwater. That\u2019s not true. Well construction, sure, that could pose a risk, but not fracking itself.\n\nAnd that has to do with newer methods of fracking compared to how it was done before. There are a lot of mixed messages about how old fracking is \u2014 the industry just celebrated its 65th birthday \u2026\n\nI actually take a very different approach to that, because that\u2019s also become very polarized and politicized. How old is fracking? The industry wants to say it\u2019s very old, to try to calm everyone down, to say, \u201cLook, this is not new, we know what we\u2019re doing. And people who are opposed to fracking want to say this is newfangled and we don\u2019t know the risks yet.\n\nMy approach is that modern fracking started in the summer of 1998, and what I mean by that is, lots of water, lots of pumping pressure into shale. That\u2019s the breakthrough of 1998. And so, that\u2019s relatively new. That\u2019s less than 15 years old.\n\nThe industry has been fracking \u2014 has been pumping water mixed with some chemicals into formations \u2014 since just after World War II, since 1947. That\u2019s probably where the 65th anniversary comes from. I actually date it back even further: If you look at what\u2019s called the torpedoes that were used and put into wells, right at the beginning of the petroleum age in the 1860s and early 1870s in Western Pennsylvania, the purpose of those torpedoes was to create fractures. It says right in the original pact, they were to create fractures in the rock to try to drain the oil out better. So in some ways this has been going on since the first wells were drilled.\n\nBut is what\u2019s going on now at all comparable to that?\n\nWell, OK, that\u2019s a good question. What is going on now is not comparable to what began in the 1860s and \u201970s. I bring that up to suggest that this effort by the industry, to break open the rocks, to crack open rocks, is very old. If you look at what was developed in the 1940s, what they call the hydrofrac treatment, that is comparable. It\u2019s the same idea, you\u2019re pumping water thickened with chemicals into a formation, and that was used quite a lot in relatively porous rocks: sandstone, for instance.\n\nWhat happens in the 1990s is that it\u2019s applied to shale, to these very dense rock formations. And the reason that\u2019s so important and revolutionary is that shale is where oil and gas come from. It\u2019s the sedimentary rock which, under lots of pressure and time and heat, bakes the tiny little zooplanktons into fossil fuel, it\u2019s what creates it. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much oil and gas in these rocks. And the ability in the 1990s, and into the 2000s, to get into the rocks and get the oil and gas out, that\u2019s really the turning point, and that\u2019s why we have an energy boom right now.\n\nRight, and that\u2019s what\u2019s having this huge economic impact.\n\nAbsolutely. Economic impact, impact on our societies, impact on our environment, everything. It\u2019s having a very large impact in many places in the United States.\n\nWhat about the impact on a local scale? When you\u2019re going into communities where the drilling is occurring, you have the benefits of increased job creation, or people receiving money from signing over their land rights, compared to the negative impacts drilling might have. What\u2019s the sort of thing that you see when you go to these places?\n\nOne of the things that I see a lot, the number one complaint that I hear isn\u2019t air, isn\u2019t water \u2014 it\u2019s trucks. People don\u2019t like all these trucks on their roads driving around. You hear that all the time. Some variation of the story: \u201cWell I used to be able to drive the 10 miles from here to my job and I\u2019d see maybe a couple different cars, and I knew who was driving them, and now it\u2019s jammed with trucks.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s true. I mean I\u2019ve been to very rural places in South Texas and turned a corner and seen a line of trucks. It\u2019s rather remarkable. The local community impact is significant. When the industry is getting in there, and building the frack pads and drilling the wells, there\u2019s no question it has a major impact. After the drilling is over, the impact lessens. And that\u2019s sometimes what people forget. That the really intensive period doesn\u2019t last that long. Now we have some really important, outstanding questions about what are some of the long-term impacts on the water and on the air. And those questions are being asked, and to an extent answered, right now.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to that idea of natural gas as a bridge fuel. I think one of the things that\u2019s really important \u2014 and that you acknowledge \u2014 is that we just don\u2019t have a lot of information about the impact it\u2019s having, on the environmental level and on the climate. And you know the big argument against the bridge fuel idea is that natural gas is, if not just as bad for the climate as oil because of methane leaks and that sort of thing, bad enough that the climate at this point can\u2019t handle it. How do you respond to that?\n\nWell, the issue of methane leakage is absolutely crucial. And I think it\u2019s too bad that we\u2019re 10 years-plus into this boom, and we\u2019re only now really starting to ask really difficult questions about methane leakage. It really would have been great if we had had the foresight to do that five years ago.\n\nThere\u2019s no question \u2014 and there have been many peer reviewed scientific papers \u2014 that the industry as a whole needs to cut down on the leaks. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas. It simply cannot be allowed to leak out in the amounts that it is right now.\n\nThe good news is that, even if at the current amounts of leakage, even at the high ends of what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s still better than coal in terms of its impact on the climate. And there\u2019s a lot of low hanging fruit, there\u2019s a lot of relatively easy plumbing that can be done to fix those leaks. It\u2019s just now starting. We\u2019re seeing some real interesting moves in places like Colorado to try to detect and shut down leaks. This is one of those areas where I think the industry regulators and the community needs to be very vigilant, it\u2019s a really important area.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WSJ reporter Russell Gold says fracking's many problems are fixable -- if the proper steps are taken", "title": "Don\u2019t frack this up!
