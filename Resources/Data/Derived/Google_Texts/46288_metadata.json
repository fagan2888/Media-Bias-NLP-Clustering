The statewide average precipitation for May was 7.73 inches, which was 188 percent of the normal rate.\n\nThe National Climate Prediction Center has indicated this summer \u2014 which begins Sunday \u2014 has an increased chance to be wetter than normal, too.\n\nRueschhoff, who works at the KDWPT Region 2 office, adjacent to Kaw River State Park on the south bank of the Kansas River in west Topeka, said deer and other animals may move to higher ground to escape wet areas, but they also will return once the land dries. Likewise, heavy rain and flooding may destroy nests of grassland birds, such as quail and wild turkey, but the birds have the ability to re-nest later.\n\nAnd, he added, what may be negative for one species of wildlife may be a positive for another: An abundance of rain benefits habitats that attract amphibians and migrating waterfowl and serves as breeding grounds for insects.\n\n\u201cWe assume with more standing water, we would have more mosquitoes,\u201d he said.\n\nSlithering concern\n\nIn addition to taking measures to guard against mosquito bites, people living in Kansas and Missouri might want to be on the lookout for snakes.\n\nStephen Thornton, medical director of The University of Kansas Hospital Poison Control Center in Kansas City, Kan., said in a video posted on YouTube that venomous snake bites are on the rise because the reptiles are moving from their natural habitats in search of drier ground.\n\n\u201cIn Kansas and Missouri, we have what we call pit vipers \u2014 the rattlesnakes, copperheads and cottonmouths further south,\u201d Thornton said, adding the venom from those snakes can cause tissue destruction, pain and swelling.\n\nA common myth, he said, is that many people die from snake bites in the United States.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we have very few deaths nationwide. Probably most of them are related to allergic reactions to the snake venom itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America if you\u2019re bitten and you see a physician, you\u2019re more than likely going to be OK.\u201d\n\nSnakes bites are treated with antivenom, which can be expensive and difficult to find at smaller hospitals. The University of Kansas Hospital is a Snake Bite Center, which means antivenom is available and doctors and nurses are trained to handle snake bites.\n\n\u201cOnce bitten, the best thing to do is stay calm. \u2026 Most of the ways snake bites are made worse are by people trying to do stuff before they get to the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nThornton warned against cutting the skin at the site of the snake bite or trying to suck the venom out of the wound. If bitten on the arm, it can be placed in a sling or immobilized in some other way, but a tourniquet shouldn\u2019t be placed around the arm. Ice or warm compresses shouldn\u2019t be applied to the snake bite area.\n\nSnake bites need to be checked out by a physician who can determine whether the individual was bitten by a poisonous snake and if treatment with antivenom is warranted. Thornton said about 25 percent of the people bitten by a venomous snake aren\u2019t injected with venom.\n\n\u201cSo their bites aren\u2019t any worse than a bite from a water snake,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother threat\n\nJeff Bender, region supervisor at the KDWPT Region 2 office, said the effect of increased rainfall on animals isn\u2019t as worrisome to him as the invasion of some plant species on habitats, such as bush honeysuckle at the 76-acre Kaw River State Park, which has hiking and biking trails that wind through an oak-hickory forest.\n\nGreater moisture boosts the growth of such plants.\n\n\u201cHoneysuckle is more of a problem in the long term, more of a threat,\u201d Bender said. \u201cHoneysuckle can do long-term damage to the forest and can displace the native species. Without control, we will have a honeysuckle forest instead of native hardwood trees and shrubs.\u201d\n\nHoneysuckle can\u2019t be eradicated by simply cutting back the thicket, he said. A combination of cutting and herbicide application is most effective.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Jan Biles, Brad Rueschhoff, Jeff Bender, Stephen Thornton", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "It has been raining more than usual this spring, causing water to spill over the banks of some ponds, rivers, streams and lakes in Kansas. \r\nBut the state's wildlife seems to be adapting pretty well to the extra moisture.", "title": "Wildlife adapting to increased rainfall", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-06-20/wildlife-adapting-increased-rainfall", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14491931.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "It has been raining more than usual this spring, causing water to spill over the banks of some ponds, rivers, streams and lakes in Kansas.But the state\u2019s wildlife seems to be adapting pretty well to the extra moisture.\u201cFloods and droughts are natural, and wildlife has a way of adapting,\u201d said Brad Rueschhoff, district wildlife biologist with the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFloods and droughts are natural, and wildlife has a way of adapting,\u201d said Brad Rueschhoff, district wildlife biologist with the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism.\nA common myth, he said, is that many people die from snake bites in the United States.\nProbably most of them are related to allergic reactions to the snake venom itself,\u201d he said.\n\u2026 Most of the ways snake bites are made worse are by people trying to do stuff before they get to the hospital,\u201d he said.\nThe University of Kansas Hospital is a Snake Bite Center, which means antivenom is available and doctors and nurses are trained to handle snake bites."}
