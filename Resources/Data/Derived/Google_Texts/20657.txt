PE-Backed Schutt Sports Grabs Rest of Adams USA

Schutt bought Adams' football helmet business in 2011

Schutt Sports has picked up the rest of Adams USA after purchasing the company's football helmet and faceguard assets in 2011. The new deal includes Cookeville, Tennessee-based AdamsÂ’s Trace, Bolco, Neumann and Bucks brands. Terms were not disclosed.

Schutt, headquartered in Litchfield, Illinois, is backed by Los Angeles private equity firm Platinum Equity, which bought the company in December 2010. The football helmet division acquisition was Schutt's first purchase after it received Platinum's backing. The company also makes sports protective gear and is the official base supplier for Major League Baseball.

The firm's other investments include Volvo Rents, the rental equipment business of Volvo Group. In December, Platinum sold Nesco, a provider of electrical-utility equipment, to Energy Capital Partners LLC.

Other recent sporting equipment deals include Kent International Inc.'s acquisition of Stoneridge Cycle Ltd. and Altamont Capital's investment in skate brand Huf Worldwide Inc.
