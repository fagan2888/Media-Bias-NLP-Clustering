The stands are packed.\u201d\n\nA Friday night auction of ribbon-winning steers, lambs, hogs and goats that were raised by 4-H and Future Farmers of America youngsters ranging in age from 9 to 18 set a stock show record, with total sales of $412,000.\n\nA standing room only crowd watched as the Grand Champion Steer, which weighed in at 1,344 pounds, sold for $117,000, the second-highest bid in stock show history.\n\nA majority of the winning bid at the Junior Livestock Auction goes directly to the exhibitor, and 10 percent of the bid proceeds are funneled into the National Western Scholarship Trust, which funds scholarships in agriculture and rural medicine at colleges in Colorado and Wyoming.\n\nSavannah Messenger, 17, drove a team of two Perche rons, draft horses that weigh about 1 ton each, to take first place in the junior cart class.\n\nMessenger has been competing in the show since she was 7, she said. \u201cI like the tradition of it and the excitement. There is nothing not to like about it,\u201d she said.\n\nJason Levy brought his daughter Sophia, 2, to the show for the first time this year. Sophia was captivated by a bright green tractor, and she smiled as she turned the wheel and grabbed levers.\n\n\u201cShe loves heavy equipment,\u201d Jason Levy said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Stock show pulls in crowd of 675,000 plus", "title": "Stock show pulls in crowd of 675,000 plus", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/24/stock-show-pulls-in-crowd-of-675000-plus/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160124__Stock_Show_crowdp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160124__Stock_Show_crowdp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-24T15:32:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:27:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "National Western Stock Show"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5aa6\"", "article_summary": "After four visits to the National Western Stock Show this year, Kathy Phillips could pick out small details.\nA standing room only crowd watched as the Grand Champion Steer, which weighed in at 1,344 pounds, sold for $117,000, the second-highest bid in stock show history.\nClifford, who has sold his Clifford\u2019s Critter Creations at the National Western for the past 26 years, sold the unicorn, a mounted horse head with an artificial narwhal tusk, last week, he said.\nSophia was captivated by a bright green tractor, and she smiled as she turned the wheel and grabbed levers.\nThe 2016 show, which ended Sunday, has been his best year for sales yet, he said."}
