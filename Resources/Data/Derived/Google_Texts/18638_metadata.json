But she noted that the individual marketplace is in flux, due partly to people changing jobs or shifting to group or government plans throughout the year.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we'll have the second-biggest market share after this round of open enrollment,\u201d Land of Lincoln President Jason Montrie said.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 As Illinois Obamacare sign-ups jump 60%, top exec heads for exit\n\n\u2022 A look at dire Obamacare predictions that haven't panned out\n\n\u2022 Obamacare enrollment erroneously inflated\n\n\u2022 State figuring out how to better market Obamacare next year\n\nA special enrollment period ends April 30 for people who weren't aware of the tax penalty for not being insured.\n\nLand of Lincoln estimates that so far this year, it has enrolled about 42,000 of nearly 350,000 total consumers on the exchange. It also has retained more than 80 percent of last year's enrollees. In 2014, Land of Lincoln captured just 2 percent of sign-ups on the exchange.\n\nLand of Lincoln also has enrolled an additional 5,000 small businesses and 1,600 large businesses so far this year, the majority of them off the exchange.\n\nFORCES OF CHANGE\n\nSo what changed?\n\nLand of Lincoln slashed premiums up to 30 percent by creating new plans with Chicago and suburban hospitals that offer deeper discounts. Some of the largest hospital networks in the state, including Downers Grove-based Advocate Health Care and Chicago-based Presence Health, are participating.\n\nThere also are more insurers competing for business this year on the state exchange, Get Covered Illinois, and more plans for consumers and small businesses to choose from. Last year, six carriers sold a combined 165 plans. This year, eight companies are offering more than 400 plans.\n\nOf those who chose a Land of Lincoln plan on the exchange this year, 45 percent are 35 or younger. The so-called young invincibles, people ages 18-34, are considered vital to balancing out the sicker, older and likely more expensive people buying exchange plans.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many first-year enrollees moved to a Land of Lincoln plan in the second year of the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "timeCrawled": "20160526_08:32:32", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150325/NEWS03/150329899/AR/0/AR-150329899.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare Illinois health insurance plan picks up 1 in 4 new enrollees"}, "published_at": "2015-3-25", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150329899", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "title": "Obamacare Illinois health insurance plan picks up 1 in 4 new enrollees", "taxo_People": "Barack Obama", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150325/NEWS03/150329899/AR/0/AR-150329899.jpg", "taxo_Areas": "Downers Grove", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Presence Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "taxo_Sections": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Land of Lincoln Health is capturing a quarter of new enrollees during its second year in the marketplace.
