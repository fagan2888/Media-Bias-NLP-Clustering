Jezebel blogger Erin Gloria Ryan has really distinguished herself for making pro-aborts sound like churlish, ignorant juveniles, but in her latest outburst against those who don\u2019t want compulsory contraception coverage, she\u2019s somehow managed to sink the bar even lower.\n\nThe following paragraph manages to pack in so much wrongness that it really deserves a line-by-line breakdown:\n\nHobby Lobby, a store that sells cheap crap for people to hot glue together as an outlet for their long-ago suffocated creative impulses [\u2026]\n\nBelittling people who enjoy arts and crafts out of the blue: a sure sign of maturity. Or projection; the two kind of blur together after reading Jezebel for too long.\n\n[\u2026] is owned by a conservative Christian family who believes \u2014 against scientific evidence \u2014 that Plan B and IUD\u2019s cause abortions [\u2026]\n\nActually, as Matthew Franck explains at National Review, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling in this case acknowledged that \u201cthere is an ongoing medical debate as to whether some contraceptive methods relevant to this case act by preventing implantation or fertilization,\u201d and that the European Medicines Agency classifies the mandate-covered drug Ella as \u201cembryotoxic at low doses.\u201d Plan B\u2019s own packaging admits that it can function by preventing \u201cattachment of a fertilized egg to the uterus (implantation).\u201d Most damningly, researchers on Ryan\u2019s own side have been caught selling completely contradictory messages about Plan B\u2019s post-fertilization effect, depending on whether they want to convince us it\u2019s safe or convince funders it\u2019s effective.\n\n[\u2026] (they also believe, again contrary to what is provable by science, that life begins at conception because SPERM ARE MAGIC).\n\nWow. With one sentence, Ryan has denied a scientific fact nowhere near as contentious as the abortive potential of contraceptives \u2013 and, with three little caps-locked words, just might have invented a refrain even less intellectually defensible than 9/11 Truthers\u2019 \u201cfire can\u2019t melt steel.\u201d Have you cracked open a biology textbook, Erin \u2013 ever?\n\nThey also believe that the Constitution protects their right to use their secular corporation as an instrument of their religious faith, [\u2026]\n\nUh, that\u2019s because it does. \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d The only religious beliefs the First Amendment doesn\u2019t protect are those that exercise coercive force against another, like witch-burning. Short of that, though, any private organization in this country can be as religious as its owners want. It\u2019s Hobby Lobby\u2019s corporation. It\u2019s their money. Taking a job with them is a choice that entitles someone only to whatever terms he agreed to when taking the job.\n\n[\u2026] and that their specific chosen belief structure grants them the inalienable right to interfere with their employees\u2019 health care choices as mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey\u2019re only \u201cinterfering\u201d in the sense that this is an area of their employees\u2019 lives that they don\u2019t want involvement in. And \u201cmandated by the Affordable Care Act\u201d doesn\u2019t change the equation, since the law is itself an egregious, multi-pronged violation of the Constitution.\n\nOpponents of the birth control mandate harp on the fact that they don\u2019t wish to subsidize a person\u2019s lifestyle choice about which they disapprove, but here are some lifestyle choices that hyper religious self-proclaimed \u201cpro life\u201d business owners have no problem subsidizing: war, a cruel and racist for-profit prison system, an immigration enforcement system that shatters families, the death penalty, etc etc etc. Why is it only worth going to court over if it involves a woman having sex without suffering \u201cconsequences\u201d?\n\nFor this to be a serious point, Ryan would have to show not only that her caricatures of conservative positions are at least in the neighborhood of accurate, but that Hobby Lobby was actually subsidizing them in some way. But that would have been way too much work.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that a bit of pro-abortion sophistry shoots so far past bad that I actually feel a little sorry for its author, but Ryan has managed it. The striking thing about her characteristic immaturity, falsehoods, and laziness is that it\u2019s hard to see why the powers that be at Gawker Media would keep wasting money on content that doesn\u2019t do pro-aborts\u2019 image or arguments any favors.\n\nThe most likely answer is that the cause isn\u2019t actually their prime goal. In 2010, Emily Gould wrote a Slate piece making the case that Jezebel is little more than a racket \u201cexploiting women\u2019s worst tendencies\u201d to \u201cgenerat[e] the traffic that enables the site to sell ad space\u201d:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "3 Like3 Tweet0 +10Just when you think someone\u2019s hit rock-bottom, she manages to dig a little deeper.
