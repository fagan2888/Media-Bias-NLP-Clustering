Sir Patrick Stewart, Aaron Paul, Al Roker and others are starring in a documentary about (and made by) Twitter, which is premiering at the Cannes Lions advertising festival this year, according to Mashable.

By the looks of the trailer (below) the documentary is in essence an extended advertisement about Twitter. (After all, it is intended for Cannes Lions, an advertising festival.)

The clip begins with Sir Patrick Stewart explaining a recent viral meme that stemmed from Rob Delaney and himself. “Well, it exploded,” Stewart explains. “I think there is a hunger for this in-the-moment excitement.” This seems to be the basic theme of the documentary, how Twitter has made everything from news to comedy to arts and culture quicker and more widespread.
