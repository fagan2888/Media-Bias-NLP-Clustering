Blum, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly sparked outrage this week by insisting that Jesus and Santa Claus are both white, saying it's \"ridiculous\" to argue that depicting Christ and St. Nick as Caucasian is \"racist.\"\n\n\"And by the way, for all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,\" Kelly said, \"but this person is arguing that we should also have a black Santa.\"\n\nKelly was responding to an article in Slate that said St. Nick needs a makeover from fat, old white guy to something less \"melanin-deficient.\"\n\nThe Fox News host would have none of it.\n\n\"Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change,\" Kelly said. \"Jesus was a white man, too. It's like we have, he's a historical figure; that's a verifiable fact. As is Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy, in the story, and change Santa from white to black?\"\n\nArguing about St. Nick, who was originally Greek before Currier & Ives got their hands on him, is one thing. But as for Jesus, people have been arguing about his skin color since the earliest days of American history. You might even call it an American tradition.\n\nWhat's new about this latest brouhaha is how swiftly Kelly\u2019s remarks were attacked. Thousands of people have rebuked her through blogs, articles, Twitter posts and Facebook updates.\n\nComedian Jon Stewart accused Kelly of \"going full Christmas nog.\"\n\n\u201cAnd who are you actually talking to?\" Stewart said on \"The Daily Show.\" \"Children who are sophisticated enough to be watching a news channel at 10 o\u2019clock at night, yet innocent enough to still believe Santa Claus is real \u2014 yet racist enough to be freaked out if he isn\u2019t white?\u201d\n\nIt seems that now, if you want to call Christ \u2014 or even Santa \u2014 white, you should expect a fierce fight.\n\nThe immediate and widespread rebuttal showcases how much America has changed over the past few decades. The nation not only has a black president, but also has refused to endorse the Christian savior as white.\n\nSince the earliest days of America, Jesus was thought of as a white man.\n\nWhen white Protestant missionaries brought Bibles and whitened images of Jesus to Native Americans, at least a few mocked what they saw.\n\nTaking the imagery seriously, the Shawnee warrior Tecumseh asked future President William Henry Harrison, \u201cHow can we have confidence in the white people? When Jesus Christ came upon the earth you kill\u2019d and nail\u2019d him on a cross.\u201d\n\nIt was not until around 1900 that a group of white Americans explicitly claimed Jesus was white.\n\nConcerned that large numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, especially Jewish immigrants, were \u201cpolluting\u201d the nation, anti-immigrant spokesmen like attorney Madison Grant asserted the whiteness of Jesus to justify calls for exclusionary legislation.\n\nREAD MORE: From science and computers, a new face of Jesus\n\nMaking Jesus white was a means to distance him from Judaism.\n\n\u201cIn depicting the crucifixion no artist hesitates to make the two thieves brunet in contrast to the blond Savior,\u201d Grant wrote in his xenophobic best-seller \"The Passing of the Great Race.\"\n\n\u201cThis is something more than a convention,\u201d Grant continued, and suggested that Jesus had \u201cNordic, possibly Greek, physical and moral attributes.\u201d\n\nEven Martin Luther King Jr. claimed that Jesus was white, after being asked why God created Jesus as a white man.\n\nKing responded that the color of Christ\u2019s skin didn\u2019t matter. Jesus would have been just as important \u201cif His skin had been black.\u201d He \u201cis no less significant because His skin was white.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Turkish town cashes in on Saint Nick legacy\n\nChallenges to Christ\u2019s whiteness have a long history, too.\n\nFamed evangelist Billy Graham preached in the 1950s, and then wrote emphatically in his autobiography \"Just As I Am,\" that, \u201cJesus was not a white man.\u201d\n\nBut Graham was far from the first American to contradict the whiteness of Jesus. That honor goes to Methodist and Pequot Indian William Apess.\n\nIn 1833, he wrote to white Christians, \u201cYou know as well as I that you are not indebted to a principle beneath a white skin for your religious services but to a colored one.\u201d\n\nAlmost 100 years later, the Jamaican born, \u201cback-to-Africa\u201d spokesman Marcus Garvey told his followers, \u201cNever admit that Jesus Christ was a white man, otherwise he could not be the Son of God and God to redeem all mankind. Jesus Christ had the blood of all races in his veins.\u201d\n\nIn our age, the color of Christ has become both politically dangerous and the butt of jokes.\n\nIn 2008, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright\u2019s words \u201cGod damn America\u201d and \u201cJesus was a poor black boy\u201d almost derailed then-Sen. Barack Obama from winning the Democratic primary.\n\nNow, Kelly bears the brunt of attacks and, in no surprise, was pilloried by comedians like Stewart and Stephen Colbert.\n\nFew Americans went on public record against King when he asserted Jesus had white skin in the 1950s. Today, thousands upon thousands from virtually every race and tribe of Americans have taken Kelly\u2019s words seriously and seriously disdained them.\n\nAll the chatter about Jesus being white (or not) shows how much America has changed. There used to be \u201cwhites\u2019 only\u201d restaurants and schoolrooms. Now, even Jesus cannot be called white without repercussions.\n\nWhat the debate hides, however, is what Jesus of the Bible actually did and how he related to people.\n\nThe gospels are full of discussions about Jesus and bodies. He healed the blind and those who suffered from disease. He touched and was touched by the sick. His body was pierced by thorns, a spear and nails. And he died.\n\nREAD MORE: What all those Jesus jokes tell us\n\nThe phenotype of Jesus was never an issue in the Bible. Neither Matthew, nor Mark, nor Luke, nor John mentioned Christ\u2019s skin tone or hair color. None called him white or black or red or brown.\n\nObsessions about race are obsessions of our age, not the biblical one. When asked what mattered most, Jesus did not say his skin tone or body shape. He instructed his followers to \u201clove the Lord your God with all your heart\u201d and to \u201cdo unto others as you would have done unto you.\u201d\n\nMaybe this Christmas season, we can reflect not so much on whether or not Jesus was white and instead consider what it meant for him to be called the \u201clight\u201d of the world.\n\n\n\nEdward J.
