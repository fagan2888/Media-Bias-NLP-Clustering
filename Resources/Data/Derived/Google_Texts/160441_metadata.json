The third Friday count will take place on Sept. 18.\n\n\u201cThat is vital in our calculation of our upcoming budget amount,\u201d O\u2019Toole said.\n\nThe actual tax levy will be approved at the Oct. 26 school board meeting.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s approved tonight is with what information we have up to date at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year student enrollment increased by 10 students to 1,391. That is down from 1,457 in 2010. O\u2019Toole said the district is anticipating student enrollment to remain level this year, but the district had enrolled several new students over the last few days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of anxious to see what our numbers are going to look like this year,\u201d O\u2019Toole said.\n\nO\u2019Toole said the final equalized aids won\u2019t be known until October. He said it has risen the past couple years by one or two percent. The district used an estimate of no increase in aid.\n\nThe proposed expenditures for the general fund for 2015-16 includes a 3.6 percent decrease. Last year expenditures increased 3.3 percent.\n\n\u201cThe reason we expended more than what we had in revenues had to do with some initiatives that we did from fund balance,\u201d O\u2019 Toole said. \u201cWe had some significant technology [expenditures], roofing projects from fund balance that actually increased our expenditures above the revenues for the 2014-15 year.\u201d\n\nThe expenditure budget is down from the 2013-14 budget, O\u2019 Toole said. \u201cWe are being somewhat frugal with things.\u201d\n\nState aid as a percentage of total revenue for the district is down from 67 percent in 2006-07 to less than 58 percent in 2015-16, O\u2019 Toole said.\n\nThe levy to pay off the debt of building the high school will be paid off in 2021-22, O\u2019 Tool said.\n\nHe added that the district anticipates the school levy will remain steady at 11.41, based on the current information the district has. Of that amount, $7.40 of the mill rate is for the general fund.\n\nO\u2019Toole shared a couple of tax examples based on owning a $75,000 property and a $150,000 property. This was based on just the general fund and the debt service funds.\n\nFor a $75,000 property, O\u2019 Toole said the overall tax impact would decrease from $799 last year to $787 in 2015-16.\n\nFor a $150,000 property, O\u2019 Toole said the overall tax impact would decrease from $1,598 last year to $1,574 in 2015-16.\n\n\u201cWe have worked pretty hard to find solutions to budget woes, to trim the budget,\u201d O\u2019 Toole said. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019ve done well to tighten our belts and maintain programs. You don\u2019t hear a program being eliminated we have going on in school. We still allow students to choose what courses they want to take in high school. That\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d\n\nO\u2019 Toole said healthcare reform is one of the strains on the budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working through some of the initial impact of the ACA (Affordable Care Act) law, some of the restrictions that we\u2019ll have there,\u201d O\u2019 Toole said. \u201cWe have to monitor all that.\u201d\n\nOverall, he said the Clintonville School District is in a \u201cpretty good financial situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to look far to find districts that are in trouble,\u201d O\u2019 Toole said.\n\nDuring the district\u2019s annual meeting later that night, the proposed budget was approved.\n\nHuber\u2019s statement\n\nDuring the district\u2019s annual meeting, School Board President Ben Huber addressed those in attendance.\n\nHuber thanked those in attendance as he said it is important for the community to be involved with the district.\n\n\u201cI would like to encourage those of you here tonight and all in our community to help improve our education system,\u201d Huber said.\n\nRegarding education, Huber said, \u201cThink globally, but act locally.\u201d\n\nHe cited Finland and South Korea as countries that typically rank near the top in education, while the United States is usually ranked in the teens.\n\nHe said children in South Korea go to school six, sometimes seven days a week.\n\n\u201cHomework is given at a very young age, and a lot of it is given,\u201d Huber said. \u201cKids are often working 90 hours-plus per week on schoolwork. Effort is more important than inherited giftedness.\u201d\n\nHuber said Finland uses a different strategy.\n\nHe said children in Finland attend school five days a week. Classes take up three to five hours per day. Extracurricular activities are encouraged. There is no assigned homework, and students have plenty of free time to pursue their own interests.\n\nHe said the reason both countries rank high in education despite different philosophies is because \u201cboth make education of their children a priority and both have very high respect for the people who are the educators.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to do those things locally as well,\u201d Huber said. \u201cIt is important to keep education in the forefront of our community discussions, and in our thinking about how we raise our children.\u201d\n\nHe said the district should continue to strive to be better and take steps in the direction it feels is right.\n\nHe said educators can have the biggest impact on improving education in the district.\n\n\u201cA small thing would be to smile more,\u201d Huber said. \u201cMake sure you interact with children and show an interest in their life. Show children your passion. Be positive because that is contagious. No one feels great everyday but if you smile when you don\u2019t feel much like smiling your attitude improves and so does the attitude of those who interact with you.\u201d\n\nHuber said members of the community need to do the same thing.\n\nHe encouraged everyone to attend school events.\n\n\u201cOur school is not perfect, there are things we can do to make it better, but we need to have a community effort to help improve our schools,\u201d Huber said.\n\nAnnual meeting\n\nSeveral resolutions were passed during the annual meeting, many relating to the proposed budget.\n\nIt was also passed that board members would continue to receive $90 for each regular and special meeting attended, and $50 for each in-service meeting attended. In addition, officers will receive an additional $250 annually and members of the negotiation Committee will each receive $300 annually. Committee and Finance Committee members will receive $20 per meeting, but no more than one paid meeting per month.\n\nPrincipals from each building in the district also shared the happenings from their building over the past year. Administrators in the district also shared what happened over the last year in their area of responsibility.\n\nRegular meeting\n\nDuring the regular school board meeting held immediately prior to the budget hearing and annual meeting, the board acted on several personnel moves.\n\nIt unanimously approved the resignation of Amanda Baxter as an eighth grade teacher, effective immediately. Board member Judy Magee was absent from the regular meeting.\n\nIt unanimously approved hiring Ellie Kanke to a fifth grade teaching position, effective with the 2015-16 school year.\n\nIt unanimously approved hour modifications for Denise Gunderson (Para I \u2013 bus rider), Patricia Wichman (Para I) and Martha Dethardt (Para I).\n\nThe board also discussed the CLC after-school program.\n\nO\u2019 Toole said the district has decided to use the name Trucker U to incorporate the before and after school activities for all students in the district.\n\nThe board was informed by O\u2019 Toole that the district has received approval and notification of the CLC grant for $50,000.\n\nThe district is in the process of recruiting staff to participate in the program.\n\nTrucker U would start around Oct. 1. The program would be Monday through Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Your source for local news!", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Waupaca County Post", "description": "O\u2019Toole said Fund 10 (general fund) and Funds 38 and 39 (de ...", "title": "School tax levy to remain stable", "url": "http://www.waupacanow.com/2015/08/27/school-tax-levy-to-remain-stable/", "image": "http://waupacanow.multimediachanne.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CN-CL-AnnualMeeting-150824-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 739856589457315}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "More information coming in OctoberBy Bert LehmanClinotnville School Superintendent Tom O\u2019 Toole presented a budget at the district\u2019s budget hearing that would keep the school tax levy stable.\nThe actual tax levy will be approved at the Oct. 26 school board meeting.\nRegular meetingDuring the regular school board meeting held immediately prior to the budget hearing and annual meeting, the board acted on several personnel moves.\nHe added that the district anticipates the school levy will remain steady at 11.41, based on the current information the district has.\nHuber\u2019s statementDuring the district\u2019s annual meeting, School Board President Ben Huber addressed those in attendance."}
