But what if you grew up without hands? What if you couldn\u2019t climb the monkey bars or hold a pencil or cut your own food with a fork and knife? Until now, you\u2019d be out of luck. But doctors have proven that hands aren\u2019t as irreplaceable as we once thought they were.\n\nIn a world's first, a child has received a double hand transplant. That\u2019s right; not just one hand, but both.\n\nEight-year-old Zion Harvey has had a pretty rough life thus far. At age 2, a life-threatening bloodstream infection led to both his hands and feet being amputated. It also destroyed his kidneys. At 4 years old, he got a transplant from his mom, Pattie Ray. But at age 6, his mom found out about Shriner\u2019s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, which specializes in caring for kids like Zion that have prosthetics on their limbs. She also learned of a radical new procedure at the University of Pennsylvania that would give her son the hands he\u2019d lost.\n\nOnly about 60 people worldwide have undergone upper extremity transplant surgery since 1998, including Penn\u2019s first case, a young woman in 2011. But no child has received a single hand transplant, let alone both. \"The doctor at Shriner's thought Zion would be a perfect candidate,\" Ray told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Zion was a suitable candidate because he was already taking antirejection drugs for his kidney transplant. These would help his body handle the newly attached hands as well.\n\nThe attachment of hands to arms that they didn't initially grow on is called complex composite tissue transplants. Doctors first have to attach blood vessels, then bones, then nerves, muscles and skin. What made the surgery even more complicated than usual was the fact that they were performing on an 8-year-old boy instead of a 38-year-old man.\n\nOn July 6, Zion and a team of 12 surgeons underwent an 11-hour procedure, which saw the team splitting up into four separate groups, all with their own priorities and responsibilities. Steel plates and screws secured the hands to Zion\u2019s forearms, while the arteries and veins were sewn together with string thinner than human hair. In the documentary below, you can see the moment blood begins to flow into Zion\u2019s new hands.\n\nZion now faces months of rehab, and it'll take up to two years for him gain feeling in his new hands. However, there has never been a more suitable boy for the task. So far, he has held a book, scratched his face, and shook hands.\n\n\"His maturity is way beyond his age, as is his insight and sensitivity,\" transplant team leader L. Scott Levin told the Inquirer. \"He's brilliant, not just smart. And his stoicism has been remarkable. I've never seen him cry, complain of pain, or be withdrawn.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hand transplant world first university of penn", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In a world first, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania have successfully transplanted two hands onto an 8-year-old boy.", "title": "Boy Becomes World's First Pediatric Double-Hand Transplant Recipient", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/8-year-old-boy-philly-becomes-worlds-first-pediatric-patient-get-double-hand-345072", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/zion.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a world first, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania have successfully transplanted two hands onto an 8-year-old boy.", "title": "Boy Becomes World's First Pediatric Double-Hand Transplant Recipient", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/8-year-old-boy-philly-becomes-worlds-first-pediatric-patient-get-double-hand-345072", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/zion.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/zion.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-07-28T18:48:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T18:48:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a world first, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania have successfully transplanted two hands onto an 8-year-old boy."}, "article_summary": "In a world's first, a child has received a double hand transplant.\nOnly about 60 people worldwide have undergone upper extremity transplant surgery since 1998, including Penn\u2019s first case, a young woman in 2011.\nBut no child has received a single hand transplant, let alone both.\n\"His maturity is way beyond his age, as is his insight and sensitivity,\" transplant team leader L.
