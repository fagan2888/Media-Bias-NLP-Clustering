After $7 million in profits in 2014 (its first year of operation), it lost $31 million in 2015 and has budgeted to lose at least $43 million in 2016. To address the losses, it initiated $11 million in administrative cuts, including rolling back part of the executive pay increases authorized after 2014\u2019s profitable year.\n\nMaine\u2019s Division of Insurance had reached an agreement with Community Health Options to place the nonprofit cooperative into receivership and help it restructure. However, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rejected the plan because it included terminating as many as 17,000 policies\u201415 to 20 percent of policies currently in force\u2014violating the ACA\u2019s \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d provisions that protect people with insurance from having their coverage terminated.\n\nCommunity Health Options\u2019 problems stem, in part, from a key aspect of its success\u2014selling more policies to people who need them. Unfortunately for the insurance cooperative, many of the newly insured needed more covered health services than expected, so premiums paid did not cover the costs of services. NPQ discussed similar issues of pricing insurance and \u201cadverse selection\u201d in the failure of Utah\u2019s insurance cooperative.\n\nEric Cioppa, Maine\u2019s insurance superintendent, is frustrated by the federal action but is continuing to work with CMS and Community Health Options to find a way to address losses while maintaining coverage.\n\nAlthough not specifically mentioned in Maine\u2019s case, one potential source of relief may be the class action lawsuit filed by Oregon\u2019s cooperative, Health Republic Insurance Company.\n\nWhether through litigation or other remedies, Cioppa has a valid point when he wrote in a letter to federal officials: \u201cBecause CMS\u2019s decision has precluded my ability to act as proposed, CMS now must share responsibility for the risk of an outcome we all very much hope to avoid.\u201d\n\nIn the worst-case scenario where Community Health Options\u2019 \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d status and attempts to restructure fail, can CMS force an insolvent insurer to continue operating? If so, whose money would pay claims? If CMS attempts to force Maine\u2019s state government to make good on policies and payments, expect more lawsuits and strife.\u2014Michael Wyland", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine\u2019s health insurance co-op is losing money at an accelerating pace.
