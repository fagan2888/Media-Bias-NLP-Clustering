The EOB will be full of codes and abbreviations, intended to explain what is being paid, and why some or all of the claim was rejected. Most insurance companies provide a key to help you understand the codes on your EOB, but that doesn\u2019t always answer every question you\u2019ll have.\n\nMost EOBs also include a customer service number so you can ask those questions. It\u2019s best to go into that conversation well-prepared, so we\u2019ve rounded up five common reasons your insurance company might deny your claim.\n\n1. Noncovered charges\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the procedure you had wasn\u2019t covered by your health insurance policy, even if it seems to you like it should have been. Look again at the terms of your policy, because some plans don\u2019t cover certain categories of care, such as infertility treatments or dental surgery. If you think you\u2019ll need care in the future that\u2019s excluded from your current policy, you may want to shop for a new policy.\n\n2. Referral or pre-authorization required\n\nProcedures like CT scans or MRIs usually require pre-authorization, which your doctor should request on your behalf. Sometimes the procedure provider will turn you away if you don\u2019t have pre-authorization; in other cases, your claim might be denied afterward. If your claim was denied but your doctor ordered the tests, ask your doctor to contact the insurance company on your behalf.\n\n3. Out-of-network provider\n\nIf your insurance is a health maintenance organization or an exclusive provider organization, your claim may have been denied for going outside of the plan\u2019s provider network for care. Going out of an HMO or EPO network means you\u2019re seeing a provider who hasn\u2019t agreed to your insurance company\u2019s terms of payment. If you received elective or nonemergency care and do not have any out-of-network benefits, your health plan may deny the claim (making payment your responsibility) or require you to pay a bigger share of the cost.\n\n4. Minor transcription errors\n\nIs your name misspelled? Does your birth date say you were born in 1978 instead of 1987? If you can\u2019t figure out why your claim wasn\u2019t paid, check for typos. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a claim was denied because of minor data entry errors. In that case, call a patient customer service representative to help you fix the data problem.\n\n5. Wrong insurance company billed\n\nThis is really basic: Did your doctor\u2019s office bill the right company? Are you sure you have an active policy? If you\u2019re seeing a provider you haven\u2019t seen in a while, it may have outdated insurance information on file for you. Having two policies can also cause some claims to be denied. For example, if you have coverage through your own employer and your spouse\u2019s employer, it can cause problems with billing. Double-check that your provider has up-to-date information.\n\nAnticipating some of the common causes of rejected health insurance claims can help you avoid them. But here\u2019s hoping you won\u2019t ever find yourself in this position.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in NerdWallet. Read more at NerdWallet:\n\nBehind on Health Insurance Premiums?
