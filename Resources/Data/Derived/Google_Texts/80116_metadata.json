Meanwhile, residents driven from their homes by power outages in the Midwest worried about burst pipes.\n\nMonday\u2019s subzero temperatures broke records in Chicago, which set a record for the date at minus 16, and Fort Wayne, Ind., where the mercury fell to 13 below. Records also fell in Oklahoma and Texas, and wind chills across the region were 40 below and colder. Officials in states like Indiana already struggling with high winds and more than a foot of snow urged residents to stay home if they could.\n\nIn New York, the cold broke an 1896 record when the mercury fell to 4 degrees by 8 a.m.\n\n\u201cThe cold is the real killer here,\u201d Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard said Monday as he asked schools and businesses to remain closed another day. \u201cIn 10 minutes you could be dead without the proper clothes.\u201d\n\nThe polar air will next invade the East and South on Tuesday, bringing with it the prospect of more records falling. Highs in the single digits were expected in Georgia and Alabama, and wind chill warnings stretched as far south as Florida, with forecasts calling for minus 10 in Atlanta and minus 12 in Baltimore.\n\nIn downtown Louisville, Ky., where wind chills dropped to 22 below zero Monday, John Tyler gathered with friends at a McDonald\u2019s. The self-described homeless man spent Sunday night sleeping on the street.\n\nDressed in a sweatshirt, two coats and a black woolen cap, Tyler said there\u2019s no way to adequately prepare for this kind of cold.\n\nTwo women try to hail a taxi in NYC early Tuesday morning Photo: G.N.
