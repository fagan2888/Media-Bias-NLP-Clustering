The mayor reasoned that L.A. was a good place for sheltering the illegal aliens because their parents are probably in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nNotably, in a forum hosted downtown by Politico Magazine, he said, \u201cBefore you get partisan, before you tell me where you are on immigration \u2014 these are children.\u201d Garcetti, apparently channeling former Florida governor and presidential aspirant Jeb Bush, told the crowd, \u201cAs a father, who are we as Americans if we don\u2019t step forward first and say, these kids who are isolated, alone\u2026 let\u2019s get them someplace safe and secure,\u201d the mayor told the crowd.\n\nThe mayor in his outreach to the aliens has upset homeless activists in Los Angeles, claiming that their needs should come before the needs of illegal immigrants. CBS Los Angeles reported that homeless activist Ted Hayes, who has lived in L.A. for three decades, adamantly opposes the idea of taking in the aliens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a slap in the face to U.S. citizens,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s hurtful. Because it\u2019s like a father saying that he loves children outside of the family more than he loves his own. We feel for them,\u201d Hayes added. \u201cWe feel their pain. But we are feeling pain of our own children first.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the mayor seems oblivious to the myriad reporting of many, most significantly Breitbart News, that high profile welcoming of illegal immigrants encourages more to do the same. Unfortunately, the perils of making the journey from Central America subject the migrants to intense suffering, sexual abuse, living in stash houses, and in some cases death.\n\nIn April, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said that we need to be a nation that welcomes legal immigration, not illegal. \u201cIn my view, we need to be a nation that welcomes and celebrates legal immigrants,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cPeople who follow the rules and come here according to the law. We\u2019re a nation of immigrants, we need to celebrate that. But at the same time, rule of law matters. And if you look at any sovereign nation, securing your border is critically important.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, the Times points out that the huge influx of Central American children crossing the border into the United States has sparked a storm of protests in other parts of California. In the Riverside County city of Murrieta, hundreds of demonstrators recently blocked buses trying to move detainees into a housing facility, drawing national headlines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "L.A.
