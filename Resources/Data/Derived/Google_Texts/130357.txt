Zubik v. Burwell: The Supreme Court orders a practical & prudent tack

It has been described as a “whiff” and a “punt.” But the U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous order sending back to lower courts the federal government's attempt to force those with religious beliefs to fall subservient to the whims of “The State” was neither a swing and a miss nor a tactical admission of lack of forward progress.

In actuality, Monday's per curiam order calling on the bevy of complainants (led by Pittsburgh Catholic Bishop David Zubik) and the feds to yet again attempt to find common ground is as practical as it is prudent.

One provision of ObamaCare forced nonprofit religious groups — first, directly, then, later, by proxy — to provide insurance contraception coverage for female employees. Those groups objected, finding particularly ludicrous the latter nod-nod, wink-wink “compromise” from the Obama administration.

Still down one justice following February's death of Antonin Scalia, the high court obviously was deadlocked 4-4. Instead of creating an even bigger mess by allowing contradictory appeals court rulings to stand, the high court, based on follow-up briefs, concluded the parties might yet find agreement.

Indeed, they might not and the case could end back before the court. But who among us (other than The New York Times, that is) would argue that preserving religious freedom is not worth such an extraordinary (though hardly unprecedented) effort?
