We're not investing in the upfront maintenance.\"\n\nMeredith said she doesn't blame anyone because the shift to electronic records started years ago. Still, she must deal with the bureaucratic consequences, so she and the partners in her practice are considering options such as joining a large medical group or shifting to a cash-based system, much like a 1950s health care model.\n\n\"It's taking away what I love about medicine, and it's taking away the essence of what medicine is,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-11-20 19:37:18", "description": "Digital medical records can improve coordination of care, but the high cost and reduced productivity involved in implementing them are hurting some health care providers.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-20 19:37:18", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14204850|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Digital medical records can improve coordination of care, but the high cost and reduced productivity involved in implementing them are hurting some health care providers.", "title": "Electronic records putting financial squeeze on doctors :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/electronic-records-putting-financial-squeeze-on-doctors/14204850/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2014/11/20/14204969/14204970-1416530225-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-20T19:37:18-05:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Digital medical records can improve coordination of care, but the high cost and reduced productivity involved in implementing them are hurting some health care providers.", "title": "Electronic records putting financial squeeze on doctors :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/electronic-records-putting-financial-squeeze-on-doctors/14204850/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2014/11/20/14204969/154366-cullen530-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec83\"", "article_summary": "Meredith said she doesn't blame anyone because the shift to electronic records started years ago.\nShe said she sees value in electronic medical records, \"but it's become clear the cost associated for a small practice is becoming a weight that is too heavy to bear.\"\n\"That's how we treat health care.\n\"It's taking away what I love about medicine, and it's taking away the essence of what medicine is,\" she said.\nGriggs argues that reform is needed to better compensate front-line doctors to cut catastrophic costs later."}
