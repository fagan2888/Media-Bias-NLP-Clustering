Just slow down, take your time and wait for that person to pass.\u201d\n\nAfter you arrive home and unpack your items from their boxes, don't leave the boxes in your driveway for garbage pick-up, police say, because it shows everyone what you now have in your home.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office recommends breaking those boxes down and putting them in a dark garbage bag before trash pick-up.\n\nYou're also reminded to keep your vehicle doors locked at all times, even at home. There have been a string of auto break-ins across northeast Florida lately and many of the victims left their doors unlocked.\n\n\u201cI talked to several burglary detectives around the state and they said that if people would simply lock their doors, then they would not need auto burglary detectives in many of their police departments. It\u2019s that simple,\" said Smith.\n\nCopyright 2015 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/27/Black%20Friday%20shopping_1448662641048_712346_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Nicole Snyder", "description": "Local police are warning people to stay vigilant while shopping this holiday season.", "author": "Nicole Snyder", "og": {"site_name": "WJXT", "description": "Local police are warning people to stay vigilant while shopping this holiday season.", "title": "Police warn shoppers to stay safe during holidays", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/consumer/police-warn-shoppers-to-stay-safe-during-holidays", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/27/Black%20Friday%20shopping_1448662641048_712346_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local police are warning people to stay vigilant while shopping this holiday season.", "title": "Police warn shoppers to stay safe during holidays", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/consumer/police-warn-shoppers-to-stay-safe-during-holidays", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/27/Black%20Friday%20shopping_1448662641048_712346_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@wjxt4", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-27T22:20:02+0000", "robots": "nofollow", "sailthru.title": "Police warn shoppers to stay safe during holidays", "sailthru.tags": "black friday,Consumer,News,Holidays,Money", "fb": {"app_id": 196517170397638}, "keywords": "black friday,Consumer,News,Holidays,Money", "article": {"section": "Consumer", "tag": "black friday", "published_time": "2015-11-27T22:20:02+0000", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T22:20:02+0000", "author": "http://www.news4jax.com/author/nicolesnyder"}, "news_keywords": "Consumer", "content_id": 144197666, "sailthru.description": "Local police are warning people to stay vigilant while shopping this holiday season.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/27/Black%20Friday%20shopping_1448662641048_712346_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said if you're shopping after daylight hours, park and walk in lit areas and bring a friend if possible.\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Local police are warning people to stay vigilant while shopping this holiday season.\nAnother mistake people make is putting shopping bags in their trunk, then going back to shop more, experts say.\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office recommends breaking those boxes down and putting them in a dark garbage bag before trash pick-up.\nThere have been a string of auto break-ins across northeast Florida lately and many of the victims left their doors unlocked."}
