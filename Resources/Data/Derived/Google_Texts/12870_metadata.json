We had deputy assistant secretary of state, Brett McGurk, in front of [the Senate Foreign Relations Committee] on July 24th, he said that ISIL, or ISIS, is far more capable in both manpower, resources, and in fighting effectiveness than what we faced in 2007,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.).\n\n\u201cThey are funneling 30 to 50 suicide bombers into Iraq every month. [McGurk] said they could easily funnel those suicide bombers into Western nations. We need to be highly concerned about this. This threat is a gathering storm. It\u2019s not going away.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s comments came during an appearance on Fox News Sunday.\n\nWhile each Sunday show focused extensively on the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, the ongoing turmoil in Iraq did not go unmentioned.\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers maintained that the danger of ISIL is not only very real, but presents a direct threat to the security of the United States and warrants action.\n\n\u201cIf we allow ISIS to get bigger and bigger, they\u2019re going to plot homeland attacks on us,\u201d Rep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), the ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, told Fox News Sunday.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.) told ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching in Iraq and in Syria, frankly, is the worst-case scenario for the Middle East. This cancer that\u2019s growing; that is consuming all over the place \u2026 Today, we see [ISIL] in the tens of thousands, and they\u2019re only continuing to metastasize.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may be war weary,\u201d Johnson noted, \u201cbut I tell ya, ISIS, ISIL is not war weary. They\u2019re highly trained. They\u2019re highly organized. They have been very patient setting up this caliphate, and their long term aim really is to use that base of operation against the West.\u201d\n\nTo that effect, some lawmakers called for the consideration of more military options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we have to be involved in stopping with the Iraqi government, with the peshmerga. I think we\u2019re on the right start, but there\u2019s a lot more to do,\u201d explained Kinzinger.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I think the defeating of ISIS is the mission, and so I think everything has to be on the table for that end result. I understand the president doesn\u2019t want to put troops on the ground. I don\u2019t either. You can\u2019t reintroduce 200,000 American troops, but I think things like special forces embedded with the Iraqi military as the Iraqi military regrows its spine to take its country back is going to be essential and important.\u201d\n\nKinzinger served in the Iraq War, and was joined on This Week by fellow veteran Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii). Gabbard questioned the mission of today\u2019s efforts in Iraq.\n\n\u201cAs we talk about whether or not there should be troops or exactly what tactical strategy should be used going forward, we\u2019re missing a critical question here, which is what is our mission? What is the United States\u2019 mission? What are we trying to accomplish here? You know, Adam and I both enlisted, joined the military after 9/11 because we heard our nation\u2019s leaders say after that attack that we would go and take out these Islamic extremists wherever they are. We would fight against those who are waging war against the United States. That stated mission after 9/11 has been lost,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\n\u201cWe heard from White House officials last week, they said and I quote, these air strikes are not an authorization of a broad-based counterterrorism campaign against ISIS, end of quote. So if our mission is not to take out, the Islamic extremists who continued to threaten and wage war against us, then I think we\u2019ve got a real problem here.\u201d\n\nEngel contended that while combat troops were not ideal, doing nothing is not an option.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to put boots on the ground the way we did before in Iraq \u2026 We do have some boots on the ground right now, and frankly, we have to do everything we can to repel ISIS. I don\u2019t think we have the luxury of putting our heads in the sand and saying, \u2018well it\u2019s over there and we\u2019re not going to do it.\u2019 I think what we\u2019re doing now is effective. We\u2019ve got to do more of it, and ultimately we may have some boots on the ground there. Not something I want, but you know what, we have bad choices and the worst choice is to do nothing.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama previously stated that he would not consider placing troops on the ground.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers warned on Sunday that the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) is not subsiding, but continuing to escalate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Lawmakers warned on Sunday that the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) is not subsiding, but continuing to escalate.    \u201cWe need to defeat them.
