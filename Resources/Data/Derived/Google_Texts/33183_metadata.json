Everything is moving faster,\u201d the commission\u2019s report, released today, finds.\n\nRelated: U.S. Weapons Worth $500 Million Vanish in Yemen\u200b\u200b\n\nThe commission was created to examine the FBI\u2019s compliance with the recommendations issued in 2004 by a previous 9/11 Commission. The three commissioners are former Reagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese III; former six-term Indiana Congressman and U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Roemer, a Democrat; and Professor Bruce Hoffman, the director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service.\n\nThe commission found that in the years following the original 2004 report, the FBI restructured itself, both fiscally and operationally, but in recent years has been hindered by the mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration. \u201cIt is important to note that sequestration in FY14 severely hindered the FBI\u2019s intelligence and national security programs,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe funds appropriated for the FBI fell slightly in fiscal 2013, but in the beginning of fiscal 2014, when the sequester cuts kicked in, the consequences were more dire. Anticipation of the cuts had already placed some programs on hold, and once the budget changes took effect, the bureau\u2019s training division saw its budget slashed by 50 percent in 2014. The Bureau\u2019s training facility in Quantico, Va. went quiet, cancelling virtually all classes except mandatory firearms training and going more than a year without graduating a new class of special agents.\n\nThe Bureau was also forced to start furloughing 5,500 field agents, without pay, for 20 works days, and to begin offering early retirement to others. The result was a loss of experienced personnel and a reduction in person-hours on the job for those who remained, made worse by the discontinuation of training for more junior agents and analysts and a the elimination of the flow of new recruits into the Bureau.\n\nThat meant that, even when a bipartisan budget deal in Congress restored the FBI budget for the remainder of fiscal 2014, programs had gone unfunded or under-funded for a significant period, and instructors with no classes to teach were reassigned.\n\nIn the end, the agency\u2019s funding in 2014 was $8.2 billion, up 2.2 percent from its last official appropriation in 2012 and more than double the agency\u2019s $3.81 billion budget from fiscal 2001. However, the interruptions in training and hiring contributed to the agency\u2019s problems in fully implementing the 2004 panel report\u2019s recommended reforms.\n\nRelated: This Lethal Laser Could Cripple ISIS and Other Enemies\n\nThe sequester, though, was not the only problem standing in the way of the FBI\u2019s success in addressing the threat of terrorism. The commission found \u201ca significant gap between the articulated principles of the Bureau\u2019s intelligence programs and their effectiveness in practice. The Bureau needs to accelerate its pursuit of its stated goals for intelligence as a matter of increased urgency.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the commission found that the agency has lagged behind on developing the capacity to analyze and understand intelligence its agents gather, and said that \u201chiring additional linguists and integrating them into operations should be a high priority.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A high-level outside review of the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that the agency has not kept pace with the threats currently facing the country, and needs to improve certain elements of its intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities.
