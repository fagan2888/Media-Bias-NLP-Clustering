He refused to sign the U.S. Constitution without a statement of our rights \u2014 and he also wanted it to provide for emancipation.\n\nWhen the Virginia General Assembly debated its adoption, he was among the foremost opposing it for those reasons. Virginia narrowly voted to ratify the Constitution with the proviso that a Bill of Rights must accompany it.\n\nThis also is an appropriate time to remember Mason because his birthday was December 11. It should be widely observed; he was one of the most important Founding Fathers.\n\nMason authored the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Fairfax Resolves (ratified in Alexandria), which set the precedent of one colony supporting another in resistance to British tyranny. He was a major contributor to the discussions resulting in the creation of our federal republic.\n\nMason realized that at every level of government there was danger that the people\u2019s God-given rights would be violated, even by those whom they had elected. Although every state\u2019s constitution had a bill of rights, he disagreed with George Washington and other federalists that such protections were redundant in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHis principled stand cost him his rightful place in history: Federalists, angered by his effective resistance to adopting the Constitution, left him out of their accounts about the important people of this period.\n\nMason\u2019s foresight proved providential because today our rights \u2014 and even the checks and balances of power provided by the Constitution \u2014 are being challenged. For example, editorial writers, columnists and elected officials, when discussing Obamacare\u2019s requirement for business owners to fund abortifacients in violation of their beliefs, regularly quote only part of the First Amendment\u2019s provision about religion: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.\u201d They omit \u201cor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d\n\nThe Founding Fathers\u2019 intention in the First Amendment was to make clear that there should not be a national religion, such as Anglicanism in England. Religious groups \u2014 like Baptists, Methodists and so on \u2014 should not be prohibited from expressing their faith openly as they wished, nor should they be required to pay taxes to the government to support their state\u2019s official religion. (At that time, states had established churches.)\n\nTo honor its anniversary, I hope residents will reread and reflect upon the Bill of Rights and be mindful of our responsibilities as citizens of a free republic to keep it so for posterity.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://alextimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "description": "By Ellen Latane Tabb,\u00a0Alexandria (Image/Charters of Freedom/ www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/) To the editor: December 15 marked the anniversary of", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "acarter"}, "article_summary": "George Mason IV, of Gunston Hall, (George Washington\u2019s next-door neighbor on the Potomac; both considered themselves Alexandrians) is the person most responsible for its inclusion.\nAlthough every state\u2019s constitution had a bill of rights, he disagreed with George Washington and other federalists that such protections were redundant in the U.S. Constitution.\nVirginia narrowly voted to ratify the Constitution with the proviso that a Bill of Rights must accompany it.\nBy Ellen Latane Tabb, Alexandria(Image/Charters of Freedom/ www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/)To the editor:December 15 marked the anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791.\nHis principled stand cost him his rightful place in history: Federalists, angered by his effective resistance to adopting the Constitution, left him out of their accounts about the important people of this period."}
