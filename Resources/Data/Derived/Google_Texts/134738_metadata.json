Via Charles Gaba, the Rand Survey \u2014 which was the subject of a report in the LA Times, but which wasn\u2019t publicly available \u2014 is now in. And it says that as of mid-March \u2014 that is, before the final enrollment surge \u2014 the Affordable Care Act had already produced a net gain of 9.3 million insured adults. Again, that\u2019s a net gain; so much for claims that more people are losing insurance than gaining it.\n\nAt least some Republicans are realizing that (a) the ACA is not going to collapse and (b) they can\u2019t simply take away insurance from millions of Americans. So they have to come up with an alternative.\n\nAnd as Sahil Kapur reports, at least a few of them are coming to a terrible realization: there is no alternative. You can\u2019t just support the popular pieces of reform, in particular coverage for preexisting conditions, and scrap the rest. As Jonathan Gruber taught me, and I and others have said many times, reform is a three-legged stool that requires community rating, the individual mandate, and subsidies; take away any leg and it collapses. And Kapur finds a GOP aide who admits to the awful truth: any workable GOP plan would look pretty much the same as Obamacare.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many GOP leaders, as opposed to aides, understand this. And even those who do won\u2019t dare to admit it. The party line, literally, has been that Obamacare is an unworkable monstrosity, and the base will destroy anyone who points out, this late in the game, that it\u2019s both workable and pretty much the only doable alternative to single-payer.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not a case of politics making people stupid, I don\u2019t know what is..", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140408142918, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002814078, "DISPLAYDATE": "April 8, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Three Legs Good, One Leg Bad ( 20140408 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "As we\u2019ve been saying all along.", "title": "Three Legs Good, One Leg Bad", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/three-legs-good-one-leg-bad/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "As we\u2019ve been saying all along.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 8, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1396981758, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-04-09T01:12:29-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140409011229, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140408, "pdate": 20140408, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "As we\u2019ve been saying all along.", "title": "Three Legs Good, One Leg Bad", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/three-legs-good-one-leg-bad/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/three-legs-good-one-leg-bad/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Three Legs Good, One Leg Bad", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd51a4\"", "article_summary": "As Jonathan Gruber taught me, and I and others have said many times, reform is a three-legged stool that requires community rating, the individual mandate, and subsidies; take away any leg and it collapses.\nAnd Kapur finds a GOP aide who admits to the awful truth: any workable GOP plan would look pretty much the same as Obamacare.\nAgain, that\u2019s a net gain; so much for claims that more people are losing insurance than gaining it.\nThe good news for Obamacare just keeps coming in.\nAnd if that\u2019s not a case of politics making people stupid, I don\u2019t know what is.."}
