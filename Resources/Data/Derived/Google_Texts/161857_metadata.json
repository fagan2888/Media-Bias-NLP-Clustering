Those effects, and their causes, continue to be hotly debated among scientists.\n\nUnder the deal, the U.S. and participating countries will be legally required to meet every five years beginning in 2020 to present new plans intended to make deeper cuts in carbon emissions. Beginning in 2023, countries will be legally compelled to meet every five years to report on emissions levels and reductions.\n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t legally binding, Obama also has pledged to pour $3 billion into the Green Climate Fund, a pot of international aid funded by developed countries to assist developing, poverty-stricken countries in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nGroves testified that the White House\u2019s decision to avert congressional input \u201cflies in the face\u201d of the climate change treaty brokered during the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention. The goal of that treaty was to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions within a set time frame.\n\nGroves argued that President George H.W. Bush agreed with the Senate, then led by Democrats, that the chamber would ratify the 1992 treaty with the requirement that any future agreement containing targets and timetables be submitted to the Senate.\n\nProponents of the Paris Protocol, including Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, contend that the deal is a \u201chybrid\u201d agreement. They say it includes both legally binding conditions and voluntary pledges, and so does not require Senate ratification.\n\n\u201cHaving looked at this very carefully with our legal scholars, our scientists, and our economists, our view is that the agreement strikes the right balance between legally binding and nonbinding, given where we are as a global civilization,\u201d Steer testified to the committee.\n\nThe Obama administration intends to implement the agreement domestically through regulations written by the Environmental Protection Agency, including those created under the agency\u2019s controversial Clean Power Plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clever thing that the White House did\u2014you go and you make an international commitment in Paris, you bypass Congress completely, and then you go to enforce it domestically through EPA regulations,\u201d Groves said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of democratic legitimacy on almost every level of the creation of this document and its enforcement.\u201d\n\nGroves, the Lomas senior research fellow in Heritage\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, predicted that the EPA regulations will be litigated among cities and corporations.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans have adopted resolutions disapproving of the administration\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cIf you want a durable climate change agreement, you have to involve Congress. This administration has chosen not to do that,\u201d Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, testified during the hearing.\n\n\u201cSo, the question is, is this a durable and legal agreement? I would say no.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of democratic legitimacy on almost every level of ... this document and its enforcement,\u201d treaty expert Steven Groves told a House panel.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of democratic legitimacy on almost every level of ... this document and its enforcement,\u201d treaty expert Steven Groves told a House panel.", "title": "Legality of Climate Change Deal Disputed on Hill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160202_ClimateHearing_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T14:18:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20nMXtK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of democratic legitimacy on almost every level of ... this document and its enforcement,\u201d treaty expert Steven Groves told a House panel.", "title": "Legality of Climate Change Deal Disputed on Hill", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160202_ClimateHearing_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2016-02-03T13:21:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T14:18:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paris Protocol, International Climate Agreement, Barack Obama, United Nations, climate change, global warming, renewable energy, Steven Groves, hearing, House committee"}, "article_summary": "They say it includes both legally binding conditions and voluntary pledges, and so does not require Senate ratification.\nPresident Barack Obama bound the United States to an international agreement on climate change, but the administration\u2019s decision to circumvent Congress to implement the deal has lawyers questioning its constitutionality.\n\u201cIf you want a durable climate change agreement, you have to involve Congress.\nGroves testified that the White House\u2019s decision to avert congressional input \u201cflies in the face\u201d of the climate change treaty brokered during the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention.\nThis administration has chosen not to do that,\u201d Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, testified during the hearing."}
