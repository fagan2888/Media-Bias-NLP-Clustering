Hamburg, the commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, arrived in India this week to express her growing unease with the safety of Indian medicines because of \u201crecent lapses in quality at a handful of pharmaceutical firms.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s pharmaceutical industry supplies 40 percent of over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs consumed in the United States, so the increased scrutiny could have profound implications for U.S. consumers.\n\nFDA investigators are blitzing Indian drug plants, financing the inspections with some of the roughly $300 million in annual fees from generic drug makers collected as part of a 2012 law requiring increased scrutiny of overseas plants. The agency inspected 160 Indian drug plants last year, three times as many as in 2009. The increased scrutiny has led to a flood of new penalties, including half of the warning letters the agency issued last year to drug makers.\n\nHamburg was met by Indian officials and executives who, shocked by recent FDA export bans of adulterated generic versions of popular medicines \u2014 such as the acne drug Accutane, the pain drug Neurontin and the antibiotic Cipro \u2014 suspect that she is just protecting a domestic industry from cheaper imports.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who take a very sinister view of the FDA inspections,\u201d Keshav Desiraju, India\u2019s health secretary until he stepped down this week, said in a recent interview.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s increased enforcement has cost Indian companies dearly \u2014 Ranbaxy, one of India\u2019s biggest drug manufacturers, pleaded guilty to felony charges and paid a $500 million fine last year, the largest ever levied against a generic company. And many worry that worse is in store.\n\n\u201cIf I have to follow U.S. standards in inspecting facilities supplying to the Indian market,\u201d G.N. Singh, India\u2019s top drug regulator, said in a recent interview with an Indian newspaper, \u201cwe will have to shut almost all of those.\u201d\n\nThe unease culminated Tuesday when a top executive at Ranbaxy \u2014 which has repeatedly been caught lying to the FDA and found to have conditions such as flies \u201ctoo numerous to count\u201d in critical plant areas \u2014 pleaded with Hamburg at a private meeting with other drug executives to allow his products into the United States so that the company could more easily pay for fixes. She declined.\n\nIndia\u2019s drug industry is one of the country\u2019s most important economic engines, exporting $15 billion in products annually, and some of its factories are world-class, virtually indistinguishable from their counterparts in the West. But others suffer from serious quality control problems. The World Health Organization estimated that 1 in 5 drugs made in India are fakes. A 2010 survey of Delhi pharmacies found that 12 percent of sampled drugs were spurious.\n\nIn one recent example, counterfeit medicines at a pediatric hospital in Kashmir are now suspected of playing a role in hundreds of infant deaths there in recent years.\n\nOne widely used antibiotic was found to contain no active ingredient after being randomly tested in a government lab. The test was kept secret for nearly a year while some 100,000 useless pills continued to be dispensed.\n\nMore tests of hospital medicines found dozens more that were substandard, including a crucial intravenous antibiotic used in sick infants.\n\n\u201cSome of the fake tablets were used by pregnant women in the post-surgical prevention of infections,\u201d said Dr. M. Ishaq Geer, senior assistant professor of pharmacology at Kashmir University. \u201cThat\u2019s very serious.\u201d\n\nInvestigations of the deaths are continuing, but convictions of drug counterfeiters in India are extremely rare.\n\nSatish Reddy, president of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said Indian drug manufacturers were better than the FDA now contends. \u201cMore rigorous enforcement is needed, for sure, but this impression that India is overrun with counterfeits is unjustified,\u201d Reddy said.\n\nBut Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, which has plants in both the United States and India, said regulatory scrutiny outside of the United States was long overdue. \u201cIf there were no cops around, would everyone drive the speed limit?\u201d Bresch asked. \u201cYou get careless, start taking risks. Our government has enabled this.\u201d\n\nFor Hamburg, the trip is part of a long-running effort to create a global network of drug and food regulators to help scrutinize the growing flood of products coming into the United States, including 80 percent of the seafood consumed in the United States, 50 percent of the fresh fruit, 20 percent of the vegetables and the vast majority of drugs.\n\nShe has gone to conclaves of regulators from Europe and elsewhere to coordinate policing, but Indian officials have so far not attended such meetings.\n\nMany of India\u2019s drug manufacturing facilities are of top quality. Cipla, one of the industry\u2019s giants, has 40 plants across the country that together can produce more than 21 billion tablets and capsules annually, and one of its plants in Goa appeared just as sterile, automated and high-tech on a recent tour as those in the United States.\n\nCipla follows FDA guidelines at every plant and on every manufacturing line, and the company exports more than 55 percent of its production, said Yusuf Hamied, the company chairman.\n\nBut Benjamin Mwesige, a pharmacist at the Uganda Cancer Institute in Kampala, said in an interview in July that the institute had stopped buying cancer drugs from India in 2011 because it had received shipments of drugs that turned out to be counterfeit and inactive, with Cipla labels that Mwesige believed were forged.\n\nHe became suspicious when doctors began seeing chemotherapy patients whose cancer showed none of the expected responses to the drugs \u2014 and who also had none of the usual side effects. The drugs that had been prescribed were among the mainstays of cancer treatment \u2014 methotrexate, docetaxel and vincristine. Laboratory tests confirmed that the drugs were bogus, and Mwesige estimated that in 2011 about 20 percent of the drugs that the institute bought were counterfeit.\n\nEnforcement of regulations overall is very weak, analysts say, and India\u2019s government does a poor job policing many of its industries. Last month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgraded India\u2019s aviation safety ranking because the country\u2019s air safety regulator is understaffed, and a global safety group found that many of India\u2019s best-selling small cars are unsafe.\n\nIndia\u2019s Central Drugs Standards Organization, the country\u2019s drug regulator, has a staff of 323, about 2 percent the size of the FDA\u2019s, and its authority is limited to new drugs. The making of medicines that have been on the market at least four years is overseen by state health departments, many of which are corrupt or lack the expertise to oversee a sophisticated industry. Despite the flood of counterfeit drugs, Singh, India\u2019s top drug regulator, warned in meetings with the FDA of the risk of overregulation.\n\nThis absence of oversight, however, is a key reason India\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has been so profitable. Drug manufacturers estimate that routine FDA inspections add about 25 percent to overall costs. In the wake of the 2012 law that requires the FDA for the first time to equalize oversight of domestic and foreign plants, India\u2019s cost advantage could shrink significantly.\n\nSome top manufacturers are already warning that they may leave, tough medicine for an already slowing economy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a great nationalist, an Indian first and last,\u201d said Hamied. \u201cBut companies like Cipla are looking to expand their businesses abroad and not in India.\u201d\n\nU.S. businesses and FDA officials are just as concerned about the quality of drugs coming out of China, but the FDA\u2019s efforts to increase inspections there have so far been frustrated by the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cChina is the source of some of the largest counterfeit manufacturing operations that we find globally,\u201d said John P. Clark, Pfizer\u2019s chief security officer, who added that Chinese authorities were cooperative.\n\nUsing its new revenues, the FDA tried to bolster its staff in China in February 2012. But the Chinese government has so far failed to provide the necessary visas despite an announced agreement in December 2013 during a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, said Erica Jefferson, an FDA spokeswoman.\n\nThe United States has become so dependent on Chinese imports, however, that the FDA may not be able to do much about the Chinese refusal. The crucial ingredients for nearly all antibiotics, steroids and many other lifesaving drugs are now made exclusively in China.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2011/11/ANTIBIOTICS.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3213\"", "article_summary": "The agency inspected 160 Indian drug plants last year, three times as many as in 2009.\nBut Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, which has plants in both the United States and India, said regulatory scrutiny outside of the United States was long overdue.\nSatish Reddy, president of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said Indian drug manufacturers were better than the FDA now contends.\nMany of India\u2019s drug manufacturing facilities are of top quality.\nThe United States has become so dependent on Chinese imports, however, that the FDA may not be able to do much about the Chinese refusal."}
