Bay County Sheriff's Investigators wrapped up a two-month investigation Friday, arresting a Springfield man on child solicitation charges.

20-year-old Kammerynn Weeks is charged with promoting the sexual performance of a child, using an electronic device to solicit a child for a sex act, and two counts of transmission of harmful materials to a minor.

Authorities say weeks set up three Facebook accounts with fake information, and convinced underage girls to send him pornographic or sexual explicit pictures of themselves.

Weeks is due in court Saturday for a bond hearing.

There could be more charges as the investigation continues.
