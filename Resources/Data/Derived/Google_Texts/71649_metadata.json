Rick Perry (R-TX) has found an unlikely fan in Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias. Ahead of Perry\u2019s presidential announcement today, Yglesias published a piece (on the typically liberal site) that praised Perry\u2019s impressive economic record in Texas. I\u2019m not kidding.\n\nPerry's 14 years in office, by contrast, included stints before, during, and after the Great Recession. His job creation record is the record of a big state weathering a national \u2014 indeed, global \u2014 economic calamity and doing a pretty good job of it. The Republican field is crowded, but Perry has the opportunity to stand out with a fairly unusual story of success.\n\nYglesias then lists some of Perry\u2019s particularly notable achievements, including Texas\u2019s rapid job creation (Texas accounted for 31 percent of all new jobs in America when he was governor), affordable housing, and population growth. These statistics from March offer confirmation:\n\nTexas continues to dominate major metropolitan area growth. Among the 53 major metropolitan areas (with more than 1 million population), Texas cities occupied three of five top positions in population growth, and four of the top 10.\n\nNo other candidate in the race can match these credentials, Yglesias argues.\n\nAnother factor that makes Rick Perry's Texas narrative compelling is that his rivals have weak stories to tell. Scott Walker's war on union power in Wisconsin is something Republicans embrace as a matter of principle. But it hasn't unleashed any \"Wisconsin Miracle\" he can brag about. Jeb Bush governed through a housing bubble that ended in tears. Marco Rubio seems to impress almost every room he walks into, but he hasn't really done much of anything except serve as a frontman for an immigration bill he ended up disowning. Ted Cruz's big achievement is grandstanding.\n\nIt may be presumptuous to assume Yglesias is on Team Perry, but his arguments on the governor\u2019s behalf are pretty convincing. Now, the question is, is Perry ready to rattle off these accomplishments as he kicks off his campaign and prepares to debate his popular opponents and avoid another \u2018Oops\u2019 moment?\n\nHe has indicated as much.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ready to rumble..05/25/2016 23:51:09PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Ready to rumble.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Vox Praises Rick Perry\u2019s \u201cUnusual Story of Success\u201d", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/06/04/vox-praises-rick-perrys-unusual-story-of-success-n2008093", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/91/2015-04-01T051003Z_1_LYNXMPEB301BH_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-OBAMACARE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Ready to rumble.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Vox Praises Rick Perry\u2019s \u201cUnusual Story of Success\u201d", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/06/04/vox-praises-rick-perrys-unusual-story-of-success-n2008093", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/91/2015-04-01T051003Z_1_LYNXMPEB301BH_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-OBAMACARE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Vox Praises Rick Perry\u2019s \u201cUnusual Story of Success\u201d, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ef0\"", "article_summary": "Another factor that makes Rick Perry's Texas narrative compelling is that his rivals have weak stories to tell.\nAhead of Perry\u2019s presidential announcement today, Yglesias published a piece (on the typically liberal site) that praised Perry\u2019s impressive economic record in Texas.\nRick Perry (R-TX) has found an unlikely fan in Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias.\nAmong the 53 major metropolitan areas (with more than 1 million population), Texas cities occupied three of five top positions in population growth, and four of the top 10.\nThe Republican field is crowded, but Perry has the opportunity to stand out with a fairly unusual story of success."}
