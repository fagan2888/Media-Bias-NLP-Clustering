The primary is June 7.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of political daylight between the Democrat and Republican hoping to topple House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy this year. But on one thing they agree: McCarthy should be challenged.\n\nHe should have to answer for his record, say Democrat Wendy Reed of Quartz Hill and Republican Ken Mettler of Bakersfield.\n\nThere should be an airing of the issues, they say.\n\nAnd, as Reed put it, the 800-pound gorilla in Kern County politics \u201chas lost some weight\u201d with locals who believe he\u2019s more focused on his leadership role than representing his district.\n\n\u201cEven his own Republican base recognizes that involvement in political life, being a career politician, is very time-consuming and can really take you away from the matters of your district,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom what I understand, that appears to be true (with McCarthy).\u201d\n\nRelated Info ALSO ON THE BALLOT... Gerald Morris of Rosamond, a Republican gun room salesman, said he suspended his campaign for the 23rd due to \u201cdirty tricks\u201d that so frightened his wife she didn\u2019t want him to say he was married. He said \u201cthey\u201d put a tracker on his car, followed him around, took down his flyers and hacked his computer. Who are \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Morris said. He said he doesn\u2019t know who did these things and he hasn\u2019t asked authorities to investigate, saying culpability would be difficult to prove. 23RD DISTRICT CONTENDERS KEVIN MCCARTHY Party: Republican\n\nRepublican Age: 51 Occupation: 23rd District congressman Website: www.mccarthyforcongress.com Family: Married; adult son, daughter Political offices held: Kern Community College District trustee, 2000-2002; 32nd District assemblyman, 2002-2006; 23rd District congressman, 2007-present Education: Bachelor\u2019s (1989) and master\u2019s (1994) degrees in business administration, Cal State Bakersfield His backstory: McCarthy is a Bakersfield native who before his 21st birthday opened a deli, sold it and used the money to finish his college education. He went to work for Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Bakersfield, ultimately serving as his district director. McCarthy was elected to the Kern Community College District board in 2000. Two years later he was elected to the 32nd Assembly District seat, and became the first freshman elected Assembly Republican leader. In 2006 he was elected to replace Thomas and rose up the leadership ranks, ultimately to House majority leader in 2014.\n\n\n\nLast year he dropped a run for House speaker.\n\n\n\nCampaign finances: Raised $5.9 million as of March 31. $4 million on hand then; $10,000 debt. Quote: \u201cIf we went with what the House passed, it would be a better country.\u201d KEN METTLER\n\n\n\nParty: Republican\n\n\n\nAge: 62 Republican62 Occupation: Independent businessman/owner of KLM Omni Inc., dba KLM Homes, KLM Land Services, and KLM Litigation Services Website: www.KenMettler.com Family: Married; two grown sons Political offices held: Kern High School District trustee, 2007-2010; Rosedale Union School District trustee, 1996-2006 Education: Bachelor\u2019s degree in public administration, Cal State Los Angeles, 1973; master\u2019s degree in public administration, UC Riverside, 1975 His backstory: Mettler is a South High School grad whose father was a gas plant operator for an oil company and mother a stay-at-home mom when he was young. After college he served in the Peace Corps in Nicaragua and tried to start a cattle herd there, but had to flee when communists took over. Mettler returned to Bakersfield to work for Tenneco Oil as an analyst in about 1977 and while there, met a vice president of finance for Tenneco West with whom he started Kaiser Mettler Development, which did land development. He ended up building home tracts and estimates he\u2019s built 1,000 homes and lots in Arizona and California. Today he owns KLM Omni Inc., under which he operates KLM Homes (primarily building custom homes), KLM Land Services (helping people with oil leases and drilling rights), and KLM Litigation Services (acting as an expert witness on construction-related issues). Campaign finances: No money reported yet. Mettler said in an interview he\u2019s raised less than $10,000. He said people are giving less than $200 each so their name doesn\u2019t have to be reported. Quote: \u201cI\u2019m principle-driven. I\u2019m not seeking a job. I\u2019m not seeking perks. I\u2019m not looking for a trophy. I\u2019m running on principles and giving people a choice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWENDY REED\n\n\n\nParty: Democratic Age: 60 Website: http://wendyreedforcongress.com Family: Married; grown son Occupation: Administrator, Antelope Valley Conservancy; business owner, Advant-edge, both Quartz Hill Education: Bachelor\u2019s degree in communications (public relations emphasis, minor in economics), Cal State Bakersfield, 2004; master\u2019s degree in public administration, Cal State Northridge, 2007. Her backstory: Reed grew up the only child of an English teacher father and artist mother on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She listened to a lot of classical music as a child and wanted to be an opera singer. Early on she was a folk and rock \u2018n roll singer and wanted to be a songwriter. In her 20s she realized that wasn\u2019t going to work out and ended up \u201cfalling in love\u201d with working with attorneys, in real estate and with computers. She came to the Antelope Valley in 1985, where she met her now-husband, got married, had a son and \u201cstarted a business or two.\u201d Reed ended up deciding to stay home with her son and on the side do freelance secretarial work with a company she started, Advant-edge. Campaign finances: Raised $18,390 as of March 31. $4,156 on hand then; $4,200 debt. Quote: \u201cWe need leadership that cares about human beings. That understands that in America we are all created equal. That\u2019s what we meant. We didn\u2019t mean that rich people are more equal than other people. We didn\u2019t mean rich people got more votes than other people. We meant that by our inalienable right of birth, we are equal.\u201d\n\nMettler sees the same kind of opening Virginia college professor Dave Brat broke through in 2014 when he unseated then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the primary. Though Mettler and Reed recognize beating McCarthy is an uphill climb.\n\n\u201cI think the anger is even more today than it was two years ago,\u201d Mettler said. \u201cIt\u2019s anger against the establishment.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, meanwhile, isn\u2019t taking anything for granted. He has a campaign headquarters, is running radio ads and says he\u2019s open to debating his opponents if everyone can work out a date.\n\nTime is running out, though, with the primary June 7 and absentee ballots having gone out this past week. The top two finishers, regardless of party, will go head-to-head in November.\n\n\u201cI want to be that voice to find the solutions and finish the jobs that we\u2019re doing,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHe rejects the notion he\u2019s the \u201cestablishment,\u201d saying he served only two terms in the state Assembly and hasn\u2019t been in Congress nearly as long as his predecessor, 28-year Congressman Bill Thomas.\n\nAnd McCarthy says he\u2019s proud of how connected he stays with the district.\n\n\u201cI do tele-town halls almost every single month,\u201d he said. \u201cI come home every single weekend. Maybe I\u2019ve missed two weekends this year. You cover and follow me. Have you ever seen me not be accessible?\u201d\n\nON THE RIGHT\n\nMettler is a homebuilder and former Kern High School District trustee known best for his conservative politics and, some would say, antics.\n\nHe successfully advocated for posters with \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d and other historical documents to be pinned up in all KHSD classrooms. He fought with a protester over signs dealing with Proposition 8, the 2008 voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage in California. And he was accused of coaxing a \u201cShannon\u201d (Holloway) to run in the 2010 Assembly race to confuse people and take votes away from Shannon Grove (who won anyway).\n\nMettler says those controversies are old news and he has a far more relevant record as a businessman, school board member and political advocate. He says he\u2019s a \u201cprinciples-driven person\u201d and wants \u201cto live by those principles.\u201d\n\nThey are fiscal responsibility, free markets, limited government and equal opportunity for all. He says he decided to run at the last minute, when nobody else stepped up, because \u201cthe people deserve a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us, when we disagree with our electeds, that we mount a challenge and let the people hear the issues,\u201d Mettler said.\n\nHe\u2019s most perturbed by McCarthy\u2019s vote last December for the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, which passed the House with 150 Republicans supporting it and 95 opposed, meaning he had to partner with Democrats.\n\nThat spending bill, Mettler said, gave President Obama $50 billion more than he requested and was so big that a lot of pork got in under the radar.\n\nHe criticizes McCarthy for not doing enough to defund the Affordable Care Act, immigration-related executive orders and Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the minority party you can say you tried,\u201d Mettler said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the majority, more is expected of you.\u201d\n\nMettler faults McCarthy for not offering up a more comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act or doing more to tackle the country\u2019s debt. And he was \u201cinfuriated\u201d by McCarthy\u2019s comments on Fox News last year tying the House Benghazi hearings to Hillary Clinton\u2019s then-falling poll numbers.\n\nMettler has posted a Clinton ad highlighting the remarks on his website.\n\n\u201cI think Mr. McCarthy is a political animal and views the world as just a partisan quest when in reality, when you have Americans die that\u2019s not political,\u201d he said.\n\nMettler has a boatload of his own baggage, though.\n\nHe was criticized for spending too much time pursuing a social agenda at the high school district (he also helped lead the charge to change the names of the breaks from \u201cWinter\u201d to \u201cChristmas\u201d and \u201cSpring\u201d to \u201cEaster\u201d) and for punching a protester after wading through a rival encampment of demonstrators to confiscate altered \u201cYes on 8\u201d yard signs.\n\nHe counters by pointing to substantive work he did at KHSD: helping start an academy to better prepare incoming freshmen for high school, fighting \u201csocial promotion\u201d policies, asking for a series of financial audits, and advocating for single-sex physical education.\n\nHe says the 2008 scuffle was self-defense (he wasn\u2019t charged criminally and won a civil trial by a 12-0 vote). And regarding Holloway says that \u201csilly things happen during campaigns,\u201d including his campaign computer being hacked during that crazy 2010 Assembly race.\n\nON THE LEFT\n\nReed says she had three goals going into her campaign. Making sure McCarthy had a challenger. Reminding people \u201cwhat self-governing really involves,\u201d like one man, one vote, taxation without representation, and equal treatment under the law. And third, having a good time.\n\nShe believes the 23rd District has a lot of needs that aren\u2019t being met.\n\n\u201cWe need resources,\u201d Reed said. \u201cOur job as congressmen is to bring home the pork. Where\u2019s our pork? Where\u2019s our money for healthcare? Where\u2019s our money for roads? Where\u2019s our money for education? Where\u2019s our money for better environmental protections?\u201d\n\nWhere would the money come from?\n\nShe says the government has allowed too many tax breaks for, and too much tax dodging by, the \u201csuper, super rich\u201d who have bought politicians\u2019 influence. Asked for specific remedies and how much money they would generate, Reed said:\n\n\u201cIf we simply roll back some of those perks, we will greatly increase the taxes that are available,\u201d describing the totals as \u201cbillions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars, by some estimates trillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nReed also bemoans what she considers a political system unduly influenced by rich special interest groups. She says she\u2019d fight it by advocating to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision that prohibited restrictions on independent political spending and move toward publicly financed elections to help level playing fields.\n\n\u201cAscending to governance, to represent the people in your district, should not be a pay-to-play system,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThat is not democracy.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d also bring back bank regulations, anti-trust laws and the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to produce balanced airings of matters of public importance.\n\nAsked why 23rd District voters should replace someone with McCarthy\u2019s clout with a political newcomer likely to be in the minority party, Reed said she\u2019s not sure McCarthy still has a lot of power, that he\u2019s really a leader and that the GOP will keep control of the House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that Mr. McCarthy is influencing people from a position of leadership. I see McCarthy is doing the bidding of whoever those leaders are, who I assume are not in office. They\u2019re not elected people. They\u2019re people who pay to elect people.\u201d\n\nWho are those people?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Who are the richest people?\u201d she responded. \u201cThe Waltons, the Gates, Soros, the Koch brothers. They\u2019re the richest, most influential people in our country.\u201d\n\nReed has never held elected office but says she\u2019s been an advocate for important causes for 30 years, including founding and managing a nonprofit that preserves wildlife habitat, and engaging citizens in government issues.\n\nTHE CONGRESSMAN\n\nAsked what he\u2019d do with another two years in office, McCarthy says he\u2019d continue his work on oil, water, valley fever, getting Isabella Dam reconstructed, protecting Kern\u2019s military bases and reducing the deficit.\n\n\n\nHe counts as a major accomplishment helping get the oil export ban lifted, and wants to pass pipeline reform to ensure companies can produce and move oil.\n\nMcCarthy wants to continue working on legislation to move water from the Delta down to the Central Valley and Southern California and to invest in more water storage. Then there\u2019s continuing the fight against valley fever \u2014 a $7 million randomized study on how best to treat it is underway \u2014 and making sure reconstruction of Isabella Dam stays on schedule.\n\nIt took him two months, he said, just to get the feds to agree to rebuild a Forest Service building that has to be taken out.\n\n\u201cI had meetings to try to keep them on schedule every quarter,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIf we did not hold them accountable, I don\u2019t know that (dam construction) would be on track.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s fostering the private space industry at the Mojave Air and Space Port and protecting Edwards Air Force Base.\n\nIn answer to his critics, McCarthy says he doesn\u2019t like big omnibus bills, either, but last year\u2019s became necessary to keep the government open.\n\nWhile discretionary spending went up, mandatory spending (about 65 percent of the budget) went down, he said. Republicans passed reforms to Medicare, for example, that will save almost $2 trillion in the long run.\n\nIncluded in the omnibus, he said, was the lifting of the oil export ban and money to reconstruct Isabella Dam, fight valley fever, continue research and development at Kern military bases and cut diesel emissions in the valley.\n\nOf note, McCarthy said: House Republicans have cut discretionary spending by $887 billion since taking control of the body in 2011.\n\nHe took Mettler to task for saying in a widely distributed email that omnibus \u201cprovided full funding for Obamacare\u201d when omnibus only deals with discretionary funding and the Affordable Care Act is mandatory spending. Mettler doesn\u2019t know the facts or is trying to mislead, he said.\n\nMcCarthy also criticized Mettler for posting the Clinton ad on his website.\n\n\u201cI never said Benghazi was a political committee. It\u2019s about four Americans who lost their lives and getting to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary wants to spin it and try to make it political, it\u2019s unfortunate that someone like Ken, who claims to be a Republican, would go onto a Hillary site to try to help her.\u201d\n\nAs for Reed\u2019s notion McCarthy is doing the bidding of unelected people, the richest people in the country, he said some of the four names she listed are big, liberal fundraisers.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve received money from any of those.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this story quoted McCarthy as saying three of four groups of political donors named by Reed are liberal fundraisers. One of the three groups he cited, however, members of the Walton family, tend to give to conservative candidates and causes, according to a report based on campaign finance data by the group Making Change at Walmart. A look at 2015-2016 campaign finance data shows Arkansas Waltons giving to a mix of GOP and Democratic candidates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There&rsquo;s a lot of political daylight between the Democrat and Republican hoping to topple House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy this year.
