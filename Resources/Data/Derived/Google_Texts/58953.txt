So far, the Broncos have six players in the NFL’s top 100 Players of 2014, as put together by the NFL Network, and as voted on by the players.

The six Broncso players who have been revealed from 51 to 100: defensive end DeMarcus Ware (No. 56), slot receiver Wes Welker (73), strongside linebacker Von Miller (76), cornerback Aqib Talib (79), strong safety T.J. Ward (82) and guard Louis Vasquez (97).

Still ahead, I would think, are quarterback Peyton Manning (who should be No. 1), receiver Demaryius Thomas, tight end Julius Thomas and left tackle Ryan Clady. Providing Julius Thomas or Clady don’t get snubbed, that would be 10 Broncos in the top 100.

Which would explain the Broncos’ back-to-back No. 1 AFC playoff seeds and why they’re the odds-on favorite to win the AFC again this year.
