As anyone who watches the news or spends any amount of time online knows, the “Caitlyn Jenner” Vanity Fair story has received a tremendous amount of coverage in the media since the magazine unveiled its July cover on Monday.

As reported by NewsBusters, the “Big Three” networks – CBS, NBC, ABC – devoted more than 48 minutes to the story from Monday night through Wednesday morning.

What they haven’t devoted time to, are these four stories about the Obama administration:

ObamaCare Price Increases

Dozens of health insurers selling plans under ObamaCare have requested hefty premium increases for 2016, according to preliminary information published Monday by the White House. Insurers have cited higher-than-expected care costs from customers they gained under ObamaCare’s coverage expansion, rising cost of prescription drugs and other expenses as reasons for proposing the increases, many of which are in the double-digit percentages. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is seeking a roughly 26% premium increase, while plans in Illinois and Florida, among other states, are asking for hikes of 20% or more. In Pennsylvania, Highmark Health Insurance Co. is asking for a 30% increase.

Amount of time covered by the “Big Three”: zero.

Bad Obama Polling Results

CBS News/New York Times poll results released Tuesday morning showed that Americans believe there is too much cash in politics; 84% of those polled said that money has too much influence in political campaigns. What the report didn’t cover from the same poll: 37% of Americans approve of Obama’s handling of foreign policy, while 49% disapprove. Also missing: 49% disapprove of Obama’s handling of the economy.

Amount of coverage by CBS of its own negative poll results on Obama: zero.

Bad Economic News

The economy contracted during the first quarter of 2015, with GDP falling .07%. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity, was modest. Personal consumption rose by 1.8% last quarter, down from 4.4% in late 2014.

Coverage by the “Big Three: zero.

Executive Amnesty Ruling

In November of 2014, the “Big Three” hailed Obama’s executive order granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. However, following the May, 27 decision by refusal the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to lift a stay on the controversial order, NBC and ABC both ignored the ruling.

Coverage by CBS: 17 seconds.

While the “mainstream media” has long denied that a liberal bias exists, Obama himself admitted earlier this year that it does:

Judging by the amount of coverage given to the Vanity Fair cover – vs. covering the above stories impacting America – the networks themselves seem to have once again proved Obama’s point.
