Talk about getting health insurance. #GetTalking.\u201d\n\nAnd, sure enough, Pajama Boy is wearing pajamas \u2014 a zip-up onesie in classic Lamar Alexander plaid \u2014 and drinking hot chocolate. He is in his 20s, sporting hipster glasses he could have bought at Warby Parker and an expression of self-satisfied ironic amusement.\n\nPajama Boy is about as threatening as Michael Cera and so nerdy he could guest-host on an unwatched MSNBC show. He is probably reading The Bell Jar and looking forward to a hearty Christmas meal of stuffed tofurkey. If he has anything to say about it, Obamacare enrollments will spike in the next few weeks in Williamsburg and Ann Arbor.\n\nPerhaps the goal of OFA was to create a readily mockable image to draw attention to its message, in which case Pajama Boy was a brilliantly successful troll. The right immediately Photoshopped him into the Mandela funeral selfie and emblazoned his photo with derisive lines like \u201cHey girl, I live with my parents\u201d and \u201cHow did you know I went to Oberlin?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard not to see Pajama Boy as an expression of the Obama vision, just like his forebear Julia, the Internet cartoon from the 2012 campaign. Pajama Boy is Julia\u2019s little brother. She progressed through life without any significant family or community connections. He is the picture of perpetual adolescence. Neither is a symbol of self-reliant, responsible adulthood.\n\nAnd so both are ideal consumers of government. Julia needed the help of Obama-supported programs at every juncture of her life, and Pajama Boy is going to get his health insurance through Obamacare (another image shows him looking very pleased in a Christmas sweater, together with the words \u201cAnd a happy New Year with health insurance\u201d).\n\nThe breakdown of marriage and its drift into the 30s mean there are more Julias and Pajama Boys than ever. The growth of government feeds off this trend and, at the margins, augments it. The vision of the Obama Democrats, distilled to its essence, is of a direct relationship between the state and the individual without the mediating institutions of family, church, and community that are an inherent check on government power.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville wrote long ago of the infantilizing tendency of all-encompassing government. \u201cIt would be like the authority of a parent,\u201d he wrote in a famous passage, \u201cif, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood.\u201d If you wanted to illustrate what Tocqueville was getting at in one meme, Pajama Boy would be good way to do it.\n\nNever has the difference between what Chris Matthews memorably dubbed the Mommy Party and the Daddy Party been so stark. Pajama Boy\u2019s mom probably still tucks him in at night, and when she isn\u2019t there for him, Obamacare will be. A less nurturing reaction is, as New Jersey governor Chris Christie put it in a counter tweet, \u201cGet out of your pajamas.\u201d There\u2019s a reason President Barack Obama is underwater by a 2-to-1 margin among men in the latest Quinnipiac poll.\n\nFor all the ridicule directed at Julia during last year\u2019s campaign, she got at something important: Single women do look to government as a cushion against their economic insecurities. Pajama Boy isn\u2019t so apt. He might be glad to pay more for his health insurance to include maternity benefits he doesn\u2019t need as a blow against gender stereotyping, but most young people will presumably consider Obamacare more rationally and realize it\u2019s a scheme to get them to subsidize insurance costs for older people.\n\nGood luck, Pajama Boy, if you hope to talk them out of that.\n\n\u2014 Rich Lowry can be reached via e-mail: [email protected]. \u00a9 2013 by King Features Syndicate", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Pajama Boy, Home for the Holidays", "sailthru.author": "Rich Lowry", "description": "Pajama Boy\u2019s place in Internet infamy was secured as soon as the insufferable man-child was tweeted out by Organizing for America.\n\nHe is the face of a Web ad that is the latest effort by the Obama team to leverage the holidays for conversation about Obamacare. \u201cWear pajamas,\u201d the ad reads. \u201cDrink hot chocolate.
