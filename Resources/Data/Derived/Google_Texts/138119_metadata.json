Since first taking office in 2009, the president has vetoed a grand total of two bills \u2013 both relatively obscure measures relating to defense funding and the ability of banks to notarize documents regarding bad loans.\n\nBy contrast, many of his recent predecessors were quick to wield their veto pens in sparring with Congress, especially when the opposing party was in charge. Republican President Ronald Reagan vetoed 78 pieces of legislation during his two terms in office; Republican George H.W. Bush struck down 44 bill during his one term; Democrat Bill Clinton vetoed 37 pieces of legislation that made it to his desk; and President George W. Bush vetoed 12 bills.\n\nRelated: Obama Wants Long-Term Infrastructure Plan, Not Keystone\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nIf some hoped that a divided government would end gridlock in Washington, they may be in for a nasty surprise. President Obama and the new Republican leadership are carefully preparing to do battle when the new GOP-controlled Congress takes office next week. Both sides are talking about trying to find common ground, but there may be no way to reconcile differences on some of the thorniest issues \u2013 including immigration reform, health care, Cuba and the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\nObama early on was more focused on persuading Democrats and Republicans to help him pass major legislation than in blocking legislation, including his stimulus package, the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and the Affordable Care Act. One reason for the paucity of vetoes was the Democratic controlled Senate. After the Republicans took control of the House in 2011 and began cranking out legislation, including 30 jobs bills, 43 repeals of Obamacare, the Keystone pipeline bill and others, Majority Leader Harry Reid and the Democrats served as Obama\u2019s backstop veto.\n\nAll that is changing in the wake of the November mid-term election as Republicans prepare to take back control of the Senate as well and extend their position in the House next week. Without a Democratic majority in the Senate to fend off House-passed measures, Obama declared in an interview with National Public Radio aired on Monday that he is bracing to do the job himself.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t used the veto pen very often since I\u2019ve been in office,\u201d Obama told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep in an interview recorded before Obama and his family departed for their annual vacation in Hawaii. \u201cNow, I suspect, there are going to be some times where I\u2019ve got to pull that pen out.\u201d\n\nThe president added, \u201cI\u2019m going to defend gains that we\u2019ve made in health care. I\u2019m going to defend gains that we\u2019ve made on environment and clean air and clean water.\u201d\n\nRelated: Talking Past Each Other on Immigration Reform\n\nDespite the months and years of political hand-to-hand combat between the White House and the GOP, Obama said that at least on some issues, the two sides are in sync \u2013 including the recent agreement over a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending package for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be areas where we agree, and I\u2019m going to be as aggressive as I can be in getting legislations passed that I think help move the economy forward and help middle class families,\u201d he said. This is a point that was quickly seconded today by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will soon succeed Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada as Majority Leader.\n\n\u201cBipartisan jobs bills will see the light of day and will make it to the President\u2019s desk, and he\u2019ll have to make decisions about ideology versus creating jobs for the middle class,\u201d McConnell said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies don\u2019t like.:\n\nObama and McConnell have previously voiced optimism that the two sides can find common ground on legislation to expand U.S. trade opportunities, revamp the corporate tax code and finance new infrastructure. With an eye to the 2016 presidential campaign, McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and other GOP leaders are eager to demonstrate their party\u2019s ability to do more than attack Democratic policies and shut down the government.\n\nRelated: The Senate Baton Passes to McConnell and the GOP\n\nWith time running out on his second term, Obama is determined to preserve and burnish his legislative legacy--that means protecting the Affordable Care Act, immigration reform, and clean air rules from renewed Republican assaults and adverse court rulings.\n\nRepublicans have vowed to roll out a series of measures early in the New Year that would pose a direct challenge to the president\u2019s agenda. That includes yet another bill to derail Obamacare; an amendment to block Obama\u2019s executive order protecting nearly five million illegal immigrants from deportation; obstacles to prevent another executive order restoring diplomatic and commercial ties to Cuba; and legislation that would threaten new economic sanctions against Iran amid negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear research program.\n\nDuring his interview with NPR, the president challenged Republicans to demonstrate they can do more than merely attack his policies.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve got Republicans in a position where it\u2019s not enough for them to simply grind the wheels of Congress to a halt and then blame me,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey are going to be in a position in which they have to show that they can responsibly govern given that they have significant majorities in both chambers. And what I\u2019ve said repeatedly is that I want to work with them, I want to get things done. I don\u2019t have another election to run.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s no question that President Obama has vetoed fewer bills than just about any other president in history.
