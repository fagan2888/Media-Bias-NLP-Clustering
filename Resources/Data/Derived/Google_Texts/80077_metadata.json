Magazine.\n\nBefore Zaida Ramos joined Cooperative Home Care Associates, she was raising her daughter on public assistance, shuttling between dead-end office jobs, and not making ends meet. \u201cI earned in a week what my family spent in a day,\u201d she recalled.\n\nAfter 17 years as a home health aide at Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA), the largest worker-owned co-op in the United States, Ramos recently celebrated her daughter\u2019s college graduation. She\u2019s paying half of her son\u2019s tuition at a Catholic school, and she\u2019s a worker-owner in a business where she enjoys flexible hours, steady earnings, health and dental insurance, plus an annual share in the profits. She\u2019s not rich, she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m financially independent. I belong to a union, and I have a chance to make a difference.\u201d\n\nCan worker-owned businesses lift families out of poverty? \u201cThey did mine,\u201d Ramos said. Should other low-income New Yorkers get involved in co-ops? She says, \u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\nNew York City is going \u2014 in a big way \u2014 for worker-owned cooperatives. Inspired by the model of CHCA and prodded by a new network of co-op members and enthusiasts, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Council allocated $1.2 million to support worker cooperatives in 2015\u2019s budget. According to the Democracy at Work Institute, New York\u2019s investment in co-ops is the largest by any US city government to date.\n\nCooperatives are businesses owned and controlled by their members on the basis of one member, one vote. Given enough time, worker-owned cooperatives tend to increase wages and improve working conditions, and advocates say a local co-op generally stays where it\u2019s founded and acts as a leadership-building force.\n\n\u201cThere is no greater medicine for apathy and feelings of living on the edges of society than to see your own work and your voice make a difference,\u201d says a report on co-ops by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies in New York.\n\nSelling the council on co-ops\n\nThis January, as a new mayor (who ran on combating inequality) and a progressive majority of the City Council were taking office, the Federation\u2019s report inspired Councilmember Maria Del Carmen Arroyo to think about co\u2011ops. \u201cA bulb went off,\u201d she said.\n\nArroyo, incoming chair of the Community Development Committee, represents a South Bronx district that\u2019s still one of the poorest in the nation, even after years of \u201cdevelopment.\u201d National retailers, attracted by tax breaks, typically pay low wages and squeeze out local businesses. Partly in response, the Bronx is also home to an array of co\u2011ops, from the large CHCA to the small Green Worker Cooperatives, which incubates local green businesses.\n\nNew York\u2019s investment in co-ops is the largest by any US city government to date.\n\nWhen Arroyo convened a first-of-its-kind hearing on co-ops this February, New Yorkers packed not one but two hearing rooms at City Hall.\n\nAmong the co-op members who testified was Yadira Fragoso, whose wages rose to $25 an hour \u2014 up from $6.25 \u2014 after becoming a worker-owner at Si Se Puede, a cleaning co-op incubated by the Brooklyn-based Center for Family Life. Translation at the hearing was provided by Caracol, an interpreters\u2019 cooperative mentored by Green Worker Cooperatives.\n\nBy spreading risk and pooling resources, co-ops offer people with little individual wealth a way to start their own businesses and build assets. That said, if starting and sustaining a successful cooperative business were easy, there would probably be more of them.\n\nAs of January 2014, just 23 worker-owned co-ops existed in New York, of which only CHCA employed more than 70 people. Nationwide, according to data from the US Federation of Worker Cooperatives, roughly 300 worker-owned cooperatives average 11 workers each. Lack of public awareness and funding, as well as a weak support system, holds co-ops back, researchers say, and cumbersome city paperwork doesn\u2019t help.\n\nNew graduates from a free training program in July at the Cooperative Home Care Associates offices in the Bronx, NY. (Photo: Stephanie Keith/YES!)\n\nA working model\n\nCHCA is over 90 percent owned by women of color and yet (because of the co-op\u2019s many owners) it hasn\u2019t qualified as a minority- and women-owned business, Arroyo told the hearing. (Such businesses enjoy privileges in bidding for contracts.) \u201cThere\u2019s no earthly reason we can\u2019t change that,\u201d Arroyo said.\n\nIf they are to change anyone\u2019s life for the better, though, co-ops have to be successful businesses, and that\u2019s hard, says Michael Elsas, CEO of CHCA.\n\nThe co-op was founded in 1985 on the premise that if workers owned their own company they could maximize their wages and benefits, and if workers were better trained and better treated, they\u2019d offer better care to their clients. Creating the worker co-op was the first step. But to truly change life for their workers in a race-to-the-bottom industry such as health care, the founders knew they\u2019d have to change the industry.\n\n\u201cThere is no greater medicine for apathy\u2026than to see your own work and your voice make a difference.\u201d\n\nTo that end, CHCA worked on several connected tracks. To raise industry standards, not just for CHCA workers but across the field, CHCA started the worker-run Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute (PHI) that trains agencies across the country while also fighting for policy shifts. (PHI was instrumental in the campaign that recently expanded the Fair Labor Standards Act.)\n\nTo better address the needs of home care clients, in 2000 they created Independence Care System (ICS), a multibillion-dollar managed-care company, which contracts with the city to work with chronically sick and disabled adults. With ICS, CHCA filled an unmet need while also creating its own primary customer to fuel the co-op\u2019s growth. ICS is responsible for 60 percent of CHCA\u2019s business, and the co-op has grown from 500 workers in the late 1990s to 2,300 today.\n\nWorkers become \u201cowners\u201d with a buy-in of $1,000, paid over time. Of today\u2019s 2,300, some 1,100 are worker-owners, Elsas says. The company had $64 million in revenues in 2013. They\u2019ve raised wages, but more important to workers like Ramos are the regular hours, the family health insurance, and membership in the Service Employees International Union Local 1199. In short, respect.\n\nCHCA occupies two floors of a new office building on Fordham Road. Peer-mentors answer caregivers\u2019 calls at desks, with plenty of cushioned sitting-room space for talking. In the PHI training lab, there are no model plastic dummies. Workers in training learn what it\u2019s like to be both caretaker and patient.\n\nWages for CHCA\u2019s health care workers stand at $16 an hour including benefits, Elsas says. It\u2019s not affluence, but it\u2019s still almost twice market rate. Workers enjoy guaranteed hours \u2014 an average of 36 a week, compared to an industry norm of 25 to 30. They\u2019re paid for business meetings, and in a state where the CEO-to-minimum-wage-worker pay ratio stands at 405: 1, the ratio at CHCA hit its highest (11:1) in 2006. Turnover stands at 15 percent, compared with an industry standard close to four times that.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t like it here, I wouldn\u2019t have stayed all these years,\u201d Ramos says.\n\nAsked about New York\u2019s new co-ops, CHCA\u2019s Elsas hesitates. He\u2019s all for making it easier for co-ops to get contracts, but he\u2019s concerned about scale.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not sure that setting up 26 new small co-ops will help change policy or practice,\u201d he says.\n\nHelen Rosenthal was changed by a small co-op: Her mother started one of the first nursery co-ops in Detroit, and she saw how lives improved. Now she chairs the New York City Council\u2019s powerful Committee on Contracts, where she\u2019s helping push the co-op legislation. \u201cWith co-ops, democracy is built into the legal DNA,\u201d she said.\n\nAdministered by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies (FPWA), the city\u2019s new funds will go to 10 nonprofits (among them, Green Worker Cooperatives and the Center for Family Life). The groups must create \u201c234 jobs in worker cooperative businesses, reach 920 cooperative entrepreneurs, provide for the start up of 28 new worker cooperative small businesses and [assist] another 20 existing co-ops.\u201d\n\nWith so few co-ops in existence, creating more is better, says Hilary Abell, author of a new study from the Democracy Collaborative titled Pathways to Scale. More is better. Co-ops thrive in a mutually supportive ecosystem. \u201cBut the biggest need right now is certainly for larger businesses, capable of hiring 100 workers and up,\u201d she says, adding that start-ups may not be the best path to scale: \u201cThere are 200,000 small businesses in the US today, employing half of all America\u2019s workers. Most have no succession plan.\u201d Might some be ripe, she asks, for takeover by their workers?\n\nAfter 92 years of the Federation\u2019s fight against poverty, its leaders are clear: \u201cMaking sure that a safety net exists is not enough to help New Yorkers have satisfying lives. We needed a new approach to workforce development that would not only reduce poverty but also promote upward mobility, and that\u2019s where co-ops can be an anchor,\u201d says Wayne Ho, FPWA\u2019s chief program and policy officer.\n\nFunding for supportive nonprofits is not the only thing co-ops need from cities. In Spain, Northern Italy, Quebec, and France, robust worker co-ops benefit from laws that help co-ops access capital and public contracts. In New York, even as public dollars flow to big businesses as incentives, public spending is on the chopping block. The first city-sponsored trainings with a new, cooperative-inclusive curriculum started this summer, but passing co-op-friendly laws is going to take political power \u2014 of the sort that elected today\u2019s progressive city leadership.\n\nThis $1.2 million won\u2019t end poverty, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction, says Christopher Michael of the New York City Network of Worker Cooperatives. \u201cWe have all the raw ingredients of a successful policy initiative: engaged groups, a bit of a track record and support in the city council\u2026\n\n\u201cThis is just a start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cooperative Home Care Associates has 2,300 workers who enjoy good wages, regular hours, and family health insurance.
