China is the most recent convert, with the planned introduction of insurance for deposits of up to 500,000 yuan from next month.\n\nMr Pillay also called for lower remittance costs in SA, the most expensive of the Group of 20 countries for sending remittances, according to World Bank research. The global average cost of sending remittances in the third quarter of last year was 7.9% of the value sent, while it was 11.3% to send the equivalent of $200 to sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank found. In SA, sending remittances costs an average of 19.5% of the value.\n\nThe Payments Association of SA was working on reformulating tariffs for sending remittances, Mr Pillay said.\n\nDespite his criticism of the banks, Mr Pillay said they had always been willing to participate in the ombud processes.\n\nThe ombud resolved 4,179 cases last year, 69% in favour of banks and 31% in favour of consumers. In 2013, 60% of complaints were resolved in favour of banks and 40% in favour of customers.\n\nStandard Bank accounted for the highest number of cases (1,630), followed by First National Bank (787). Capitec (640), Absa (639) and Nedbank (635) had a similar number of cases.\n\nMr Pillay said the favouring of the banks last year was not typical, as historically there had been an almost equal split between cases resolved in favour of consumers and those in favour of banks.\n\nThe anomaly last year was due to two factors.\n\nFirst, the number of ATM card-swapping complaints \"increased dramatically\" from 27% of ATM complaints in 2013 to 60%. In these cases, customers had tended to be negligent. Second, the ombud and the banks were deadlocked on how to apply and interpret the legal principle of the duty of care. This had been referred to retired judge Frans Malan for a ruling.\n\nWhile that was pending, all cases related to phishing \u2014 where criminals use emails and websites to trick people into revealing their bank account information \u2014 were on hold and, therefore, not included in last year\u2019s figures.\n\nATM complaints have dominated the ombud\u2019s caseload since 2010. Last year, 1,768 cases related to ATMs, with most cases resolved in favour of the banks.\n\nOnly 21% of ATM cases were resolved in favour of consumers, as clients appeared to be unaware of the \"ploys of shoulder surfers and \"helpful\u2019 bystanders\", said Mr Pillay. However, when criminals used sophisticated devices that customers could not be expected to detect, the banks were responsible as they had a duty under the Code of Banking Practice to provide secure systems, said Mr Pillay.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BDlive covers economics, business and politics as the website of Business Day, the South African national daily newspaper, including Business Times", "application-name": "Business Day Live", "og": {"site_name": "Business Day Live", "description": "Ombudsman\u2019s call for new measure echoes similar calls from the International Monetary Fund that SA introduce a safety net for customers if their bank fails", "title": "Banks ombud in push for deposit insurance", "url": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/financial/2015/04/20/banks-ombud-in-push-for-deposit-insurance", "image": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/financial/2012/08/10/banking-customers-xxx/ALTERNATES/crop_100x100/Banking+customers+XXX", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-20 06:43:01.0", "author": "Gillian Jones"}}, "Keywords": "Business Day, Times, Media, Markets, Companies, Stock exchange, finance, economics, investment, Wanted, Peter Bruce, World, Africa, South Africa, news", "msvalidate.01": "7FB4BFB7072B95663F9D473B86922BB1", "google-site-verification": "EzCi3Aoap8anKQL71BTkyxoJIAcfLuVnfQ1mtwy5sU4", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "business_financial", "image": "http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/financial/2012/08/10/banking-customers-xxx/ALTERNATES/crop_258x180/Banking+customers+XXX", "articleid": 390576, "publishtime": "2015-04-20 06:43:01.0"}, "title": "Banks ombud in push for deposit insurance", "author": "Gillian Jones"}}, "article_summary": "Gillian JonesBanks ombud in push for deposit insuranceTHE Ombudsman for Banking Services wants the swift introduction of deposit insurance, particularly to benefit less sophisticated customers.\nThe ombud resolved 4,179 cases last year, 69% in favour of banks and 31% in favour of consumers.\nLast year, 1,768 cases related to ATMs, with most cases resolved in favour of the banks.\nDeposit insurance involves banks paying a small fee on deposits so that if they face insolvency customers will be paid a major portion of their deposits.\nDespite his criticism of the banks, Mr Pillay said they had always been willing to participate in the ombud processes."}
