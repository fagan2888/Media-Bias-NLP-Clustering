But here\u2019s a little known fact: Some forms of insulin can be bought without a prescription.\n\nCarmen Smith did that for six years when she didn\u2019t have health insurance, and didn\u2019t have a primary care doctor. She bought her insulin without a prescription at Wal-Mart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we go in our trench coat and a top hat, saying, \u2018Uh I need the insulin,'\u201d says Smith, who lives in Cleveland. \u201cThe clerks usually don\u2019t know it\u2019s a big secret. They\u2019ll just go, \u2018Do we sell over-the-counter insulin?'\u201d\n\nOnce the pharmacist says yes, the clerk just goes to get it, Smith says. \u201cAnd you purchase it and go about your business.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s still a pretty uncommon purchase.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t learn from a doctor that she could buy insulin that way. In fact, many doctors don\u2019t know it\u2019s possible. When she no longer had insurance to help pay for doctors\u2019 appointments or medicine, Smith happened to ask at Wal-Mart if she could get vials of the medicine without a prescription. To figure out the dose, she just used the same amount a doctor had given her years before.\n\nIt was a way to survive, she says, but no way to live. It was horrible when she didn\u2019t get the size of the dose or the timing quite right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quick high and then, it\u2019s a down,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe down part is, you feel icky. You feel lifeless. You feel pain. And the cramps are so intense \u2014 till you can\u2019t walk, you can\u2019t sit, you can\u2019t stand.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s guesswork put her in the emergency room of MetroHealth, Cleveland\u2019s public hospital, several times across six years.\n\nThe availability of insulin over the counter presents a real conundrum. As Smith\u2019s experience shows, without training or guidance from a health care provider, it can be dangerous for a patient to guess at the best dosage and timing from version to version of insulin. On the other hand, being able to afford and easily buy some when she needed it may have saved her life.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Medicaid,Public Health,Public Radio Partnership,Syndicate,Diabetes,FDA", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Versions sold that way are based on older formulas, and make tight control of blood sugar harder.
