Law Enforcement officials say the woman suspected of robbing a Reeds Jewelry store in Panama City Beach back in August is at it again, but this time in Tennessee.

Friday morning, employees at a Jared Jewelry store in Sevierville, Tennessee, say a woman entered the store, displayed what looked like a large-caliber black and silver pistol, and then ordered the employees to the back office.

Reports state, she then tied their hands with zip ties, took some jewelry and then fled.

No one was injured.

The woman is described as white, 25-30 years of age and wearing navy blue hospital scrubs, white shoes, and a Gray University of Alabama hat.

Incidents similar to this have also occurred in Georgia and South Carolina.
