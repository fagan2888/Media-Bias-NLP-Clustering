People who drive electric cars can now find charging stations along the National Mall.

Two charging stations have been installed on the National Mall, located at Madison Drive across from the National Museum of American History and on Jefferson Drive across from the National Air and Space Museum, the National Park Service announced Wednesday.

There are other public charging stations in downtown Washington, but these two stations are the first to be installed on the National Mall. They cost $2 per hour.

The National Park Service is furthering its energy conservation efforts, Acting Superintendent Karen Cucurullo said.

"As the National Park Service prepares for its second century of service to the American people, we are committed to providing clean and green energy to promote a healthy environment," she said.

The group received a grant from the Clean Cities National Parks Initiative for the project. The Clean Cities Program funds and supports alternative fuels and vehicle replacement projects at national parks across the country.
