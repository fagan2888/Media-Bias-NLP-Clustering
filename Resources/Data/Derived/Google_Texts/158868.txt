Sioux Falls, SD

More than 20 local artists were under the same roof Sunday to show off their best work.

Augustana College presented the 35th annual Artists of the Plains Art Show. There was a wide variety of art on display, from paintings to pottery to ceramics. Jennifer White of Prairie Star Gallery says as the population of Sioux Falls increases, so does the interest in local art.

"The city of Sioux Falls is growing. The art scene is booming. It's robust here, man. People are growing very cool to the idea that fine art means something here. It's cool," White says.

Several art students from Augustana also showed off their work today. This event is the largest and longest running show if its kind in the region.
