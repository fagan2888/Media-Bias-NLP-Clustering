President Barack Obama jogs up to the stage to speak about the Affordable Care Act on March 3, 2016, in Milwaukee. Slightly more Americans currently approve of his job in office than disapprove, according to HuffPost Pollster.

President Barack Obama is enjoying some of the highest ratings of his second term in office. A new Gallup poll out on Thursday shows that 50 percent of Americans surveyed approve of the job he's doing in office -- his highest rating in that poll since early 2013.

The higher Gallup ratings are reflected in HuffPost Pollster's average of Obama's job approval ratings. The Pollster average shows that 48.4 percent of Americans approve of the job he’s doing in office, while 48.2 percent give him negative ratings. The margin is narrow -- that’s only 0.2 percent net positive -- but it’s the first time Obama’s job approval ratings have reached positive territory in the HuffPost Pollster average since his re-election honeymoon period ended in the spring of 2013.

The HuffPost Pollster chart average is configured to not give any one poll much weight, meaning that the average changes slowly.
