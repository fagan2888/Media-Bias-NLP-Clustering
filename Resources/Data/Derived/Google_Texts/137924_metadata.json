But environmentalist Simran Sethi has an appealing new argument in \u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate.\u201d She explains how the pleasures of tasty food and drink are also threatened, and suggests that protecting biodiversity can help us reclaim a diversity of flavors, too.\n\nFrom pistachios to wine and chocolate to coffee, Sethi shows that the foods we love have been biologically dumbed-down to feed the masses. Bananas? One species dominates worldwide production, even though hundreds more - with more flavors - exist. The U.S. pistachio industry? Descended from one species. Wine? A half-dozen French and European varieties dominate vineyards and restaurant lists, but more than 1,000 wine grapes exist.\n\nSethi, a former NBC News correspondent, notes that 75 percent of the world\u2019s food comes from just 12 plant and five animal species, often treated with the same fertilizers and pesticides. In practical terms that sameness raises the risk of global disease outbreaks, just as hospital bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics. It also means that uniquely tasty regional crops are at risk of dying out, leaving farmers from Australia to Europe and the Americas fighting for a sliver of the same global market. \u201cWhile we debate GMOs and the merits of Paleo (diets) \u2026 we\u2019re losing the foundation of food,\u201d Sethi writes, since diversity is the foundation for tastes and smells, and for resistance to pests, drought and disease.\n\n\u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate\u201d is full of wonderfully geeky bits of science, including an excellent section on how memory and culture influences our perception of taste. But Sethi\u2019s friendly, welcoming tone makes serious topics digestible and pleasurable. \u201cEat and drink with reverence and gusto, whether it\u2019s a Big Mac or a mountain of kale,\u201d she writes, with an admirable lack of foodie pretension.\n\n\u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate\u201d is passionate without being dogmatic: Sethi understands that global change takes time, and that poor farmers in India can\u2019t just flip a switch and turn to small-scale, heirloom crops. Sethi acknowledges extinctions, climate change and heartbreak, but leaves readers with the hope that individual choices will make a difference over time, and that the love of food can be joyous and part of a meaningful commitment to the environment.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://simransethi.com/\n\n___\n\nOn Twitter: @kbegos", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Bread, Wine, Chocolate: The Slow Loss of Foods We Love\" (HarperOne), by Simran Sethi", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate: The Slow Loss of Foods We Love\u201d (HarperOne), by Simran Sethi", "title": "\u2018Bread, Wine, Chocolate\u2019 makes environmental issues tasty", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/23/bread-wine-chocolate-makes-environmental-issues-ta/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/23/book_review-bread_wine_chocolate_.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/23/book_review-bread_wine_chocolate_.jpeg", "description": "\"Bread, Wine, Chocolate: The Slow Loss of Foods We Love\" (HarperOne), by Simran Sethi", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Bread, Wine, Chocolate\u2019 makes environmental issues tasty"}, "Author": "KEVIN BEGOS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe406a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate\u201d is full of wonderfully geeky bits of science, including an excellent section on how memory and culture influences our perception of taste.\nFrom pistachios to wine and chocolate to coffee, Sethi shows that the foods we love have been biologically dumbed-down to feed the masses.\nBut environmentalist Simran Sethi has an appealing new argument in \u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate.\u201d She explains how the pleasures of tasty food and drink are also threatened, and suggests that protecting biodiversity can help us reclaim a diversity of flavors, too.\n\u201cBread, Wine, Chocolate\u201d is passionate without being dogmatic: Sethi understands that global change takes time, and that poor farmers in India can\u2019t just flip a switch and turn to small-scale, heirloom crops.\n\u201cWhile we debate GMOs and the merits of Paleo (diets) \u2026 we\u2019re losing the foundation of food,\u201d Sethi writes, since diversity is the foundation for tastes and smells, and for resistance to pests, drought and disease."}
