Trump,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nRepeating, as he frequently does, that he is self-financing his campaign, Trump demanded that CNN \u201cview the second debate broadcast as a public service and not accept the massive profits that this airing will generate. I believe that all profits from this broadcast should go to various VETERANS groups, a list of which I will send to you in the near future.\u201d\n\nTrump closed by asking Zucker to give him a decision as soon as possible.\n\nThough the letter is dated September 8, Trump released it via his Twitter feed this morning, as well as in an email sent to journalists covering his campaign.\n\nRelated: Trump and Cruz, the Bad Boy of the Senate, Put GOP Leaders on Notice\n\nIt is unclear at this point how CNN will respond to the billionaire\u2019s unorthodox request, but it creates a raft of potential consequences for how the debate will be viewed and how CNN moderators\u2019 treatment of Trump will be perceived.\n\nFirst, assume CNN declines to donate all or part of the profits to veterans\u2019 charities.\n\nTrump will have embarrassed the network and made it look greedy. So if, during the debate, the moderators are particularly hard on Trump \u2013 something that, as frontrunner, he ought to expect \u2013 he will have a ready-made claim of unfair treatment, complete with an alleged motive.\n\nWhat if CNN does donate to veterans charities? Then, not only does the network look as though it can be pushed around by a loudmouthed billionaire, it also gives Trump another plausible complaint in the event moderators are particularly tough in their questioning. \u201cSee?\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cThey were angry at me for forcing them to give money to veterans.\u201d\n\nRelated: With Trump and Sanders Riding High, How Low Will Bush and Clinton Go?\n\nAnother benefit for Trump in this move is that it will help soften criticism he is likely to receive over comments he made about his experience as a student at a military academy during his high school years.\n\nIn an interview with the author of an upcoming biography, Trump said that because of his youthful experience at New York Military Academy, he \u201calways felt I was in the military.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew immediate scorn from detractors, and are likely to come up when other candidates challenge Trump during next week\u2019s debate. His letter demanding that CNN turn over its windfall profits to veterans groups \u2013 no matter how the network reacts \u2013 will give him an easy talking point to pivot to in an emergency.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Demonstrating once again that he plays by no rules other than the ones he makes up as", "title": "Trump to CNN: Donate Debate Profits to Vets", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/Trump-CNN-Donate-Debate-Profits-Vets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-juryduty_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/Trump-CNN-Donate-Debate-Profits-Vets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-juryduty_2.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Demonstrating once again that he plays by no rules other than the ones he makes up as", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcac\"", "article_summary": "What if CNN does donate to veterans charities?\nFirst, assume CNN declines to donate all or part of the profits to veterans\u2019 charities.\nRepeating, as he frequently does, that he is self-financing his campaign, Trump demanded that CNN \u201cview the second debate broadcast as a public service and not accept the massive profits that this airing will generate.\nHis letter demanding that CNN turn over its windfall profits to veterans groups \u2013 no matter how the network reacts \u2013 will give him an easy talking point to pivot to in an emergency.\nIn a letter to Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, Trump on Tuesday referred to reports over the weekend that CNN\u2019s ad rates for the debate, which is scheduled for next Wednesday, September 16, had soared from $5,000 to $200,000 and could go higher."}
