This is the first time we have been asked to assist in the care of a sea turtle, which are excellent divers themselves.\u201d\n\nTucker was given pure oxygen in the chamber and a video posted on Thursday shows he\u2019s getting along just swimmingly.\n\nTucker the Turtle is recovering at @SeattleAquarium from hyperbaric treatment at @VirginiaMasonpic.twitter.com/lZfMa7yEv1 \u2014 Jeff Pohjola (@JeffPohjola) March 31, 2016\n\nFor whatever reason, Tucker couldn\u2019t let the belly bubble out the old fashioned way, even though turtles are known for epic breaking of wind (and sometimes water).\n\nTucker won\u2019t be returned to the wild until he\u2019s able to regulate his buoyancy, because he won\u2019t survive if he can\u2019t dive for food or to avoid human predators on their oil-powered boats.\n\nSpeaking of oil, or rather the climate change and rising ocean levels caused by the human use of oil, the ability of sea turtles to hatch their eggs is being disrupted.\n\nAs this video from the New England Aquarium explains, turtles that follow their ancient instincts and return to the beach of their birth, often find the ocean has swallowed it up.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poor Tucker!
