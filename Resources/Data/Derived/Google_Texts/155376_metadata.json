Though the proposal has some puzzling dimensions, it represents a welcome step toward providing more people in our state access to health care.\n\nTennessee is one of 19 states that have opted not to expand their Medicaid programs as allowed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Last year, after 18 months of planning in consultation with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Gov. Bill Haslam pushed Insure Tennessee as an alternative to simply expanding TennCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program. The bill died in Senate committees, leaving an estimated 280,000 low-income Tennesseans without access to insurance coverage and placing rural hospitals at financial risk.\n\nConceived as a two-year pilot program, Insure Tennessee consists of two plans. One would provide financial assistance to people with access to employer-provided insurance but who cannot afford coverage. The other would feature a combination of TennCare benefits and health care accounts containing credits that could be applied to copays and premiums. Participants could earn additional credits for healthy life choices such as quitting smoking.\n\nImportantly, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has already given provisional approval of the plan and the Tennessee Hospital Association pledged to cover any costs not borne by the federal government. The state could opt out if the federal government or the hospital association back out of their commitments.\n\nWith Haslam at her side, Harwell said on April13 her \u201c3-Star Healthy Project\u201d task force would apply \u201cconservative Tennessee principles\u201d to come up with a plan to take to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in June. She envisions the plan would largely consist of experimental pilot programs, with limited enrollment and features like health savings accounts, premiums and incentives for healthy behaviors by enrollees and \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that would halt the programs if costs exceed projections.\n\nIn other words, it would be a remixed and hopefully politically palatable version of Insure Tennessee.\n\nThe task force members either opposed Insure Tennessee or hold key House committee positions. They are Cameron Sexton of Crossville, the task force chairman, who chairs the House Health Committee; Steve McManus of Memphis, who chairs the Insurance and Banking Committee; Roger Kane of Knoxville, who is in the insurance industry; and Matthew Hill of Jonesborough. All are Republicans. There are no senators on the task force.\n\nComing just after the qualifying deadline for the August primary, the timing of the announcement seemed based on election-year politics. All the task force members are unopposed in the primary and now are safe from challengers who could count on an avalanche of negative advertising from ultra-conservative groups opposed to any type of Medicaid expansion.\n\nDemocrats, who by and large supported Insure Tennessee, were unimpressed with Harwell\u2019s effort. \u201cWhat a sad political joke. What a political charade,\u201d said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart of Nashville.\n\nHarwell\u2019s proposal could be seen as an indication GOP lawmakers are looking for a politically acceptable way to overcome their aversion to anything connected to the Affordable Care Act. Polls show a solid bipartisan majority of Tennesseans support Insure Tennessee.\n\nThe task force is charged with achieving in two months what the Haslam administration spent a year and a half doing - arriving at a plan the federal government would approve that would not cost the state a single additional penny. Task force members would be wise use the governor\u2019s sound, fiscally and socially responsible plan as the centerpiece of their effort.\n\nOnline: http://www.knoxnews.com/\n\n____\n\nApril 17\n\nThe Johnson City Press on drowsy driving:\n\nLaw enforcement officials routinely advise drivers of things they should and shouldn\u2019t do when they take to the highways. Following the speed limit is something drivers should be doing. Wearing a seat belt is another thing they should always be doing.\n\nMotorists shouldn\u2019t drink and drive. Nor should they text when they are behind the wheel. That, like talking on a phone, is considered distracted driving.\n\nNow, officials with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are focusing on a growing safety threat on this nation\u2019s highways - drowsy driving. The NHTSA estimates at least 100,000 crashes reported to police annually are caused by a sleepy driver.\n\nOfficials from the NHTSA say teenagers and young adults are the most likely to suffer from drowsy driving, as are shift workers and those who have a sleeping disorder. Drowsy driving is most likely to occur between midnight and 6 a.m., and is made particularly dangerous if the motorist has consumed alcohol.\n\nIf you begin feeling drowsy behind the wheel, experts advise you consume some caffeine (the equivalent of two cups of coffee should do) and find to safe spot to take at least a 20-minute nap before heading to a motel, friend\u2019s house or home for a decent night\u2019s sleep.\n\nOnline: http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/\n\n____\n\nApril 18\n\nThe Leaf-Chronicle on Gov. Haslam\u2019s decision to veto the Bible bill:\n\nVetoing the so-called Bible bill took courage for Gov. Bill Haslam, but there\u2019s no question he made the right decision.\n\nHaslam was consistent in his disapproval of the measure throughout its course through the state legislature both last year and this year. It will again come up again this week when Sen. Steve Southerland tries to get the simple majority to override the veto.\n\nIt\u2019s a waste of time and taxpayer dollars to be going through this year in and year out. There are literally dozens of other more important issues that the legislature needs to be focusing on more than some trivial grandstanding measure to get one over on someone else.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really all it is.\n\nThe weight and power of the Bible bill is in the message. It\u2019s the first step toward theocracy, and marginalizes anyone who doesn\u2019t value the words of the Bible as highly as Christians do. You know, people like Jews, and Buddhists and Muslims (gasp!).\n\nThere is clear language in the U.S. Constitution and the Tennessee Constitution that clearly states neither governmental authority should respect one religion over another.\n\nEven though it might be technically a trivial matter, making the Bible the state\u2019s official book is exactly that. Not to mention it will make Tennessee a target for mockery and insult.\n\nElected leaders use their faith to guide them, but they should not forcefully establish their faith over anyone else\u2019s.\n\nJust as there are dozens of more important issues for the legislature to discuss, there are dozens more books that would make better official state books. (How about \u201cAll the King\u2019s Men,\u201d for example? It won a Pulitzer and Robert Penn Warren graduated from Clarksville High School.)\n\nWe hope that the Senate chooses to not override Haslam\u2019s wishes, especially Sen. Mark Green, who Clarksville chose to make these decisions on its behalf.\n\nOnline: http://www.theleafchronicle.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recent editorials from Tennessee newspapers:", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/20/tennessee-editorial-roundup/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Recent editorials from Tennessee newspapers:", "title": "Tennessee editorial roundup"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Recent editorials from Tennessee newspapers:", "card": "summary", "title": "Tennessee editorial roundup"}, "Author": "The Associated Press", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "In other words, it would be a remixed and hopefully politically palatable version of Insure Tennessee.\nConceived as a two-year pilot program, Insure Tennessee consists of two plans.\nThe task force members either opposed Insure Tennessee or hold key House committee positions.\nDemocrats, who by and large supported Insure Tennessee, were unimpressed with Harwell\u2019s effort.\nBill Haslam pushed Insure Tennessee as an alternative to simply expanding TennCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program."}
