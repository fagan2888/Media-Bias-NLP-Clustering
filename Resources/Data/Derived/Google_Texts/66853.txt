WHAT’S AT STAKE

The national championship. Clemson would become the first 15-0 FBS champion while Alabama would win its fourth national title in seven seasons.

KEY MATCHUP

Clemson QB Deshaun Watson vs. Alabama’s front seven. Watson set the Atlantic Coast Conference mark for total offense with 4,731 yards, 1,032 of those coming on the ground. He’s led Clemson to 10 straight games with 500 or more yards of offense. Watson, though, may not have seen a group like Alabama’s defensive line and linebackers, who had nine sacks in slowing down Mississippi State’s Dak Prescott — possibly the best dual-threat QB the Tide have faced before Watson.

PLAYERS TO WATCH

Alabama: RB Derrick Henry is the Heisman Trophy winner with 2,061 yards rushing and 25 touchdowns in his first season as the Crimson Tide’s fulltime starter. The rushing yards and touchdowns are SEC records. He surpassed Herschel Walker’s yardage total and the TD mark of Tim Tebow and Tre Mason.

Clemson: CB Mackensie Alexander is the leader of the secondary, a lock down corner who usually shadows the opponent’s best receiver. This time, that’s Calvin Ridley of Alabama. Alexander has six pass break ups, but zero interceptions — mostly because quarterbacks don’t test him much.
