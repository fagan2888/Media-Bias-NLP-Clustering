Media mogul Arianna Huffington stopped by "New Day" Wednesday to talk about her tips for success and greater well-being. She addresses these issues in her 14th book â€“ "Thrive."

On the show, Huffington talked about her personal wake-up call, which she said came in the form of a broken cheekbone and a nasty gash over her eye - the result of a fall brought on by exhaustion and lack of sleep.

"By any sane definition of success, if you are lying in a pool of blood on the floor of your office, you are not successful," she said.

The Huffington Post founder revealed that this experience made her question: is this really what success feels like?

"We discovered what was wrong with me was the way I was living my life," she told our "New Day" anchors.

According to her book jacket: "Our current definition of success is...literally killing us."

Huffington stressed the transformative effects meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving can have on us all.

Her first suggested simple step to success: "get 30 minutes more sleep a night than you're getting now."
