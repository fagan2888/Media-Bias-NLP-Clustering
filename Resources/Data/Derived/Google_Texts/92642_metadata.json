The primary giveaway to the scam is in the body of the email where it plainly states: \u2018FOLLOW LINK.'\n\n\u201cInstead of being hosted on a dol.gov server, like the real Department of Labor documents, this one is \u201chosted\u201d on the website of a Turkish nutrition business,\u201d Ducklin wrote.\n\n\u201cJudging by the URL that the crooks have used, it looks as though they've camped in a subdirectory on the server that belongs to a WordPress plugin. If so, that plugin is presumably one that either has not been correctly configured, or, more likely, has not been patched against known security holes.\u201d\n\nThe PDF document that recipients are asked to download and open is named \u201chealth_coverage_webcast.pdf;\u201d however, it is actually a .SCR file \u2013 or a screensaver file \u2013 and opening it ultimately results in the recipient's computer being infected with a variant of Vawtrak banking malware that is detected by Sophos as Mal/Vawtrak-H.\n\nRecently, the number of reported scams and phishing campaigns seems to be on the rise, but Aaron Higbee, CTO of PhishMe, told SCMagazine.com in a Friday email correspondence that there is no specific time of year when phishing activity regularly peaks. Notably, he said that leveraging current events is effective all the time.\n\n\u201cPhishing is effective regardless of the season,\u201d Higbee said, going on to add, \u201cFor enterprises, defending against phishing is important all 12 months of the year, which is why training employees to recognize and report phishing emails should be a continuous effort that occurs at various times throughout the year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,congress.scmagazine.com,etouches.com,eventsforce.net,media.scmagazine.com,scmagazine.com", "news_keywords": "Cyber Threats, Malware", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "SC Magazine", "description": "US-CERT issued an advisory on Thursday, warning of phishing emails referencing the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Affordable Care Act phishing campaign identified, US-CERT issues advisory", "url": "http://www.scmagazine.com/news/phishing-messages-claim-to-be-from-a-federal-agency/article/393053/", "image": "http://media.scmagazine.com/images/2014/09/19/phishing1_658901_658903.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US-CERT issued an advisory on Thursday, warning of phishing emails referencing the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Affordable Care Act phishing campaign identified, US-CERT issues advisory", "image": {"src": "http://media.scmagazine.com/images/2014/09/19/phishing1_658901_658903.jpg"}, "creator": "@https://twitter.com/writingadam", "site": "@scmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=623450625", "fb": {"app_id": 196538560371925}, "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Malware", "published_time": "2015-01-16T14:22:05", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T15:11:46"}, "google-site-verification": "JC1nb6wLjs3e_RfpxNJDwD8GFy9iD0hhb2LCWo7cwjE", "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "US-CERT issued an advisory on Thursday, warning of phishing emails referencing the Affordable Care Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ba8\"", "article_summary": "Affordable Care Act phishing campaign identified, US-CERT issues advisoryShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintSophosLabs became the recipient of an email that references the Affordable Care Act and purports to come from the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\u201cThe phishing emails reference the Affordable Care Act in the subject and claim to direct users to health coverage information, but instead direct them to sites which attempt to elicit private information or install malicious code,\u201d according to the advisory.\nThe United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) issued an advisory on Thursday, stating it is aware of phishing campaign that involves communications claiming to be from a U.S. federal government agency.\nThe primary giveaway to the scam is in the body of the email where it plainly states: \u2018FOLLOW LINK.'\nThat message states that the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration has updated its Affordable Care Act web page, and the recipients should follow a link and download and open a PDF document, according to a Wednesday post by Paul Ducklin, of Sophos."}
