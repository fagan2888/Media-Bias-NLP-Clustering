Jones was there to catch it, turning the near-interception into an 18-yard gain.\n\nThen the Washington Redskins\u2019 running back nearly gave the ball to the Chicago Bears\u2018 defense.\n\nSEE ALSO: Redskins players happy with win, but want to be better amid push for playoffs\n\nJamison Crowder realized Jones hadn\u2019t been touched yet, so he tried to help Jones up. Jones, who had his back to Crowder, thought a Bears defender had touched him down, and once he put the ball down, Bears safety Adrian Amos lunged for it.\n\nJones scrambled to pick the ball up and safely secured it at the Bears\u2018 45-yard line. With 4:09 to play in the fourth quarter, the Redskins avoided a catastrophic turnover and held on for a 24-21 win at Soldier Field.\n\n\u201cI hit the ground and thought, \u2018I just made a big play, I\u2019m gonna go run the ball again,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of nothing else. As soon as I let it go I was like, \u2018Shoot, why y\u2019all trying to get the ball?\u2019\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Jordan Reed again proves himself as difference-maker in Redskins\u2019 offense\n\nAs Jones recounted the play in the locker room, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Neither could inside linebacker Will Compton, yet his frantic account of the play made it clear there was nothing funny about it when it happened.\n\n\u201cWhen Kirk broke it, he did a hell of a job getting out of the pocket,\u201d Compton said. \u201cHe looks downfield, everybody is locked up. I\u2019m like, \u2018Son of a [expletive], we\u2019re going to have to go back out there. We got to do something.\u2019 He just throws it up and I\u2019m like, \u2018For the love of God.\u2019 It tips around, I\u2019m throwing it up, I\u2019m throwing it to Jordan Reed. We still have a good probability. Matt caught it, a sigh of relief, then he put it down. I don\u2019t even know what was happening.\u201d\n\nEven if the Bears had recovered the ball, officials ruled Jones had given himself up on the play. Both Amos and Chicago coach John Fox said that Jones was ruled down. Amos tried scooping the ball up anyway.\n\nCousins knew it was a dangerous pass, but he also felt confident that the 6-foot-2 Reed had an advantage on the defender.\n\n\u201cI saw Jordan, basically, with his defender\u2019s back turned, and I felt like I could give him what we call an \u2018opportunity ball,\u2019\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but maybe [it\u2019s] an opportunity to make a play. It\u2019s living dangerously, and I don\u2019t know that you want to do that all the time. You\u2019re going to die by that more than you\u2019ll live by that, but we were fortunate today. Sometimes, to win, you need that kind of thing to fall your way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jones reeled in an 18-yard reception after it deflected off of tight end Jordan Reed's hands.
