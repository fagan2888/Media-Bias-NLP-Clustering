The fact is, you make some strong points against the tax. But read on, as you may find I\u2019ve got even stronger ones, especially given the reality of tax policy today and some ideas for compromise.\n\nAs you know, the Cadillac tax, which takes effect in 2018, is a 40 percent excise tax on the value of insurance premiums over a threshold of $10,200 for self-coverage and $27,500 for family plans. It is expected to raise about $90 billion over 10 years to support the ACA, and much more after that. Here are some of your most pointed objections to it:\n\n\u2014 Yes, the tax exclusion \u2014 the fact that health benefits are treated more favorably than wages \u2014 leads to wasteful spending on health coverage; but the Cadillac tax doesn\u2019t just hit such \u201cexcess\u201d care; it discourages necessary care that many won\u2019t be able to afford once it causes employers to increase out-of-pocket costs or impose high deductibles.\n\n\u2014 Those of us in unions traded away wage increases for these valuable plans, which looked like a fair trade-off at the time. Put this tax in the mix and that trade-off looks a lot less favorable.\n\n\u2014 And please don\u2019t try to serenade me with your economic theory about how if we traded wages for benefits back then, we\u2019re going to get back wages when we give up benefits now. Won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u2014 Even if it did, health benefits get the tax exclusion while wages do not, so even if the pretax trade-off were dollar-for-dollar, the post-tax trade-off would be less than that.\n\nCounterarguments exist, and I\u2019ll get to them. Some are stronger than others \u2014 your trade-off points are well taken. But here\u2019s the fact that I fear you are seriously overlooking: the Cadillac tax isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 no tax is. But it is on the books, and if you repeal it, you will not be able to replace it.\n\nI realize that\u2019s a political prediction but I am confident that it is correct. Instead, you will be joining forces with those trying to kill Obamacare in repealing one of its important revenue sources. If you want the ACA to continue to grow, flourish, and solidly cement its place in the firmament of public policies that, because they solve big market failures, are treasured by large majorities, then you cannot in good faith support repeal of a key funding source unless you can replace it with a better one, which I\u2019m certain you cannot.\n\nThis political point is perhaps made more salient when you consider some counterarguments to your objections. Your concern that the tax will take too large a bite out of necessary, versus excessive, care does not square with either my own analysis or that of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax analysis. They estimate that the plans of only 4 percent of those with employer coverage will surpass the thresholds in 2018. More importantly, since what matters is not whether your plan is subject to the tax but how much in terms of dollars would be hit by it, Treasury estimates that only 1 percent of plan costs will be over the thresholds that year, and that assumes employers do nothing to avoid this outcome. That share will grow, but stick with me, because that may be an area where we can find some compromise.\n\nThere\u2019s also reason to believe that imposing cost-sharing on employees won\u2019t be the only way employers lower premium costs to avoid the tax. They\u2019ll have an incentive they currently lack to negotiate for lower costs and to tap rising efficiencies like bundled payments and related models of care coordination that pay for quality over quantity.\n\nYou also challenge the assumption that what employers used to put into your health plans, they\u2019ll now put into your paycheck. My read of the evidence is that over the long term, this assumption is valid, even if it isn\u2019t dollar for dollar, but (a) the long-term could be far away, and you and I both have long worried about wage stagnation, and (b) this result is less likely to hold in slack labor markets.\n\nI agree. But you know that the goal of my work is to get to full employment and thus boost the bargaining power of middle and low-wage workers. Surely, this is a primary goal for both of us, regardless of the outcome of this debate. With the Caddy tax in place, achieving our full employment goal is even more urgent. Repealing the tax won\u2019t change that, but it will, by undermining the viability of the ACA, strike a blow at job quality, as millions of working people could end up with less affordable access to coverage.\n\nFinally, my political point \u2014 if you repeal, you won\u2019t replace \u2014 gets even stronger if we begin to consider some compromises. The thresholds are already set to adjust for plans that are more expensive due to age, gender, high-risk industries and occupations, and numbers of retirees.\n\nThat leaves out another significant source of price variation: geography. Suppose the thresholds also were adjusted to kick in at higher levels in parts of the country with higher health care costs and at lower levels in places with lower costs (keyed off of some standard plan so we\u2019d know we\u2019re adjusting for price, not quality, differences). Also, if it turns out that over the long run, indexing the thresholds to the Consumer Price Index (as in current law) leads to a situation wherein affordable, quality access is compromised, we should index to a different measure that will thereafter avoid this outcome.\n\nThat might cut into the revenue projections but it would still be the right thing to do.\n\nLook, in sharp distinction to the ideologically motivated enemies of Obamacare, we share the same goal: affordable, quality health care that squeezes the unsustainable, wasteful inefficiencies out of our uniquely expensive U.S. system. If it turns out that the Cadillac tax undermines that goal, then I will work with you to change that. I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t be the case, especially if we make further adjustments to the thresholds.\n\nBut if our support for the ACA is split at this critical stage of its evolution, it will be dealt a serious blow. Let\u2019s work together to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opponents of the Cadillac tax who support Obamacare think the tax can be repealed and replaced.
