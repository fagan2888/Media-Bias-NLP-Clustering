Way back in 2005, Kunkel wrote a novel no one heard of called \u201cIndecision.\u201d This was after he co-founded a New York-based literary journal no one heard of.\n\nThe New Yorker is gaga over Kunkel, though, and devoted a whopping 3700 words to him and his new book, \u201cUtopia or Bust.\u201d The magazine seems awfully excited over the fact that Kunkel is now an \u201cunapologetic \u2026 Marxist Intellectual.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFrom Rio, it was back to Buenos Aires, but only briefly. Kunkel is from Colorado and had been following the Denver Broncos\u2019 march through the playoffs quite closely, which is one reason why he\u2019s here in New York on Super Bowl Sunday, six weeks before the publication of his second book and first in nine years, a collection of rigorous and unapologetically Marxist essays called Utopia or Bust.\n\nFor a Marxist, Kenkel sure does seem to live the high-life with all that fancy traveling. Gawker points out that the New Yorker\u2019s favorite Marxist Intellectual owns *gasp* property \u2014 a pied-\u00e0-terre in Union Square.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that there is no such thing as a \u201cMarxist Intellectual.\u201d Marxism has as much to do with intellect as an Uzi does with a banana. Marxism is navel gazing while masturbating while riding a unicorn. Marxism is a mess of egghead theories that have absolutely no basis in reality. Marxism is wholly ignorant of the real world and the human spirit. This is why Marxism always fails (see: Care, Obama) or can only come close to fruition through government oppression and terrorism (see: Stalin, Joseph).\n\nThanks to Kenkel\u2019s perfectly-perfect politics, perfectly-tousled hair, perfectly-trimmed beard stubble, and perfectly-posed stare off into his own destiny, the truth doesn\u2019t really matter. Join the collective; embrace The Next Big Thing.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Benjamin Kunkel: The Lena Dunham of Literature", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Benjamin Kunkel: The Lena Dunham of Literature", "title": "Benjamin Kunkel: The Lena Dunham of Literature - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/03/12/a_560x0.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/03/12/benjamin-kunkel-the-lena-dunham-of-literature/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Benjamin Kunkel: The Lena Dunham of Literature", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/03/12/a_560x0.jpg", "title": "Benjamin Kunkel: The Lena Dunham of Literature - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Lena Dunham, Twitter,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-03-12T11:18:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab69\"", "article_summary": "Gawker points out that the New Yorker\u2019s favorite Marxist Intellectual owns *gasp* property \u2014 a pied-\u00e0-terre in Union Square.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe urban provincials at New York Magazine have found their new Lena Dunham, a novelist named Benjamin Kunkel who they are primping to be the next big thing no one has ever heard of.\nWay back in 2005, Kunkel wrote a novel no one heard of called \u201cIndecision.\u201d This was after he co-founded a New York-based literary journal no one heard of.\nIt is worth pointing out that there is no such thing as a \u201cMarxist Intellectual.\u201d Marxism has as much to do with intellect as an Uzi does with a banana.\nFor a Marxist, Kenkel sure does seem to live the high-life with all that fancy traveling."}
