Biden\u2019s road to running\n\nSome of it is political. Much of it is emotional.\n\nAnd as Vice President Joe Biden mulls joining the 2016 presidential race, close advisers and allies say they are not sure what he will decide, and suggest it is a waste of time to try to read tea leaves from one conversation to the next.\n\nSo they are preparing, and answering his questions.\n\nAmong the things the vice president has been told, according to several sources familiar with meetings and conversations over the past few weeks:\n\n\u2022 That it will be difficult but not impossible to assemble a viable campaign operation. Not impossible, but nowhere near on par with the depth and experience level of the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\n\u2022 That, in the view of several people involved, the best way to think of the possibility is with the framework of a four-state initial strategy: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The idea here is that, if Biden were to run, the first four contests on the nominating calendar would deliver a clear verdict as to whether he had a real chance to knock Clinton from her front-runner status or whether a third Biden presidential run was destined to end in disappointment like the first two.\n\n\u2022 That to mount a reasonable campaign in those states it would be wise to think in the ballpark of $25 million to $30 million, plus $100 million. The smaller figure would be hard money \u2014 smaller contributions to the official campaign organization; the larger would be for a pro-Biden super PAC.\n\n\u2022 There are competing thoughts on a timetable, though there is a general consensus that October 1 is as late as the VP could wait to decide.\n\nOne joke being kicked around in Biden circles \u2014 assuming he decided to run \u2014 calls for a morning announcement on October 13 and then a dramatic appearance that night at the first Democratic primary debate, in Nevada. Again, that\u2019s a joke.\n\n2. Bill Clinton defends his record and puts Hillary in an awkward spot \u2014 again\n\nThe Glass-Steagall Act probably doesn\u2019t come up much at the dinner table or around the water cooler at work.\n\nBut the law regulating relationships between banks and securities firms is a big part of the debate about the 2008-2009 financial collapse, and comes up a lot among liberals and populists.\n\nWell, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee took note of a remark this past week where former President Bill Clinton defended his stewardship on the issue \u2014 and she notes it could cause candidate Hillary Clinton a bit of a headache.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s something Bill Clinton said this week that actually didn\u2019t get a lot of pickup,\u201d said Lee. \u201cHe said there\u2019s not a single piece of evidence to show when he repealed Glass-Steagall, it led to the financial crisis. This is a line that is going to haunt Hillary Clinton when she talks about being tough on Wall Street and wanting to rein in big banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you watch the crowds that turn up at Martin O\u2019Malley rallies and Bernie Sanders rallies \u2014 they\u2019re holding up \u2018Bring back Glass-Steagall\u2019 posters.\u201d\n\n3. The next Koch or Adelson? A big Michigan donor makes a policy play\n\nThe DeVos family of Michigan long has been a player in state and national GOP affairs, but is looking to ramp up even more this presidential cycle.\n\nJonathan Martin of The New York Times shared reporting about a forum organized by Betsy DeVos to promote conservative education ideas.\n\nShe is holding it in New Hampshire, and drawing an impressive guest list.\n\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s not as well known as (Sheldon) Adelson or (Charles and David) Koch, but Betsy DeVos, who\u2019s a big Michigan donor, is going to be staging a big education summit Wednesday in New Hampshire, sort of entering the fray of some of these superdonors,\u201d said Martin.\n\n\u201cShe has a big crowd coming from the candidates: Jeb Bush is coming, you\u2019re going to see John Kasich coming, Carly Fiorina coming. A combination of a hot issue on the right, which is education and vouchers, a big donor, and a key state.\u201d\n\n4. Walker plans to detail the \u2018replace\u2019 part of his Obamacare repeal plan\n\n\u201cRepeal Obamacare\u201d is a frequent promise from Republican presidential candidates. They also promise to replace many provisions \u2014 but haven\u2019t been all too forthcoming with specifics.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, struggling of late, hopes to distinguish himself from his GOP presidential rivals by adding some meat to the \u201creplace\u201d promise.\n\nNia-Malika Henderson of CNN told us the plan is coming.\n\n\u201cScott Walker, who\u2019s been slumping in the polls a bit in Iowa as well as New Hampshire, on Tuesday in Minnesota will unveil his alternative to Obamacare,\u201d said Henderson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll unveil a plan that will talk about expanding affordability, expanding choices and eliminating waste in health care. We\u2019ll see what kind of traction he gets from this, and it also puts the onus on other candidates who want to repeal Obamacare \u2014 what is their alternative in terms of replacing it?\u201d\n\n5. Bush\u2019s ISIS plan has a bipartisan ring to it\n\nJeb Bush plans to flesh out his plan for combating ISIS this week, and the details are unlikely to draw too much criticism from Democrats.\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe of The Washington Post shared advance details of the Bush approach and noted that foreign policy experts observe that they overlap with many of the recommendations made recently by leading Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey pointed to an op-ed in The Washington Post \u2026 co-written by Michele Flournoy, who of course is considered to be a possible defense secretary under Hillary Clinton, and Richard Fontaine,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe.\n\n\u201cThey propose helping out the Sunnis and the Kurds more directly, embedding Special Forces with Iraqi security forces going after ISIS, deploying forward air spotters to help pick out some air raid sites, and then a new global campaign against ISIS. Well guess who else is proposing that \u2014 Jeb Bush.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they point out that while he\u2019s getting a lot of flak for this right now, the eventual Democratic nominee might be proposing the same things, so smart of him to get out in front.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Vice President Joe Biden mulls joining the 2016 presidential race, close advisers and allies say they are not sure what he will decide, and suggest it is a waste of time to try to read tea leaves from one conversation to the next.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "0b712ce3c768feea09b44013120c6553"}, "og": {"site_name": "whotv.com", "description": "As Vice President Joe Biden mulls joining the 2016 presidential race, close advisers and allies say they are not sure what he will decide, and suggest it is a waste of time to try to read tea leave\u2026", "title": "Advisers Tell Biden: Decide by October 1", "url": "http://whotv.com/2015/08/17/advisers-tell-biden-decide-by-october-1/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/biden.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/biden.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@whohd", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@whohd"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324711668", "fb": {"pages": 383549560312}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whotv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f35371452b04df2deef561dcee55bb01?s=16", "application-name": "whotv.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD", "published_time": "2015-08-17T12:58:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T12:58:36+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD"}, "keywords": "joe biden, iowa, news, politics, democrat, iowa caucuses, presidential candidates", "google-site-verification": "rL7fNdHSnN2PyMcNFC2GBk_LusisYfoPth6XdX-yZ2Y", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "joe biden, iowa, news, politics, democrat, iowa caucuses, presidential candidates"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdccf\"", "article_summary": "Not impossible, but nowhere near on par with the depth and experience level of the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\u201cThey pointed to an op-ed in The Washington Post \u2026 co-written by Michele Flournoy, who of course is considered to be a possible defense secretary under Hillary Clinton, and Richard Fontaine,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe.\nBush\u2019s ISIS plan has a bipartisan ring to itJeb Bush plans to flesh out his plan for combating ISIS this week, and the details are unlikely to draw too much criticism from Democrats.\nWalker plans to detail the \u2018replace\u2019 part of his Obamacare repeal plan\u201cRepeal Obamacare\u201d is a frequent promise from Republican presidential candidates.\n\u2022 There are competing thoughts on a timetable, though there is a general consensus that October 1 is as late as the VP could wait to decide."}
