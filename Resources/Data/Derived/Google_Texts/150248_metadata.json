As we negotiate upcoming rounds of employee contracts and health care policies, this is something we intend to include with collective bargaining in the future.\"\n\nLast month, city officials said they planned to save about $3 million a year by making changes to employee health care plans. The city planned to save $700,000 annually by denying coverage for erectile dysfunction drugs for retirees, and $2.3 million requiring tobacco users covered by city employee or retiree health plans to pay 50 percent more for their insurance.\n\nThe average charge would have been about $50 per month, Libit said.\n\nUnion leader Glenard S. Middleton Sr. said union officials were surprised by the changes. \"We came in and objected to it,\" he said. \"We told them we would be filing a lawsuit. They did the right thing and changed their minds.\"\n\nMiddleton said he agreed that city workers can get healthier. He suggested giving breaks for exercise or health awareness classes.\n\nLibit said the lack of a surcharge in this year's budget would not affect city services or lead to cuts.\n\nThe attempted changes are the latest from a city government eager to cut health care costs.\n\nIn 2013, Baltimore officials dropped more than 1,600 spouses, children and others from city coverage after workers failed to fill out forms to prove they were eligible dependents. The move is saving Baltimore about $6.5 million a year, officials said.\n\nRawlings-Blake has been targeting health care expenses as one of several ways to cut a projected $750 million long-term budget deficit. She has said that nearly half of Baltimore's municipal employees and retirees have a \"critical or chronic\" illness \u2014 a distinction that contributes to the high cost of providing their health insurance.\n\nThe city also has modified health benefits to charge lower premiums but require higher co-payments. That move has saved the city more than $20 million a year, officials say.\n\nBaltimore is among the jurisdictions across the country that are trying to make smokers pay more for health care. Under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can charge smokers up to 50 percent more for health coverage. The city of Austin, Texas, applies such a surcharge, as does the state of Virginia. Some businesses, such as Wal-Mart, also apply such a charge.\n\nlbroadwater@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/lukebroadwater", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Baltimore officials back off plan to charge smokers more for health insurance", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Baltimore officials say they are backing off a plan to charge city employees who smoke more for their health insurance after union officials objected.", "title": "Baltimore officials back off plan to charge smokers more for health insurance", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-smoking-charge-20150604-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5570b51f/turbine/bs-md-ci-smoking-charge-20150604", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Baltimore city workers health insurance surcharge smokers union", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/83706364", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-04", "Description": "Baltimore officials say they are backing off a plan to charge city employees who smoke about $50 more per month for health insurance after union officials objected.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Baltimore city workers health insurance surcharge smokers union"}, "article_summary": "Baltimore officials say they are backing off a plan to charge city employees who smoke more for their health insurance after union officials objected.\nBaltimore is among the jurisdictions across the country that are trying to make smokers pay more for health care.\nLast month, city officials said they planned to save about $3 million a year by making changes to employee health care plans.\nUnder President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can charge smokers up to 50 percent more for health coverage.\nAs we negotiate upcoming rounds of employee contracts and health care policies, this is something we intend to include with collective bargaining in the future.\""}
