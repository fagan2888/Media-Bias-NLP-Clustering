The rate of emergency room visits for children 5 and older more than doubled in rural Madera County and nearly doubled in Merced.\n\nAll told, more than 72,000 California children under 18 visited the ER for asthma in 2012, nearly 21,000 of them from Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly more work to be done if this many kids are going to the emergency department,\u201d said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program of the Oakland-based Public Health Institute. \u201cWe know a lot about what works. We absolutely should be able to reduce the rates we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nAt the national level, asthma-related emergency room visit rates have declined in recent years, according to federal health data through 2010, the latest available.\n\nAlthough ER visits declined in some counties, including Alameda, San Mateo and Marin, the overall rise in California has frustrated public health experts who have spent millions of dollars and countless hours to improve and expand asthma prevention programs around the state. The state and federal governments alone spend $1.54 million annually on such projects in California, including grants to schools to improve indoor air quality and training community health workers.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in ER visits are complex, experts say. They include parents not properly administering medications, poverty and inadequate insurance coverage, persistently high levels of indoor and outdoor pollution in some regions and the limited reach of programs that seek to manage symptoms or prevent them.\n\nLoretta Worthington, coordinator of the Asthma Coalition of Los Angeles County and a staff analyst at the county\u2019s department of public health, said she\u2019s been surprised at some doctors\u2019 lack of knowledge about controlling the disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of training that still needs to be done,\u201d Worthington said.\n\nIn the Central Valley, persistent poverty and outdoor air pollution levels combine to produce the highest rates of ER visits for childhood asthma in the state.\n\nThe good news is fewer kids in California are actually being admitted into hospitals. Overnight-or-longer stays are declining statewide and nationally. That\u2019s due largely to better medicines and more aggressive treatment in the ER, asthma specialists say.\n\nThe rising rates don\u2019t seem to reflect an actual increase in the respiratory disease \u2014 about 15 percent of California children have been diagnosed with asthma, a number that has remained fairly steady since 2001.\n\nThe rates of ER visits vary widely by county, from a high of 300 visits per 10,000 children under age 5 (Madera County) to a low of 32 (Sutter County) in 2012.\n\nIn Los Angeles County that year, there were about 78 visits per 10,000 children ages 5-17 and 121 visits per 10,000 children under age 5. Both rates exceeded the state average.\n\nYounger children visit the ER at higher rates because they are more likely to have undiagnosed asthma and because their lung function is more difficult to measure, complicating the task of finding the right combination of medicines, Kelsey Lamb said.\n\nSome families seek treatment in the ER for symptoms that easily could be dealt with in a clinic because they can\u2019t get a timely doctor\u2019s appointment or don\u2019t have a regular doctor \u2014 especially those without health insurance. Sometimes, a bad cold and flu season can aggravate asthma that is usually well-controlled.\n\nAffected children often live in homes with dust, mold or pets, which trigger asthma symptoms.\n\nThey may need two inhalers \u2014 one for school and one for home \u2014 but insurance sometimes only pays for one.\n\nAcross California, local and regional asthma programs aim to educate families and doctors to help keep kids out of the hospital. In counties including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange, medically equipped vans called \u201cBreathmobiles\u201d provide comprehensive care in community settings and ensure children don\u2019t end up repeatedly in the ER.\n\nThough often effective, these programs are expensive and can\u2019t serve enough children to make a real difference statewide, said John Capitman, a Cal State Fresno public health professor and executive director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute. And health outreach workers have found it difficult to get reimbursed by insurers, including Medi-Cal, for proven strategies including home visits to minimize risks, Capitman said.\n\nWorthington of Los Angeles County said health workers are focusing on the Antelope Valley, which has the county\u2019s highest prevalence of asthma diagnoses.\n\nThey train local primary care doctors on use of the latest medications and the national asthma management protocols. They also inform physicians about some pervasive but mistaken cultural beliefs, including the one that sleeping with a Chihuahua can help control asthma symptoms.\n\nIn the Harbor Area, community health workers run weekly asthma classes for parents in Long Beach, Wilmington and San Pedro, where asthma has been prevalent in part because of pollution from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. Hundreds of local physicians also have been trained on use of the latest medications and national asthma management protocols, said pediatrician Elisa Nicholas, CEO of the Children\u2019s Clinic and founder of the Long Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma.\n\nNicholas noted that ER visits and hospitalizations have declined in her area because of these and other asthma control activities, and in part because of declining pollution levels at the ports and nearby freeways.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, we knew that asthma was the most preventable admission to the hospital,\u201d Nicholas said, referring to the year her organization was founded. \u201cWe\u2019ve put so much effort into reducing that. I\u2019m hoping we can sustain the effort.\u201d\n\nBecause the emergency visit data don\u2019t extend beyond 2012, it remains unclear how expanded coverage offered since last year under the Affordable Care Act and California\u2019s Medicaid program will affect emergency room visits.\n\nAsthma care for kids has improved markedly in recent years, in part because of the wider use of steroid inhalers. But some families simply don\u2019t know how to manage their child\u2019s condition or when to seek medical care, said Dr. Rami Keisari, medical director of the Pediatric Asthma Disease Management Program at the county-run Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges we have is getting parents to use the medications every day,\u201d Keisari said.\n\nHeidi de Marco contributed reporting.\n\nbarbarafederostrov@gmail.com\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Children in California increasingly are flocking to emergency rooms for treatment of asthma, despite millions of dollars spent on programs to control the disease.Statewide, the rates of ER visits for asthma symptoms rose by about 18 percent for", "title": "More children rushing to ERs for asthma despite programs to curb disease", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20150607/more-children-rushing-to-ers-for-asthma-despite-programs-to-curb-disease", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150607/NEWS/150609563/AR/0/AR-150609563.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1040px"}, "type": "article", "title": "More children rushing to ERs for asthma despite programs to curb disease"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Children in California increasingly are flocking to emergency rooms for treatment of asthma, despite millions of dollars spent on programs to control the disease.Statewide, the rates of ER visits for asthma symptoms rose by about 18 percent for", "title": "More children rushing to ERs for asthma despite programs to curb disease", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20150607/more-children-rushing-to-ers-for-asthma-despite-programs-to-curb-disease", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20150607/NEWS/150609563/AR/0/AR-150609563.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Asthma, Asthma news, Los Angeles Asthma news, CA Asthma news, US Asthma news, world Asthma news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Asthma, Asthma news, Los Angeles Asthma news, CA Asthma news, US Asthma news, world Asthma news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac5b\"", "article_summary": "In Los Angeles County, ER visit rates rose by 17 percent for children 5 and older and by 8 percent for children under 5.\nAll told, more than 72,000 California children under 18 visited the ER for asthma in 2012, nearly 21,000 of them from Los Angeles County.\nChildren in California increasingly are flocking to emergency rooms for treatment of asthma, despite millions of dollars spent on programs to control the disease.\nThat\u2019s due largely to better medicines and more aggressive treatment in the ER, asthma specialists say.\nIn Los Angeles County that year, there were about 78 visits per 10,000 children ages 5-17 and 121 visits per 10,000 children under age 5."}
