By the time his second ends, \u201cblack people will have lost ground in every single leading economic indicator category,\u201d television talk show host Tavis Smiley said last month.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, the top 1 percent received 95 percent of income gains, a study by University of California-Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez indicated.\n\nThat\u2019s where you find the \u201csuperstars\u201d who make megabucks in sports, entertainment, technology and finance, said economists Steven Kaplan and Joshua Rauh. You\u2019d expect them to do better.\n\nBut during the presidency of George W. Bush, the top 1 percent garnered just 65 percent of income growth, Prof. Saez said.\n\nThe stock market has set all-time highs despite mostly dismal economic news \u2014 thanks to \u201cquantitative easing\u201d (money creation) by the Federal Reserve Board. The top 1 percent own 83 percent of U.S. stocks.\n\nThe boon to Wall Street has been a blow to the middle class. Near-zero interest rates undermine savings.\n\nQE was supposed to make credit available to \u201cMain Street\u201d businesses crunched by the recession. That didn\u2019t happen, said Andrew Huszar, point man for the Fed\u2019s bond purchases.\n\n\u201cMy program wasn\u2019t helping to make credit any more accessible for the average American,\u201d Mr. Huszar wrote in the Wall Street Journal Nov. 11. \u201cQE may have been driving down the wholesale cost for banks to make loans, but Wall Street was pocketing most of the extra cash.\u201d\n\nThe banks also \u201cenjoyed huge capital gains on the rising values of their securities holdings and fat commissions from brokering most of the Fed\u2019s QE transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nWall Street investment banks also get from federal loan guarantees what amounts to an $83 billion subsidy. \u201cIt\u2019s tantamount to giving the banks about 3 cents of every tax dollar collected,\u201d said the editors of Bloomberg View.\n\nA major cause of the Great Recession was the recklessness of Wall Street bankers. But Democrats gave them an edge in 2010 when they imposed crushing burdens on smaller competitors who\u2019d done nothing wrong.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank bill has imposed \u201csignificant costs on community banks without providing benefits to consumers or the economy that justify those costs,\u201d concluded a paper by Wake Forest University law professor Tanya Marsh and Joseph Norman.\n\nDespite ample evidence, no Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for fraud.\n\nSo it\u2019s easy to see why Democrats are Wall Street\u2019s darlings. Last month, Goldman Sachs paid Hillary Clinton more than $400,000 for making two speeches. Wall Street has donated more to Barack Obama than to any other presidential candidate, save for ex-Wall Streeter Mitt Romney, according to the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nThe income inequality his policies have intensified is \u201cimmoral,\u201d President Obama said at Knox College in July. But as Americans who\u2019ve lost their health insurance can attest, he often says things he doesn\u2019t mean. Actions speak louder.\n\n\u201cWhile the populist rhetoric of modern (Democratic) politicians is all about redistribution and inequality, the reality is that (their) policies entrench privilege,\u201d wrote Walter Russell Mead, editor of The American Interest.\n\n\u201cWell-connected insiders get sweetheart deals from government, and insurance lobbyists wield a veto over Obamacare\u2019s restructuring of the American health care system,\u201d Mr. Mead said. \u201cMost of the so-called green policies are basically ways to channel money from ordinary consumers to political insiders who invest in clever enterprises engineered to suck in subsidies or to thrive in protected, artificial markets created by regulations.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has \u201credistributed\u201d more tax dollars to crony capitalists than to the poor. From the $787 billion \u201cstimulus\u201d that didn\u2019t stimulate, to subsidies for \u201cgreen\u201d companies that produced more corruption than energy, to Obamacare, every \u201cinvestment\u201d he has made has produced a windfall for the politically connected but hasn\u2019t helped ordinary Americans.\n\nThe party of the rich isn\u2019t the one you thought it was.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Real (inflation adjusted) median household income last year was $51,371, 4.44 percent lower than in 2009, the Census Bureau says.\nThe number of Americans living in poverty rose by the equivalent of...", "title": "Obama's Policies Have Helped Wall St. Fat Cats | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/11/24/obamas_policies_have_helped_wall_st_fat_cats_120768.html", "image": "/articles/topicons/jack_kelly.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Real (inflation adjusted) median household income last year was $51,371, 4.44 percent lower than in 2009, the Census Bureau says.\nThe number of Americans living in poverty rose by the equivalent of...", "title": "Obama's Policies Have Helped Wall St. Fat Cats | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TomBevanRCP", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Obama's Policies Have Helped Wall St. Fat Cats | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "economy,Wall Street,Barack Obama,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d3d\"", "article_summary": "The boon to Wall Street has been a blow to the middle class.\nA major cause of the Great Recession was the recklessness of Wall Street bankers.\nWall Street investment banks also get from federal loan guarantees what amounts to an $83 billion subsidy.\nDespite ample evidence, no Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for fraud.\nWall Street has donated more to Barack Obama than to any other presidential candidate, save for ex-Wall Streeter Mitt Romney, according to the Sunlight Foundation."}
