But cleaning our ears of these substances \u2014 even though we should \u2014 could be like throwing out important information. That\u2019s because researchers found that earwax from different races also have specific odors, and therefore, can say something about the person\u2019s health.\n\nThe study, from researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, looked into whether health information can be derived from earwax. Research has shown that a gene associated with a person\u2019s tendency to have underarm odor, called ABCC11, is also related to the color and texture of their earwax. One variant of ABCC11, which is normally found in people of East Asian descent, leads to dry, white earwax and less body odor; while another variant of the gene, mostly found among people of African and European descent, causes earwax to be wet and yellow-brown in color, and is also more likely to cause body odor, according to LiveScience.\n\nIn studies that have linked body odor to disease, ABCC11 has been the link between the two. For example, a 2009 study, published in The FASEB Journal, found that the variant of the gene that caused odorous armpits and wet earwax was also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. \u201cAs it turns out, the type of earwax one has is linked to a gene that leads to bad odors from one\u2019s armpit,\u201d said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, editor-in-chief of the journal, according to Medical News Today. \u201cThese may become lifesaving clues to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer.\u201d\n\nKnowing this, researchers wanted to see if heated-up earwax could produce information regarding a person\u2019s health. They took earwax samples from 16 men \u2014 half were East Asian and half were white \u2014 and heated them in vials until they started to release odors. These odors, molecularly known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were then analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which identifies each molecule. The tests showed that 12 VOCs were present among all them men. They also showed clear differences between the two ethnic groups, as 11 of the 12 VOCs were present at higher concentrations in the white men when compared to the Asian men.\n\n\u201cIn essence, we could obtain information about a person\u2019s ethnicity simply by looking in his ears,\u201d lead author of the study Katharine Prokop-Prigge said in a statement. \u201cWhile the types of odorants were similar, the amounts were very different.\u201d\n\nBecause earwax is created from a mixture of secretions \u2014 sweat and fat \u2014 the researchers believe that it could be a source for spotting early stages of disease, as fat-soluble odorants emitted by diseases get caught in the secreted fat. The researchers noted that signs of both maple syrup urine disease and alkaptonuria \u2014 also called black urine disease \u2014 could be spotted in earwax before blood and urine tests found them. \u201cOdors in earwax may be able to tell us what a person has eaten and where they have been,\u201d Dr. George Preti, an organic chemist at Monell, said in the statement. \u201cEarwax is a neglected body secretion whose potential as an information source has yet to be explored.\u201d\n\nSource: Prokop-Prigge K, Thaler E, Preti G, et al.
