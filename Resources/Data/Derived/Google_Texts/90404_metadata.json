Of the 1,200 open positions at its Fort Myers campus, approximately 700 are still available.\n\nTo assist with the hiring process, Alta Resources will host a casual, come as you are, two-day job fair, Aug. 15 and 16 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., at its Fort Myers campus, 12600 Gateway Blvd.\n\nLast year, Wisconsin-based Alta Resources expanded into Fort Myers and immediately created more than 400 employment opportunities. Those jobs, like the ones being offered this year, were filled to serve the company\u2019s health-insurance clients that experienced an increase in contact volumes in the wake of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The success of the Fort Myers team, together with Alta Resources\u2019 companywide success, for those clients has prompted additional program expansion in 2014, as the number of jobs being filled at its Fort Myers campus has nearly tripled from 2013. In fact, Fort Myers is and will continue to be the hub of Alta Resources\u2019 clients\u2019 health-insurance programs.\n\n\u201cThe Fort Myers community welcomed us with open arms. We continue to pursue bringing additional opportunities to Fort Myers, further solidifying Alta Resources as a permanent fixture in the area,\u201d said Paul Makurat, managing director at Alta Resources\u2019 Fort Myers campus. \u201cOur transition to the area was largely seamless, thanks to the great performance of our Fort Myers team during the past year. In fact, our clients have taken notice of the results our staff has achieved here.\u201d\n\nThe English and English-Spanish bilingual positions are primarily seasonal and range from full to part time. Positions are immediate, and qualified applicants will begin as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur positions feature flexibility, with schedules tailored to one\u2019s lifestyle. That makes these seasonal roles especially ideal for students, busy parents and even retirees,\u201d added Makurat.\n\nAvailable opportunities include customer care; inbound, licensed health-insurance sales; and team leadership. Alta Resources offers paid training, competitive pay, a team-based culture, skills development and advancement potential for high performers. The company also pays for health-insurance sales licensing for qualified candidates; licensing will be specific to the state(s) a sales representative will service and is his or hers to retain for as long as the license is valid.\n\nMakurat noted that the company is committed to Southwest Florida, \u201cWe\u2019re excited to begin our second year in Fort Myers. Our clients are extremely happy with the quality of results that our people delivered over year one, thus driving the need for expansion in 2014. The team here did more than produce results; in fact, they helped further cement Alta Resources as a staple of this great community by getting actively involved with many programs, including our inaugural United Way of Lee, Hendry, Glades and Okeechobee Counties fundraising campaign.\u201d\n\nInterested candidates are encouraged to search jobs, create a profile and apply online at JoinAlta.com before attending the job fair, and then visit the Gateway location for immediate, on-site interviews with hiring professionals. While there, they will have an opportunity to ask questions and learn more about the growing company.\n\nAbout Alta Resources\n\nFormed in 1995, privately held Alta Resources is a leading provider of customer management business process outsourcing for many of the world\u2019s best-known brands in a variety of industries, including consumer-packaged goods, health care and insurance, and entertainment.
