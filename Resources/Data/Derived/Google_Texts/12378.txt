A school in Davenport is showing off some new upgrades. Wood Intermediate School cut the ribbon for its new gym and fitness room on Wenesday, October 7.

That's not all, t he school also boasts an outdoor classroom, solar panels as well as geothermal heating and air conditioning.

"Last year it used to be a little more old looking-a little vintage. And now they have made it a lot more modern. There are more school colors all around. It's just a really nice remodel," said Meredith Sloat, a student at Wood Intermediate.

Administrators also showed off new rooms for band and orchestra.
