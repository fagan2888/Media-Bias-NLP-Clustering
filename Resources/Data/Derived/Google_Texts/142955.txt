CNN’s poll methodology eschewed the usual sampling of “likely” or “registered” voters and instead asked 209 people “who describe themselves as Independents who lean Republican” and 244 individuals “who describe themselves as Republicans” the candidate they “would be most likely to support for the Republican nomination for president in 2016.”

CNN’s top 10 results were as follows:

Bush: 23%

Christie: 13%

Carson: 7%

Huckabee: 6%

Paul: 6%

Rubio: 5%

Ryan: 5%

Cruz: 4%

Jindal: 4%

Perry: 4%

The poll’s small sample size gives it a larger +/-4.5 percentage point sampling error.

Respondents were also asked whether Bush’s description of illegal immigration as an “act of love” made them more or less likely to support his candidacy. A full 42% said the position made them “less likely to support” Bush versus 20% who said “more likely to support.” Thirty-eight percent said Bush’s position made “no difference” in their decision.

CNN conducted its poll from Dec. 18-21.
