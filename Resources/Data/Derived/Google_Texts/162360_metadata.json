It\u2019s doubtful.\n\nNo one claims that today\u2019s system is ideal. It\u2019s complex, confusing, costly and incomplete. Even after the Affordable Care Act, about 30 million people remain uninsured. For decades, rapid spending increased health care\u2019s share of the economy, estimated at 17.5 percent in 2014. And on many health outcomes \u2013 say, infant mortality \u2013 the United States does worse than some other advanced societies.\n\nTo hear Sanders tell it, his single-payer plan (the government pays for most health care) would cure these ailments. Everyone would have coverage. People would go to doctors, hospitals and clinics as needed. There would be no deductibles or copayments to discourage them. Workers would not be locked into jobs they dislike because they fear losing employer-provided insurance.\n\nAs for costs, the government would negotiate price cuts on drugs and eliminate private insurers\u2019 high overhead costs. To be sure, paying for the plan would require new taxes. But for many middle-class families, these taxes would be less than today\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses and their share of premiums for employer-provided insurance. A family of four with $50,000 of income could save nearly $5,800 a year, Sanders says.\n\nIt sounds too good to be true, because it is.\n\nFor starters, even if Sanders became president, the prospect for his plan being enacted would be slim. That\u2019s not a conservative wish but the view of many liberals. It\u2019s politically unrealistic, they argue, to think that nearly a fifth of the economy could be totally remade. \u201cAs the old joke goes, \u2018You can\u2019t get there from here,\u2019 \u201d writes economist Henry Aaron of the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution in Newsweek. There would be too much opposition and uncertainty.\n\nHospitals, doctors and drug companies would lobby for favored treatment \u2013 or resist punitive policies. Insurance companies would fight to survive. Americans with good insurance would worry that they\u2019d lose their privileged position.\n\nBillions of dollars would be at stake. Most employer-provided health insurance would disappear, saving companies (Aaron says) about $700 billion. Some of that would be drained by a new 6.2 percent payroll tax to pay for government insurance. But what would happen to any remainder? Would it fatten workers\u2019 wages or shareholders\u2019 profits?\n\nEspecially controversial would be cost savings. The Sanders campaign estimates that his plan would lower costs by about $1 trillion annually, but how this would occur isn\u2019t clear. Controlling the \u201cadministrative costs [of insurers and providers] and drug prices,\u201d as the campaign suggests, may not yield huge savings.\n\nDrugs are only 10 percent of total health costs, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Similarly, insurance companies\u2019 profit and overhead represent about 6 percent of all health costs: equal to about one year\u2019s growth in total spending. Even large cuts to both (say 20 percent) would represent relatively modest reductions in overall health costs.\n\nThe paradox is that the Sanders plan assumes major cost savings when it also creates huge pressures for higher \u2013 not lower \u2013 health spending. More people would be insured; coverage would probably be expanded (better vision and dental benefits?); Medicare premiums would be eliminated; and traditional cost-control tools \u2013 deductibles and copayments \u2013 would be abandoned.\n\nIf savings are overestimated, then the taxes needed to pay for the plan are underestimated \u2013 perhaps dramatically. Already, one major health scholar, Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University, says that the campaign has understated the plan\u2019s costs by about $1 trillion annually. Covering that extra spending would require an income-based tax of 20 percent, not the 8.4 percent proposed by Sanders.\n\nOf course, Sanders could control costs with cuts in reimbursement rates to doctors, hospitals and other providers. (If government pays for most health care, it presumably would \u2013 as with Medicare \u2013 set reimbursements.) But this might trigger protests that patients would suffer. With time, stingy reimbursement might also lead to longer waits, as shortages of doctors, nurses and hospitals emerged.\n\nIt is the complexity and the contentiousness of the health care system that frustrates any sweeping overhaul, as Aaron argues. Changes tend to be incremental.\n\nOn examination, the single-payer proposal is a better campaign slogan than it is a realistic panacea for the nation\u2019s health care problems. It can\u2019t escape a stubborn dilemma: How can we control spending for something that most Americans consider \u2013 as Sanders says \u2013 an open-ended \u201cright\u201d?\n\nRobert J.
