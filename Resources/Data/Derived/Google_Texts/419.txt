Fire crews will remain at the Maple Grove Cemetery all day Easter Sunday to monitor a large brush fire.

The fire was called in early Sunday morning.

The cemetery is located near 10th and Yale.

Fire crews had been working on the fire for over 4 hours, when it reignited.

A lieutenant on scene tells KAKE News the fire was shooting up 30 feet into the air and potentially by a bonfire or a discarded cigarette, but a cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

The lieutenant on scene all says that lack of water is causing difficulties and that the fire is in a very forested area.
