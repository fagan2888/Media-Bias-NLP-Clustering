A host of patients have been affected nationwide. (See update: FMA Protests Doctor-Dropping)\n\nEver since United started sending out letters to doctors, telling them they won\u2019t be on United\u2019s Medicare network next year, it\u2019s been a big story.\n\n\n\nHere it is on Fox: \u201cUnited Health, which is one of the largest health-care providers in this country, has dropped thousands of doctors from their insurance plan. The reason? Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWINK TV, the CBS affiliate in Fort Myers, offered a different view:\n\n\u201cNew at 6, there\u2019s a big change coming to some United Healthcare subscribers, and it has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSo who\u2019s right? Did the health law trigger all this? Not really, says John Petrila, chairman of Health Policy & Management at University of South Florida.\n\nHe says the narrowing of doctor networks isn\u2019t new.\n\n\u201cI think there are certain trends in health care that the Affordable Care Act to some degree has made more visible, to some degree maybe has accelerated, but ever since the introduction of managed care and efforts at controlling costs into health care, and that dates back at least 25 years or more, there have been efforts by payers to reduce their panels.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it used to fly under the radar, Petrila says.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is new is the effort to use this as one of the proxies for what people are arguing is the failure of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nBecause of the health law, insurers can\u2019t outright deny coverage to patients who\u2019ve been sick the way they used to. But Petrila says they can drop the doctors who treat them \u2013 like the ones who practice at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cNo insurer wants to deal with sick people, that\u2019s the bottom line. At some level, this is a strategy to decrease access.\u201d\n\nIf sick people can\u2019t keep their doctors, insurers know, they\u2019ll move to a different plan. That\u2019s what happened with Gail Gallagher, who moved with her husband to Tarpon Springs three years ago when she retired from the Broward School system. She was so attached to her gynecologist that she drove back to Boca every year for her annual exam.\n\nFor eye care, her doctor in Boca recommended St. Luke\u2019s Cataract and Laser Institute in Tarpon Springs.\n\nShe says she got really good care there, and it was just 10 minutes from her house. But then she found out United was dropping St. Luke\u2019s doctors; she\u2019s one of 5,000 United patients who use St. Luke\u2019s and were told they\u2019d have to go elsewhere.\n\n\u201cHow could United let this happen? This is a huge amount of people.\u201d\n\nUnited offered alternatives. She didn\u2019t like them.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had three torn retinas, you want to make sure should there ever be a problem, you\u2019re not told \u2018We\u2019ll see you in a month.\u2019 St Luke\u2019s always has someone on duty. \u201c\n\nOver at St. Luke\u2019s, administrator Brad Houser says the United Medicare Advantage contract accounts for 10% of their business.\n\n\u201cThe contract\u2019s pretty straightforward. You have the right to terminate us without cause, giving us notice. We acknowledge that\u2019s what you did. \u201d\n\nThe most frustrating thing, Houser said, is the mystery. United won\u2019t say why it\u2019s dropping them, as he told me on a recent visit.\n\n\u201cIs there a financial advantage to them? My guess is they think there\u2019s a financial advantage or else they wouldn\u2019t be doing this.\n\n\u201cIs it a way of getting rid of people who have eye diseases? One could construe that there\u2019s a backdoor rationing of care.\u201c\n\nHe\u2019s not so much angry as mystified, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we can\u2019t get any answers from anybody about what\u2019s going on. We just know there\u2019s a bad thing coming at us and bad thing coming at our patients. They\u2019re in here everyday saying what am I going to do about my eye care next year, doctor? And our doctors are as dumbfounded as I am.\u201d\n\nSo I called UnitedHealthcare to ask why they\u2019re doing this. Jessica Pappas was the PR person assigned to me. She said, essentially, everybody\u2019s doing it.\n\n\u201cMany Medicare Advantage plans including United Healthcare are making these changes; it\u2019s really to improve the quality and affordability of health care coverage for our Medicare members. \"\n\n\"Okay, well it seems to me that if you have fewer doctors they\u2019ll either be super-busy and people will have trouble getting in to see them, or else you\u2019ll have to have fewer patients.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re working to insure that our network is adequate to meet the needs of our members. Historically United has had a larger network than other insurers in many markets.\"\n\n\n\nDoctors are not taking it lying down. Last week, as Kaiser Health News reported, a federal judge in Connecticut temporarily blocked United from dropping 2,200 doctors in that state from its Medicare Advantage network.\n\nFlorida Medical Association has asked federal Medicare authorities to investigate the terminations to make sure United is following the law and that it is not harming patients.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
