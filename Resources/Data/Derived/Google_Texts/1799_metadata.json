And then Kathleen Sebelius had some of her HHS minions go down in the basement and write a regulation that said as part of Obamacare, you have to cover 20 out of 20 birth-control drugs.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court sided with Hobby Lobby and used the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as the basis of their decision. The law was passed nearly unanimously during President Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThat law protects you Hobby Lobby,\u201d Kelly concluded, \u201cand Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 minions in the basement don\u2019t get to take your rights away from you.\u201d\n\nVideo via The DC.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "It was FOX News' Megyn Kelly taking on the comments of contraception-rights activist Sandra Fluke Monday night -- and Kelly didn't hold back.", "title": "Megyn Kelly takes down Sandra Fluke over her Hobby Lobby argument...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 533, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/12/Megyn-Kelly1-533x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/07/01/megyn-kelly-takes-sandra-fluke-hobby-lobby-argument/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "sandra-fluke", "published_time": "2014-07-01T14:03:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-01T14:03:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat law protects you Hobby Lobby,\u201d Kelly concluded, \u201cand Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 minions in the basement don\u2019t get to take your rights away from you.\u201dVideo via The DC.\nIt was FOX News\u2019 Megyn Kelly taking on the comments of contraception-rights activist Sandra Fluke Monday night \u2014 and Kelly didn\u2019t hold back.\n\u201cHobby Lobby, which is an evangelical company, came out and said, \u2018Alright we\u2019ll do it.\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision, both conservative and liberal commentators have been up in arms to either commend or criticize the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 ruling.\nKelly passionately stated her case that Hobby Lobby will still have to cover 16 out of the 20 birth-control drugs that are available."}
