Cancel his plan. KPIX-TV, though, says the fact that he can\u2019t find a doctor within a reasonable distance violates state law and nothing appears to be taking place to fix the issue.\n\nThe former Marine identified by KPIX by only his first name, Kyle, is covered by Anthem BlueCross through the state exchange Covered California.\n\n\u201cI was on the phone with Anthem for two hours while they were trying to find me a doctor within 20 miles. Finally a supervisor came on the phone and said \u2018Sir, we have to go, we have other people to help,\u2019 and advised me I need to cancel my plan,\u201d Kyle told the news station.\n\nKPIX pointed out that California\u2019s law requires insurers to have enough doctors within 15 miles of a patient\u2019s home for them to acquire an appointment in 15 days or less.\n\nWhen Kyle looks at the list of doctors that Anthem on its website, he said it shows more than 80 doctors within 20 miles, even though in reality he can\u2019t find one.\n\nThe news station reported that the state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care previously said it will look into the matter of insurers being in compliance with an adequate number of doctors, but it declined to comment when contacted again by KPIX regarding the issue and possible fines.\n\nThe news station did find records that show Anthem has been fined more than $100,000 since February but not for violations for lack of doctors. The insurance agency told KPIX that it is working on expanding its network and said Kyle\u2019s experience does not sound like something that would come of its customer service.\n\nCovered California\u2019s Dana Howard told KPIX that it has seen \u201csome cases\u201d of people having to switch insurance plans due to a lack of doctors, but she added that they \u201cdon\u2019t have a count\u201d of how many nor could they provide the number if they had it.\n\nWatch KPIX-TV\u2019s report about the issue:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 61, "twitter": {"description": "A California man has been seeking treatment for Lyme disease, something he contracted while on active duty as a Marine, but he's having a hard time finding a doctor in the San Francisco Bay area that accepts his insurance.
