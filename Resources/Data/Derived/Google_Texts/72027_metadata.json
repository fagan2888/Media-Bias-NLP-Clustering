(AP) \u2014 The family and colleagues of a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran nine years ago while on a CIA mission expressed anger and disappointment at a rally Saturday that he wasn\u2019t part of a January prisoner exchange with Tehran.\n\nSeveral hundred people attended the rally for Robert Levinson, 67, who disappeared from Iran\u2019s Kish Island in March 2007. A 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that the married father of seven was working for the CIA on an unauthorized intelligence-gathering mission to glean information about Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nIf Levinson remains alive, he has been held captive longer than any American \u2014 longer than then-AP journalist Terry Anderson, who was held more than six years in Beirut in the 1980s. Unlike Anderson, Levinson\u2019s whereabouts and captors remain a mystery. U.S. officials believe the Iranian government was behind his disappearance. It has denied that.\n\nThe case drew renewed attention in January when Levinson was not part of a prisoner swap between the U.S. and Iranian governments that freed four other Americans who had been in Iran\u2019s custody. Levinson\u2019s family insists he is still alive, even with health issues including diabetes, gout and high blood pressure. They last received video and photos of him about five years ago.\n\nStephanie Levinson Curry, his second-oldest child, said her autistic 9-year-old son Ryan cried for days when the other American captives were released, but not his grandfather.\n\nThe rally\u2019s stage was decorated with nine chained and padlocked glass cookie jars filled with yellow rocks, each one representing a day Levinson has been held captive. The crowd held yellow signs showing the social media hashtag \u201cwhataboutbob.\u201d\n\n\u201cBob Levinson has been deprived of being a grandfather, a job that he would love so much,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe worry all the time about what he is thinking while he is alone in his cell. Even prisoners in jail get to see their families, write them letters and call them. Bob Levinson has none of that.\u201d\n\nRetired FBI agent Ellen Glasser harshly criticized the Obama administration for not demanding that Iran release Levinson or, at least, turn over information about his whereabouts. The FBI says it still investigates every lead and remains committed to finding Levinson. A $5 million reward for information leading to his whereabouts remains in effect.\n\n\u201cThe failure to push publicly and hard for answers about Bob was an outrage,\u201d Glasser said. \u201cA rare opportunity was squandered when we had the most possible leverage to bring him home. Despite many requests, no new pressure was put upon Iran to produce information on Bob\u2019s status.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Florida, told the crowd they should send messages to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who is active on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair that Bob wasn\u2019t among the Americans who came home, but because of that, our fight continues,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 2013 AP investigation showed that in a breach of the most basic CIA rules, a team of analysts \u2014 with no authority to run spy operations \u2014 paid Levinson to gather intelligence from hotspots around the world, including the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nThe official story when Levinson disappeared was that he was in Iran on private business, either to investigate cigarette smuggling or to work on a book about Russian organized crime. Russia has a presence on Kish, a tourist island.\n\nIn fact, he was meeting a source, an American fugitive, Dawud Salahuddin. He is wanted for killing a former Iranian diplomat in Maryland in 1980. In interviews, Salahuddin has admitted killing the diplomat.\n\nThe CIA paid Levinson\u2019s family $2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit, and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders. Three analysts who had been working with Levinson lost their jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t do to rewind nine years and beg my dad, \u2018Please don\u2019t go away,\u2019\u201d said a weeping Susan Levinson Booth, his oldest child, as her siblings gathered around her to close the rally.\n\nShe named her son, who was born after his disappearance, after him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The family and colleagues of a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran nine years ago while on a CIA mission expressed anger and disappointment at a rally Saturday that he wasn't part of a January prisoner exchange with Tehran.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The family and colleagues of a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran nine years ago while on a CIA mission expressed anger and disappointment at a rally Saturday that he wasn\u2019t part of a January prisoner exchange with Tehran.", "title": "Family and friends of Robert Levinson, ex-FBI agent missing in Iran, demand his release", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/5/family-of-american-missing-in-iran-plans-florida-r/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/05/missing_american-iran.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/05/missing_american-iran.jpeg", "description": "The family and colleagues of a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran nine years ago while on a CIA mission expressed anger and disappointment at a rally Saturday that he wasn't part of a January pr", "card": "summary", "title": "Family and friends of Robert Levinson, ex-FBI agent missing in Iran, d"}, "Author": "Terry Spencer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Robert Levinson, Iran, United States Central Intelligence Agency"}, "article_summary": "Unlike Anderson, Levinson\u2019s whereabouts and captors remain a mystery.\nSeveral hundred people attended the rally for Robert Levinson, 67, who disappeared from Iran\u2019s Kish Island in March 2007.\nBob Levinson has none of that.\u201dRetired FBI agent Ellen Glasser harshly criticized the Obama administration for not demanding that Iran release Levinson or, at least, turn over information about his whereabouts.\nIf Levinson remains alive, he has been held captive longer than any American \u2014 longer than then-AP journalist Terry Anderson, who was held more than six years in Beirut in the 1980s.\nA $5 million reward for information leading to his whereabouts remains in effect."}
