I am reminded, as I was when he made the infamous remark in 2011 about not wanting his daughters to be \u201cpunished with a baby\u201d, that the President and I reside in different universes on social issues.\n\n\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Rhode Island, the president called for more taxpayer-spending on early education programs in order to \u201cmake sure that women are full and equal participants in our economy.\u201d He said:\n\n\u201cSometimes someone, usually mom, leaves the workplace to stay home with the kids, which then leaves her earning a lower wage for the rest of her life as a result. And that\u2019s not a choice we want Americans to make.\u201c\n\n* * * * *\n\nExcuse me, Mr. President, but I believe that\u2019s EXACTLY the choice we want Americans to make. We want you, Mr. President, to support and strengthen American families through tax incentives which encourage parents to stay home\u2013not programs that separate children from their parents and which try, with limited success, to match the education and character formation that mothers were already providing in the home.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me: I don\u2019t hate working mothers. For single mothers and those who need to work\u2013even those who simply choose to work\u2013I hold no animus. They deserve our understanding and respect and, where possible, our help. But where possible, children should receive the best care available\u2013and that, I believe, is the care that only a mother can provide.\n\nStay-at-home mothers can nurse their children rather than resorting to bottle-feeding, thus bonding more deeply while meeting the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 recommendation that women breastfeed for at least twelve months.\n\nMothers, who have an instinctive love for their children, can provide one-on-one personalized education designed to maximize the child\u2019s development. The best intentioned classroom teacher will, of necessity, offer a standardized curriculum with occasional moments of one-on-one assistance.\n\nThere\u2019s more: Mothers can cook fresh, wholesome meals rather than relying on carryouts and fast foods. Stay-at-home mothers need less money, saving the dollars that would be spent by a working mother on gas, a working wardrobe, lunches out, and childcare. Stay-at-home mothers can present character-building and values education, including religious instruction, without fear of complaints from atheists or others who don\u2019t share the family\u2019s core values.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen I was pregnant with our first child, I bought the feminist message: I was a strong woman, I was highly qualified, I was valuable in the workforce, I could do EVERYTHING! And then she was born. When I held my daughter for the first time, I knew that holding her, loving her, teaching her was the most valuable contribution I could ever make in this world. At the end of my planned maternity leave, I returned to the office sadly; shortly after, I quit my oh-so-important job and went home to do a much more important job, a job with eternal consequences.\n\nI wrote a few years ago about my own internal conflict regarding work vs. parenting. There is so much pressure from society for women to remain in the workforce. When I chose to stay home, I did not feel the strong support of everyone around me. Often other women were polite, but obviously surprised by my choice. I wrote:\n\nMy life, it seemed at the time, revolved around cleaning toilets and changing diapers. Oh, sure, I had made the choice to stay home to mother my children. Together we read stories and baked cookies, sang the ABCs with gusto, embarked on sun-splashed walks in search of caterpillars and wildflowers. But when would I ever have an opportunity to use my business education, my college degree, the skills for which I\u2019d trained?\n\nI wrote about meeting the highly successful NASA Space Ambassador Sharon Newman Bordine, who had been a stand-in for Christa McAuliffe, the \u201cteacher-in-space\u201d aboard the Challenger when it exploded in 1986. I said at the time:\n\nThe point/counterpoint was discouraging: SHE: touring the world, speaking for NASA, and getting engaged in the Holy Land.\n\nME: hand-picking Play-Doh out of the carpet, running the vacuum, and serving up macaroni and cheese on paper plates.\n\nBut I came to peace with my life choice\u2013and really, I\u2019ve had it all. I\u2019ve enjoyed a career, but will never regret the time I devoted to my children. I concluded:\n\nIt\u2019s just too tempting, as you wipe smudged little faces and tackle yet another mountain of dirty dishes, to forget to thank God for those most precious of life\u2019s blessings. But today, if I could choose one day to live again, one poignant memory to forever hold up to the light, I\u2019d rush to embrace those soft little bodies, begging for just one more goodnight kiss, one more silly song, one more question. Being a mother is, after all, the greatest adventure of all.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis morning, I read an excellent letter to President Obama from Kristi Burton Brown. Kristi, writing in the Christian Post, worries about the President\u2019s statement, which is very concerning to stay-at-home moms around the nation. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she writes,\n\n\u201c\u2026your statement makes us wonder if you consider us as equal and contributing members of society. We\u2019ve always been a substantial part of society, and we\u2019re becoming even more so. From 1999 to 2012, the share of stay-at-home moms grew by 6 percent , after a nearly three-decade decline in our numbers. In 2012, there were 10.4 million of us around the nation.\u201d\n\nBrown, an attorney and stay-at-home mom, takes the President to task, scolding him:\n\nI hope you misspoke, but let me tell you how this comes across to stay-at-home moms. You\u2019re telling us that the money we earn is more important than our kids. You\u2019re telling us that leaving the workplace to stay home isn\u2019t a choice American moms should be making. Well, first off, we care about the choices our husbands and kids want us to make; about the choices we ourselves want to make \u2013 not the choices you claim we should be making. I can guarantee you that, when given the choice, kids would choose their moms over money. And, as a stay-at-home mom myself, who is also an attorney, let me tell you that I want to choose my kids over my career. I honestly don\u2019t care if missing two decades in the work force means that I\u2019ll never make as much as a male attorney over the course of my lifetime. My kids \u2013 people \u2013 are much, much more important than my money \u2013 mere possessions. And my choice is just as valid and just as equal as the choices of the single mom who needs to find a quality daycare and a high performing school to put her children in.\n\nRead the rest of her letter here.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how this plays out\u2013but Mr. Obama, you really stuck your foot in your mouth now.\n\nOh, in case you think he\u2019s been misquoted or didn\u2019t really mean what he said, here\u2019s the video:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/kathyschiffer/2014/11/obama-loses-stay-at-home-moms-support-if-he-ever-had-it/", "site_name": "Seasons of Grace", "image": "http://media.patheos.com/Images/CathPT/CathPT_SeasonsofGrace_bio.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Obama Loses Stay-at-Home Moms\u2019 Support (If He Ever Had It)"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1640\"", "article_summary": "Kristi, writing in the Christian Post, worries about the President\u2019s statement, which is very concerning to stay-at-home moms around the nation.\nFrom 1999 to 2012, the share of stay-at-home moms grew by 6 percent , after a nearly three-decade decline in our numbers.\nbyThere\u2019s quite a brew erupting in social media over remarks by President Obama this week about stay-at-home mothers.\nStay-at-home mothers need less money, saving the dollars that would be spent by a working mother on gas, a working wardrobe, lunches out, and childcare.\nI can guarantee you that, when given the choice, kids would choose their moms over money."}
