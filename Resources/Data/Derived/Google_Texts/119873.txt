Three voter service centers opened Tuesday outside downtown Denver for the final week before the June 2 runoff election.

Each Voter Service and Polling Center, where voters can drop off a mail ballot or vote in person, is in a City Council district with a runoff. They are at the Harvey Park Recreation Center, 2120 S. Tennyson Way, in District 2, where John Kidd faces Kevin Flynn; the Platt Park Senior Center, 1500 S. Grant St., in District 7, where Jolon Clark faces Aaron Greco; and the Montbello Recreation Center, 15555 E. 53rd Ave., in District 11, where Stacie Gilmore faces Sean Bradley.

Central Denver’s District 10 also has a runoff, between Anna Jones and Wayne New. The Denver Elections Division headquarters, at 200 W. 14th Ave., is in that district and also has a voting center that’s been open since last week.

The downtown center is open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day through Friday as well as on Monday. The other three centers will be open on those days from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. All four centers will be open Saturday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

On June 2, all four centers will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., the deadline to return mail ballots.

Voters in those council districts also can submit ballots to two dozen 24-hour drop boxes, listed on the Elections Division’s website.
