Closing or consolidating those facilities could free up millions of dollars that could otherwise be used to pay more doctors and nurses to treat the backlog of patients at medical facilities across the country, according to McDonald.\n\nRelated: Embattled VA Added to Federal Risk List\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Association of Health Care Journalists\u2019 annual conference in Santa Clara, California, the VA secretary suggested that doing so could allow the VA to hire at least 200 more registered nurses and pay for 144,000 primary care visits for veterans.\n\n\u201cWe need to move forward with closing locations that are not economically sustainable and old, outdated buildings that are challenging to maintain and provide little or no value to our customers,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nThe VA has 336 buildings across the country, covering about 10.5 million square feet, that are either sitting vacant or less than 50 percent occupied, according to McDonald\u2019s early Congressional testimony. The secretary, who took over the troubled department last July, has urged lawmakers to close or consolidate the facilities \u2014 but his suggestion hasn\u2019t gained much traction on Capitol Hill.\n\nRelated: 7 of the Most Outrageous Abuses at VA Medical Centers\n\nWhile these buildings sit empty, the VA is building new facilities using emergency funding granted by Congress. Last summer, lawmakers approved a major $16.5 billion overhaul bill in response to a spate of investigations that revealed that VA health facilities across the country had created hidden waitlists that kept patients waiting months, even years for treatment.\n\nThe extra funding so far has gone toward opening up more facilities and beefing up the VA\u2019s staff to accommodate the increasing demand. McDonald says that, even with the savings that could be gained from the unused space, his agency needs more money and more staffing in order to relieve the backlog of veterans waiting for treatment.\n\nThough the Obama administration has requested a significant budget increase for the VA in 2016, it\u2019s not likely that Congress will approve it. In fact, a subcommittee in the Republican-controlled House just approved a $1.2 billion cut to the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nMcDonald said if the cuts go through, it \u201cwill create another crisis\u201d especially as demand ticks upward. As veterans age and become more dependent on VA medical services, the number of claims is expected to rise to 1.5 million in 2017 from 1 million in 2009.\n\nRelated: More Mismanagement and Millions Wasted at the VA\n\nMcDonald has spent much of the past year attempting to repair his agency\u2019s tarnished image. Lawmakers remain skeptical, though \u2014 especially given the department\u2019s continuing problems. For example, the VA has been under scrutiny for lax oversight of a massive hospital facility in Denver that is years behind schedule and has racked up a $1.7 billion price tag that is still growing \u2014 the most expensive construction project in the department\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cI feel like I need a bath,\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN) said about the facility\u2019s costs during a recent congressional hearing. \u201cThis $1 billion could have provided a tremendous amount of health care \u2014 examining rooms and ICU\u2019s \u2014 not on winning architectural awards. But now we are stuck in the ultimate catch-22 \u2014 we don\u2019t want to go ahead, but we can\u2019t quit.\u201d\n\nIn another example of the VA\u2019s lack of progress, the Associated Press last month published an analysis of how well the department has performed since Congress passed the emergency funding package last year. It concluded that, so far, not much has changed.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald says his department is so cash-strapped that i", "title": "VA Wastes Millions, But Still Wants More as Vets Wait for Care", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/26/VA-Wastes-Millions-Still-Wants-More-Vets-Wait-Care", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Flag_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs.svg_.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/26/VA-Wastes-Millions-Still-Wants-More-Vets-Wait-Care", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Flag_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs.svg_.png", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald says his department is so cash-strapped that i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf57\"", "article_summary": "Related: 7 of the Most Outrageous Abuses at VA Medical CentersWhile these buildings sit empty, the VA is building new facilities using emergency funding granted by Congress.\nAs veterans age and become more dependent on VA medical services, the number of claims is expected to rise to 1.5 million in 2017 from 1 million in 2009.\n\u201cThis $1 billion could have provided a tremendous amount of health care \u2014 examining rooms and ICU\u2019s \u2014 not on winning architectural awards.\nRelated: Embattled VA Added to Federal Risk ListSpeaking to reporters at the Association of Health Care Journalists\u2019 annual conference in Santa Clara, California, the VA secretary suggested that doing so could allow the VA to hire at least 200 more registered nurses and pay for 144,000 primary care visits for veterans.\nAt the same time, the agency continues spending nearly $25 million a year on hundreds of vacant or underused facilities across the country."}
