Here\u2019s a hint: It\u2019s not that they both play in Texas\u2026\n\nJames Harden was the target of a third-degree burn on Sunday, and he didn\u2019t even have to get crossed over on the court to suffer it. Lawson caught some flak by way of the Dallas Cowboys, thanks to a reposted Instagram picture from Denver Nuggets player Ty Lawson. While the Cowboys were getting thumped by the San Francisco 49ers, Lawson posted a Photoshopped pic of Harden with an over-ear headpiece. The caption: Cowboys defensive coordinator.\n\nOuch.\n\nThe burn, for all of you that either don\u2019t get it or revel in having jokes explained, is that the Cowboys don\u2019t play defense. That was in evidence on Sunday, as the 49ers shellacked Harden\u2019s fellow Texas-based athletes, scoring 21 points in the first quarter and then pretty much coasting the rest of the way. The Cowboys, by comparison, scored just three points in the first half, though they scored an additional 14 points in the second half. It was never close, though.\n\nAnd what\u2019s all that got to do with James Harden, you ask? Well, the burn is a callback to Harden\u2019s reputation as a weak defender. This is a thing: James Harden doesn\u2019t play defense. There is footage. Here is some of that footage.\n\nYes, that was painful. We\u2019re sure Harden isn\u2019t a fan of videos like this, but it is what is is, no?\n\nAside from his considerable defensive shortcomings, Harden has other things to worry about. Since the Houston Rockets signed Harden to a five-year, $80 million contract, the team hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations. Harden\u2019s tenure with the Rockets looks even worse in light of the fact that the Rockets also brought in Dwight Howard, said by some to be the best center in the league, last year. Expectations for the squad featuring Harden and Howard were quite high going into last season. Those expectations were not met.\n\nHarden and Howard were taken out in the first round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs, losing in six games to the Portland Trailblazers.\n\nBurn.\n\nRockets fans and league observers are still trying to figure out what the squad needs to do to realize the promise of pairing Harden with Howard. It\u2019s possible that one remedy would be to get the two superstars to work on their leadership skills. Reportedly, the happy-go-lucky nature of the Harden and Howard regime is the thing that led to Miami Heat star Chris Bosh electing to keep his talents in South Beach instead of teaming up with Harden and crew.\n\nHarden isn\u2019t worried about the team\u2019s prospects going forward, though. Speaking a while back with The Philippine Star, Harden was optimistic about the outlook with him and Howard as the Rockets\u2019 foundation, even if he wasn\u2019t terribly generous in his estimation of his teammates\u2019 value.\n\n\u201cDwight and I are the cornerstones of the Rockets,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThe rest of the guys are role players or pieces that complete our team.\u201d\n\nConfident words, no doubt, but they\u2019d probably be easier to swallow with a dash of perimeter defense. Barring that, Harden could always get himself a position in Dallas\u2019 coaching staff, as he\u2019s shown that they\u2019re on the same page.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What do James Harden and the Dallas Cowboys have in common?
