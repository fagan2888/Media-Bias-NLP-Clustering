I\u2019d buttonhole them after they\u2019d exited the fat man\u2019s lap. Come here, kid, I got some news for ya. I didn\u2019t do it because I was mean. I did it because I was 13 and in the mood to share my own disillusionment. I told myself that I had a higher purpose. I\u2019d come to believe that faith in Santa stood behind a loss of faith in general\u2014 churches shuttered, pews empty. Some blamed Darwin. I blamed that sleigh-crazed fat man from the frozen north.\n\nImagine you\u2019re a child in America. You\u2019re 5. You\u2019re filled with wonder and a natural inclination toward belief. At some point, you learned the story. You know the face, the walk, the hearty laugh. Were Santa to commit a crime, you could supply the cops enough info for a sketch.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re less familiar with the background: how he began as St. Nicholas, a 4th-century Greek bishop beloved for giving gifts to the poor, especially children. In old paintings, he has a narrow face, in no way jolly. But the beard is already there, ditto the beatific aura. The legend drifted to Germany, then Holland, where the name and honorific jumbled into Sinter-Klass. Klass put on weight, turned myopic, grew the hipster beard and acquired the sort of flannel outerwear needed to survive the winter. He went big in England but blew up in the U.S.: the songs and movies, the knowing winks and shopping-center scenes, cookies, chimneys, a billion-dollar industry.\n\nTo many, he\u2019s just another star, part of the pop pantheon, drinking at the diner between Bogart and James Dean, with the sack at his feet. But to children, he\u2019s more than an angel. He\u2019s taken on faith, right beside the big, big man himself.\n\nIf it were just a story of a magical creature akin to the tooth-fairy or sasquatch, that would be one thing. But Santa has become entwined with core Christian theology. According to Fred Edie, an associate professor at Duke Divinity School, children are drawn to Santa because he represents certain aspects of Jesus. \u201cI suspect the story evolved in part along the same lines of other stories of Christian saints and exemplars,\u201d Dr. Edie wrote to me. \u201cIn this genre, characters are cast as \u2018types\u2019 of Jesus because of the ways their lives reflect dimensions of Jesus\u2019 life. Santa may have been good to children, as was Jesus, which would have constituted a radical, even subversive gesture back in the day when children were considered little more than property.\u201d\n\nThen, at some point\u2014maybe you\u2019re 7, maybe 10\u2014you discover the truth: There is no Santa. It\u2019s just a story, a polite word for a lie. Worse still: Everyone knew, even your mom. The adults have been involved in a vast, \u201cMatrix\u201d-like conspiracy. You awake in a pod, bald, swimming in goop. You have a keen sense of being laughed at; you picture them all yukking it up. You\u2019re beset by doubt: If Santa is just a story, does that mean everything is just a story? For some, it\u2019s a moment as painful as the more profound moment that might come later, when your inner Nietzsche emerges from the hills to announce, God is dead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m among the seemingly tiny remnant of Americans who finds Santa Claus kind of odious,\u201d James McCartin, director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture, wrote to me. \u201cOn the one hand, as a religious believer who wants my kids to imbibe and embrace certain foundational Christian beliefs\u2014that God actually became human, died and rose from the dead, for example, and that this ancient theological event somehow ought to bring direction and meaning to our lives today\u2014I wonder, \u2018Why should they believe what I try to teach them about Jesus if they can\u2019t ultimately believe what I tell them about Santa?\u2019 \u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, I moved from New York City to Ridgefield, Conn. Santa is serious business here, and I quickly found myself in the vicinity of conversations that featured a kind of soliloquy: When do we tell her? How do we tell her? What if she finds out at school? It seemed obvious that this subterfuge was a long-term challenge to belief. How do you tell a kid that one story she\u2019s accepted on faith is a lie and not expect her to question that other story? Pundits talk about the war on Christmas, but hasn\u2019t Santa been waging that war for decades?\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Cohen? New York? He\u2019s Jewish! Of course he\u2019s down on Santa. He\u2019s jealous. Whereas Christians celebrate Christmas, with its plethora of early morning gifts, Jews get Hanukkah, with its candles, its prayers and its eight nights of tchotchkes. But the fact is, I too once believed in Santa. I loved that fat man. It isn\u2019t something my parents taught me. It is something I learned naturally\u2014on the schoolyard. I believed Santa rewarded obedience and answered prayers and spread joy like marmalade until we glistened like trees after a storm. I made my parents take me to the mall, sit me on the lap. I have the picture. The look on my face\u2026it\u2019s a quality of joy I\u2019d never experience again. Did I ask for gifts? Of course. Because we\u2019re Jewish, I urged Santa to leave them beneath the tree at the Johnstons\u2019 house.\n\nWhen I learned the truth\u2014from Todd Johnston, from my sister\u2014I was crushed, changed. At synagogue, when the rabbi spoke of the burning bush and the parting waters, I thought, Yeah right! Learning the truth about Santa shocked me into skepticism. For years, I refused to believe anything until I saw proof. It could be from the Gospels, it could be from the Torah\u2014I wasn\u2019t interested unless I could touch it. I came to see Santa as a historic mistake with one function: to hurry kids toward disbelief.\n\nThough many of the theologians I talked to agreed with me, Fred Edie changed my mind. He convinced me that I had it backward. Santa doesn\u2019t prepare you for disillusionment\u2014he prepares you for belief. He\u2019s a kind of training-wheel Jesus, presenting aspects of faith in a manner that kids can handle.\n\n\u201cIf the Santa story is a type of the Jesus story, [it] persists because the Jesus story is true,\u201d Dr. Edie wrote. \u201cIt is true because it reveals that all life ultimately comes to us as a gift. It is true in proclaiming that the receiving of this gift occurs in the sharing of it. It is true in its testimony to the powers above...as benevolent, close at hand, and definitely not us.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Santa is like a stage set. At a certain point, it is rolled away, revealing a story still more impossible to believe, where the sun shines, the trees glisten, and the presents patiently wait beneath the Johnstons\u2019 tree.\n\n\u2014Mr. Cohen is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-12-19T16:05:00.000Z", "article.section": "Life and Style", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "He\u2019s a kind of training-wheel Jesus, presenting aspects of faith in a way children can handle.", "title": "Learning That There\u2019s No Santa Taught Me to Believe", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AP167_SANTA_G_20141219105746.jpg", "alt": "Learning that there\u2019s no Santa taught me to believe", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AP167_SANTA_D_20141219105746.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10912639172741004777804580345292598097392&headline=Learning%20that%20there%u2019s%20no%20Santa%20taught%20me%20to%20believe&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10912639172741004777804580345292598097392"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "atheism,belief,childhood,christmas,growing up,hanukkah,religion,santa claus,theism,political,general news,society,community,essay (discontinued from 13th january 2015)", "news_keywords": "atheism,belief,childhood,christmas,growing up,hanukkah,religion,santa claus,theism,political", "article.headline": "Learning that there\u2019s no Santa taught me to believe", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AP167_SANTA_E_20141219105746.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AP167_SANTA_D_20141219105746.jpg"}}, "description": "He\u2019s a kind of training-wheel Jesus, presenting aspects of faith in a way children can handle.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10912639172741004777804580345292598097392&headline=Learning%20that%20there%u2019s%20no%20Santa%20taught%20me%20to%20believe&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10912639172741004777804580345292598097392", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Life and Style", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "He\u2019s a kind of training-wheel Jesus, presenting aspects of faith in a way children can handle.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-19T16:05:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-73ea", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "embed_count": 1, "image_count": 1, "word_count": 1165, "internal_link_count": 3}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "He\u2019s a kind of training-wheel Jesus, presenting aspects of faith in a way children can handle.", "title": "Learning That There\u2019s No Santa Taught Me to Believe", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/learning-that-theres-no-santa-taught-me-to-believe-1419005139", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AP167_SANTA_G_20141219105746.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Rich Cohen", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Learning That There\u2019s No Santa Taught Me to Believe", "article.type": "Essay", "article.id": "SB10912639172741004777804580345292598097392", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-19T16:05:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd210b\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019d come to believe that faith in Santa stood behind a loss of faith in general\u2014 churches shuttered, pews empty.\nENLARGE The author, en route to a crisis of faith, 1973 Ellen CohenI used to hang around the mall and tell kids there is no Santa.\nBut to children, he\u2019s more than an angel.\n\u201cIf the Santa story is a type of the Jesus story, [it] persists because the Jesus story is true,\u201d Dr. Edie wrote.\nAccording to Fred Edie, an associate professor at Duke Divinity School, children are drawn to Santa because he represents certain aspects of Jesus."}
