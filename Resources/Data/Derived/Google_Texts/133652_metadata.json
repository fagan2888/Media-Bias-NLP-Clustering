For example: Unlike his potential opponents, he has been through this before, and his political and personal history, from his Massachusetts governorship to his leadership at Bain Capital, have already been picked through, exposed, and exploited \u2014 so surprises are improbable. Unlike his potential opponents, he knows exactly what a long, grinding national campaign is like \u2014 so he can prepare accordingly. And unlike his potential opponents, he has the fruits of his 2012 vice-presidential vetting process at his disposal \u2014 so he has leverage.\n\nBut if 2016 sees the return of Mitt Romney, expect the return, too, of another name: Jonathan Gruber. And that will be, for Romney, a serious disadvantage.\n\nIn his new book, America\u2019s Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, journalist Steven Brill chronicles the years-long process that led to Obamacare and notes the central role its architect had earlier played in developing \u201cRomneycare.\u201d In 2005, writes Brill, aides to the first-term Republican governor of Massachusetts were calling the hotshot MIT economist to ask for help with a possible \u201cmarket-based health-care reform program.\u201d The politician and the professor hit it off; Gruber later told Brill that Romney seemed to him \u201cthe perfect public servant.\u201d Together, the pair charted out a three-pronged health-care plan that prohibited insurance companies from screening people for preexisting conditions, provided government subsidies to those who could not afford insurance, and established an individual mandate. At the April 2006 Romneycare signing celebration, held at Boston\u2019s Faneuil Hall, Romney noted that Gruber\u2019s econometric model was \u201cessential\u201d to the legislation\u2019s success. Three years later, the Obama administration would draw on Romneycare, and its key economist, for its own plan.\n\nThat personnel link did not, of course, go unnoticed during the last presidential cycle. In March 2011, Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post speculated that Gruber might prove \u201cthe death knell of the Romney candidacy.\u201d A year later, in April 2012, Romney having by then nearly wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination, the Obama reelection team featured Gruber prominently in an online video: \u201cI helped Governor Romney develop his health-care reform, or \u2018Romneycare,\u2019 before going down to Washington to help President Obama develop his national version of that law,\u201d says Gruber in the three-minute spot. \u201cThe core of the Affordable Care Act, or \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 and what we did in Massachusetts are identical.\u201d No doubt that connection would be readily drawn next year, too.\n\nBut in 2016, Romney\u2019s well-documented link to Gruber would be particularly poisonous. In 2012, Jonathan Gruber was a wunderkind economist and much-feted health-care guru who had been heavily involved in the premier health-care reform efforts of the last decade. But in 2015, he is to many the embodiment of the smug, smarter-than-thou superciliousness that, since January 2009, has seemed to emanate from this particular White House. His casual admission that Obamacare was written in a \u201ctortured\u201d way to game the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s scoring process \u2014 and that \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d was crucial to passing the bill \u2014 seemed to confirm widespread suspicions that the Obama administration has no compunction about deceiving the masses whenever it proves expedient.\n\nThe facts that the deception practiced by Gruber and his White House associates long postdated his affiliation with Romney, and that there is no evidence that anything similar afflicted Romneycare, are unlikely to matter much in what could well be a fiercely contested Republican primary. Gruber remains a Romney connection, and what in 2012 was merely the unpleasant task of explaining away Romney\u2019s link with the president\u2019s health-care plan \u2014 some egghead consultant, what\u2019s-his-name, at MIT \u2014 is now the forbidding task of explaining away his link with the incarnation of liberal arrogance.\n\nBut the problem is not Gruber\u2019s toxicity alone; it is also that Romney would be the only candidate on the debate stage required to defend that unsavory tie. For primary voters looking for a \u201cfresh,\u201d \u201cforward-looking\u201d nominee, the sole candidate linked to Obama\u2019s primary health-care consultant would hardly be an appealing choice.\n\nOf course, this new iteration of the Romney\u2013Gruber link would reveal nothing about a Candidate Romney\u2019s principles or proposals, which, in a more just world, would be the main focus of voters\u2019 and commentators\u2019 attention.
