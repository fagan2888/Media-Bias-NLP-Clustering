Verrilli Jr. wrote in his brief to the Supreme Court, \u201cthat greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare in ways that may prove to be more widespread, longer lasting and graver than the effects of any other pollutant regulated under the act.\u201d\n\nThe case that will be heard on Monday involves interlocking judicial decisions, statutory provisions and agency regulations complicated enough to make Rube Goldberg blush. But one aspect of it concerns the straightforward question of whether the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority by reinterpreting the Clean Air Act to avoid what it called \u201cabsurd results.\u201d\n\nThe challenged regulations built on the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-to-4 decision in 2007 in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which required the agency to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles if it found that they endangered public health or welfare.\n\nThe agency made such a finding, saying that \u201celevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\u201d pose a danger to \u201ccurrent and future generations,\u201d and it set limits on emissions from new vehicles. (Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement on Tuesday calling for new regulations to reduce carbon emissions from heavy-duty trucks was also based on the 2007 Supreme Court decision and the agency\u2019s finding.)\n\nThe agency also issued regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources like power plants. While acknowledging that the relevant provisions of the Clean Air Act fit such emissions imperfectly, the agency said the law nonetheless compelled it to require permits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStates and industry groups challenged the various regulations on many grounds, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce calling them \u201cthe most burdensome, costly, far-reaching program ever adopted by a United States regulatory agency.\u201d\n\nA three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously rejected all of the challenges, some on the merits and some on the ground that the parties before the court lacked standing to pursue them.\n\nWhen the full appeals court declined to rehear the case, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented, and he identified the ground that would turn out to interest the Supreme Court. He said the agency had gone astray in revising the text of the statute.\n\n\u201cThe task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh wrote, but it is primarily one for Congress to address. \u201cThe framers of the Constitution,\u201d he added, \u201cdid not grant the executive branch the authority to set economic and social policy as it sees fit.\u201d\n\nThe agency said its regulation of tailpipe emissions also required regulation of emissions from stationary sources under two permitting programs. The Clean Air Act says those programs cover all sources that can annually emit 100 or 250 tons of the relevant pollutant, a threshold that works tolerably well for conventional air pollutants like lead and carbon monoxide. But that threshold, applied to greenhouse gases, which are emitted in far greater amounts, would require the regulation of millions of sources of pollution.\n\nAll sides agree that requiring permits at the statutory thresholds would impose enormous burdens. \u201cWe\u2019d be regulating mom-and-pop stores,\u201d said Peter S. Glaser, a lawyer for the Washington Legal Foundation, which filed a supporting brief opposing the regulations.\n\nApplying the law as written would increase the number of covered sources under one program from fewer than 280 to more than 80,000, reaching commercial and residential sources and subjecting them to expenses averaging almost $60,000, according to the appeals court. A second program would reach six million sources, subjecting them to expenses of more than $20,000 each. The cost of the programs would rise to $21 billion from $62 million.\n\nThe agency said Congress could not have intended such an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d Its solution was to raise the statutory emissions threshold to 75,000 to 100,000 tons per year, thus reaching far fewer facilities. This was, Mr. Verrilli told the justices, a permissible exercise of discretion and one subject to tightening over time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTexas and other states challenging the agency\u2019s actions acknowledged that the higher thresholds resulted in less regulation, but told the appeals court that this proved only that the E.P.A. was \u201cacting as a benevolent dictator rather than a tyrant.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court considered nine petitions seeking review of the appeals court\u2019s decision on many grounds, and it accepted six of them. But it limited the issue it would consider to whether the agency \u201cpermissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouses gases.\u201d Among the cases accepted for review was Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 12-1146.\n\nThe question was narrow, and it appeared spurred by Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent. Environmental groups said they were pleased that the court had not questioned the agency\u2019s finding that greenhouse gases pose a danger, or that it can regulate tailpipe emissions. They added that the agency has other tools to regulate stationary sources should it lose in the pending case.\n\nThe case has divided the states along predictable lines. A Supreme Court brief filed by Texas and a dozen other states called the challenged regulations \u201cone of the most brazen power grabs ever attempted by an administrative agency,\u201d while a brief filed by New York and 14 other states said the agency\u2019s \u201cgradual transition\u201d to more comprehensive regulation was \u201ca reasonable and temporary accommodation to certain practical implementation problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140219184742, "twitter": {"description": "On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider the limits of executive authority, in a case on greenhouse gas emissions.", "title": "As Obama Vows to Act on Climate Change, Justices Weigh His Approach", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/politics/in-emissions-case-supreme-court-to-consider-the-limits-of-obamas-authority.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002720896"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "adamliptak", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/politics/in-emissions-case-supreme-court-to-consider-the-limits-of-obamas-authority.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002720896", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/politics/in-emissions-case-supreme-court-to-consider-the-limits-of-obamas-authority.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "As Obama Vows to Go It Alone, Justices Weigh a Boundary", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 19, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Supreme Court (US),Greenhouse Gas Emissions,Clean Air Act,Regulation and Deregulation of Industry,Electric Light and Power", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Adam Liptak", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ADAM LIPTAK", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider the limits of executive authority, in a case on greenhouse gas emissions.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider the limits of executive authority, in a case on greenhouse gas emissions.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/adam_liptak/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-02-21", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Electric Light and Power", "published": "2014-02-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "20scotus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140221112524, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/politics/in-emissions-case-supreme-court-to-consider-the-limits-of-obamas-authority.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider the limits of executive authority, in a case on greenhouse gas emissions.", "title": "As Obama Vows to Act on Climate Change, Justices Weigh His Approach"}, "pdate": 20140219, "des": "Electric Light and Power", "articleid": 100000002720896, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "As Obama Vows to Act on Climate Change, Justices Weigh His Approach", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca295\"", "article_summary": "When the full appeals court declined to rehear the case, Judge Brett M.
