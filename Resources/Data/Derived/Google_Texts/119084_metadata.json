They\u2019re finding that in North Florida there are nearly 30 plans available, however, \u201cthey\u2019re all, unfortunately, all versions of Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and that\u2019s fairly alarming that there is no competition,\" says Donna Gillette.\n\nGillette is a mental health specialist, in private practice for nearly three decades. For much of that time, she\u2019s been insured through Tallahassee-based Capital Health Plan, a Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, for short. CHP has long been regarded as one of the best HMO\u2019s in the nation, so Gillette was shocked when she received a series of letters from CHP, first telling her that they were dropping her insurance plan, and then, offering her the ability to renew for an additional year\u2014at a higher rate. That led her to shop around:\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be able to continue with them because of the increase in their premium, which was 110-130-percent of my income, so I was looking forward to Obamacare,\" she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to have to leave the plan if they don\u2019t want to,\" said CHP President John Hogan, who says the company is trying to find ways to keep as many people on its plans as possible.\n\nCHP insures many small businesses. Under the Affordable Care Act those businesses are classified as organizations with two or more employees. Gillette is a business of one and therefore, is being steered to the individual market. The only provider of that kind of insurance in more than 30 predominantly rural Florida counties is Florida Blue, which has a controlling stake on CHP\u2019s governing board.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of companies throughout Florida that actually offer the type of coverage mandated by the exchanges and so that would be the question\u2014not for us, but, they\u2019ve selectively decided to be in some areas and not in other areas, and for the way the exchanges are set up now, that\u2019s where you\u2019d think the competition would come from,\" said CHP Chief Medical Officer Nancy Van Veesem on why the company is sitting out of healthcare.gov.\n\nCHP has opted not to compete in the individual market because it has not done so ever before. The company would also have to figure out a way to expand its services beyond its seven county region, and offer individual plans. CHP President John Hogan says those plans could cost more than what the company already provides, with fewer benefits. CHP Medical Director Estrelitta Redmon says when people see deductibles, no matter how big or small\u2014they tend to delay care. CHP\u2019s model is based on the opposite -- prevention:\n\n\u201cWhen patients have a higher out-of-pocket cost initially, they\u2019ll delay the preventive care and end up with rescue care, and that\u2019s something our model really doesn\u2019t support.\u201d\n\nEmergency care is more expensive and HMO\u2019s are aimed at controlling costs. As an HMO, CHP doesn\u2019t have deductibles. Members pay a fixed amount of money per month and receive services,. A CHP plan is the equivalent of a platinum plan on the federal government\u2019s healthcare exchange website. And Hogan says offering less for more, is not what the company is about. But at the same time, he isn\u2019t ruling out the federal government\u2019s exchanges either.\n\n\u201cThings that may not be permitted today, the way the regulations are being interpreted, maybe they will be permitted in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, CHP customer Donna Gillette is weighing her options \u2013 or, more correctly, her option. She\u2019ll pay about $700 dollars a month for an unsubsidized plan, $500 dollars less than what she was paying under CHP coverage.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "There\u2019s more than one insurance company in North Florida, but you wouldn\u2019t know it just by looking at the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wfsu.org/post/capital-health-plan-sitting-out-federal-insurance-exchange-how-long", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfsu/files/styles/medium/public/201311/CHP.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "There\u2019s more than one insurance company in North Florida, but you wouldn\u2019t know it just by looking at the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange", "title": "Capital Health Plan Sitting Out Of Federal Insurance Exchange, But For How Long?"}, "story_id": 245470464, "twitter": {"site": "@wfsunews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HatterLynn"}, "author": "Lynn Hatter", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Capital Health Plan Sitting Out Of Federal Insurance Exchange, But For How Long?"}, "nid": 41832, "datePublished": "2013-11-15", "keywords": "Florida Blue, Health Insurance Exchanges", "wordCount": 691, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9154\"", "article_summary": "For much of that time, she\u2019s been insured through Tallahassee-based Capital Health Plan, a Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, for short.\nThere\u2019s more than one insurance company in North Florida, but you wouldn\u2019t know it just by looking at the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange website.\nA CHP plan is the equivalent of a platinum plan on the federal government\u2019s healthcare exchange website.\nShe\u2019ll pay about $700 dollars a month for an unsubsidized plan, $500 dollars less than what she was paying under CHP coverage.\nCHP President John Hogan says those plans could cost more than what the company already provides, with fewer benefits."}
