After being taken to the hospital, the patient was confirmed to be infected with the virus and was placed in isolation, though his condition is reportedly improving and he has already been discharged from the hospital.\n\nSince then, there have been a few more confirmed cases in the U.S. \u2014 one in Florida, and most recently one in Illinois. \u201cWe definitely should expect more cases of MERS to arrive in the United States,\u201d Dr. Daniel Lucey, at Georgetown University Medical Center, told CNN. Hospitals have been warned about the potential spread of the virus for a year, and given instructions by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to prevent transmission, such as placing MERS patients in confined rooms. \u201cThe idea behind it is not to circulate any germs or viruses to other parts of the hospital,\u201d Dr. Bruno Petinaux of George Washington University Hospital told CNN.\n\nThough infected persons must be isolated in these rooms, hospital personnel and health care staff will always be at a higher risk of contracting the disease simply due to the fact that they will be more likely to be exposed to it. The Illinois patient reportedly had been in contact with the original Indiana patient, which is how healthcare experts believe he became infected with the virus. MERS can cause symptoms ranging from fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing, to overall flu-like features.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mers outbreak, mers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There has been another MERS case confirmed in Illinois, and hospitals are beginning to brace for a potential outbreak of the virus.", "title": "US Hospitals Brace For MERS Outbreak: Third Case Confirmed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/third-us-mers-case-confirmed-illinois-hospitals-prepare-potential-viral-outbreak-283220", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/hospital-staff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There has been another MERS case confirmed in Illinois, and hospitals are beginning to brace for a potential outbreak of the virus.", "title": "US Hospitals Brace For MERS Outbreak: Third Case Confirmed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/third-us-mers-case-confirmed-illinois-hospitals-prepare-potential-viral-outbreak-283220", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/hospital-staff.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/hospital-staff.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-17T18:13:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T18:13:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There has been another MERS case confirmed in Illinois, and hospitals are beginning to brace for a potential outbreak of the virus."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2770\"", "article_summary": "Hospitals throughout the U.S. are preparing for a possible MERS outbreak, in light of the third confirmed case of the virus in Illinois.\n\u201cThe idea behind it is not to circulate any germs or viruses to other parts of the hospital,\u201d Dr. Bruno Petinaux of George Washington University Hospital told CNN.\nHealthcare professionals are at a higher risk of contracting the MERS virus, since they are more likely to be exposed to infected patients.\nThe Illinois patient reportedly had been in contact with the original Indiana patient, which is how healthcare experts believe he became infected with the virus.\nSince then, there have been a few more confirmed cases in the U.S. \u2014 one in Florida, and most recently one in Illinois."}
