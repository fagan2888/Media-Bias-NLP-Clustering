ColoradoCare Initiative #20 is less than 20 pages long, compared to 900-plus for the ACA. A 2016 ColoradoCare ballot win would bring universal health care, while decreasing the total cost of health care by $4.4 billion.\n\nThoughtful conservatives note the ACA ads layers of bureaucracy for businesses, covers more people while doing little to cut costs and requires people to buy insurance in a one-size-fits-all federal dictum. ColoradoCare lightens businesses' load by decoupling the burden of providing/administering health benefits, slashes administrative waste and is designed in Colorado by and for Coloradans. And, it's simple enough to actually work.\n\nMeanwhile, ColoradoCare does heavy lifting social justice work beyond the ACA's good intentions: Gone would be deductibles, co-pays, un- and under-insurance. Every Coloradan would benefit from comprehensive health care \u2014 including mental health and some vision and dental \u2014 at all times without exception. All while saving billions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do more for less? We'd end the gridlock created when 400-plus private insurers create multi-payer madness designed to profit them by making actually getting paid an obstacle for providers and patients. ColoradoCare would pay for health care: Done. We'd use the purchasing power of Colorado's 5.3 million to negotiate prices on drugs/supplies. Simplifying the payment system would reduce fraud and duplication. And we'd invest in prevention and keeping every Coloradan healthy for our shared benefit and savings.\n\nCarry a petition, learn more and contribute: www.ColoradoCareYES.co\n\nSara Wright\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28604663/sara-wright-coloradocare-initiative-bests-aca", "modificationDate": "2015-08-08T19:26:12-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2025-08-07T18:29:11-0600", "description": "Heather Shannon's July 28 guest opinion, \" The ACA is here to stay,\" notes the Affordable Care Act's waiver for state innovation invites states to improve upon federal reform, and Colorado can lead the way.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28604663:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-08T19:25:49-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28604663/sara-wright-coloradocare-initiative-bests-aca", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Heather Shannon's July 28 guest opinion, \" The ACA is here to stay,\" notes the Affordable Care Act's waiver for state innovation invites states to improve upon federal reform, and Colorado can lead the way.", "title": "Sara Wright: ColoradoCare initiative bests ACA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Heather Shannon's July 28 guest opinion, \" The ACA is here to stay,\" notes the Affordable Care Act's waiver for state innovation invites states to improve upon federal reform, and Colorado can lead the way.", "title": "Sara Wright: ColoradoCare initiative bests ACA", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28604663/sara-wright-coloradocare-initiative-bests-aca", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-08T19:25:49-0600", "sailthru.title": "Sara Wright: ColoradoCare initiative bests ACA", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-08-08T19:26:12-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4a9\"", "article_summary": "A 2016 ColoradoCare ballot win would bring universal health care, while decreasing the total cost of health care by $4.4 billion.\nEvery Coloradan would benefit from comprehensive health care \u2014 including mental health and some vision and dental \u2014 at all times without exception.\nColoradoCare Initiative #20 is less than 20 pages long, compared to 900-plus for the ACA.\nColoradoCare would pay for health care: Done.\nColoradoCare lightens businesses' load by decoupling the burden of providing/administering health benefits, slashes administrative waste and is designed in Colorado by and for Coloradans."}
