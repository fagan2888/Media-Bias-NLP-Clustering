Buying presents for the holidays can be trying for low income families, but thanks to a helpful event those families can bring the spirit of Christmas home.



Community Action Partnership hosted "Day of Hope" on Saturday.



People in booths, from different agencies, guided families through Lindbergh Community Center to pick out various items.



Families collected food boxes, toys, household necessities and coats to keep warm for the winter.



"All of the families that have came in here are very grateful," said one of the event organizers, Ashley Bangundy. "They didn't actually realize what all they were getting, so it's kind of a surprise for them. They thought it was just a coat and a toy."



A surprise that had one lady in tears.



"We had a lady come in earlier who was crying, and she said 'I didn't expect this. I thought when I showed up I was just going to get a coat and I get everything else.' So, it was kind of heartwarming," said an event volunteer, Rhonda Bullmaster.



This event helped more than 60 families in the community.
