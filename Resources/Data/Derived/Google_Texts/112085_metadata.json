The series is brought to you by Siemens.

How did he do it? Instead of gut feelings and anecdotes, Nate Silver and his blog FiveThirtyEight used \u201cbig data\u201d to correctly predict the outcome of every single state and the District of Columbia. But Silver was not the only person to use data in that election; the Obama campaign also famously employed big data to help them win votes, using it to do everything from tracking the effectiveness of door-to-door canvasing to determining the contents of ads. Now, more and more the same tools and techniques Silver and the Obama campaign used to find trends in everything from election results to poll numbers are being applied to a very different topic: your health.\n\nBig data refers to the use of specialized tools and techniques to understand and distill meaningful insights of massive amounts of information. Imagine using a spreadsheet to record your friend\u2019s favorite restaurants. By looking at the document you might be able to see that most of your friends love Italian or that nobody\u2019s favorite restaurant is seafood. Big data does the same thing, except instead of having information from a handful of friends; the file contains information from thousands, even millions of people. Crunching this cache of data requires more than your basic spreadsheet program and laptop, but the benefit is being able to find nuanced, hidden patterns in otherwise impenetrable masses of information.\n\nHealth is particularly well suited to benefit from big data. For decades hospitals, researchers, and government agencies have diligently collected a huge variety of health data, from the success rates of drug trials, to the cost of an average medical procedure, to the demographic information of patients, to the average wait time in emergency rooms. A recent report by the research and consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that there are four \u201cpools\u201d of data in the health care field: pharmaceutical research data (e.g. clinical trial results), clinical data (e.g. patient records), activity and cost data (e.g. estimated procedure costs), and patient behavior data (e.g. health purchases history). Where big data comes in is gathering all this information together in one place, sometimes from many different data warehouses, and using it to gain insights into how our health care system can be better. Want to know which drugs are least likely to have side effects? Which individual doctors have the best outcomes? Which procedures are most cost-effective? Big data could answer these questions and more.\n\nThere are three major areas where big data is revolutionizing health care. First, big data is increasingly being used by health care providers to identify patients at high-risk for certain medical conditions before major problems occur. One health care system in Texas is using data from clinical records and insurance claims to identify which patients will be at high-risk of an ailment in the future and using that information to offer them early preventative services. A different provider has been using data from patient records to build predictive models around intervention successes. The analysis provided by the data has successfully cut down on hospital readmissions by 31 percent. Google is also getting involved in identifying health risks. Using data from user search histories, the technology company is able to track the spread of the flu across the world in near real time.\n\nThis is where the power of big data becomes the power of knowing. By working with big data experts like Siemens Healthcare, providers are able to use solutions that automate the collection of healthcare data, aggregating and standardizing the data across an enterprise, thereby using predictive analytics to help identify populations at risk, while monitoring performance at all levels of the organization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data is making health care better, smarter and cheaper", "author": "Sponsored by Siemens", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Data is making health care better, smarter and cheaper", "title": "Big Data Improves Health Care", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/09/big_data_improves_health_care/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/big_data.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Data is making health care better, smarter and cheaper", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/big_data.jpg", "title": "Big Data Improves Health Care", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Big Data Improves Health Care", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Big Data, Health, SIEMENS, SIEMENS_STORYPROMO, sustainability, Sustainable", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd89\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Big Data, Health, SIEMENS, SIEMENS_STORYPROMO, sustainability, Sustainable, Sustainability NewsThis is the first installment in a series that explores how technology is transforming healthcare.\nThere are three major areas where big data is revolutionizing health care.\nFirst, big data is increasingly being used by health care providers to identify patients at high-risk for certain medical conditions before major problems occur.\nA recent report by the research and consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that there are four \u201cpools\u201d of data in the health care field: pharmaceutical research data (e.g.\nThis is where the power of big data becomes the power of knowing."}
