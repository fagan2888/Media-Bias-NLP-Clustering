He did not attend.\n\nTitle companies handle large amounts of money in closing real estate transactions, keeping funds in trust or escrow and then paying them to the appropriate party.\n\nThe extent of the alleged embezzlement is unclear, although TRGC said in its lawsuit that American Title\u2019s controller, Bill Krieg, 69, admitted funds had been misappropriated from the trust accounts.\n\nThe Colorado Division of Insurance initiated an investigation into TRGC\u2019s allegations Feb. 5, the day after Talley\u2019s death, according to the lawsuit. A division spokesman earlier told The Denver Post that the investigation had begun before Talley\u2019s death. The spokesman on Wednesday said he had been misinformed.\n\nAt the division\u2019s request, TRGC said it filed the lawsuit to shut down various bank accounts that might still contain escrow funds, all at a single Denver bank. It said it needed access to Talley\u2019s files to \u201cidentify what escrow obligations remain outstanding.\u201d\n\nAmerican Title\u2019s several offices across Colorado were shut down Tuesday, and all phones were disconnected. Efforts to reach Talley\u2019s wife and business partner, Cheryl Talley, were unsuccessful.\n\nTRGC said in the suit that it believes Cheryl Talley on Monday entered the company\u2019s headquarters and removed items from her husband\u2019s office, including \u201coperating bank statements.\u201d It is seeking those records.\n\nCalls to the couple\u2019s home, near the southwest part of Cherry Creek State Park, were not returned. Personal and business pages on Facebook were no longer available Wednesday.\n\nThe landlord at American Title\u2019s seventh-floor headquarters at Peakview Tower in Greenwood Village on Friday filed a demand for back rent in Arapahoe County for $41,164, records show.\n\nThe company had been there since December 2011.\n\nTRGC said state insurance investigators told it that Talley\u2019s death \u201craises concerns\u201d that critical information about the company \u201cmay be irretrievably lost or exposed to the public.\u201d\n\nThe division has refused to comment further.\n\nTitle companies typically handle real estate closings, where funds are set aside \u2014 escrowed \u2014 to pay off existing mortgage loans, property taxes, homeowner insurance premiums and other charges associated with the culmination of a real estate purchase or sale.\n\nThe impact of Talley\u2019s alleged conduct reaches further than the altered ledger entries, TRGC says in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cInnocent homeowners are subject to potential foreclosure actions, harm to their credit ratings, and disclosure of private, sensitive, personal and financial information,\u201d the company said.\n\nAmerican Title was an agent for TRGC, which underwrote the policies protecting an owner\u2019s or lender\u2019s financial interest in real estate against loss due to defects in the line of title or liens.\n\nTalley had been an agent for TRGC since March 2009, the lawsuit shows.\n\nAn employee at American Title said Wednesday that Talley was \u201ca wonderful person, just amazing to us employees.\u201d The employee, who asked that her name not be used because she\u2019s looking for work, said the company\u2019s demise was a shock and that she was unaware of the escrow allegations noted in the lawsuit.\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Uncovered missing escrow funds could be nail-gun suicide\u2019s cause", "title": "Uncovered missing escrow funds could be nail-gun suicide\u2019s cause", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/12/uncovered-missing-escrow-funds-could-be-nail-gun-suicides-cause/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-12T17:33:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T17:33:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At the division\u2019s request, TRGC said it filed the lawsuit to shut down various bank accounts that might still contain escrow funds, all at a single Denver bank.\nTitle companies handle large amounts of money in closing real estate transactions, keeping funds in trust or escrow and then paying them to the appropriate party.\nA division spokesman earlier told The Denver Post that the investigation had begun before Talley\u2019s death.\nTitle companies typically handle real estate closings, where funds are set aside \u2014 escrowed \u2014 to pay off existing mortgage loans, property taxes, homeowner insurance premiums and other charges associated with the culmination of a real estate purchase or sale.\nThe lawsuit was filed in part to help learn that answer."}
