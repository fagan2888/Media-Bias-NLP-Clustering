While many in the media claim that Mrs. Clinton has embraced President Obama\u2019s legacy more than the socialist Sanders has, a closer examination of her words reveals implicit criticism of Obama\u2019s policies and progress.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton\u2019s words at times did embrace and praise Obama\u2019s policy, both she and Sanders are, in effect, treating Obama\u2019s policies as failures. This is not because, as some argue, they would like to push the hope and change agenda on to greater victories. It is, instead, because there is no way of getting around the fact that Obama\u2019s policies have largely been disastrous for this country.\n\n\u201cIn ways sizable and subtle, Clinton sought on Thursday [February 11] to show she was the faithful heir of the President\u2019s legacy, repeating his name more than 15 times throughout the debate,\u201d reported Sam Frizell for Time magazine. Similarly, Politico\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere noted that \u201cOn the debate stage Thursday, she [Mrs. Clinton] invoked Obama\u2019s name 21 times along with phrases like \u2018I fully endorse,\u2019 \u2018I am a staunch supporter,\u2019 and \u2018I think President Obama has set a great example.\u2019\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton must carefully weigh the benefits of appealing to Obama\u2019s remaining base of support while not losing dissatisfied Democrat voters to Sanders. While Mrs. Clinton did, as these media organizations report, continuously appeal to the President\u2019s popularity and policies, both candidates\u2019 words, in reality, serve as an ongoing indictment of President Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton at the February 11 debate. \u201cAnd for good cause. Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. There aren\u2019t enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.\u201d\n\nAs we have reported, one of President Obama\u2019s signature falsehoods has been to argue that the economy is doing very well and has recovered. \u201cBack in January, the labor force participation rate was the lowest since 1978,\u201d we wrote. \u201cIt has since increased by a mere 0.2%.\u201d Last year The Wall Street Journal called this recovery \u201cthe worst expansion since World War II.\u201d\n\nSanders challenged the claims and accomplishments of the Obama administration in a series of questions he raised during the debate: \u201cWho in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time, is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent?\u201d\n\nCharles Krauthammer described it this way: \u201cBernie Sanders is careful never to blame President Obama directly, but his description of the America Obama leaves behind is devastating\u2014a wasteland of stagnant wages, rising inequality, a sinking middle class, young people crushed by debt, the American Dream dying.\u201d\n\nAnother part of Hillary\u2019s plan, to show she is just as tough on Wall Street as Bernie, is to impose a four percent \u201cwealth tax\u201d on people making more than $5 million per year, which she says would raise $150 billion over 10 years. That\u2019s $15 billion a year. This serves to highlight another aspect of the Obama presidency. While campaigning for the presidency in 2008, Obama said that President George W. Bush had added $4 trillion to the national debt in 8 years, which Obama called \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d Since President Obama took office in 2009, the U.S. has added approximately $9 trillion to the debt. Irresponsible? Unpatriotic? In that context, the idea that $15 billion a year will do anything significant while the federal government is spending $4 trillion a year is absurd. It is just class warfare, to show that she is down with the people, just like Bernie.\n\nAnd Mrs. Clinton can scarcely complain about Wall Street \u201cwreck[ing]\u201d Main Street. She has refused to release transcripts of her paid Goldman Sachs speeches, according to The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cShe spent no time criticizing Goldman or Wall Street more broadly for its role in the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d writes Ben White for Politico. He cites a person familiar with her 2013 speech as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s so far from what she sounds like as a candidate now. It was like a rah-rah speech. She sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton also defended her own Wall Street support by pointing to Obama\u2019s big money from Wall Street when he ran in 2008.\n\nOne of the President\u2019s biggest failures has been ObamaCare, which has resulted in higher premiums and less care overall. Sanders criticized the many failures of Obama\u2019s signature achievement, decrying how, \u201cTwenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.\u201d\n\nSix years after the passage of ObamaCare, the media tout that just 29 million remain uninsured. But that\u2019s about the same number as when ObamaCare became law.\n\n\u201cAbout 4 million new people signed up for ObamaCare this year, which could be a sign that uninsured number is coming down,\u201d reported The Hill last week. \u201cIt remains to be seen, though, how many of the 4 million were previously uninsured.\u201d In other words, enrollees may be simply part of a shell game switching the previously insured across different types of insurance.\n\nIn addition, how many people have lost their full-time jobs as a result of the perverse ObamaCare incentives that result in employers hiring fewer full-time employees, and limiting the hours of part-time workers?\n\n\u201cMillions of people have high deductibles and co-payments,\u201d Sanders said at the debate.\n\nAccording to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal, \u201cAll states, with the exception of Mississippi, saw the cost of health insurance premiums increase for 2016\u201d with most states seeing \u201cpremium costs rise by double digits.\u201d Remember Obama\u2019s promise that ObamaCare would reduce premiums for the average family by $2,500 per year?\n\nEven the co-moderator of the debate, Judy Woodruff, implicitly lambasted President Obama\u2019s record on race relations. \u201cSecretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23-year-old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example,\u201d said Woodruff. \u201cHardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency?\u201d\n\nThe implicit assertion is, of course, that race relations have deteriorated under the leadership of America\u2019s first black president.\n\nMrs. Clinton also proclaimed during the debate the need to guarantee \u201cthat women\u2019s work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.\u201d Why hasn\u2019t that happened after seven years of the Obama administration, including the first two years in which the Democrats had majorities in both houses of Congress to push through whatever they wanted, such as ObamaCare?\n\nA Washington Free Beacon analysis conducted last February found that while Mrs. Clinton was a U.S. senator from New York, her female staffers were disproportionately paid 72 cents on the dollar when compared to her male staffers.\n\nClinton must realize that her words marginalize President Obama\u2019s first piece of signed legislation, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. This law was supposed to bolster pay equality by giving workers greater capability to challenge discriminatory pay practices. Arguing, seven years later, as Clinton does, that equal pay has a long way to go shines a light on President Obama\u2019s efforts on this issue, and highlights her own hypocrisy.\n\nWhat the debate demonstrated wasn\u2019t, as the media has claimed, how Mrs. Clinton has married herself to President Obama\u2019s policies. Instead, it has exposed Obama\u2019s policies as abject failures that even Democratic candidates cannot defend.\n\nAt the same time, this debate was another clear example of how the media rarely ever put the Democrats on the defensive. Amazingly, not a single question was asked about any of the investigations looking into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s involvement in Benghazi, into her handling of classified emails on her private server, or regarding the recently revealed subpoena issued by the State Department to the Clinton Foundation for possible conflicts of interest when Clinton was secretary of state.
