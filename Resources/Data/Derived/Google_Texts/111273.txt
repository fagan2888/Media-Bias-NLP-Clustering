There is some deeply disturbing news to report in the Week in Racism.

Sandra Bland

On Friday 10 July, Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old woman from Chicago, (seen above) was pulled over by police in Waller County, Texas, for improper signaling. When she allegedly became combative on the side of the road, she was arrested on charges of assaulting a public servant.

After spending the weekend in jail, she was discovered dead on Monday morning from what the Waller County Sheriff’s office said “appears to be self-inflicted asphyxiation” — death by hanging.

The incident was reported in local press at the time, but it was only on July 16 when a video was released, bringing Bland’s story to national and international attention. Filmed by a bystander, Bland can be heard saying to the officer restraining her: “You just slammed my head into the ground. Do you not even care about that?” Another officer repeatedly tells the man with the recording device that he “needs to leave,” before Bland thanks him for recording the incident and is led away in handcuffs.

Bland was excited about her new job in student outreach at her alma mater, Prairie View A&M University. The job would have started Wednesday. Bland was also an outspoken civil rights advocate who frequently posted on social media about police brutality and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.

Just how many times has this happened before, when there was no one around with a cell phone to capture such brutality on video?

If you feel strongly that we need to uncover the truth about this incident, please sign my petition demanding a full investigation into the death of Sandra Bland.

Jonathan Sanders

Another death after an altercation with a police officer. This happened last week, on July 8, but more details about it are emerging this week.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is stepping in to investigate an incident in Clarke County where an unarmed black man was killed in a physical struggle with a police officer.

Thirty-nine-year-old Jonathan Sanders suffered “some kind of asphyxiation” during an altercation with white officer Kevin Harrington on July 8, in the small town of Stonewall, in the eastern part of the state, said attorney J. Stewart Parrish.

Parrish told local media outlets that Harrington pulled Sanders from a horse and choked him to death with a flashlight. Stonewall Police Chief Michael Street denied the details of the attorney’s allegations. According to Street, the two men engaged in a fight without weapons after Sanders voluntarily stepped down from a horse-drawn buggy.

“We can’t really give out any particulars to it because it is an ongoing investigation. I can say that we’ve always had a good relation with the community, and we continue to do that,” Street said.

We await the results of an autopsy, but meanwhile, according to the Guardian, as of this writing 165 black people have been killed by the police in the U.S. so far this year.

Eric Garner

In more positive news, the city of New York has announced a $5.9 million settlement with the family of Eric Garner, killed on July 17, 2014, due to a banned police chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes.

Garner’s death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, but a grand jury declined to indict the officer on criminal charges. After the grand jury’s decision, the family announced its intention to file a wrongful death lawsuit, seeking $75 million in damages.

During a press conference on July 14 in Harlem, the family assured the public that it will continue to work for changes in the criminal justice system and cautioned the public against viewing the settlement deal in too favorable of terms.

“Don’t congratulate us,” said Gwen Carr, the mother of Mr. Garner. “This is not a victory.”

But the settlement is a start, albeit just a tiny start, a hope that justice will be served in the midst of so much injustice.

Serena Williams

File this one under racism and sexism.

Last weekend, Serena Williams, the women’s world No 1 tennis player and holder of 21 grand slam titles, won her sixth Wimbledon – a truly amazing feat. However, it didn’t take long for David Frum, senior editor of the Atlantic, to send tweets implying that Williams uses steroids, something that has been disproved numerous times in the past. Frum later deleted his tweets.

Then came the attacks on her body. One tweeter stated that Williams’ win was down to her being “built like a man�,” which drew the wrath of J.K. Rowling. The author cleverly responded with a picture of Williams in a red dress and the message:

“Yeah, my husband looks just like this in a dress. You’re an idiot.”

But even before Williams won her 6th Wimbledon, a New York Times article about the body image of female tennis players unleashed a furious debate about the racist and sexist ways in which the media discusses Serena Williams’ body. In it, Ben Rothenberg interviewed Williams and some of her peers about what female athletes “should” look like. “I’m really happy with my body type, and I’m really proud of it,” said Williams.

End of conversation. Or, at least, it should be.
