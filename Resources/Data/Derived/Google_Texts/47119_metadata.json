Some of the priciest properties in Britain are found in this magnet for the rich and famous.\n\nSo it will surprise some to learn that Hampstead Garden Suburb, a swathe of low-density early 20th Century housing that stretches as far as Golders Green, was built specifically to cater for people from all social classes and economic backgrounds. It occupies 243 acres bought from Eton College in 1906.\n\nToday, One Direction\u2019s Harry Styles and TV hosts Jonathan Ross, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan are among celebrity residents.\n\nHeath and home: The five-bedroom \u00a33.65million Wyldes Farm feels rural yet is in the middle of London\n\nWho knows what Raymond Unwin, the socialist architect who designed the suburb, would be thinking, particularly about the fact that Wyldes Farm, the Hampstead house where he lived, is on the market for \u00a33.65 million \u2013 and that\u2019s for just half of it.\n\nThe house has five bedrooms and two reception rooms, and its location \u2013 with Hampstead Heath on its doorstep \u2013 starts to explain its asking price.\n\nIt was built in the mid-1600s as a farmhouse. But by the end of the 18th Century Hampstead had become a fashionable place for artists and intellectuals, and home-owners began to let out rooms \u2013 including at Wyldes Farm.\n\nLandscape painters John Constable and William Collins (whose son Wilkie, the novelist, used to play in the garden as a child) lived in the house, as did the Romantic poet William Blake. It is also believed to have been used as a meeting place for members of the Fabian Society in the late 19th Century.\n\nBut its most famous resident was Charles Dickens. In 1837, a distraught Dickens, then in his mid-20s, rented the property following the death of his sister-in-law Mary Hogarth.\n\nAiry: The modern kitchen is in a house full of historic features\n\nAt the time of his stay, Dickens was writing his first two major novels, The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. They were written in instalments, because they were serialised in literary magazines.\n\nAs he was working to tight deadlines, Dickens needed a secluded place to work, and he knew the area offered this because he had stayed there in his childhood when his father was trying to evade creditors.\n\nThe house, which has two staircases, has plenty of features to remind you how it would have looked when Dickens was writing \u2013 vaulted ceilings, panelled walls and exposed beams.\n\nFamous residents: Charles Dickens and romantic painter John Constable lived in the house\n\nBut it has been updated sufficiently to provide a slick, modern environment. There\u2019s a vast kitchen-dining area with an island workstation and a beautifully presented en suite bathroom and dressing room for the master bedroom.\n\nOutside there are three sections of garden, each offering excellent entertainment space in the summer.\n\nWyldes\u2019s current owner, Yamuna Sharma, is selling because she and her husband plan to live abroad. She says the artistic tradition of the house has lived on.\n\n\u2018Painters, musicians, actors, designers have continued to stay,\u2019 she says.\n\nIndeed Sharma has recently rented out the house to a family with a strong connection to the arts.\n\nHer tenants, businessman Scott Finlay, 54, and teacher wife Catherine, 53, have seen their 21-year-old daughter, a film-maker, and 23-year-old son, an artist, develop their careers while living there.\n\nThe three outbuildings have helped. The Finlays\u2019 son has used one as a studio.\n\nArchitect and poet: Sir Raymond Urwin who designed the suburb and romantic writer William Blake\n\nMeanwhile their daughter drew inspiration from the filming of the recent British film about slavery \u2013 Belle \u2013 up the road at Kenwood House.\n\nCatherine says: \u2018We have loved the house\u2019s unique sense of history, and it\u2019s magical living on the edge of the Heath.\u2019\n\nGary Saunders, of estate agents Westways, says: \u2018There\u2019s been a great deal of interest. It is the first time the house has been on sale for 34 years, it has direct access to the Heath and is a gem of a property with a unique story.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Britain,s,artistic,farmhouse,From,Constable,Dickens,home,astonishing,array,famous,residents", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2698317/Britain-s-artistic-farmhouse-From-Constable-Dickens-home-astonishing-array-famous-residents.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Iconic Wyldes Farm, in Hampstead, North London, is on the market for \u00a33.65 million \u2013 and that\u2019s for just half of the property.", "title": "From Constable to Dickens... the home withfamous residents", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2698317/Britain-s-artistic-farmhouse-From-Constable-Dickens-home-astonishing-array-famous-residents.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/19/1405803537586_wps_2_Artisitc_farmhouse.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2698317/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2698317/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2698317, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Britain,s,artistic,farmhouse,From,Constable,Dickens,home,astonishing,array,famous,residents", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-07-19T21:20:01.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Oliver+Wadeson", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-07-20T07:48:54.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Britain s artistic farmhouse From Constable Dickens home astonishing array famous residents"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Iconic Wyldes Farm, in Hampstead, North London, is on the market for \u00a33.65 million \u2013 and that\u2019s for just half of the property.", "title": "From Constable to Dickens... the home withfamous residents", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2698317/Britain-s-artistic-farmhouse-From-Constable-Dickens-home-astonishing-array-famous-residents.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/19/1405803537586_wps_2_Artisitc_farmhouse.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Iconic Wyldes Farm, in Hampstead, North London, is on the market for \u00a33.65 million \u2013 and that\u2019s for just half of the property."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd15d\"", "article_summary": "Famous residents: Charles Dickens and romantic painter John Constable lived in the houseBut it has been updated sufficiently to provide a slick, modern environment.\nToday, One Direction\u2019s Harry Styles and TV hosts Jonathan Ross, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan are among celebrity residents.\nIn 1837, a distraught Dickens, then in his mid-20s, rented the property following the death of his sister-in-law Mary Hogarth.\nSome of the priciest properties in Britain are found in this magnet for the rich and famous.\nShe says the artistic tradition of the house has lived on."}
