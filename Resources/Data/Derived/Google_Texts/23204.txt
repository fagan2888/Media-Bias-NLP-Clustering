A Moore boy severely injured in the May 20, 2013 tornado is thanking the blood donors who saved his life.

Jackson Quick, 10, visited an Oklahoma Blood Institute donation center on the 2nd anniversary of the tornado.

“I'm alive thanks to blood donors,” Jackson said.

It took 12 blood donors with OBI to save Jackson's life after the massive twister.

“It almost took my right leg completely off,” he explained to other donors as he visited with them.

News 9 first met Jackson's family two years ago. He was with his mother and brother when the tornado hit, but his mom did not survive. Jackson was injured so badly he almost lost his leg. He spent four months in the hospital and is now back at school at Briarwood Elementary.

“The 12 donors whose blood he needed to survive that trauma had no idea who they were helping,” said Leslie Gamble with OBI.

One blood donor was so touched to see the face of a blood recipient that he started crying.

Jackson is encouraging others to donate blood, because you never know who may need help.

“If you do it, a lot more people would be alive and especially a lot more kids would,” Jackson said.

He said when he is old enough, he will donate blood, too.

“That way I can help people out,” Jackson told News 9.

Pre-Memorial Day blood drives will be held this Thursday and Friday, May 21 and 22, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at all Oklahoma Blood Institute donor centers. Donors get free barbeque pork sandwiches and two free tickets to the Oklahoma City Zoo.
