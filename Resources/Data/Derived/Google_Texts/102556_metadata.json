bulldogs accused of seriously injuring a north Queensland man have been saved from death row because they were defending their master.\n\nZane Brache\u2019s dogs Boston and Lola were destined for destruction by Douglas Shire Council until he successfully appealed to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal.\n\nMr Brache was in a fist fight with Anthony Bartels when Boston and Lola attacked Mr Bartels on or near his Daintree property in September last year.\n\nThe tribunal heard the pair had a history of animosity and Mr Bartels had driven to Mr Brache\u2019s property to confront him.\n\nTribunal member Peter Krebs found that during the fight Mr Bartels armed himself with a baseball bat, which he used to strike Mr Brache and his dogs.\n\n\u201cThis was a violent confrontation with both Mr Bartels and Mr Brache striking each other during the course of the conflict,\u201d Mr Krebs said.\n\nMr Brache denied his dogs attacked Mr Bartels and claimed the other man was injured when he fell on a star picket fence.\n\nMr Bartels claimed Mr Brache set the dogs on him and he only used the baseball bat after he was mauled.\n\nMr Krebs found Boston inflicted injuries to Mr Bartels\u2019 back left shoulder and Lola was responsible for injuries to his right ear and throat.\n\nThe council seized both dogs and Mr Brache\u2019s other American bulldog, Rascal, ordering their destruction but after an internal review Rascal was saved from death row.\n\nMr Krebs said Boston and Lola acted were acting in defence of their owner when they attacked Mr Bartels.\n\n\u201cDogs ... like other animals, act on instinct and don\u2019t have the capacity to make reasoned decisions in deciding to intervene or not when their owner is perceived to be in danger,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIt was completely different to when a dog attacked someone in a public place without provocation, he said.\n\nMr Brache said yesterday he had lodged an appeal against the council\u2019s dangerous dog declaration on all three dogs and is yet to get them back.\n\n\u201cThey are family pets, they are not dangerous,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Bartels said he was \u201clivid\u2019\u2019 about the tribunal tribunal decision and still felt the dogs should be destroyed.\n\n\u201cI thought I was gone,\u201d he said of the attack. \u201cI\u2019ve still got scars.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "TWO American bulldogs accused of seriously injuring a north Queensland man have been saved from death row because they were defending their
