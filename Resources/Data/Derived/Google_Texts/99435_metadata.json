Oh, wait, they are the guys in scrubs.\n\nThe ZDogg is Zubin Damania, a Stanford-trained doctor with a clinical practice called Turntable Health in Las Vegas and a stated goal of developing better models of patient care. Meanwhile, for the past few years he\u2019s also been doing parodies of pop music videos on medical themes: Obamacare, pain, prostate disease, bad nurses, getting into medical school, colon disease, addiction, and dozens and dozens more. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna hear me snore!\u201d he sings about sleep apnea to the tune of Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cRoar.\u201d \u201cFriends With Low Platelets,\u201d is a Garth Brooks takeoff on a blood condition. \u201cBig Pharma\u201d parodies Biggie\u2019s \u201cBig Poppa.\u201d\n\nWhen the Atlantic magazine wrote about him in 2013, it said he\u2019d garnered 1.2 million YouTube views, but this summer he got that many hits on one video alone \u2014 \u201cReadmission\u201d (from R. Kelly\u2019s \u201cIgnition\u201d), about hospitals that mess up patient discharge: \u201cLet\u2019s just prevent readmissions/Manage those chronic conditions/Need time preparing the handoff/Move on to other clinicians/Verbal instructions are clear/Only if the patient can hear \u2026 \u201d\n\nThe heartbreaker is \u201cAin\u2019t the Way to Die\u201d (based on the Eminem/Rihanna remix \u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d) with ZDogg acting out the thoughts of a mute, dying patient who wishes somebody would pull the plug. It ends with the long beep of a flat line and the somber written warning: \u201cTalk about your end-of-life issues now with those you love.\u201d\n\nBut mostly it\u2019s just a hoot.
