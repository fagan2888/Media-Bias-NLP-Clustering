The voter wanted to know, \u201cWhy does Texas continue with abstinence education programs, when they don\u2019t seem to be working?\u201d The question was well grounded in fact: in the areas of teen pregnancies and teen births, Texas ranked among the worst in the United States.\n\nPerry heard the question, thought for a second, and replied , \u201cAbstinence works.\u201d\n\nThe reporter pressed on, reminding the governor, \u201cBut we have the third-highest teen teen-pregnancy rate among all states in the country. The questioner\u2019s point is, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working.\u201d The governor responded, \u201cIt \u2013 it works.\u201d\n\nFour years later, the San Antonio Express-News is reporting on a striking number of cases of Chlamydia in a local high school, prompting school officials to organize a meeting \u201cto discuss their sex education program.\u201d\n\nAmanda Marcotte, a Texas native, explained the scope of the problem.\n\nAt the state level, meanwhile, the Texas Tribune reported yesterday on the latest the Republican-run state government.\n\nHealth insurers would be prohibited from covering abortion in all cases save for medical emergencies under a bill the Texas Senate gave preliminary approval to on Tuesday. [\u2026] Under SB 575, private health insurance plans and those offered through the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace could only provide coverage for abortions in cases of medical emergencies. Women seeking coverage for what Taylor calls \u201celective\u201d abortions would be required to purchase supplemental health insurance plans. Ten states now prohibit all health plans from covering abortion, and 15 prohibit abortion coverage on federal marketplace plans, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Officials in Texas like to think their abstinence-education programs are working.
