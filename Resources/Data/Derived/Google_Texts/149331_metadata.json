It is the centralized control.\n\nOnce technocrats seize power over a sector, its political nature is to determine winners and losers, favored and disfavored, in-crowds and out-crowds. That means rationing based on invidious determinations about whose lives matter more and whose less.\n\nBut Sarah Palin threw a wrench into those plans by coining the \u201cdeath panel\u201d descriptive, leading pro-rationers to loudly decry her as an alarmist and a paranoid right wing nut.\n\nThat led to the hilarious phenomenon, of which I have written often, of want-to-be rationers yelling, \u201cHow DARE you say we death panels!\u201d and then whisper, \u201cWe need death panels.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the professional journals\u2013where such plans are hatched\u2013the push for rationing continues. Latest example, a push for rationing the elderly from access to ICUs by Dr. Paul E. Marik in the American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care.\n\nFirst, Marik extols other countries for barring the elderly from ICUs. From, \u201cThe Cost of Inappropriate Care at the End of Life:\u201d\n\nThe United States is in the midst of a health care crisis; health care expenditure currently accounts for 17.7% of the Gross National Product when compared to 6% to 11% for other Western Nations.1,2 Hospitalizations rather than physician and other services are the major contributor to health care spending in the United States. Elderly patients (older than 65 years) account for 11% of the US population yet they account for 34% of health care expenditure. The disproportionate usage of health care costs by the elderly patients is in striking contrast with that of other Western Nations.\n\nThe answer is to bar the door to some of the elderly, those in which wanted life-sustaining treatment \u201cprolong the patient\u2019s death,\u201d a very slippery concept that turns what is actually happening\u2013keeping the patient alive longer\u2013on its head:\n\nAlmost all patients with serious and life-threatening illnesses in the United States regardless of their prognosis or prospect of recovery are admitted to an ICU, unless the patient or his or her surrogate specifically declines ICU admission. It is therefore exceedingly uncommon for intensivists in the United States to refuse ICU admission; if a bed is not immediately available, one is \u2018\u2018made.\u2019\u2019 This contrasts to the situation in most Western nations in which not all requests for an ICU bed are honored. Indeed, refusal of ICU admission is common, with a rate that varies from 24% to 88%.\n\nMarik decides that palliative care specialists decide who gets in, who doesn\u2019t, and who gets kicked out:\n\nA palliative care consult should be obtained as part of the time-limited trial. The patients preferences (or surrogates best estimate of the patient\u2019s wishes) with regard to mechanical ventilation and other forms of life sustaining treatment should be considered in all triage decisions.\n\nBut they can be vetoed.\n\nFor dying patients with irreversible disease, admission to the ICU (or ongoing care) is frequently inappropriate and the care of these patients should be primarily focused on a palliative approach allowing a dignified death. A palliative care consult and an ethics consult should be considered in those circumstances, where the goals of the patient and/or family appear unrealistic and when long-term interventions such as tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement are being considered.\n\nBut that means imposing a conflict of interest upon doctors, requiring them to balance a purported duty to society with that of the patient. Moreover, in some cases, society prevails. So much for optimal care.\n\nSo much, too, for honoring patient wishes, which other medical technocrats are assuring us will be honored if we fill out advance directives and pay doctors to discuss our end-of-life wishes.\n\nAnd indeed, in his conclusion, Marik uses the \u201cR-word:\u201d\n\nThe reality is that although we are the richest nation on the Earth, we need to ration health care; this should however be done fairly, justly, and equitably.\n\nRationing, by definition, isn\u2019t that. It is invidious when it judges the value of some lives as having greater societal value than those of others.\n\nBut Wesley! We have to limit costs.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nIndeed. But coercion is not the answer. Education is. Treat people like adults. Patients and families need to be told about how onerous some of these interventions can be.\n\nMoreover, I point out that as we are discussing cutting access to wanted treatment for some patients, we are expanding the scope of what constitutes required care for others. As just one example, Medicare now pays for sex change surgery and other interventions for gender dysphoria.\n\nIf we are going to ration care, it should start with procedures that are elective and/or not essential to maintain life and physical health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctor Pushes Health Care Rationing, Wants to Prohibit Elderly Patients From ICUs", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The big problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t the exchanges for me.
