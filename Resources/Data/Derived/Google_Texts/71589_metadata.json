It will be helpful to hospitals in decreasing the need for emergency room visits and intensive-care hospitalization.\u201d\n\nOrganizers hope the clinic will treat about 2,500 patients within a year, and its services will eventually grow to include dental care. The clinic is a collaboration between Bethune-Cookman, Florida Hospital, Halifax Health, the Volusia County Health Department and other community health organizations.\n\n\u201cVolusia Volunteers in Medicine has received incredible support from our local community already \u2014 including major medical equipment to properly outfit the facility to the significant commitment to staff the facility when it opens,\u201d said Francene Barnes, president of Volusia Volunteers in Medicine.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s guidelines are drawn from a national organization called Volunteers in Medicine. Seven similar clinics are operating in Florida, including clinics in Jacksonville and Lakeland.\n\nDaytona Beach\u2019s clinic has been a community effort that has spanned more than five years, said Jim Dixon, who sits on the organization\u2019s board of directors.\n\nAccess to health care for working-class residents who fuel the area\u2019s tourist economy was identified as a top need during Daytona Beach\u2019s visioning process several years ago, he said.\n\n\u201cThis town employs a ton of minimum-wage employees \u2014 folks who don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable need.\u201d\n\nOther free clinics in the area serving the poor are at capacity, said Dr. Bill Gilmer, director of the Jesus Clinic in Daytona Beach.\n\nHe said he has to turn away patients because of insufficient space.\n\n\u201cI have to pick and choose who looks more needy,\u201d Gilmer said. \u201cWhat we will start doing is referring to Volunteers in Medicine the patients we cannot handle for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nOrganizers are working to finalize operating hours and hire an operations coordinator. Patients will be able to use three private exam rooms. The clinic is on Lockhart Street just off International Speedway Boulevard.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s founders say even with the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, a need still exists for free clinics.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated 31 million people will remain uninsured even when the law is fully implemented in 2024.\n\nMore information about Volusia Volunteers in Medicine is available by visiting volusiavim.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<span class=\"Dateline\">DAYTONA BEACH - A free clinic is opening this summer to serve the health care needs of Volusia County's working poor.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-B52473EF-1EA2-4E48-AC29-770FD8FD2448-pubDN"}, "og": {"site_name": "News-JournalOnline.com", "description": "<span class=\"Dateline\">DAYTONA BEACH - A free clinic is opening this summer to serve the health care needs of Volusia County's working poor.", "title": "Free clinic on verge of opening in Daytona Beach", "url": "http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20150608/news/150609540", "image": "http://G52-DNweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=DN&Date=20150608&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=150609540&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dbnewsjournal", "card": "summary"}, "publishdate": 20150608, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150609540-pubDN"}}, "keywords": "VOLUSIA COUNTY (FL),  People Helping People,  Feature,  Coastal Volusia,  Southeast Volusia,  West Volusia,  VOLUSIA COUNTY (FL),  People Helping People,  Feature,  Coastal Volusia,  Southeast Volusia,  West Volusia"}, "article_summary": "A free clinic is opening this summer to serve the health care needs of Volusia County\u2019s working poor.\nThe clinic is a collaboration between Bethune-Cookman, Florida Hospital, Halifax Health, the Volusia County Health Department and other community health organizations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable need.\u201dOther free clinics in the area serving the poor are at capacity, said Dr. Bill Gilmer, director of the Jesus Clinic in Daytona Beach.\nVolusia Volunteers in Medicine, a not-for-profit organization, is operating the clinic, which will be housed in Bethune-Cookman University\u2019s Odessa Chambliss Center for Health Equity.\nMore information about Volusia Volunteers in Medicine is available by visiting volusiavim.org."}
