He emphasized the achievements that he made during his time in office as well as those made by President Barack Obama, and then addressed how Hillary Clinton would tackle those same issues.\n\n\u201cWe need to finish healthcare reform,\u201d Bill Clinton said, referring to some of the issues not addressed by the Affordable Care Act. As president, Hillary Clinton would allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices, he said. In addition, he reiterated Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for a \u201cpublic option\u201d for health insurance.\n\nBefore Bill Clinton took the stage, Meghan Hughes, president of CCRI; David Sears, president of the Knight Campus Student Government and Gov. Gina Raimondo addressed the crowd.\n\nSears emphasized the importance of young people, especially college students, getting involved in the political process. Speaking specifically to the students in the audience, Sears said the \u201cbiggest misconception is that your voice and your vote doesn\u2019t count. Believe me, your voice and vote does count.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton also emphasized the importance of education, saying that it is \u201cmore of a lifetime asset than a house is.\u201d As president, Hillary Clinton will work toward decreasing student debt by expanding the AmeriCorps program, which allows students to work in public service in order to pay off their debts, Bill Clinton said. This is especially appealing for Rhode Island residents, as the state has the fourth-highest average student debt in the country, Raimondo said.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has spent her entire life breaking down barriers and building ladders of opportunity,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cAnd as president, she\u2019s going to make it her mission to tackle barriers that are holding Americans back from reaching their potential.\u201d Raimondo also talked about how Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is \u201cuniting\u201d the American people rather than dividing them.\n\nWhen speaking on Hillary Clinton\u2019s stance on crime, Bill Clinton stressed the importance of providing transitional support and job training for the incarcerated. There are \u201ctoo many people in prison,\u201d he said, \u201ca significant portion of which are young, non-violent offenders.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Bill Clinton told the crowd, \u201cYou have a choice to make,\u201d and summarized his three reasons why voters should pull the lever for Hillary Clinton. First, Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies would not break the bank and her \u201cnumbers add up,\u201d he said, referring to how single-payer healthcare would require lofty spending. Second, she is dedicated to a tough brand of diplomacy and understands that it is a \u201cdangerous world.\u201d Lastly, she is a \u201cchange-maker,\u201d which is why various labor unions and labor organizations have endorsed her, Bill Clinton said.\n\n\u201cIf you want something done, you better elect Hillary (as) president,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "In preparation for Rhode Island\u2019s primary April 26, former President Bill Clinton spoke at a rally at the Community College of Rhode Island Thursday.", "title": "Bill Clinton campaigns for Hillary Clinton at CCRI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Young.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-17T23:59:19+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/18/bill-clinton-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton-at-ccri/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "University News", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2016-04-18T00:00:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-17T23:59:19+00:00"}, "description": "In preparation for Rhode Island\u2019s primary April 26, former President Bill Clinton spoke at a rally at the Community College of Rhode Island Thursday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Shawn Young"}, "article_summary": "As president, Hillary Clinton would allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices, he said.\nBill Clinton spoke on his wife\u2019s platform on a variety of policy issues, including wealth inequality, education, healthcare and crime.\n\u201cWe need to finish healthcare reform,\u201d Bill Clinton said, referring to some of the issues not addressed by the Affordable Care Act.\nWhen speaking on Hillary Clinton\u2019s stance on crime, Bill Clinton stressed the importance of providing transitional support and job training for the incarcerated.\nBefore Bill Clinton took the stage, Meghan Hughes, president of CCRI; David Sears, president of the Knight Campus Student Government and Gov."}
