Templeton was a pediatric surgeon who retired from medicine to manage the foundation and later became its top staffer, the newspaper said. Although the foundation does not have a Core Funding Area in health per se, it awarded a grant in 2013 to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for work toward launching the Harvard Initiative on Health, Religion, and Spirituality. Michael Balboni, one of the institute\u2019s three leaders, commented in an e-mail to me that \u201cDr. Templeton was especially understanding of the field of spirituality and health because he was a leading academic surgeon.\u201d The Templeton Foundation \u201chelped our initiative get started, which is especially meaningful since Dr. Templeton graduated from Harvard Medical School.\u201d\n\nThe Templeton Foundation does, however, award grants in the field of genetics.
