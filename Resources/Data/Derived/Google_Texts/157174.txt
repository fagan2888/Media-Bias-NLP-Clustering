INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Aug. 17, 2014) — A woman was rushed to the hospital in serious condition early Sunday morning after a crash on the city’s north side. Police suspect the driver of the car who hit her may have been under the influence.

The woman driving the gray car was taken to Methodist in serious condition. The driver and passenger of the red car were not seriously injured. Police are investigating the crash.
