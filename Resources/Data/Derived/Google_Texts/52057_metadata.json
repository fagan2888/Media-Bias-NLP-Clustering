What do the critics have to say? Find out what the critics have to say on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\u201cSpectre\u201d\n\nIn 2006\u2032s \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d Daniel Craig helped redefine James Bond for the modern era, eschewing the increasingly silly elements of previous Bond films for a more visceral, vulnerable interpretation of the character. \u201cSpectre,\u201d Craig\u2019s fourth outing as the British superspy (and 24th film in the franchise overall), hews closer to the 007 formula of old, and critics say it\u2019s mostly effective, even if it suffers from comparison to its predecessor. This time out, Bond squares off with a shadowy criminal organization with ties to his past, all while he and M (Ralph Fiennes) push back against the imminent cancellation of the double-0 program. \u201cSpectre\u201d is currently at 61 percent on Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 Tomatometer; check out some of the reviews here:\n\nFresh: \u201cA slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain.\u201d \u2014 Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times\n\nFresh: \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth.\u201d \u2014 Steven Rea, Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nRotten: \u201c\u2018Spectre\u2019 is full of not-good things, and some oppressively bad things that may come to feel like drill bits twirling in your skull.\u201d \u2014 Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal\n\nRotten: \u201cIn the end, \u2018Spectre\u2019 is just too much of a good thing. Though each scene is carefully wrought, there\u2019s little grace, majesty, or romance in the way the pieces are connected.\u201d \u2014 Stephanie Zacharek, Village Voice\n\n\u201cThe Peanuts Movie\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 65 years since Charles Schulz published the first Peanuts strip, and 35 years since the gang\u2019s last big screen appearance with 1980\u2032s \u201cBon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don\u2019t Come Back!!).\u201d That latter fact is being rectified with the release of \u201cThe Peanuts Movie,\u201d and critics say this warm, deeply-felt feature will appeal to longtime fans and a new audience that wasn\u2019t even alive the last time a new Peanuts strip was published. In this movie, lovable loser Charlie Brown goes into panic mode when the Little Red-Haired Girl, his perennial crush, moves across the street, setting off an adventure that crosses path with all the classic characters. \u201cThe Peanuts Movie\u201d is currently at 86 percent on the Tomatometer; here are a few of the reviews:\n\nFresh: \u201cAn entertaining combination of humor and tenderness, \u2018The Peanuts Movie\u2019 isn\u2019t just an all-ages crowd-pleaser. It\u2019s the perfect first feature film for a preschooler.\u201d \u2014 Sandie Angulo Chen, Washington Post\n\nFresh: \u201cTheirs is a world where kids can\u2019t wait to go outside and play on a snow day, and there aren\u2019t any parents policing the park for hurt feelings and peanut butter. And it\u2019s a lo-fi delight.\u201d \u2014 Katharine Pushkar, New York Daily News\n\nFresh: \u201cIt\u2019s a gentle, simple movie with Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the gang that the late Charles Schulz would be proud to call his own.\u201d \u2014 Laura DeMarco, Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\nRotten: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and actually kind of cynical in its unwillingness to try anything even vaguely innovative with these beloved characters.\u201d \u2014 Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com\n\nFor more movie reviews, trailers, and pictures, check out Rottentomatoes.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Check out review revue of the weekend's big films.", "title": "See What Critics Are Saying About \u2018Spectre\u2019 and \u2018The Peanuts Movie\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/06/see-what-critics-are-saying-about-spectre-and-the-peanuts-movie/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LD349_1106sp_P_20151106100359.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "See What Critics Are Saying About \u2018Spectre\u2019 and \u2018The Peanuts Movie\u2019", "description": "Check out review revue of the weekend's big films.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Check out review revue of the weekend's big films.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-11-06T20:00:21-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/06/see-what-critics-are-saying-about-spectre-and-the-peanuts-movie/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-92017", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Check out review revue of the weekend's big films.", "title": "See What Critics Are Saying About \u2018Spectre\u2019 and \u2018The Peanuts Movie\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/06/see-what-critics-are-saying-about-spectre-and-the-peanuts-movie/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LD349_1106sp_P_20151106100359.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-92017", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-06T20:21:00-05:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Peanuts Movie\u201d is currently at 86 percent on the Tomatometer; here are a few of the reviews:Fresh: \u201cAn entertaining combination of humor and tenderness, \u2018The Peanuts Movie\u2019 isn\u2019t just an all-ages crowd-pleaser.\nColumbia Pictures/Courtesy EverettThis week at the multiplex, we\u2019ve got 007 (\u201cSpectre,\u201d starring Daniel Craig and L\u00e9a Seydoux) and Snoopy (the animated feature \u201cThe Peanuts Movie\u201d).\n).\u201d That latter fact is being rectified with the release of \u201cThe Peanuts Movie,\u201d and critics say this warm, deeply-felt feature will appeal to longtime fans and a new audience that wasn\u2019t even alive the last time a new Peanuts strip was published.\n\u201cSpectre,\u201d Craig\u2019s fourth outing as the British superspy (and 24th film in the franchise overall), hews closer to the 007 formula of old, and critics say it\u2019s mostly effective, even if it suffers from comparison to its predecessor.\nFind out what the critics have to say on Rotten Tomatoes."}
