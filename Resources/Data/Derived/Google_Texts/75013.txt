Sarah Palin is reigniting her call to “clean house” at the Department of Veterans Affairs, this time with a video on Facebook lending support to a push from the Koch brothers to privatize the agency and go to a voucher system.

Palin criticized new VA Secretary Robert McDonald, calling his character into question after he was recently forced to apologize for misstating his military service.

“It’s time to reform the VA so thoroughly that vets don’t have to depend on it for their basic needs,” Palin said.

She made a similar call at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.

“What we would be doing is giving them the same freedom that they gave us,” Palin said in the video. “We do owe the vets so much, the very least that we can give them is care, and really, respect, and what we’re giving them is a failed, bloated federal agency, and our vets – they don’t complain about it, they’re not wired to whine about it.”
