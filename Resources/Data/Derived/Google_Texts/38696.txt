On day four of their 64-mile trek from Eglin Air Force Base, Bart Steele and Crystal Merkes approach Panama City late Sunday afternoon.

But as a veteran who served four years in Army Aviation in Seoul Korea, Steele is used to a challenge.

He's walking in support of the Honor Flight Network, an organization that sends WWII vets to Washington, D.C. to visit the WWII Memorial.

"As a young army veteran, I think we can learn a lot from these guys, so while they are here we have to do all that we can to make sure that they know that we appreciate what they did and that we salute them and thank them," Army Aviation Veteran Bart Steele said.

"I thought this would be a great opportunity since this month marks the 70th anniversary of Operation Market Garden, which is the largest airborne operation in the second World War," Steele added.

Steele said he thinks this is a fitting tribute to march 64 miles, which is about the distance covered by the ground relief forces during the operation.

Along with his backpack, his leather boots share a purpose more than just carrying him to the end of his journey. "I had the honor of jumping from a C-47 a few months ago, and we did it WWII style, so I said I'm going to wear these boots since we're commemorating an Airborne Operation," Steele said.

As for Steele's girlfriend Crystal Merkes, she's joining in not only to support Steele, but to pay it back to the vets.

"A lot of weight and a lot of distance, and then on top of that they had to fight so I can't imagine the thoughts that were going through their minds, but just to think of them as we're traveling," Navy School EOD Capt. Crystal Merkes said.

Despite the mileage, they didn't give up, making it all the way to Panama City at Bay Memorial Sunday afternoon.
