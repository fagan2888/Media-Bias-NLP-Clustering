Sidney Crosby is in Southwest Florida.

The NHL's reigning Most Valuable Player and scoring champion has worked out in Southwest Florida all week at Germain Arena.

NBC2 was on hand as the Pittsburgh Penguins All-Star center was on the ice for a personal workout.

Crosby is in town with seven high caliber players, including John Tavares of the New York Islanders and NHL Rookie-of-The-Year Nathan Mackinnon of the Colorado Avalanche.

The group of NHL standout players has been working out with Canadian trainer Darryl Belfry since Monday.

The workouts concluded on Friday.

Last season, Crosby won his second Hart Memorial Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the National Hockey League.

He helped lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a Stanley Cup championship during the 2008-09 hockey season.

NBC2's Rishi Barran spoke with Crosby after his final workout.
