Ironically, it\u2019s the group with the least overt power \u2014 House Democrats \u2014 who are the big hold-up, with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi still holding out to index the Child Tax Credit to inflation. The backup, if the big deal falls short, is a two-year extension of the expired tax breaks, putting us right back in this position in holiday season 2017.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said Wednesday that Republicans believed there was still good reason to keep negotiating with Democrats, but showed no give on indexing. \u201cMy view is the index is extraneous,\u201d Brady told reporters. \u201cGlad to have that debate in the future.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans also acknowledge that there\u2019s a good chance that any permanent deal trading business incentives for the GOP for the Earned Income Tax Credit and child credit plus-ups for Democrats collapses if Pelosi doesn\u2019t get on board. Rep. Pat Tiberi, a senior GOP member of Ways and Means, said \u201ca couple dozen\u201d House Democrats could back a permanent extenders deal even without leadership support. But he added: \u201cI think you have to have leadership\u2019s buy-in. And quite frankly, it complicates things with the White House, too, if you don\u2019t have Pelosi on board.\u201d\n\nAs for the Senate: Take it from Democrat Ben Cardin, who told The Hill \"if it was up to the Senate, we would be ready to sign the deal now.\"\n\nWHO\u2019S DRIVING THE CADILLAC? Let\u2019s be clear \u2014 it'd be hard to find Republicans who like the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on costly insurance plans. But that doesn\u2019t mean they all want to delay the tax in an extenders deal. Some, like Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, basically want to inflict more pain on Democrats and their labor allies before they agree to delay the tax. \u201cThat's a major Democrat ask, so there needs to be something proportionate in terms of achievement on our side,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nBut Brady noted the GOP was \u201cconvinced all 23 taxes in Obamacare are pretty bad taxes,\u201d adding that \u201cevery effort we get to kick some of these taxes out of the way, even for a short time, we think is pretty helpful.\u201d More from our Brian Faler here: http://politico.pro/1RFul2h\n\nALRIGHT, IT\u2019S THURSDAY, and another threat of weekend votes on Capitol Hill has miraculously evaporated.

Story here: http://politico.pro/1Qx8wRv\n\nDemocrats are expected to grudgingly accept the end of the oil export ban. The Pro Energy team\u2019s Elana Schor notes that Democratic Sen. Tom Carper is floating the idea of a refinery tax credit as part of that trade for his party. http://politico.pro/1NHihMr\n\nAnd Cogan Schneier notes for the Pro Agriculture team that farming interests are a bit nervous about extenders as well, especially provisions dealing with expensing. http://politico.pro/1IVOpGv\n\nHILLARY ON INVERSIONS: The Democratic front-runner says that she absolutely believes the Treasury Department has the authority to attack earnings stripping as it seeks to combat corporate inversions, a step the Obama administration has yet to feel comfortable taking. (Recall that Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was both a deputy to Hillary Clinton at the State Department and a member of Bill Clinton\u2019s administration as well.)\n\nMore from our Katy O\u2019Donnell on Clinton\u2019s plan, which also includes an \u201cexit tax\u201d on companies that plan to invert: \u201cShe would funnel an anticipated $60 billion in new revenue from the earnings stripping measure into incentives for manufacturing, research and small businesses, according to a Clinton aide.\u201d Full story: http://politico.pro/1RanjU2\n\nExecutive action as the last resort: The WSJ notes that Clinton has also vowed to act on her own on both immigration and guns. But her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said that \u201cher first preference will always be to seek to work with Congress. But where progress has stalled and there is clear legal authority for the president to act, she will not hesitate to do so.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1luWkpv\n\n** A message from Grant Thornton LLP: The tax code puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage. Congress can\u2019t address the problem if it excludes pass-throughs from an innovation box or tax reform. Congress should lower the effective business tax rates equitably for all U.S. businesses. http://gt-us.co/1LhfUyM **\n\nTHAT\u2019S A WIN: Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, got on the bad side of some people for his handling of the 2014 year-end tax negotiations. But Wyden, the original co-author of a measure that bars states from implementing new taxes on Internet access, helped get the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act tucked into a bicameral customs compromise (H.R. 644). \u201cIn my view, when you have something that works, that has stood the test of time, you ought to make it permanent,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nWin-win actually: That\u2019s because Wyden, from the sales tax-free state of Oregon, has bitterly opposed efforts from retail advocates and a bipartisan group of lawmakers to pair the Internet access measure with a more controversial measure to give states more latitude to collect sales taxes from online retailers without a brick-and-mortar location in that state.\n\nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association, a key advocate for the online sales tax measure, somewhat sarcastically called the permanent authorization of ITFA \u201ca remarkable departure from the regular order commitments House and Senate leaders have made and that many members have so exalted.\u201d The group added that allowing ITFA to move without a sales tax bill \u201crobs Main Street retailers, the backbone of local economies, of the logical companion to bipartisan legislation to level the sales tax playing field.\u201d\n\nJust an FYI: Not everyone\u2019s happy about that customs bill. Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, is urging Democrats to vote against the measure, in part because a currency manipulation provision was dropped. More on how the provision was left out, from our friends at Pro Trade: http://politico.pro/1TCsKbZ And Levin\u2019s opposition, from The Hill: http://bit.ly/1M42PEk\n\nSEEKING A PUERTO RICO FIX: Three senior Senate Republicans \u2014 Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch and Lisa Murkowski \u2014 rolled out a bill to establish a new authority overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s finances, just about three weeks before the island faces another key debt payment. The GOP proposal didn\u2019t give Puerto Rican authorities the Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection they requested, but does include a cut in the payroll tax meant to give the economy a spark. More from Colin Wilhelm on the Financial Services team here: http://politico.pro/1mbCmA5. A House bill also released Wednesday would give Puerto Rico bankruptcy protection.\n\nSide note: Republicans are generally big fans of tax cuts, but not necessarily payroll tax cuts. Ryan once called the payroll tax cut here in 2011 and 2012 \u201csugar high economics.\u201d\n\nHitching a ride? Over at The Hill, Peter Schroeder \u2014 previously forced to co-byline entirely too many stories with your Morning Tax author \u2014 reports that Puerto Rican officials hope a rescue plan will be included in the omnibus. But that may be a long shot. Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez vowed to vote against any spending deal that didn\u2019t have assistance for Puerto Rico and asked others to join him. Hard to imagine a groundswell, though. http://bit.ly/1NcKqJG\n\nTAX FOUNDATION VS. TAX POLICY CENTER: The more free-market Tax Foundation examines why its projection for Jeb Bush\u2019s tax plan found it to be so much less expensive than the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center \u2014 $3.66 trillion vs. $6.8 trillion \u2014 and finds three reasons. First, the Tax Foundation didn\u2019t model some provisions because of uncertainty about the details. Second, the Tax Foundation assumes Bush\u2019s plan would go into effect in 2015, and the Tax Policy Center goes with 2017. And finally, the Tax Foundation says that the Tax Policy Center assumes more transitional costs in the early years of Jeb\u2019s plan.

But then the IRS got in the way, and now Yahoo\u2019s going to spin off what the AP called basically \u201ceverything associated with the Yahoo brand name\u201d to \u201cbecome little more than a holding company\u201d for Alibaba. The tax implications: The original decision to spin off Alibaba \u201cwas designed to sidestep more than $10 billion in taxes Yahoo might otherwise owe. But the IRS jeopardized that plan by refusing to guarantee a tax exemption.\u201d AP story: http://apne.ws/1RFBWht.\n\nCNBC also explains why reversing course might result in a better tax bill for Yahoo: http://cnb.cx/1TBNDE8.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS \u2014\n\nBATTLE OVER OFFSHORE TAX BREAKS, CONTINUED: The FACT Coalition said Wednesday that almost 90,000 letters went to Congress asking lawmakers not to extend two tax extenders popular with multinational corporations \u2014 the CFC look-through and the Active Financing Exception. http://bit.ly/1ORQ0Uh\n\nNo thank you to patent box: The libertarian Mercatus Center says in a new study that an innovation box on profits from intellectual property \u201cis a poor substitute for much needed holistic corporate income tax reform.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Z0dxVL\n\nSTATE UPDATE \u2014\n\nREPUBLICANS PRESS OREGON DOJ TO INVESTIGATE ENERGY TAX CREDITS: Republican lawmakers are asking Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to look into the controversial sale of state energy tax credits, The Oregonian reports. \u201cIn a letter sent Monday, the legislators summarized a variety of allegations that surfaced in conversations with whistleblowers at the Energy and Revenue departments. Based on those discussions, the lawmakers expressed concern that the state may have lost substantial tax revenues and that state employees may have used their positions for personal gain.\u201d\n\nNearly $1 billion in tax credits to businesses, nonprofits and public organizations has been circulated by the Energy Department since 2007 to fund \u201cefficiency, conservation and renewable energy projects.\u201d Most of those credits, though, end up being sold again to investors at a lower cost, \u201ceither because the original recipient has no tax state liability or prefers cash.\u201d http://bit.ly/1mb9U17\n\nALASKA GOVERNOR CALLS FOR \u2014 GULP \u2014 AN INCOME TAX: Gov. Bill Walker, faced with plummeting oil revenues, is proposing Alaska\u2019s first personal income tax in 35 years, as well as an increase in alcohol and cigarette taxes, The Associated Press reports. Alaska is expecting revenue from oil and gas production taxes to bring in $172 million in fiscal year 2016, a massive decline from two years ago, when production taxes totaled $2.6 billion. http://abcn.ws/1mbAxTE\n\nProduction taxes for fiscal year 2015 added up to about $390 million, the state Revenue department said in a report. The AP: \u201cAlaska relies heavily on oil revenues to fund state government and is currently grappling with an estimated $3.5 billion budget deficit amid chronically low prices. In recent years, petroleum revenue provided about 90 percent of the money available for spending. Last year, that dropped to 75 percent, and it's not projected to provide more than 72 percent during the rest of the decade, the report said.\u201d http://abcn.ws/1Qe4Q8E.\n\nQUICK LINK\n\n\u2014 How a garden variety tax dispute (at least for a galaxy far, far away) kick-started the Star Wars sagas. http://bit.ly/1TgmE0K\n\nDID YOU KNOW?

More than 50 popular tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, including the R&D credit. Congress\u2019s indecision on these provisions is impeding business planning and stifling growth. According to a Grant Thornton survey of top financial executives, more than half of companies that use the provisions do all their planning under the assumption that the extension will not occur. That\u2019s a huge blow to the effectiveness of the provisions and a barrier to growth. The R&D credit is a major driver of entrepreneurial activity and high-paying jobs. Congress needs to act soon to reinstate these provisions and to make the R&D credit permanent.
