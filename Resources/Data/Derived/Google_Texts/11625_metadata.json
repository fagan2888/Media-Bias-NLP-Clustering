The Tigers (11-0, 8-0) were picked to do just that at conference media days in July.\n\nNEXT GAME What: No. 1 Clemson (11-0) at South Carolina (3-8) When: Saturday, noon Where: Williams-Brice Stadium, Columbia TV: ESPN Line: Clemson by 17\n\nBut the No. 1 ranking? Cemented in the College Football Playoff conversation? That all probably arrived a year ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people thought we would be where we are,\u201d head coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a single offensive lineman starting for us that started last year. Five new starters, including a true freshman at left tackle. We haven\u2019t had Mike Williams all year, the best receiver in this league.\n\n\u201cThen on the defensive side, 10 of those guys from last year\u2019s (top-ranked) defense went on to the NFL, and you lose (nickelback) Korrin Wiggins on top of it. So, not a lot of expectations from outside people with this team, but this team has been hungry from Day 1.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Deshaun Watson has lived up to his preseason hype as a true sophomore, putting himself in the Heisman Trophy conversation. Clemson\u2019s leading rusher (Wayne Gallman) and receiver (Artavis Scott) are also sophomores, while freshmen like left tackle Mitch Hyatt and receivers Hunter Renfrow and Deon Cain have also stood out.\n\nMeanwhile, longtime backups are now excelling on defense, like linebacker B.J. Goodson, defensive end Kevin Dodd and cornerback Cordrea Tankersley. Throw in an entirely new set of special teamers led by freshman walk-on kicker Greg Huegel and junior punter Andy Teasdall, and it wasn\u2019t exactly a recipe for championship contention.\n\nClemson has played 28 freshmen this year and starts just five seniors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this enthusiasm and hunger to go with experience,\u201d Swinney said, \u201cand we\u2019ve had the right type of leadership to help pull it all together week to week.\u201d\n\nAll sold out\n\nSpeaking of the ACC Championship, organizers for the Dec. 5 game at Charlotte\u2019s Bank of America Stadium probably could not have crafted a more desirable matchup with ticket sales in mind.\n\nThe ACC announced this week the championship game is sold out for the first time since Clemson faced Virginia Tech in 2011. Florida State-Virginia Tech in 2010 also sold out.\n\nClemson and UNC are two of the larger fan bases located near Charlotte.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to having a full house in Charlotte for this year\u2019s ACC Football Championship game, and we appreciate our partnership with the entire city,\u201d ACC Commissioner John Swofford said in a statement. \u201cOur event continues to gain excellent momentum in Bank of America Stadium and it\u2019s a win-win that Charlotte and the ACC Football Championship are becoming synonymous.\u201d\n\nCharleston tribute\n\nThe Clemson and South Carolina bands will play a halftime tribute Saturday at Williams-Brice Stadium to honor the fatal shootings at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church last June.\n\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re doing this is to commemorate the tragedy in Charleston that occurred this year, and to pay tribute to the victims, and to offer hope for our state,\u201d Clemson Tiger Band director Mark Spede said in a YouTube statement. \u201cWhat better way to demonstrate unity in our state than by having these two great bands join forces?\u201d\n\nSpede pointed out many band members at both schools went to high school together and attend the same band competitions.\n\n\u201cWe just happen to root for different football teams,\u201d Spede said. \u201cBut we do share the common bond of music and the healing it can provide.\u201d\n\nBoth teams\u2019 helmets have been affixed with a special \u201cEmanuel 9\u201d sticker all season.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "On the Beat: Clemson\u2019s championship contention a year ahead of schedule, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, ACC Championship,Clemson football,Dabo Swinney,Emanuel AME Church", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "CLEMSON \u2014 It\u2019s hardly a shock Clemson has qualified for, and will be favored in, the ACC Championship Game next week.
