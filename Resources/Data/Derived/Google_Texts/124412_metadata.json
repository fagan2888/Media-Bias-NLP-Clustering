Reuters\n\nCostumed characters working in Times Square have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after a number of incidents led some to campaign for regulation of their work.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said people working in costumes should be licensed, wrote WSJ\u2019s Mara Gay.\n\nMr. de Blasio said he was open to legislation being considered in the City Council that would require people dressed up as cartoon characters like Elmo and Spider-Man to display identification as they work in Times Square, hamming it up with the children of tourists before asking for tips, often aggressively. \u201cI think this has gone too far,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at City Hall. \u201cIt needs to be regulated.\u201d The mayor\u2019s comments came after a man dressed as Spider-Man was arrested on charges of assaulting a police officer in an incident that was videotaped. Police have stepped up efforts to enforce quality-of-life laws in Times Square after complaints about the characters\u2019 behavior.\n\nThe controversy has also caught the attention of the Times Square Alliance and corporations that own the characters, such as Viacom and Sesame Workshop.\n\nOn Wednesday, Reuters photographer Eduardo Munoz spent time with Jorge, an immigrant from Mexico who collects tips from tourists eager to take pictures with the beloved Sesame Street character, Elmo.\n\nReuters\n\nJorge gets dressed as the Sesame Street character Elmo inside a subway station in Times Square.\n\nReuters\n\nJorge, dressed as Elmo, leaves the subway to start his workday.\n\nReuters\n\nJorge walks through Times Square. The City Council might consider a bill drafted by City Councilman Andy King that would introduce a licensing system and background checks for people in costume.\n\nReuters\n\nJorge poses with children on Wednesday. At the beginning of July, a trade group representing Broadway theater owners and operators blamed a drop in some ticket sales on dressed-up panhandlers.\n\nReuters\n\nThe characters tread a fuzzy ground, WSJ\u2019s Andrew Grossman wrote in April last year. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging legally because dressing up in a costume and walking around Times Square is, we believe, a First Amendment-protected activity,\u201d said then-Council Speaker Christine Quinn.\n\nReuters\n\nA group of Elmos and other characters look to make tips for photographs in Times Square on Wednesday.\n\nReuters\n\nJorge, still dressed as Elmo, buys food from a street food cart in Times Square.\n\nReuters\n\nJorge heads into a subway station after making some tips.
