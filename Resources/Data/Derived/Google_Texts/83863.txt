Sioux Falls, SD

For the 10th year, Elegant Xpressions Boutique is providing discounted prom dresses, while also raising money for the Children's Miracle Network.

Hundreds of people piled into the Sioux Falls store today for the Prom Extravaganza to find that perfect dress. Some of the proceeds from the event go towards the non-profit. Owner Shauna Niedon has two children that use CMN, and she's happy to have helped raise money for the organization for the last decade.

“You're not just getting a dress. You're helping a child out and that's really a feeling that you can't really explain. You're paying it forward and making a difference in a kid's life,” Niedon said.

And if you still want to take part. You're in luck. The event is also going on tomorrow from noon until 4.
