Not for the couples, of course, who are likely to get slapped with both a marriage tax and an AMT tax if their incomes meet a certain threshold, although they will benefit from certain financial protections afforded married people.\n\nSo, to all the gay couples in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin who are planning to tie the knot \u2013 welcome to the high-tax world of marriage. Your love can help close the budget gap in your state and close the country\u2019s deficit. It may even pay for one those $1.2 million Tomahawk missiles that we\u2019re lobbing at ISIS. Maybe this is what the defense and marriage act is all about.\n\nIn 2004, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report claiming, \u201cIn some cases, recognizing same-sex marriages would increase [Federal] outlays and revenues; in other cases, it would have the opposite effect\u2026. On net, those impacts would improve the [Federal] budget\u2019s bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nMoney flowing into state and federal bank accounts isn\u2019t the only benefit of same-sex marriage. All the benefits of a stable, committed relationship make sense for communities that value home ownership, stability, and participation in community affairs without the stigma of having a second-class relationship.\n\nThe other fiscal upside is a reduction in the outlays states make to unmarried singles \u2014 gay or straight \u2014 because of minimal incomes and other needs. If children are involved, the benefits are even more obvious.\n\nMore than 40 percent of all people born in the U.S. today are born to single parents. If you want to know what this means to social mobility, income inequality, jobs, entitlement funding, and the like, just look at this data, which cuts across all ethnic groups. The data are unequivocal that children are far more likely to succeed in two-parent households. So the Court\u2019s decision today should help build a stronger economy tomorrow.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the benefits of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision that paved the way for same-sex", "title": "Why the Supreme Court\u2019s Same-Sex Marriage Decision Is a Boon to the Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/06/Why-Supreme-Court-s-Same-Sex-Marriage-Decision-Boon-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03292013_gay_marriage_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/06/Why-Supreme-Court-s-Same-Sex-Marriage-Decision-Boon-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03292013_gay_marriage_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jackieleo"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One of the benefits of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision that paved the way for same-sex", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One of the benefits of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision that paved the way for same-sex marriage in five states is clearly fiscal.\nNot for the couples, of course, who are likely to get slapped with both a marriage tax and an AMT tax if their incomes meet a certain threshold, although they will benefit from certain financial protections afforded married people.\nSo the Court\u2019s decision today should help build a stronger economy tomorrow.\nThe other fiscal upside is a reduction in the outlays states make to unmarried singles \u2014 gay or straight \u2014 because of minimal incomes and other needs.\nIn 2004, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report claiming, \u201cIn some cases, recognizing same-sex marriages would increase [Federal] outlays and revenues; in other cases, it would have the opposite effect\u2026."}
