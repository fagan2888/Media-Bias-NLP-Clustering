If At First You Don\u2019t Succeed, Bash Obamacare: After bailing on a bill that would have banned abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy \u2014 an embarrassing face-plant with thousands of pro-life activists in town for the annual Roe v. Wade festivities \u2014 the Republican-led House instead used abortion to slap around Obamacare, the law they love to hate. The bill bans the use of taxpayer funds (in this case, Affordable Care Act tax subsidies), after a federal report found 18 states' health care exchanges included abortion coverage.\n\n2. Cop Out: A coalition of Republican women forced House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s team to pull the bill from the House floor, a development that, if you squinted, looked like GOP women standing up for women\u2019s rights. On closer inspection, however, their objection wasn\u2019t with the idea behind the bill itself \u2014 they agree fetuses feel pain after 20 weeks of gestation and want the ban. Turns out that the rebels, led by Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana thought a so-called \u201crape exemption\u201d provision was too narrow: it would allow women to undergo pregnancy termination if they get a police report first. And, since most rape victims typically don\u2019t report the attacks, the exemption was too narrow and could hurt the GOP\u2019s brand image among the youngs. As if it was all that positive with them in the first place.\n\n3. Wait, What?: This one\u2019s a two-fer: apparently Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, is seriously considering running for president (insert Frank Underwood joke here), and, if so, he\u2019ll have some \u2018splainin\u2019 to do with women voters if the political gods grant us a Graham for America campaign. In light of Boehner\u2019s 180 on the 20-week abortion ban, Graham called on members of the Right to Life coalition for help crafting an anti-abortion bill he could get through the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m going to do more than bring my bill up \u2014 I\u2019m going to need your help to find a way out of this definitional problem with rape,\u201d he said in a speech to the pro-life Family Research Council. \u201cThe rape exception will be part of the bill \u2014 that\u2019s the Hyde position \u2014 we just need to find a way to get ourselves into a spot where we\u2019re debating what a \u2018legitimate rape\u2018 is.\u201d Todd Akin, call your office. Or better yet, call Graham\u2019s.\n\n4. No Means No: Memo to Republicans: President Barack Obama issued a statement hailing the Roe vs. Wade anniversary, in language the GOP seems to love \u2014 but with what sounds like a veto-threat chaser. The president said the landmark ruling \u201creaffirms a fundamental American value: that government should not intrude in our most private and personal family matters.\u201d But while Obama said he\u2019s \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to ending unwanted pregnancies through education, adoption and better healthcare, \u201cI am deeply committed to protecting this core constitutional right, and I believe that efforts like H.R. 7, the bill the House considered today, would intrude on women's reproductive freedom and access to health care and unnecessarily restrict the private insurance choices that consumers have today.\u201d\n\n5. Old School: How far we\u2019ve come: In 1973, the year of the landmark abortion decision, U.S. News reported the nation had recorded a \u201cskyrocketing\u201d number of abortions in places where the \u201cliberalized\u201d law had allowed the procedure. Unfortunate semantics aside, the rate of terminated pregnancies has actually dropped by about 13 percent since Roe vs. Wade became the law of the land.\n\nDrawn Conclusion:\n\nJack Ohman/Tribune Content Agency", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Lindsey Graham to the Rescue", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Five things to know, Roe v.
