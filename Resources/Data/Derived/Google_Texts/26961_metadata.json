We want to be with you, we want to be strong. And if you keep doing this, we\u2019re not going to be able to be one of your cheerleaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that, sadly, is what happened.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Affordable Care Act mandates that all insurance plans include maternity coverage for the so-called \u201cunborn,\u201d which was usually only offered as an rider prior to 2014.\n\nAnd the law maintains the status quo on abortion coverage. Private insurance companies have the option of offering coverage, which some states have banned. Government funds can only pay for an abortion in the case of rape, incest or if the life of the mother is at stake.\n\nWatch this video NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, broadcast Dec. 1, 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nbc_mtp_dolan_obamacare_131201c-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Cardinal Dolan: Catholic Church opposes Obamacare because \u2018it\u2019s excluding the unborn\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo that\u2019s where we begin to draw back and say, Mr. President, please, you\u2019re really kind of pushing aside some of your greatest supporters here.\nGovernment funds can only pay for an abortion in the case of rape, incest or if the life of the mother is at stake.\nPrivate insurance companies have the option of offering coverage, which some states have banned.\nWatch this video NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, broadcast Dec. 1, 2013.\nAnd the law maintains the status quo on abortion coverage."}
