Drone operators are also prohibited under the FAA proposal from conducting flights that take the devices out of their line of vision, which is a big blow to companies like Amazon, which has touted the possibility of using the technology to conduct deliveries.\n\nThe rules make drone operators responsible for avoiding collisions with manned aircraft that are in the same airspace as the devices, and prohibit drone flights that \u201cfly over people, except those directly involved with the flight.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
