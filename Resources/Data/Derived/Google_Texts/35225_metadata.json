One is central-line associated bloodstream infections, or CLABSIs. The second is catheter associated urinary tract infections, or CAUTIs. The final one, Serious Complications, is based on eight types of injuries, including blood clots, bed sores and falls.\"\n\n\n\nHospitals that received a score of seven or higher are assessed the penalty.\n\nUniversity Medical Center received the worst score possible with 10s in every category.\n\n\n\nUMC's quality manager Javier Gonzales said patients shouldn't worry about the scores. He said only 18 patients out of 33,598 experienced serious complications.\n\n\n\n\"It's less than 1 percent,\" said Gonzales. \"We are committed to providing great patient care.\"\n\n\n\nJoe Garcia is the hospital's chief nursing officer and said UMC is a teaching hospital that treats low-income patients and that contributes to some of the hospitals acquired conditions.\n\n\n\n\"Because they're uninsured or under insured you have to keep in mind they wait because they can't afford healthcare. So they wait and they wait until they're sicker.\"\n\n\n\nGonzales added that UMC has already taken steps to make sure they're not penalized in the future.\n\n\n\n\"We started a dashboard with all the complications and all the conditions we have here and we're picking up data and we'll be monitoring our performance and processing it through our patient safety councilors.\"\n\nOther hospitals in the borderland that are being penalized include El Paso Specialty Hospital and Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces.\n\n\n\nEl Paso Specialty Hospital received a nine for serious complications and an overall score of nine.\n\n\n\nMMC received a score of nine for serious complications, a three for central-line infections and a nine for catheter-related infections, resulting in an overall score of 7.05.\n\n\n\nA representative from MMC told KFOX14, \"we are very dedicated to the effective prevention of hospital acquired conditions. As part of a Hospital Engagement Network (HEN) established by CMS's Partnership for Patients since 2012, our hospital has undertaken initiatives to reduce infections and improve patient safety. We are pleased that our most recent data shows improvement in many areas of hospital acquired conditions. Quality improvement is a continuous process and we remain vigilant.\"\n\n\n\nEl Paso Specialty Hospital could not be reached for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EL PASO, TX -- Three borderland hospitals, including University Medical Center, will face a 1 percent Medicare payment penalty in 2015 for having high rates of avoidable mistakes.Officials with University Medical Center say that will cost them about $350,", "title": "University Medical Center among 721 penalized for high infection, injury rates", "og": {"site_name": "KFOX", "description": "EL PASO, TX -- Three borderland hospitals, including University Medical Center, will face a 1 percent Medicare payment penalty in 2015 for having high rates of avoidable mistakes.Officials with University Medical Center say that will cost them about $350,", "title": "University Medical Center among 721 penalized for high infection, injury rates", "url": "http://kfoxtv.com/archive/university-medical-center-among-721-penalized-for-high-infection-injury-rates-01-21-2016", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/e14fb889-183d-4d4a-a5df-0050fee3d1ab-KLZJ9fbF.jpg?1453400266887", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/e14fb889-183d-4d4a-a5df-0050fee3d1ab-KLZJ9fbF.jpg?1453400266887", "description": "EL PASO, TX -- Three borderland hospitals, including University Medical Center, will face a 1 percent Medicare payment penalty in 2015 for having high rates of avoidable mistakes.Officials with University Medical Center say that will cost them about $350,", "site": "@kfox14", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "University Medical Center among 721 penalized for high infection, injury rates"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "news,archive,local,TX", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/kfoxtv", "published_time": "2014-12-24T22:28:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfa1\"", "article_summary": "In addition to UMC, the El Paso Specialty Hospital and Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces will be penalized.\nOther hospitals in the borderland that are being penalized include El Paso Specialty Hospital and Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces.\nOfficials with University Medical Center say that will cost them about $350,000.\nUniversity Medical Center received the worst score possible with 10s in every category.\nEL PASO, TX -- Three borderland hospitals, including University Medical Center, will face a 1 percent Medicare payment penalty in 2015 for having high rates of avoidable mistakes."}
