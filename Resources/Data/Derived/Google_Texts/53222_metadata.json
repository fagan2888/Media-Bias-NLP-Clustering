Loretta Sanchez, Duf Sundheim, Tom Del Beccaro and Ron Unz will answer questions on the economy, immigration, health care, crime and policing.\n\nWe'll also be incorporating one question from you, our listeners. We asked you to submit questions last week. And now, it's time to vote. We've tallied up the submissions. Here's your chance to vote on which question we should pose the night of the debate.\n\nWhich of these questions should we ask California's U.S. Senate candidates?\n\nVote here\n\nThe poll will close May 2.\n\nHarris is the California Democratic Party's pick to fill the seat that will be vacated when Boxer retires. Boxer has held the seat for 24 years. Harris favors national climate change legislation, backs immigration reform and supports President Barack Obama's plan for free tuition at community colleges.
