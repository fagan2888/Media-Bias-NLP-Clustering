Guns in political ads aren’t confined to the Right anymore: A new ad by a Democratic candidate from Washington State shows him shooting an elephant piñata.

“They call me a long shot — they say I can’t win in this district,” Estakio Beltran says in the ad. “But what happens to an elephant that stands around doing nothing for too long?”

Beltran goes on to shoot the elephant with a shotgun, before riding off on a donkey.

Showing off some marksmanship is a common theme in political ads, and reception varies depending on the candidate. Earlier this year, Republican senate candidate Joni Ernst in Iowa took target practice at a gun range during an ad in which she promised to “take aim” at Obamacare, which attracted some criticism on the grounds that she was making light of gun violence.

Beltran is running in Washington’s fourth congressional district, a seat from which Republican congressman Doc Hastings is retiring. The district is largely considered a safe Republican district, with the Cook Partisan Voting Index rating it R+14.
