(At least for now it is. These deadline things seem to be written in sand.) Key to making the whole program work is getting healthy people in their 20s, a.k.a. the \u201cYoung Invincibles,\u201d to sign up.\n\nYes, The Young Invincibles sounds like a bad boy band. Just move along.\n\nSo a couple of days ago, in an attempt to goose Young Invincibles to sign up, Organizing for America (a.k.a. the former Obama campaign arm) tweeted this to its followers:\n\nResponse was swift and brutal. And for the past several days, there has been no shortage of abuse raining down on the so-called Pajama Boy \u2014 most of which, predictably, came from the same conservative folks who aren\u2019t big fans of Obamacare. Haters created an entire backstory for PJ Boy, like Rich Lowry, who said, \u201cPajama Boy is about as threatening as Michael Cera and so nerdy he could guest-host on an unwatched MSNBC show.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a whole \u2018nother discussion about PJB\u2019s \u201cmetrosexuality,\u201d etc., which we\u2019re not touching because it\u2019s irrelevant \u2026 because, you know, he\u2019s an image in an ad.\n\nWhat is relevant is this: It is TERRIBLE ADVERTISING.\n\nThat\u2019s coming from San Francisco ad exec Jeff Goodby, the man behind the \u201cGot Milk\u201d campaign. He\u2019s an Obama fan \u2014 he wrote a song with his partner Rich Silverstein in support of him last year \u2014 and wants the program to succeed.\n\nBut the PJ Boy image doesn\u2019t work, Goodby told me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it works because there\u2019s nothing in it for you. There\u2019s nothing in it for the person to respond to except that you should get on with your day and don\u2019t forget to apply for your healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to make an incentive for people to sign up early \u2014 they have to make it worth their while. And right now, no one is doing it and it\u2019s dead in the water. It\u2019s a real problem for the program.\u201d\n\nAnd at this point, the clock is ticking to make Obamacare work and get young people signed up. And they\u2019re not. As Goodby said, they don\u2019t even know what it is.\n\nThe new health care system is \u201clike the Higgs boson \u2014 the God particle,\u201d Goodby said. \u201cEverybody has heard of it but nobody knows what the hell it is.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to take more aggressive action,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of making a cool and funny ad \u2014 which I would love to help with \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of having a reason to do it. They have to feel that it\u2019s going to benefit you in some way. I don\u2019t think the program has been properly explained to everyone in any age. But especially to people with the attention spans of nanoseconds.\u201d\n\nGoodby said using the image of a guy in his pajamas to connect with young people \u201cis the most disingenuous part, I think.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a problem in advertising in general \u2014 show the target audience in the ad instead of actually understanding the target audience and saying something that would be meaningful to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, you show them in a way that\u2019s a little bit cynical. As in, \u2018Hey, these guys are all slackers.\u2019 It\u2019s not a very becoming way to talk about them.\u201d\n\nAs for the use of the much-mocked onesie: \u201cHe looks like a guy who doesn\u2019t have his act together,\u201d Goodby said. \u201cWe want people to sign up for health care who do have their act together and this guy doesn\u2019t look like he does. It\u2019s not a compliment.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Obama reached out to Silicon Valley techies to help repair the health law website. Maybe it\u2019s time he reached out to a San Francisco ad exec to help repair its outreach.\n\n\u201cI would be happy to do that, if asked,\u201d Goodby said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://blog.sfgate.com/politics/files/2013/12/pajamaBoy.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Joe Garofoli", "vf": {"unique_id": "wp_sfgate_blog_sfgate_com_politics_2285_blogEntryId26842"}, "title": "Ad exec Goodby: Pajama Boy Obamacare ad stinks", "og": {"site_name": "Politics Blog", "description": "After a last-minute extension, midnight Tuesday is the deadline to sign up for health care if you want coverage starting Jan. 1 under the terms of Obamacare.
