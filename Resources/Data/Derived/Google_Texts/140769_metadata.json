The latter two battles extended to double overtime.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re close; they\u2019re right there in every game,\u201d Rodriguez told the Arizona Daily Star when asked about the Buffs (2-7, 0-6 Pac-12).\n\n\u201cColorado is averaging 30 more yards per game than their opponents, which is a big stat when you look at it,\u201d he added. \u201cThey play really, really hard. And they have some challenging schemes. They do a lot of stuff. For our defense, it\u2019s a challenge to recognize formations and schemes and how to attack it.\u201d\n\nArizona (6-2, 3-2) has much to play for in the game (6 p.m., Pac-12 Network). The Wildcats are still challenging for the Pac-12\u2019s South Division title and hold the only victory over Oregon, a headline-grabbing 31-24 win over the then No. 2 Ducks in Eugene, Ore.\n\nArizona aims to make amends for last weekend\u2019s 17-7 loss to UCLA, the only game this season in which the Wildcats failed to score at least 26 points. And much is being made here of Saturday marking Arizona\u2019s 100th homecoming.\n\nA matchup to watch is Colorado junior receiver Nelson Spruce against Arizona safety Will Parks, who likely will cover Spruce when the Buffs standout lines up in the slot.\n\n\u201cThose are the matchups you look for \u2014 to play against some of the best receivers out there,\u201d Parks said to the Arizona Daily Star. \u201c(Spruce is) definitely one of them. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s defense will be without starting sophomore free safety Chidobe Awuzie. CU announced prior to the game that Awuzie had lacerated a kidney during a practice this week and is done for the season.\n\nSophomore starting strong safety Tedric Thompson (concussion Oct. 25 against UCLA) also is out.\n\nAnother sophomore, linebacker Addison Gillam (viral infection), has returned.\n\nArizona star receiver Austin Hill (concussion) is expected to play.\n\nTemperatures in Tucson are expected to reach the low-to-mid 80s by mid-afternoon but should cool to the 70s by kickoff.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arizona\u2019s Rich Rodriguez concerned about Colorado\u2019s close calls", "title": "Arizona\u2019s Rich Rodriguez concerned about Colorado\u2019s close calls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/08/arizonas-rich-rodriguez-concerned-about-colorados-close-calls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141108__Rich-Rodriguezp1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141108__Rich-Rodriguezp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-08T14:54:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:06:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5c20\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re close; they\u2019re right there in every game,\u201d Rodriguez told the Arizona Daily Star when asked about the Buffs (2-7, 0-6 Pac-12).\nBut you\u2019d never know that by listening to Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez, although CU still seeks its first conference victory.\nGametracker: Arizona Wildcats vs. Colorado BuffaloesTUCSON \u2014 Las Vegas oddsmakers have made No.\nArizona star receiver Austin Hill (concussion) is expected to play.\nAs coaches are apt to do, Rodriguez prefers to focus on the Buffaloes\u2019 highlights: narrow defeats to Oregon State, California and UCLA."}
