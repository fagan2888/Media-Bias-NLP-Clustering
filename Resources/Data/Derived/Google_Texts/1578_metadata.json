Insufficient levels of the L-citrulline may lead to dangerous levels of ammonia in the bloodstream, potentially causing brain damage or death. Medisca officials said in a statement they had contacted their manufacturing partner in an effort to ascertain the chemical makeup of the bad lots.\n\nThose missing doses may have caused illness in as many as a half-dozen children across the country, Cynthia Le Mons, executive director of the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation, told NBC News. Among those sickened, a 14-year-old girl lost clumps of her hair and suffered stomach pains before she was hospitalized for low levels of L-citrulline. Such disorders affect only 2,000 to 2,500 children in the United States, of whom three-quarters require the L-citrulline supplements from Medisca, the main supplier, or several competitors.\n\nIn 2012, Medisca and its founder were sentenced in U.S. District Court in New York to pay a $15,000 fine and forfeit $1.7 million in profits for the illicit sale of Chinese-made human growth hormone drugs.\n\nRegulatory officials recommended that medical professionals L-citrulline quarantine lots of L-citrulline from Medisca until they can provide further information. Meanwhile, doctors and caregivers should report adverse reactions or quality problems to the FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "l-citrulline, bad lots l-citrulline, medisca and bad lots, l-citrulline recall, urea disorder, treatment for urea disorder, l-citrulline supplement recall", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eight bad lots of the supplement L-citrulline from Medisca have been recalled from hospitals and retail pharmacies around the world.", "title": "FDA Issues Recall For L-Citrulline Supplements", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-issues-recall-l-citrulline-supplement-used-treat-urea-cycle-disorders-269395", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/16/fda-warns-faulty-l-citrulline-supplements.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eight bad lots of the supplement L-citrulline from Medisca have been recalled from hospitals and retail pharmacies around the world.", "title": "FDA Issues Recall For L-Citrulline Supplements", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-issues-recall-l-citrulline-supplement-used-treat-urea-cycle-disorders-269395", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/16/fda-warns-faulty-l-citrulline-supplements.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/16/fda-warns-faulty-l-citrulline-supplements.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-02-16T16:45:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-16T16:45:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eight bad lots of the supplement L-citrulline from Medisca have been recalled from hospitals and retail pharmacies around the world."}, "article_summary": "The supplement is used to treat urea cycle disorders, wherein the body lacks one of six enzymes that help clear ammonia from the blood.\nEight bad lots of L-citrulline supplement from Medisca Inc., of Plattsburgh, N.Y., have been recalled.\nRegulatory officials recommended that medical professionals L-citrulline quarantine lots of L-citrulline from Medisca until they can provide further information.\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Saturday warned pharmacies and patients across the country of faulty batches of the supplement L-citrulline, an amino acid used to treat a rare and serious genetic disorder.\nMedisca officials said in a statement they had contacted their manufacturing partner in an effort to ascertain the chemical makeup of the bad lots."}
