This month\u2019s results found only 38 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while 53 percent had an unfavorable view. Clinton trailed a generic Republican candidate by 8 points. Fifty-eight percent of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that Clinton \u201cwill say or do anything\u201d to be president. Additionally, 56 percent of respondents found her at least somewhat untrustworthy, and 37 percent thought she was definitely hiding something about the 2012 Benghazi attack with another 21 percent probably hiding something.\n\n\n\n[GOP-opposition research group America Rising unveiled its sister group, AR2, on Tuesday.]\n\n\n\nClinton says Democrats should run on climate change - National Journal: \u201cHillary Clinton isn\u2019t afraid to talk about global warming\u2014and she wants her fellow Democrats to join her. In closed-door meetings with House and Senate Democrats Tuesday, Clinton jumped at the chance to discuss the hot-button topic in political terms, numerous lawmakers said. Clinton delivered a clear message: Democrats must convince the American public that action to combat Earth's rising temperatures is urgent, and her party can make that case by tailoring their message to different kinds of voters.\u201d\n\n\n\nClinton family friend attacks Hillary on bank breakup - Former classmate to both Clintons, economist Robert Reich goes after Hillary for her resistance to the Glass-Steagall Act. Reich posted a column on his website stating: \u201cHillary Clinton won\u2019t propose reinstating a bank break-up law known as the Glass-Steagall \u2026This is a big mistake. It\u2019s a mistake politically because people who believe Hillary Clinton is still too close to Wall Street will not be reassured by her position on Glass-Steagall.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Poll: Hillary loses a step or two - Hillary Clinton\u2019s sizable lead has been trimmed a bit according to a new Monmouth University poll. Clinton saw support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters drop six points since June to 51 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., still a distance second at 17 percent, bumped up 5 points from his June showing.]\n\n\n\nO\u2019Malley pushes further on immigration than Obama - TIME: \u201cFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley on Tuesday called for a broad sweep of executive actions to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation and detention, touting his work as governor of Maryland and saying he would go further than President Obama as he seeks to attract the support of Hispanic voters.\u201d\n\n\n\nDEMS WILL PAY 2016 PRICE FOR IRAN\n\nVox: \u201cObama already has vowed to veto planned legislation blocking the deal. That means he will rely on just one-third of either the House or Senate voting with him to save it. He needs a majority of Democrats but only a minority of either chamber. That paradigm \u2014 Republicans uniformly opposed and Democrats divided \u2014 will make the agreement a tougher sell to the broader public than if it had bipartisan majority support or even full backing from Obama\u2019s Democrats. \u2018The easier vote for most us will be no,\u2019 said one House Democrat who is inclined to back the president. Members don\u2019t tend to lose their seats for voting against the president when his position ends up winning, the lawmaker explained.\u201d\n\n\n\nHappy place - David Drucker points out that the issue is not so complicated for Republicans, quoting GOP wise man Ed Rollins: \u201cBad issue for the country; good issue for Republicans.\u201d\n\n\n\nRubio group launches television second ad on Iran - The Conservative Solutions Project, a group backing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., released a second ad Tuesday set to air on national cable stations.

The car, produced at Ford\u2019s plant on Mack Street (now Mack Avenue) in Detroit, was delivered to Dr. Pfenning just over a week later. Henry Ford had built his first gasoline-powered vehicle\u2013which he called the Quadricycle\u2013in a workshop behind his home in 1896, while working as the chief engineer for the main plant of the Edison Illuminating Company in Detroit. After making two unsuccessful attempts to start a company to manufacture automobiles before 1903, Ford gathered a group of 12 stockholders, including himself, to sign the papers necessary to form the Ford Motor Company in mid-June 1903.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The Federal Election Commission will release today the details of the second-quarter fundraising by 2016 candidates.\n\n\n\nWith Jeb Bush in his own $114 million campaign-plus-super PAC fundraising zip code, and Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio rounding out the top tier at $51 million and $43 million respectively, the key question is what will Scott Walker\u2019s filing tell. Though his official kickoff was just last week, the Wisconsin governor will need to show he can compete in the top money group.\n\n\n\nDespite solid poll number in early states Walker is bound to suffer some down beats which means having sufficient hay in the loft to push through a heavily front-loaded primary calendar. Walker will face a tough climb if he falls back into the rest of the pack, none of whom has reported more than $17 million in combined campaign/PAC dollars, several bringing in considerably less.\n\n\n\n[Who\u2019s rising fastest? Who\u2019s spending fastest? WSJ goes granular on what to watch out for in second quarter filings.]\n\n\n\nWalker picks fight with Feds over food stamp drug testing - Chicago Tribune: \u201cThe budget Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed on Sunday contains language requiring food stamp recipients to undergo drug screening. If they fail the screen they must go through drug testing and treatment to remain eligible for the benefit. The lawsuit alleges that federal food stamp officials warned the state in May that federal law bars the state from implementing any drug testing for food stamp recipients. The law prohibits a state agency from imposing eligibility standards for food stamps that aren't consistent with standards set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary.\u201d\n\n\n\nFreakout, day two - Walker\u2019s support for the Boy Scouts\u2019 policy to welcome gay scouts but ban gay scoutmasters was greeted by a full-scale frenzy on the left.\n\n\n\n[Walker continues his post launch tour with a trio of events in South Carolina today.]\n\n\n\nJEB PICKS HIS SOUTH CAROLINA TEAM\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., rolled out his South Carolina campaign committee today.

Read the full list here.\n\n\n\nJeb tees off on Trump - \u201cWhether it\u2019s Donald Trump or Barack Obama, their rhetoric of divisiveness is wrong\u2026A Republican will never win by striking fear in people\u2019s hearts. A Republican can win and will win if we have an aspirational message that gives people hope that their lives will be better if we apply conservative principles the right way,\u201d said Bush in Iowa on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Jeb Bush joins the ranks of the presidential contender series on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d Watch Bush\u2019s segment tonight at 6 p.m. ET]\n\n\n\nPOWER PLAY: TRUMPING CARLY\n\nCarly Fiorina, who has held an upper tier position in the Fox News First GOP Power Index, has seen her numbers drop.

John Kasich, a likely Republican presidential candidate, on Tuesday defended his decision to accept federal dollars for a Medicaid expansion as part of ObamaCare\u2026He defended the decision as rooted in Biblical teaching of helping the \u2018downtrodden,\u2019 and he pushed back against others in his party that panned Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion as bloating the size of the federal government. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is the only other Republican governor in the field to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristie\u2019s special announcement - Gov.

He is not some kind of activist. He is no part of any movement. This Atticus Finch, the one we have loved for so long, is nothing more than a slave to the law. He loves only justice. And when he saw a man who was wrongly accused, he didn\u2019t see a black man or a white girl. He simply saw a miscarriage of justice and fought to right it.\u201d\n\n\n\nCANADIAN HOLES ELEVATED\n\nCBC: \u201cExcusez-moi? Many Fredericton drivers can be excused if they are getting lost in translation thanks to some road construction signs popping up across the city. New Brunswick is Canada\u2019s only officially bilingual province, so it\u2019s not unusual to see road signs in both French and English. But sometimes signs translated directly from English to French can cause unintended \u2014 and humorous \u2014problems. That\u2019s what is happening in Fredericton, where signs warning of raised manholes are causing some confusion among drivers. The yellow warning sign reads: \u2018Caution: Raised manholes/Attention: Trous d\u2019homme sur \u00e9l\u00e9ves.\u2019 The direct translation suggests that \u2018men\u2019s holes are over-elevated.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cEven worse is the final capitulation, which was a giving in to a lifting of the embargo on ballistic missiles and conventional arms. We just heard Kerry say why didn\u2019t you negotiate for U.S. hostages held there and he says it\u2019s not a nuclear thing. Well, conventional is the opposite of nuclear that was not to be discussed at all, it was thrown in by the Iranians and the Russians at the last moment and we caved on that.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
