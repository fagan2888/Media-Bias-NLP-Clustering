McCoy of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nAfter Anita Beets retired from teaching with Knox County Schools in 2008, it didn\u2019t take long for her to want to return to the classroom.\n\nA year later, she returned to Sequoyah Elementary, the school where she had been a kindergarten teacher, as a substitute.\n\nBeets said she subs at the school an average of two to three times per week.\n\n\u201cI missed the kids. I missed the community. I missed the classroom and decided that I would start back slowly,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I started back slowly, subbing a little here and a little there, and then just found that I just love it.\u201d\n\nBeets is one of the district\u2019s substitutes who could benefit from a differential pay structure being implemented by the school system beginning Feb. 1.\n\nThis week, school officials announced the system will be giving differential pay to substitutes who are licensed teachers and to teachers who have retired from the school system \u2014 which means a substitute could earn up to $164 per day with additional differential pay.\n\nSubstitutes currently are paid $68 per day for certified positions.\n\nThe school system has added five more schools to the list of \u201chigh needs\u201d schools that are eligible for the differential pay and has increased the daily cost for instructional assistants at the district\u2019s alternative schools. So effective Feb. 1, differential pay will be available at 33 schools.\n\n\u201cWe want to really address the issue of making sure we have a great educator available to substitute when a teacher is absent,\u201d said Schools Superintendent Jim McIntyre. \u201cWe\u2019re creating some incentives within the financial structure of our substitute teacher pay program to encourage really highly qualified, expert educators to take advantage of the opportunities to be in our classrooms and teach with us.\u201d\n\nBeets said she was unaware of the differential, but she thought it was good that the district was looking at ways to increase the pool of qualified substitutes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that they keep looking at different strategies, yes, to pull more people in to help out. I know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re sick ... You need to know you have a responsible person there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sub pool, from what I understand, is down quite a bit. Schools are having problems, and I think anything that they can try and come up with incentives to get more people in there \u2014 responsible people that want to be there \u2014 I think is a great idea.\u201d\n\nBeets said that while the extra dollars in her pocket wouldn\u2019t be a pull for her, she knows the pay could help others.\n\n\u201cI love being in the classroom \u2014 that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m going back. That would be wonderful if they paid certified teachers a little more than other subs, but the other subs work as hard as we do,\u201d she said.\n\nThe school system implemented its first set of strategies in November \u2014 differential pay of $25 for substitutes who work at schools with a rate of unfilled teacher absences of 15 percent or more and an additional $20 per day for substitutes who work on Mondays and Fridays at 28 \u2014 soon to be increased to 33 \u2014 of the district\u2019s schools.\n\nThe changes have made a difference, according to school officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s had a positive impact, and we\u2019ve seen increases both in terms of fill rates at those schools and particularly the fill rates on Mondays and Fridays, which were the days where we had the lowest fill rates for substitute teachers covering teacher absences,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen a slight expansion of the overall pool of substitute teachers that are taking advantage of those opportunities. So we feel like those strategies are working.\u201d\n\nThe financial strategies came as recommendations from a 14-member committee convened by Kathy Sims, the school system\u2019s chief human resources officer, to look at the issues around increasing the district\u2019s substitute teaching pool.\n\nThe committee was created after school officials did an analysis of teacher absences and substitutes. The study showed that 28 of the district\u2019s schools had a 15 percent or higher rate of unfilled teacher absences.\n\nSome of the factors for those absences going unfilled, according to findings from the committee, included required professional development days during the year on designated school days, last-minute calls from employees requesting a substitute and new federal guidelines based on the Affordable Care Act, which mandate health care benefits be provided if a substitute works more than a certain number of hours.\n\nAs a result of the Affordable Care Act requirement, the school system has restricted substitutes to working 120 hours per month.\n\nSince implementing differential pay at those 28 schools and on Mondays and Fridays, school officials said they are seeing improvements.\n\nAccording to school system data, the schools that received differential pay before Nov. 1 had only a 63 percent fill rate on Mondays and Fridays. Afterward, those numbers rose to 77.9 percent on Mondays and 78.3 percent on Fridays, according to officials.\n\nAt schools with no differential pay, the fill rates remained the same \u2014 about 84 percent on Mondays. That percentage decreased slightly on Fridays \u2014 from 82.6 percent before Nov. 1 to 79.3 percent after.\n\nSusan Sprinkle has been a substitute teacher with the school system since 2010, retiring the year before from the University of Tennessee\u2019s office of printing. She has subbed at several schools in the district and subs often at Carter Middle School \u2014 one of the schools where substitutes receive differential pay.\n\nSprinkle said she likes that the district is looking at ways to increase its substitute pool, but differential pay at only a few schools might not be the best route.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good strategy, but you have more than these 28 schools that are suffering for substitutes,\u201d Sprinkle said. \u201cAs far as Carter Middle School right now, they\u2019re getting some subs that they do not know how they\u2019re going to focus with the children, how they\u2019re going to focus with the teaching staff.\u201d\n\nShe said it\u2019s been a different situation at the school since the district started the differential pay, and some substitutes have chosen the school because of the higher pay.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t love the kids and want to help them learn, you shouldn\u2019t be doing it, because it\u2019s not a baby-sitting service,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it a baby-sitting job. I consider it a job to help them learn to further their education. Everybody doesn\u2019t look at it that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Knox schools offer more incentives to attract substitutes", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/education/knox-schools-offer-more-incentives-to-attract-substitutes-ep-869328664-353686891.html", "image": {"width": 482, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/knoxlogo_12350318_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "After Anita Beets retired from teaching with Knox County Schools in 2008, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long for her to want to return to the classroom.", "title": "Knox schools offer more incentives to attract substitutes"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/knoxlogo_12350318_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "After Anita Beets retired from teaching with Knox County Schools in 2008, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long for her to want to return to the classroom.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Knox schools offer more incentives to attract substitutes"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6a9\"", "article_summary": "She has subbed at several schools in the district and subs often at Carter Middle School \u2014 one of the schools where substitutes receive differential pay.\nSince implementing differential pay at those 28 schools and on Mondays and Fridays, school officials said they are seeing improvements.\nAs a result of the Affordable Care Act requirement, the school system has restricted substitutes to working 120 hours per month.\nThe school system has added five more schools to the list of \u201chigh needs\u201d schools that are eligible for the differential pay and has increased the daily cost for instructional assistants at the district\u2019s alternative schools.\nSo effective Feb. 1, differential pay will be available at 33 schools."}
