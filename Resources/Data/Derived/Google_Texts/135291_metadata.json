Someone who receives a commutation still has felony convictions on his or her record. During his presidency, Obama has pardoned 70 people.\n\nThe 61 inmates who won commuted sentences were \u201cserving years in prison under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws,\u201d Neil Eggleston, White House counsel to the president, wrote in a White House blog post.\n\nOver his two terms, Obama so far has commuted the sentences of 248 federal inmates, more than the past seven presidents combined.\n\nOf last week\u2019s 61 recipients of clemency, more than a third were serving life sentences.\n\n\u201cThe pardon clause in the Constitution empowers the president to grant clemency,\u201d Paul Larkin, a senior legal research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. \u201cPart of that authority is the ability to reduce a sentence imposed by a court, even if the sentence was required by an act of Congress.\u201d Larkin added:\n\nThe federal drug laws require that stiff, mandatory minimum sentences be imposed in some cases. Congress reduced those penalties for the sale of crack cocaine on a prospective basis starting back in 2010, but Congress declined to make that revision retroactive. What President Obama is trying to do now is decide whether he should grant clemency to individual prisoners in order to reduce their sentences.\n\nA dozen of those who received clemency in this round had a firearm conviction along with a drug offense, according to the White House.\n\nJerome Harris Jr., 40, sentenced to 25 years in federal prison in 2006, had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of \u201cintent to distribute crack and powder cocaine\u201d and \u201cknowingly using, carrying, and possessing firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.\u201d There were six firearms involved.\n\nAlthough Obama continues to stress the need to limit gun sales and combat \u201cgun violence,\u201d Earnest chose not to answer a reporter\u2019s question about clemency recipients\u2019 gun possession charges in connection with their crimes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important about these cases is many of them are low-level drug offenders and many of them, had they been sentenced under the rules that are in place today, would have already served out their sentence,\u201d Earnest said at the White House press briefing. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what made them particularly strong candidates to receive this kind of clemency from the commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nIn Mobile, Ala., Harris previously was convicted in a state court for possession of cocaine and marijuana \u201cin addition to charges of receiving stolen property, robbery, assault, and carrying a pistol without a permit.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of the fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1, 2015, lawyers for inmates sent the Department of Justice 1,715 petitions for the commutation of sentences; another 9,115 petitions were pending.\n\nThe process to get clemency is rigorous. According to the Department of Justice, clemency applications for inmates who meet all of the following criteria are prioritized:\n\nCurrently serving a federal sentence and likely would get a substantially shorter sentence if convicted of the same offenses today.\n\nConvicted of nonviolent, low-level offenses and without significant ties to large-scale criminal organizations, gangs, or cartels.\n\nServed at least 10 years of a prison sentence.\n\nDo not have a significant criminal history.\n\nDemonstrated good conduct in prison.\n\nHad no history of violence prior to or during the current prison term.\n\nThe White House said eight of those whose sentences were commuted had been convicted of drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Americans who\u2019d been serving time on the kind of outdated sentences that are clogging up our jails and burning through our tax dollars,\u201d Obama wrote on Facebook. \u201cSimply put, their punishments didn\u2019t fit the crime.\u201d The president added:\n\nI believe America is a nation of second chances, and with hard work, responsibility, and better choices, people can change their lives and contribute to our society.\n\nCarmel Bretous, 48, was convicted after being charged in 2001 in Miami, Fla., for trying to smuggle 110 pounds of cocaine, valued at $1 million, into the United States.\n\nBretous was convicted of importing, possessing, and intending to distribute at least 5 grams of cocaine, the White House said.\n\nShe was sentenced to 235 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Her sentence now expires on July 28, like the majority of the others granted clemency last week.\n\nMelissa Ross, 44, was convicted on charges of cocaine distribution involving \u201c5 kilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride and 50 grams or more of cocaine base.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Ross was part of a $54 million cocaine ring and the right-hand assistant to her boyfriend, the mastermind.\n\nIn 1999, a Georgia court convicted Willie Chevell Cameron, now 41, of obstructing or hindering a law enforcement officer. Prosecutors accused Cameron of \u201crunning from and fighting with\u201d an investigator, Earl Grizzard of the Troup County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nCameron also was convicted on two counts of cocaine distribution. The incident was separate from federal charges for distribution of cocaine and methamphetamine in Florida in 2006, for which he received a life sentence upon conviction.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution gives presidents the power to grant mercy, and these commutations show that President Obama takes second chances seriously,\u201d Mary Price, general counsel for Families Against Mandatory Minimums, who directs the organization\u2019s clemency project, said in a formal statement.\n\nThe group representing families of inmates reported as follows on four others who won clemency:\n\nIsmael Rosa. Ismael Rosa was a salsa musician struggling with cocaine addiction when he became involved in a drug conspiracy. He was only involved for six days, but in 1994, he was given a mandatory life sentence in federal prison because of two minor priors related to his addiction. Rosa served more than 20 years in prison, and has watched as every single person above him in the conspiracy, including its leader, has been released from prison. Kenneth Harvey. In 1990, Kenneth Harvey was sentenced to life in prison as a result of his conviction for possessing 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Because of Harvey\u2019s two prior drug convictions, his judge [had] no choice but to impose a life sentence, but he took the unusual step of recommending that Harvey\u2019s sentence be commuted after 15 years. Carol Denise Richardson. Carol Richardson was 38 years old when, in 2006, she was sentenced to life in prison for her role in a crack conspiracy. Her sentence was enhanced due to minor drug priors. The Texas native has been separated from her four daughters for more than 10 years. Jesse Webster. In 1996, Jesse Webster was sentenced to life in prison for his role in a cocaine conspiracy, his first and only drug offense. At the time, Webster\u2019s sentencing judge, James B. Zagel, said the life term he was forced to impose was \u2018too high.\u2019 The Chicago native has been incarcerated for more than 20 years.\n\nA list of all 61 of those granted clemency by Obama may be found here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Convicts whose sentences were commuted include a federal inmate involved in a $54 million cocaine conspiracy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Convicts whose sentences were commuted include a federal inmate involved in a $54 million cocaine conspiracy.", "title": "These 61 Prisoners Had Sentences Shortened by Obama", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160331_ObamaCommutations_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-04T22:08:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1q0ZjaF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Convicts whose sentences were commuted include a federal inmate involved in a $54 million cocaine conspiracy.", "title": "These 61 Prisoners Had Sentences Shortened by Obama", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160331_ObamaCommutations_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2016-04-04T17:54:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T22:08:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama commutations, Obama clemency, prisons, commutation, pardons, drug offenders, mandatory minimums, criminal justice reform"}, "article_summary": "In his most recent round of clemency, President Barack Obama has reduced the sentences of 61 federal prisoners, allowing most to be freed within months.\nOf last week\u2019s 61 recipients of clemency, more than a third were serving life sentences.\nWhat President Obama is trying to do now is decide whether he should grant clemency to individual prisoners in order to reduce their sentences.\nA list of all 61 of those granted clemency by Obama may be found here.\nOver his two terms, Obama so far has commuted the sentences of 248 federal inmates, more than the past seven presidents combined."}
