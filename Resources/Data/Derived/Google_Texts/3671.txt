The Colorado State Patrol on Saturday was investigating a van crash — with multiple injuries — on La Veta Pass.

The State Patrol’s Alamosa office said on Twitter that two people were seriously injured and seven had moderate injuries.

Four or five of the victims were children.

Nine people were reported to have been in the van when it crashed on U.S. 160.

Flight For Life helped take victims to hospitals.

U.S. 160 was closed but had reopened by 5 p.m., the State Patrol said.
