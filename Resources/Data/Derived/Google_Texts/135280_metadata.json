It\u2019s a venerable principle in economics.\n\nSo five years ago when ObamaCare was being enacted, we and many others warned that its coverage mandates for employers would result in hours being cut back and workers being laid off. We were criticized at the time as Chicken Littles. Now comes a survey of 743 personnel executives by the Society of Human Resource Management, as reported by Robert King of the Washington Examiner, that shows businesses are doing just that. Nearly 14% of firms have cut part-time hours for workers, King wrote, and another 6% plan to do so.\n\nStill worse, 5% of companies have already either cut or plan to cut the total number of workers they have, thanks to ObamaCare.\n\nObamaCare\u2019s employer mandate requires businesses with 100 or more employees to provide health insurance to 70% of their workers who put in 30 or more hours a week. That goes up to 95% next year.\n\nMeanwhile, small businesses with 50 to 99 workers will start feeling the pinch in 2016, when the mandate hits them, too.\n\nSo it\u2019s only logical: Businesses are cutting hours to avoid having to pay for the mandate \u2014 a predictable response in the real world, but apparently not in the world of the economists, politicians and planners who concocted ObamaCare\u2019s destructive rules.\n\nAs for \u201cbending the cost-curve down,\u201d as President Obama promised repeatedly, forget about it. The survey found that 77% of companies had higher health-care costs this year than last year, and just 6% saw their costs decrease. For those who had costs rise, 24% saw costs go up 16% or more.\n\nIf you want to know why this job recovery has been the worst since the Great Depression, you need look no further than these depressing statistics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Raise the cost of something, and inevitably demand for that thing goes down.
