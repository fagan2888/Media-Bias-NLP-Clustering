Court records don't indicate why the case was withdrawn, and Tressler's attorney at the time could not be reached Sunday.\n\nState police released no further details Sunday about the fatal stabbing at the home Engle and Tressler, now 45, shared on Ondrejko Road in Georges Township. The address is different from the site of the previous incident.\n\nCoroner Dr. Phillip Reilly said an autopsy on Engle, 29, was completed, but he referred questions to state police. A criminal complaint was not available Sunday.\n\nArthur Engle of Smithfield called his nephew a laid-back, nonviolent person. Engle last saw his nephew on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat wasn't even my nephew; that was my best friend in the world,\u201d Arthur Engle said.\n\nEngle's cousin, Stephanie Engle, established an online donation site at gofundme.com/robertengle on Saturday to offset funeral costs. Family members, including his mother, Ellie Engle, and father, Petey Mitchell, both of Masontown, were struggling to come to terms with his death, she said. He has a daughter, Stephanie Engle said.\n\n\u201cHe was a very loving, caring, outgoing person,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's a lot of people who are reaching out.\u201d\n\nPolice were summoned to Ondrejko Road at about 4 a.m. Saturday, and found Engle dead of a stab wound to the chest. Tressler was not home when police arrived, but later was arrested, police said.\n\nStephanie Engle said the family needs to come up with $600 by Tuesday to secure a funeral home's services. The total cost is $2,200, she said.\n\nTressler is being held without bail at the Fayette County Prison on a homicide charge. A preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 1. Tressler did not have an attorney listed in online court records.\n\nRenatta Signorini is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
