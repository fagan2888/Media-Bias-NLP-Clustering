On July 1 the state will start its fiscal year, which means the city\u2019s plan will renew. At that time the library can opt to leave the city\u2019s insurance plan and seek private coverage. Plans are changing at the first of the year due to deadlines created by the ACA.\n\n\n\nZipfel brought in private insurance Chartered Life Underwriter Matthew Schellenberg of Peoria-based Group Benefits, Ltd. to speak to the board and employees about the plans his firm could offer the library. She also invited City Manager Todd Thompson to touch upon the changes to the city\u2019s plan, but he was not in attendance.\n\nTwo plans offered by Schellenberg would cost about $20,000 less that the city\u2019s $144,000 plan, and would offer similar coverage.\n\n\u201cWhenever you make a change there\u2019s good and bad,\u201d Schellenberg said. \u201cBut I think we offer a competitive plan (to the city\u2019s).\u201d\n\nThere was concerns that the private plans were Health Maintenance Organization plans instead of Preferred Provider Organization plans, which employees currently receive from the city.\n\nSchellenberg said his proposal, \u201clooks and feels like a PPO.\u201d\n\nPPOs generally offer more flexibility in health care provider, whereas HMOs are based under one primary physician of the customer\u2019s choice.\n\nThe out-of-pocket prices are $4,000 and $4,500 for the two plans proposed by Schellenberg. The plan with the higher costs comes with more copays.\n\nAssistant Director Jane Easterly said what Schellenberg proposed sounded great, but she had concerns about comparing the city\u2019s plan to the private ones.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a salesman. We didn\u2019t that kind of pitch from the city,\u201d Easterly said.\n\nEasterly, Zipfel and members of the board all felt it is better for them to get an unbiased explanation of the options available before leaving the city\u2019s insurance. However, the deadline for the city is Nov. 30, and Schellenberg said he wants a decision on Dec. 1.\n\n\u201cMy other concern is, it\u2019s Nov. 21, it feels like it will be a rushed decision,\u201d Easterly said.\n\nBoard member Laurie Muelder said agreed, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what exactly we\u2019re getting for the money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GALESBURG \u2014 The Public Library Board has opted to stick with the city\u2019s health insurance plan for at least six more months to complete more research on outside plans.
