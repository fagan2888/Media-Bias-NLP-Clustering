It was an appropriate time for a news icon to pass the torch, as few were paying attention; Sawyer may be the last evening news anchor who mattered.\n\nConsider that Sawyer\u2019s replacement in the anchor spot will be David Muir, but that Muir will not be the network\u2019s go-to person when news breaks or during major events like elections. That\u2019d be George Stephanopoulos, who\u2019s now the network\u2019s \u201cchief anchor\u201d \u2014 an unusual split, and one that points, as though we needed any more evidence, to the decreased primacy of the evening newscast.\n\nSawyer was a bigger star than the typical network news anchor \u2014 for better or worse, as recent scurrilous bits of news from a book about her and other female TV icons indicated \u2014 and will continue to be one without the job. A report in the New York Daily News sourced by anonymous Sawyer intimates indicated Sawyer\u2019s desire to do the sort of reporting that cannot be done from behind a Manhattan desk. As a news anchor, Sawyer shored up the \u201cWorld News\u201d ratings \u2014 but it\u2019s the sort of job that really can be done even by someone the network doesn\u2019t entrust to lead their network\u2019s coverage.\n\nOnce the sort of prize that was a victory lap in the later stages of a long career or an albatross that could upset the careers of people who sought it (Katie Couric, at the height of her fame and power, gave it a go at CBS and has never really recovered), the evening news gig is now something that Sawyer is slipping away from, and something that, at ABC, at least, hardly seems like such a prize.\n\nNBC\u2019s Brian Williams, at least, still gets attention, but as a recent New York Times interview with him and Seth Meyers recently proved, it\u2019s really more about his love of comedy than about anything happening between 6:30 and 7 p.m. Scott Pelley is also on television nightly!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sawyer signed off her evening gig last night -- but the heat in TV news is in the morning now", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sawyer signed off her evening gig last night -- but the heat in TV news is in the morning now", "title": "Diane Sawyer: The last news anchor?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/28/diane_sawyer_the_last_news_anchor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/AP919645518316-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sawyer signed off her evening gig last night -- but the heat in TV news is in the morning now", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/AP919645518316-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Diane Sawyer: The last news anchor?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Diane Sawyer: The last news anchor?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ABC, david muir, diane sawyer, good morning america, world news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdac6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: ABC, david muir, diane sawyer, good morning america, world news, Entertainment NewsDiane Sawyer\u2019s last night on the air as anchor of ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News\u201d came last night \u2014 in the middle of the week in late summer.\nIt was an appropriate time for a news icon to pass the torch, as few were paying attention; Sawyer may be the last evening news anchor who mattered.\nAs a news anchor, Sawyer shored up the \u201cWorld News\u201d ratings \u2014 but it\u2019s the sort of job that really can be done even by someone the network doesn\u2019t entrust to lead their network\u2019s coverage.\nConsider that Sawyer\u2019s replacement in the anchor spot will be David Muir, but that Muir will not be the network\u2019s go-to person when news breaks or during major events like elections.\nA report in the New York Daily News sourced by anonymous Sawyer intimates indicated Sawyer\u2019s desire to do the sort of reporting that cannot be done from behind a Manhattan desk."}
