Gary Hershorn/Corbis\n\nIn a recent interview with the Des Moines Register, Hillary Clinton outlined several elements of Obamacare that she said she would seek to change as president. Her proposals illustrate how the fiscal impact of the law could increase significantly from what was expected when the legislation passed in March 2010.\n\nAmong the things Mrs. Clinton cited was \u201chow to fix the family glitch.\u201d In short, if an individual qualifies for \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance through an employer, that person\u2019s family will not qualify for federal insurance subsidies\u2013even if the employer does not offer family coverage or if family coverage is unaffordable for the household.\n\nSupporters of the health-care law may call this a \u201cglitch,\u201d but it is far from an unintended consequence. This provision has worked exactly how Congress wrote it into the Affordable Care Act. As I noted in an earlier Think Tank post, the Joint Committee on Taxation outlined the specifics behind this policy in a footnote on Page 33 of a 157-page summary of the law released the week of its passage. While some congressional Democrats have attempted to argue since then that the provision, as codified by the Internal Revenue Service, was \u201csimply incongruent\u201d with the text, or a \u201cwrong interpretation of the law,\u201d the legislative history indicates otherwise. The provision may have harsh consequences for affected families, but its inclusion was deliberate.\n\nWhen Congress considered the legislation in 2010, the bill needed to adhere to President Barack Obama\u2019s September 2009 pledge that it would \u201ccost around $900 billion over 10 years.\u201d But to keep the total cost of insurance subsidies\u2014the \u201cgross cost of coverage provisions\u201d in Table 4 here\u2014under $1 trillion, lawmakers made numerous tough choices. For instance, Congress delayed the start of subsidized insurance from January 2013 to January 2014. Congress increased Medicaid payment rates to improve access\u2014but let that increase expire after two years. To pay for higher levels of upfront spending on insurance subsidies, Congress included provisions that slow their growth after 2019\u2014a back-dated reckoning that future Congresses, and families, will have to contend with. And Congress passed\u2014whether lawmakers knew it or not\u2014the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d provision.\n\nAs I wrote in January, undoing all these fiscal constraints will cost money. Mrs. Clinton and other supporters of the law have wish lists of enhanced benefits, but proposals to pay for this new spending have been scarce. Moreover, to the extent that skeptics have likened Obamacare to a subprime mortgage\u2014with \u201cteaser\u201d provisions passed in 2010 and a balloon payment still to come\u2014the long lists of additional spending proposals, with few instances of budgetary restraint, will reinforce those comparisons.\n\nChris Jacobs is policy director of America Next, a conservative think tank.
