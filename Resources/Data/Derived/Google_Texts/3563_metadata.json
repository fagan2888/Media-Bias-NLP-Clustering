But it turns out there\u2019s something that may be more effective with no downside, though it takes a bit of effort: meditation for about 30 minutes a day.\n\nA new analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins find that just a half-hour of \u201cmindfulness meditation\u201d may improve some of these garden variety, not yet full-blown, symptoms of anxiety and depression. The findings, published online in JAMA Internal Medicine, also found that some pain symptoms can also be relieved through a consistent meditation practice.\n\nThis should not come as breaking news. Many studies over many years link meditation to all kinds of health improvements. But I think it\u2019s worth restating, since meditation is still viewed as a crunchy, ineffective practice by so many \u2014 including those in the medical mainstream.\n\nHere\u2019s lead study author Dr. Madhav Goyal, assistant professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, quoted in the news release:\n\n\u201cA lot of people use meditation, but it\u2019s not a practice considered part of mainstream medical therapy for anything,\u201d says Goyal, M.D. M.P.H. \u201cBut in our study, meditation appeared to provide as much relief from some anxiety and depression symptoms as what other studies have found from antidepressants.\u201d These patients did not typically have full-blown anxiety or depression. The researchers evaluated the degree to which those symptoms changed in people who had a variety of medical conditions, such as insomnia or fibromyalgia, although only a minority had been diagnosed with a mental illness. Goyal and his colleagues found that so-called \u201cmindfulness meditation\u201d \u2014 a form of Buddhist self-awareness designed to focus precise, nonjudgmental attention to the moment at hand \u2014 also showed promise in alleviating some pain symptoms as well as stress. The findings held even as the researchers controlled for the possibility of the placebo effect, in which subjects in a study feel better even if they receive no active treatment because they perceive they are getting help for what ails them. To conduct their review, the investigators focused on 47 clinical trials performed through June 2013 among 3,515 participants that involved meditation and various mental and physical health issues, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, substance use, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and chronic pain. They found moderate evidence of improvement in symptoms of anxiety, depression and pain after participants underwent what was typically an eight-week training program in mindfulness meditation. They discovered low evidence of improvement in stress and quality of life. There was not enough information to determine whether other areas could be improved by meditation. In the studies that followed participants for six months, the improvements typically continued. They also found no harm came from meditation. Meditation, Goyal notes, has a long history in Eastern traditions, and it has been growing in popularity over the last 30 years in Western culture. \u201cA lot of people have this idea that meditation means sitting down and doing nothing,\u201d Goyal says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true. Meditation is an active training of the mind to increase awareness, and different meditation programs approach this in different ways.\u201d Mindfulness meditation, the type that showed the most promise, is typically practiced for 30 to 40 minutes a day. It emphasizes acceptance of feelings and thoughts without judgment and relaxation of body and mind. He cautions that the literature reviewed in the study contained potential weaknesses. Further studies are needed to clarify which outcomes are most affected by these meditation programs, as well as whether more meditation practice would have greater effects. \u201cMeditation programs appear to have an effect above and beyond the placebo,\u201d Goyal says.\n\nOm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An analysis of published studies finds that 30 minutes of daily meditation may relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "An analysis of published studies finds that 30 minutes of daily meditation may relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "title": "Study: Meditation Relieves Some Anxiety, Depression Beyond Placebo", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/meditation-relieves-symptoms-of-anxiety-depression-beyond-placebo-study-finds", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/07/kids-yoga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/meditation-relieves-symptoms-of-anxiety-depression-beyond-placebo-study-finds", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/07/kids-yoga.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Meditation Relieves Some Anxiety, Depression Beyond Placebo"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-07", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 07 Jan 2014 08:40:52 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2736\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut in our study, meditation appeared to provide as much relief from some anxiety and depression symptoms as what other studies have found from antidepressants.\u201d These patients did not typically have full-blown anxiety or depression.\nThey found moderate evidence of improvement in symptoms of anxiety, depression and pain after participants underwent what was typically an eight-week training program in mindfulness meditation.\nMeditation, Goyal notes, has a long history in Eastern traditions, and it has been growing in popularity over the last 30 years in Western culture.\nThe findings, published online in JAMA Internal Medicine, also found that some pain symptoms can also be relieved through a consistent meditation practice.\nA new analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins find that just a half-hour of \u201cmindfulness meditation\u201d may improve some of these garden variety, not yet full-blown, symptoms of anxiety and depression."}
