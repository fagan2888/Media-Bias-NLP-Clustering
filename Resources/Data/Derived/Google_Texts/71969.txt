The prices of books, supplies, tuition, fees and room and board have all increased, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.

Over the last five years, the cost of in-state tuition at public schools has increased in every state, but more drastically in some. The winners – or perhaps losers – in this case are the District of Columbia, Arizona and Georgia. In the nation's capital, tuition and fees increased 81 percent. They increased by about 70 percent in Arizona and by 65 percent in Georgia.
