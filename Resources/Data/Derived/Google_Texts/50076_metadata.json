The Bureau of Labor Statistics put out its monthly jobs report this morning, and the headline number was 7.0 percent unemployment, down from 7.3 percent a month earlier. It was a great report by almost all accounts \u2013 \u201ctidings of comfort and joy,\u201d Reuters\u2019 Felix Salmon called it, in the spirit of the season \u2013 and stocks jumped in response to the headline figure and the strength underlying it.\n\nBefore we get too excited about an unemployment rate as low as 7 percent for the first time in five years, though, let\u2019s take a look at this chart of the labor force participation rate. It tracks the percentage of Americans actively involved in the labor force, and back in 2000, it hit a post-World War II high. Today, it\u2019s near its lowest level since 1978.\n\nYes, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate ticked up from 62.8 percent in October to 63 percent in November, suggesting that the unemployment rate fell because more people found jobs and not because they got discouraged and dropped out of the workforce. And yes, the so-called underemployment rate, which includes those discouraged job seekers and part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs, fell to 13.2 percent from 13.8 percent in October. Those are signs of progress.\n\nRelated: Fast-Food Worker Strikes: Will They Do Any Good?\n\nBut remember back in 2009, when the unemployment rate hit 10 percent? Well, a higher percentage of working-age Americans was in the labor force then than now, even though the nominal unemployment rate is three full percentage points lower. \u201cParticipation in the workforce at a four decade low,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief of Bankrate.com. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your father\u2019s unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nJim Chessen, chief economist for the American Bankers Association, pointed out that if the labor participation rate right now were at the average level for the past 10 years, the unemployment rate would actually be closer to 11 percent.\n\nThe number of people who now have jobs is still 1.8 million people below where it was when the recession officially started in December 2007. At the current pace of job gains, it will be nine more months before that measure returns to pre-recession levels.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington that focuses on low and middle income workers, estimates that there are some 5.7 million Americans \u2013 the majority of them of prime working age \u2013 who are not even looking for work anymore and aren\u2019t counted in the monthly BLS figure.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just low-wage menial workers who are sitting on the sidelines, said Elise Gould, an economist with EPI. \u201cWhen we look at the unemployment rates of various demographic groups, it\u2019s elevated across the board.\u201d\n\nThis represents a huge amount of wasted economic potential, as the productive capacity of millions of potential workers goes unused.\n\nThe stubborn refusal of the labor force participation rate to come out of its downward dive over the past five years may force the Federal Reserve Board to re-think what it considers an acceptable level of unemployment in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe continuing disappointment in labor supply will prompt some soul-searching at the Fed, where the house view has been that the participation rate would bounce back once job creation picked up,\u201d J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a research note today. \u201cOver the past two years the labor market has created almost 4-1/2 million jobs, yet the participation rate has continued to decline. At some point the Fed will have to accept that the labor supply is trending lower, and hence that the decline in the unemployment rate truly represents progress toward their full employment mandate.\u201d\n\nFeroli suggested that it may push the central bank to begin easing back on its quantitative easing program \u2013 the so-called taper \u2013 sooner than it otherwise might if policymakers determine that broad demographic and economic changes have permanently altered the country\u2019s long-term labor participation rate.\n\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter: @rrgarver\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Before we get too excited about an unemployment rate as low as 7 percent for the first time in five years, let\u2019s take a look at some other measures of the job market.", "title": "November\u2019s Great Jobs Report Leaves a Lot to Be Desired", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/06/November-s-Great-Jobs-Report-Leaves-Lot-Be-Desired", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10032012_jobs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/06/November-s-Great-Jobs-Report-Leaves-Lot-Be-Desired", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10032012_jobs_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Before we get too excited about an unemployment rate as low as 7 percent for the first time in five years, let\u2019s take a look at some other measures of the job market.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbedd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOver the past two years the labor market has created almost 4-1/2 million jobs, yet the participation rate has continued to decline.\nBut remember back in 2009, when the unemployment rate hit 10 percent?\nIt tracks the percentage of Americans actively involved in the labor force, and back in 2000, it hit a post-World War II high.\nBefore we get too excited about an unemployment rate as low as 7 percent for the first time in five years, though, let\u2019s take a look at this chart of the labor force participation rate.\nWell, a higher percentage of working-age Americans was in the labor force then than now, even though the nominal unemployment rate is three full percentage points lower."}
