All three that cover the stock have a \u201chold\u201d or equivalent rating on the name.\n\n\u201cThere are reasons to hold the stock,\u201d said National Bank Financial analyst Trevor Johnson, who has a $17 price target. He cites the dividend and exposure to U.S. health care as positive, especially at a time when the economy is expanding and as the aging baby boomer population is likely to rely more heavily on the health care system.\n\nHowever, Mr. Johnson cites \u201cconstraints on growth,\u201d which are the result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Act puts pressure on reimbursement rates for U.S. physicians for programs such as Medicare (for patients 65 and older) and Medicaid (for low-income individuals). It also prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals, which includes MFC. This is meant to prevent doctors from focusing their work on patients at higher-end specialty centres instead of local hospitals where doctors are also needed.\n\nThe company has five physician-owned surgical centres, three in South Dakota and one each in Oklahoma and Arkansas, which focus on orthopedic, ear, nose and throat care, neurosurgery and other specialty surgical procedures.\n\nIn a recent conference call with investors, MFC chief executive Dr. Donald Schellpfeffer said the company is well positioned to grow given that 97 per cent of its revenues come from its surgical centres in U.S. Midwest, which have below-average unemployment rates and strong economic growth.\n\nHe said a combination of a growing population, longer lifespans and more people with access to health insurance will drive increased demand for MFC\u2019s services.\n\nWhile MFC can\u2019t open new centres, it can grow through acquisition, which Dr. Schellpfeffer said company is pursuing. It\u2019s also recruiting more doctors to help expand care at its centres.\n\n\u201cWe believe that increases in the number of physicians holding medical staff privileges and/or ownership interest in our centres are one of the best methods of positively impacting our results,\u201d Dr. Schellpfeffer told investors on Nov. 13, according to a transcript of the third-quarter earnings call.\n\nMFC beat analyst expectations when it reported a 5.5-per-cent increase in quarterly revenues to $77-million (U.S.), compared with the same period last year. Income from operations rose 6.2 per cent to $21.3-million.\n\nRBC Dominion Securities analyst Douglas Miehm increased his target to $19 from $18 after the earnings were released, citing an improved outlook.\n\n\u201cGiven the stable cash flows, cash reserves, and solid organic growth opportunities due to an aging population and higher quality of care rankings relative to its peers, Medical Facilities, in our opinion, remains an attractive alternative for yield-oriented investors,\u201d Mr. Miehm said in a report.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Neil Maruoka has a $17.50 target, citing weaker operating margins in recent quarters which he said in a note \"may be indicative of reimbursement pressures going forward.\"\n\nPaul Gardner, partner and portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, which owns the stock, likes its health care business model and the rich dividend.\n\n\u201cThe desirable piece of this company is its sustainable payout, that it\u2019s defensive in nature and it\u2019s not cyclical,\u201d said Mr. Gardner.\n\nThe stock has pulled back since hitting a 52-week high of $20.77 in April, but Mr. Gardner said his firm is staying put.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t increase our position or decrease it, but we are happy to hold it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice diversified play.\u201d\n\nA previous version of this story contained outdated information from Canaccord Genuity, which was provided in error. Canaccord has a $17.50 target on the stock, not $15.50 as stated in a previous report.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Company sports healthy dividend, but Obamacare could hamper growth of Toronto-based Medical Facilities\u2019 specialty medical centres in United States", "last-modified": "2014-11-25 03:50:51 EST", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Company sports healthy dividend, but Obamacare could hamper growth of Toronto-based Medical Facilities\u2019 specialty medical centres in United States", "title": "A defensive way to play U.S. health care", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/analysts-wary-of-medical-facilities-stock-citing-constraints-on-growth/article21741174/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/353/globe-investor/investment-ideas/article21741173.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/gi-medical-facilities24rb1.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/21741174", "iphone": "tgam://article/21741174"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "description": "Company sports healthy dividend, but Obamacare could hamper growth of Toronto-based Medical Facilities\u2019 specialty medical centres in United States", "card": "app", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Trevor Johnson;National Bank AG;doctors;physicians;health care;surgical centres;specialty centres;healthy dividend;Toronto-based company;medical staff privileges;Medical Facilities Corp.;Obamacare;Dr. Donald Schellpfeffer;Douglas Miehm;Neil Maruoka;Paul Gardner;Health Care;wary;medical centres;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;", "article": {"onpage": 1, "engagement": "true", "comments": "false", "id": 21741174, "type": "column", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "He cites the dividend and exposure to U.S. health care as positive, especially at a time when the economy is expanding and as the aging baby boomer population is likely to rely more heavily on the health care system.\nInvestors looking to play the U.S. health care sector are scoping out TSX-listed Medical Facilities Corp., although analysts say now may not be the best time to buy.\nPaul Gardner, partner and portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, which owns the stock, likes its health care business model and the rich dividend.\n\u201cThe desirable piece of this company is its sustainable payout, that it\u2019s defensive in nature and it\u2019s not cyclical,\u201d said Mr. Gardner.\nThe company has five physician-owned surgical centres, three in South Dakota and one each in Oklahoma and Arkansas, which focus on orthopedic, ear, nose and throat care, neurosurgery and other specialty surgical procedures."}
