John Cornyn, the majority whip, believes the mental health angle is an opportunity for consensus. Other Republicans have signaled similar sentiment, but Cornyn is the most prominent of them. \u201cThis legislation is a product of my frustration with legislation that won\u2019t actually solve any problems,\u201d Cornyn told CQ Roll Call. \u201cIn other words, I look at all of the legislation that gets introduced and I wonder: 'OK, which of these incidents might have been prevented if this legislation had been law?' And there isn\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nCornyn Pushes Mental Health Measures in Wake of Oregon Shooting\n\nAfter the defeat in 2013 of a background check bill in the wake of the 2012 Newtown, Conn., shootings, gun legislation has largely been a non-starter in Congress.\n\nCornyn likens the focus on gun bans and expanded background checks to \u201ca shiny object to distract you from what the real problem is.\u201d In Cornyn\u2019s estimation, the solution lies in \u201chelping people before they become a danger to themselves and to others.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, Cornyn\u2019s legislation would give families the ability to obtain a court order to compel compliance with psychiatric medication and visits, which he says might have helped prevent Newtown.\n\nThe bill would also provide states with incentives to better participate with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. On this, Cornyn points to the 2007 Virginia Tech shooter, who passed background checks despite having been found with mental health issues that were not reported in that system.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Democratic senators introduced a group of principles that include closing background check loopholes, like those online and at gun shows , where buyers can arrange purchases from private individuals (licensed dealers are still subject to federal laws). The 2012 Colorado movie theater shooter utilized such loopholes. On this, Cornyn wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the business of selling firearms, you have to do the background checks,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s only in the case of a person-to-person transfer, friend, neighbor, family member, it\u2019s become sort of an urban myth that this would somehow stop these mass shootings. They don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nStaring down a presidential election cycle in 2016 with the Senate's balance of power at stake and government funding disputes likely to dominate at least the rest of this year, the window to pass legislation like Cornyn's narrows each day.\n\n\u201cWe need to get a hearing,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cThen we need to show [Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.] that there\u2019s bipartisan support. And then I think that he would be inclined to bring it to the floor.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that if Republicans want to focus on mental health, they should urge states under Republican governance to accept the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion, which many have blocked. Cornyn doesn't think that's a solution.\n\n\u201cHe wants to politicize everything, it\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cThe Supreme Court smacked him down on the compulsory Medicaid expansion and so now he\u2019s trying to go another route, to use these tragedies to try to advance his Obamacare agenda. Those are really apples and oranges.\u201d\n\nBoth sides of the debate tout the evidence most in their favor. Proponents of stronger gun control could evoke examples where stronger laws reduced homicides, like in Connecticut or in other countries. Opponents could point to cities like Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Chicago, which have strict gun laws but still suffer from armed violence.\n\nBoth sides are dug in, but Cornyn used a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul bill making its way through the Judiciary Committee as an example of what can happen if people are willing to budge a bit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good model, not for getting everything you want, but for finding a consensus that will actually be bipartisan and actually has some likelihood of getting done,\" Cornyn said.\n\nAsked whether he could tell the victims\u2019 families he's doing everything he can to curb mass shootings, Cornyn said he has met with such families.\n\n\u201cI actually have done that,\u201d Cornyn said, pointing to a 2013 meeting with family members of victims from the Newtown shooting. \u201cWhich is a tough thing to do. They\u2019re grieving. They\u2019re looking for solutions.\"\n\n\"But the response that I got when I talked to them and told them what I would like to try to do and it would actually have helped [the Sandy Hook shooter's] mother \u2014 get him compliant on his medication so he wouldn\u2019t get sicker and sicker and become a danger to himself and others \u2014 they seemed to think that made sense. I\u2019m happy to meet with those folks to try to explain where I think we can make some real progress.\u201d\n\nRelated: White House Offers RX for Mental Health: Obamacare\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
