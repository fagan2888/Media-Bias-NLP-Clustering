I called it \u201cWeird Scenes in the Gold Mine,\u201d a phrase I\u2019d borrowed from the Doors song \u201cThe End.\u201d The beast had begun its feast, Cuisinarting everything it couldn\u2019t digest. But there were still outposts of local musical sensibility. I never got to see the studios in Muscle Shoals or Memphis, but I did make it to Detroit, where the greatest factory of black music was located. This was Motown, the biggest black-owned record label in the sixties, and also the only major black company in entertainment. The label\u2019s founder, Berry Gordy, had plucked a lot of his acts from the city\u2019s housing projects. This gave Motown a rich connection with the doo-wop and girl-group traditions, apparent in the funkiness under its sleek sound. But its presentation of the female body was more conservative than in most black acts\u2014the singers wore gowns, and they were likelier to sway than to shake their booties. These elaborate moves were assembled in one of the many tiny rooms where the Motown sound was made. It was the oddest operation I\u2019d ever come across.\n\nWhen I got out of the cab on Grand Boulevard I thought I was on the wrong street. All I could see was a row of small private houses. But there was a whole finishing school inside, including a choreography room, a costume department (where the Supremes were given their prom-night look), and of course the recording studios, all contained in a series of connected basement spaces. It was warrenlike\u2014there was a rumor that Motown used a hole in the ceiling as an echo chamber. I never got to see that, but during my visit I watched Harvey Fuqua, a veteran producer, work the studio console while the Four Tops recorded a song. I think it was \u201cSeven Rooms of Gloom,\u201d but I may be confusing that title with the cramped feeling of the place. When I recall my visit to Motown I see creaky floors and narrow passageways. It reminded me of the writers\u2019 floor at the Voice.\n\nI figured it was only a matter of time before Motown closed up shop in Detroit and moved to L.A. (It did, in 1972.) All the major labels had offices there, and the city offered state-of-the-art studios. It was where you had to go in order to meet the new crop of producers, who were young, hip, and sometimes part of the band. The most eccentric of them was Brian Wilson, the genius behind the Beach Boys.\n\nThey weren\u2019t exactly darlings of the rock press. Their songs were considered simple-minded and certainly not blues based\u2014hence, not manly enough to be serious rock. But I loved the Beach Boys, even in their earliest incarnation as architects of surf music. To my ears, their car-crazed optimism was the realization of Chuck Berry\u2019s American dream. I don\u2019t think you can beat \u201cFun, fun, fun (till your daddy takes the T-bird away)\u201d when it comes to the poetics of hedonism. This was a fantasy, of course, and a banal one at that. But then Brian Wilson dropped acid and began to create remarkable elegiac songs, with barber-shop harmonies gone psychedelic. I watched the Beach Boys\u2019 evolution with awe.\n\n\u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d their mega-hit of 1966, was as complex as anything the Beatles thought up a year later on Sgt. Pepper. It had a multiple melody and a musical palette that included the first use in rock of the theremin, an electronic instrument whose spooky sound had mainly appeared in horror films. When you play Beach Boys tunes from that era it\u2019s hard to believe that the arrangements weren\u2019t MIDI generated, but of course such programs didn\u2019t exist then. Wilson used the recording technology of the time to maximum effect, but he also played with found sounds. To apply a critical term I didn\u2019t know at the time, he was a rock auteur.\n\nIn the fall of 1967 I wrote a piece for the Times on the Beach Boys\u2019 latest album, Smiley Smile. I was struck by its fragile melodies and their relationship to sacred music; those familiar ride-the-curl voices, now \u201chushed with wonder,\u201d reminded me of the Faur\u00e9 Requiem, but they were utterly American. I was listening to proof of my belief that pop could produce a mass culture that was at once accessible and profound.\n\nI don\u2019t think my editor at the Times bought the Faur\u00e9 comparison, but he agreed to pay my expenses so I could travel west, and I guess Brian Wilson was impressed by my piece, because he invited me to his home in Bel Air. Judith came along, and we stayed at L.A.\u2019s hippest hotel, the Chateau Marmont, with its Spanish-colonial lobby and windows that actually opened. Our room had a view of Laurel Canyon, but if we craned our necks we could see the Sunset Strip. It was quite a contrast\u2014 on one side verdant slopes and on the other a barren avenue with billboards the size of drive-in movie screens. Everything about L.A. seemed incongruous to me, so the interview with Brian fit right in.\n\nHis wife, Marilyn, answered the door. One look at her and I could tell that she was another strong Jewish woman with an introverted artist for a husband. Pointing to a limo sitting on the lawn, she said, wearily, \u201cHe\u2019s hiding.\u201d I\u2019d heard about that car\u2014it had once belonged to John Lennon, and Brian bought it as a totem of the group toward which he felt the most competitive. He was determined to beat the Beatles at their elevated game, so he\u2019d teamed up with Van Dyke Parks, a member of the L.A. pop avant-garde whose style encompassed everything from Stephen Foster to blank verse. To this remarkable range Parks added a wry affection for the Disneyesque. The open harmonies and quirky touches of the Beach Boys brought out the whimsy of his lyrics, as in:\n\nI know that you\u2019ll feel better\n\nWhen you send us in your letter\n\nAnd tell us the name of your . . . favorite vegetable\n\nLittle of what Parks wrote made linear sense, but his lyrics were enchanting, and I championed his solo album, Song Cycle. That was when I realized how far my critical taste could stray from the judgment of the record racks. The album was a flop\u2014even rock had its limits when it came to free-form obscurity.\n\nParks never got very far as a songwriter, but he did co-author the most legendary sixties record that never was. This was Smile, Brian Wilson\u2019s uncompleted \u201cteenage symphony to God.\u201d A reconstructed version was released in 2011, but it\u2019s not the original and I can only imagine what that work would have been like if he had ever finished it. But he blew deadline after deadline, and the final product, Smiley Smile, was a truncated version of what he intended. The most ambitious piece\u2014a suite based on the four elements: earth, wind, fire, and water\u2014 was missing. Later I would hear that Brian had destroyed the master tapes. A fire had broken out not far from the recording studio, and he became convinced that the music would cause things to burst into flame. This was the story that made the rounds, but it seems that he didn\u2019t actually trash the masters; he only said he had, perhaps to avoid admitting that he was uneasy about the work. At the time I accepted his original explanation, because it sounded like something he was capable of.\n\nBrian\u2019s emotional state, which was fragile to begin with, had deteriorated under the pressure from his record label. It must have seemed to him that he would never again be able to produce a hit. I didn\u2019t know anything about that when we met; he kept the details hidden from me. But his instability was evident, and, I think, directly related to his audacity as a producer. He was capable of creating moment of sheer tonal whimsey, pellucid choral interludes (\u201cWind Chimes\u201d), and cartoony riffs as twisted as the stuff in comix. (Give \u201cFall Breaks and Back to Winter,\u201d aka \u201cW. Woodpecker Symphony\u201d a listen and you\u2019ll hear the origins of Animal Collective.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was a young critic. He was a young rock auteur.
