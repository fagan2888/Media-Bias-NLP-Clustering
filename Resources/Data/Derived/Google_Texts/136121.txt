ROCKFORD (WIFR) -- Hundreds of high school students from Rockford's public schools have been spending their Saturdays at school. They're preparing for the ACT test which can help them get into college and help them qualify for scholarships.

More than 300 students show up each weekend to refresh their memories on some of the topics they may have forgotten about that will be on the test. Last year students who took the course increased their scores by almost four points. The top score for the act is 36.

"As their score improves their scholarships improve. That's less burden on the families, less burden on them long term, but more importantly I don't know who's the next Mr. Sundstrand or the next Mr. Woodward who's in this group that we are going to encourage that we are going to take this encouragement, go on and make a better life for themselves and maybe come back home and create employment and give back to their hometown," Sunil Puri, who funds the course, said.

Students who attend four weeks of the course get a $50 gift card.
