PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 Nelson Cruz put on quite a show on Sunday.\n\nCruz hit his second homer of the game in the 11th inning and drove in seven runs, and the AL East-leading Baltimore Orioles avoided a three-game sweep by beating the Tampa Bay Rays 7-5 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cNelson has been spoiling us at a high level all year as a teammate and a player,\u201d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.\n\nAfter Nick Hundley drew a one-walk in the 11th, Cruz drove the next pitch from Cesar Ramos (2-6) over the wall in center for his 39th homer. Cruz has 101 RBI this season.\n\nBaltimore trailed 4-2 before Cruz\u2019s bases-loaded triple against Joel Peralta in the ninth. Tampa Bay tied it at 5 in the bottom half on pinch-hitter Sean Rodriguez\u2019s run-scoring grounder off closer Zach Britton.\n\nBrad Brach (6-1) worked a scoreless 10th before Andrew Miller got three outs for his first save.\n\nBaltimore increased its margin in the division to 9 1/2 games over the New York Yankees, who lost 2-0 to Kansas City.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pretty victory but we got it done and that\u2019s the important thing,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to think about the standings too much but we are in pretty good shape and we just have to remain focused.\u201d\n\nEvan Longoria, James Loney, David DeJesus and Kevin Kiermaier homered for the Rays. Tampa Bay had gone deep three times in its previous 15 games.\n\nThe Rays went 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position.\n\nOrioles outfielders Adam Jones and Nick Markakis were out of the starting lineup, receiving a break from the artificial turf at Tropicana Field. Shortstop J.J. Hardy missed his second consecutive game due to back spasms.\n\nJones had a pinch-hit single in the ninth.\n\nLongoria and Loney hit consecutive homers off Bud Norris in the first. Longoria has 39 RBIs in 47 games since the All-Star break.\n\nDeJesus made it 3-0 with his fourth career inside-the park homer during the fourth. Left fielder Alejandro De Aza had the ball knocked out of his glove when center fielder David Lough ran into his teammate\u2019s arm. The ball ended up around the foul line, which allowed DeJesus to easily reach home.\n\nNorris gave four runs and eight hits in six innings.\n\nCruz\u2019s two-run shot off Jeremy Hellickson made it 3-2 in the sixth. Hellickson allowed two runs and four hits over 5 1-3 innings.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like a lot of our losses came like this,\u201d Hellickson said.\n\nTampa Bay has lost 14 of 22 since reaching .500 after dropping 18 games under the break-even mark.\n\nThe Rays went ahead 4-2 on Kiermaier\u2019s sixth-inning homer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Nick Hundley drew a one-walk in the 11th, Cruz drove the next pitch from Cesar Ramos (2-6) over the wall in center for his 39th homer.
