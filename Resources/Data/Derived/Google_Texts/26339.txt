Tennova Healthcare in Eastern Tennessee has added four West Tennessee hospitals to its organization to become one of the largest healthcare systems in the state, the healthcare provider announced Monday.

Tennova, with seven hospitals in the eastern region, added four to the west, for a current 11 hospitals and 80 physician clinics.

Financial details were not disclosed.

The four hospitals are already under Tennova's parent company, Community Health Systems. They are Dyersburg Regional Medical Center, Regional Hospital of Jackson, Volunteer Community Hospital and McNairy Regional Hospital.

No changes have been announced at those facilities but consumers can expect to see an advertising campaign featuring NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, the former University of Tennessee football standout who serves as the brand spokesman, according to Tennova.

Hospitals already in the network include Jefferson Memorial Hospital, LaFollette Medical Center, Lakeway Regional Hospital, Newport Medical Center, North Knoxville Medical Center, Physicians Regional Medical Center and Turkey Creek Medical Center. All network facilities are affiliated with Community Health Systems.

"It's an important day for Tennova as we become a statewide network and one of the biggest health systems in the state," said Neil Heatherly, chief executive officer of Physicians Regional Medical Center, who oversees Tennova's East Tennessee market.
