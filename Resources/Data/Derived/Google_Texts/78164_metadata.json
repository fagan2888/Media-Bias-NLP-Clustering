His legislation has already had an impressive impact on California public policy, ranging from public safety, health, education, energy, technology, environmental quality, consumer protection and voting.\n\n\u201cIt has been an honor and a privilege to serve my constituents and our state. I look forward to this final year being no less productive,\u201d said Senator Padilla.\n\nPadilla was first elected to the Senate in 2006 to represent the 20th District in Los Angeles County. Since that time, he has won legislative approval for 93 bills, 80 of which were signed into law.\n\nSenator Padilla\u2019s bills that took effect January 1, 2014 includes:\n\nSB 135 \u2013 Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) System. This new law requires the development of a comprehensive statewide earthquake early warning system in California. A fully developed system would process data from an array of sensors throughout the state, detect the strength and the progression of an earthquake and provide up to 60 seconds advanced warning before potentially damaging ground shaking is felt.\n\nSB 362 \u2013 Disaster Responder Voting. This new law protects the voting rights of emergency workers who are participating in disaster relief efforts outside of California by setting-up an alternative means to obtain a ballot and cast their vote in an election.\n\nSB 360 \u2013 Publicly Owned Voting Machines. This new law allows counties to develop, own and operate public voting systems, subject to approval and certification by the California Secretary of State.\n\nSB 380 \u2013 Telecommunication Service Interruption. This new law prohibits the arbitrary shutdown of wireless communication services without a court order. For decades, California law has required a court order to interrupt or shutdown traditional telephone service. The bill was in response to the Bay Area Rapid Transit Agency (BART) shutdown of mobile services for three hours during public protests in August 2011.\n\nSB 330 \u2013 Mental Health for K-12. This new law improves the educational framework for teaching California K-12 public school students about mental health issues to ensure that they receive instruction to raise both awareness and understanding by requiring the California State Board of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission to develop a distinct category on mental health instruction.\n\nSB 435 \u2013 Piece-Rate Workers. This new law ensures that piece rate workers are paid for their rest periods and encourages them to take rest periods when exposed to extreme heat.\n\nSB 740 \u2013 CA Advanced Services Fund. This new law modifies the eligibility requirements and funding for the California Advanced Services Fund (CASF) to support broadband infrastructure in the most remote areas of the state that lack high-speed Internet access.\n\nSB 440 \u2013 Community College Transfers. This new law requires that the California Community Colleges and the California State University develop a strategic plan for full implementation of the Student Transfer Achievement Reform (STAR) Act of 2010 and create Associate Degrees for Transfer in every major by 2014-15 and in each areas of emphasis by 2016-17.\n\nSB 191 \u2013 Pediatric Trauma Care. This new law authorizes counties to continue to collect funds for local emergency medical services, including pediatric trauma care, at no cost to the general fund.\n\nSB 311 \u2013 Voter Participation. This new law requires that proposals to create, change, repeal or amend a city or county charter be submitted to its voters during a statewide general election.\n\nSB 5 \u2013 Teacher Pipeline. This new law provides aspiring teachers the necessary time to develop the skills to effectively meet state expectations and requirements by allowing graduate level teacher preparation programs to expand from 1 to 2 years.\n\nSCR 54\u2013Government Access to Customer Information. This Senate Concurrent Resolution directs the California Law Revision Commission to examine California law and recommend needed reforms as it relates to government access to customer information from communications service providers.\n\nLegislative Highlights from Senator Padilla\u2019s career:\n\nSB 1298 \u2013 Autonomous Vehicles. This 2012 bill requires the establishment of safety and performance standards for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles on California\u2019s roads and highways. Audi, BMW, Ford, Volvo, and Volkswagen are all actively working on autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nSB 26 \u2013 Cell Phones in Prison. This 2011 bill cracks down on the smuggling and possession of cell phones and other wireless communication devices in California prisons by imposing tough penalties for both smugglers and inmates. Cell phones in prison have been linked to murders, threats and intimidation of witnesses and victims, the coordination of gang activity and drug trafficking, planned escapes, and attacks on prison guards.\n\nSB 1420 \u2013 Nutritional Information on Menus and Menu Boards. This 2008 bill requires nutritional information to be displayed by restaurants on menus and menu boards. California was first state in the nation to require this information and it later became national policy as part of the preventative healthcare section of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSB 1440 \u2013 Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act. This 2010 bill requires the California Community Colleges and the California State University to streamline the transfer process for community college students by creating two-year Associate in Arts (AA-T) and Associate in Science degrees (AS-T) for transfer with priority admission to the CSU system with junior status.\n\nSB 332 \u2013 Smoke-Free Housing. This 2011 bill enacted a landmark anti-smoking law which for the first time explicitly allows landlords to establish smoke free units in multi-family rental housing.\n\nSB 35 \u2013 Voter Registration. This 2012 bill brings California into full compliance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), commonly known as Motor Voter, by requiring Covered California and hundreds of state agencies to register voters. Motor Voter requires state governments to expand the public\u2019s access to voter registration when renewing a driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration or applying for social services.\n\nSB 559 \u2013 Civil Rights. This 2011 bill protects Californians by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of genetic information in the areas of housing, employment, education, public accommodations, health insurance coverage, life insurance coverage, mortgage lending, and elections. As more and more Californians gain access to their personal genomic information, there is an increased potential for the misuse of genetic information to discriminate.\n\nSB 1525 \u2013 College Student Athlete Bill of Rights. This 2012 bill implements the first in the nation Student-Athlete Bill of Rights in order to improve graduation rates of student-athletes by requiring California universities which make over ten million in athletics media revenue provide student-athletes who are injured, equivalent academic scholarships, pay the health care premiums and cover all insurance deductibles.\n\nSB 71 \u2013 Green Manufacturing Tax Incentives. This 2010 bill exempts green manufacturers from paying sales and use taxes on manufacturing equipment to encourage investment in manufacturing, job creation and economic growth in California. California was one of only three states in the nation that did not provide a sales tax exemption or tax credit for the purchase of green manufacturing equipment.\n\nSB 1193 \u2013 Broadband Deployment. This 2008 bill implements the California Advanced Services Fund by allocating $100 million to build broadband infrastructure in un-served and underserved areas of California.\n\nSB 753 \u2013 English Learner Reform. This 2011 bill reforms how California\u2019s 1.5 million English Learner students are evaluated in school by moving the California English Language Development Test (CELDT) from the beginning of the year to later in the school year like most other testing.\n\nSB 624 \u2013 Illegal Sales of Tobacco to Minors. This 2007 bill allows local law enforcement to enforce the STAKE Act (Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act) by conducting compliance checks of tobacco retailers. Prior to Padilla\u2019s bill, only the State Department of Health Services was allowed to conduct compliance checks.\n\nSB 408 \u2013 Body Armor. This 2010 bill prohibits violent felons from purchasing, owning or possessing body armor. The bill was needed because of many deadly encounters between law enforcement and felons wearing body armor, including one of the most infamous, a North Hollywood shootout in 1997 where two bank robbers wearing body armor were able to engage 350 Los Angeles Police Department officers for an hour-long shoot out. Shots fired by officers literally bounced off the bank robbers\u2019 body armor.\n\nSB 1770 \u2013 Anti-reproductive rights crimes. This 2008 bill requires the Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (POST) to prepare guidelines establishing standard procedures for law enforcement agencies in the investigation and reporting of cases involving anti-reproductive-rights crimes.\n\nSB 729 \u2013 Vehicle Trade-In Consumer Protection. This 2007 bill creates a restitution program that compensates consumers who suffer financial loss in a vehicle trade-in transaction when purchasing a car from a car dealer that becomes insolvent. It is modeled after the successful travel agency restitution program.\n\nFor a complete list of Senator Padilla\u2019s legislative accomplishments click-on link: http://sd20.senate.ca.gov/legislation\n\nSenator Alex Padilla, 40, graduated from MIT with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.
