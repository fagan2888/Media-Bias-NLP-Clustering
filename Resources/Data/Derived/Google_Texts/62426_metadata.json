Juliet Mayor Ed Hagerty and Commissioner Ray Justice walk through Tuscan Gardens, a residential development under construction near Mt. Juliet High School. Mt. Juliet growth is exploding and the city is struggling to control it. Some leaders say they have done a better job than Franklin, but others worry it's out of control. A moratorium on growth failed, but the discussion continues on how fast the city should grow. Monday July 28, 2014, in Mt. Juliet, TN. (Photo: Larry McCormack / THE TENNESSEAN)Buy Photo\n\nAt a recent city commission meeting, Mt. Juliet Mayor Ed Hagerty recalled driving seven miles to buy a gallon of milk in the 1980s.\n\nThe city had very few conveniences. Only 2,879 people lived there.\n\n\u201cI always made sure I stopped before I got home from work so I didn\u2019t have to go back out,\u201d said Carol Kaelin, a resident of Mt. Juliet since 1974.\n\nRELATED:Mt. Juliet tries to lure large-scale employers\n\nThose days are long gone with Mt. Juliet ranked among the top five fastest-growing cities in Tennessee for 12 straight years. In 2010 Mt. Juliet\u2019s population was 24,548 \u2014 up from 12,366 in 2000.\n\nAn array of commercial options followed the rooftops. Retail, restaurant and entertainment options abound, and residents no longer have to travel to Nashville to shop or find something to do.\n\nBut there are growing pains that have some concerned about how to manage Mt. Juliet\u2019s future as the city remains a mark for developers and builders.\n\n\u201cI am nervous,\u201d Commissioner Ray Justice said. \u201cGrowth is a great thing, but it\u2019s the rate, the pace, and all those kind of things I want to look at. We\u2019ve been blessed, but we have to be consistent.\u201d\n\nJustice recently sponsored a resolution for a moratorium on development. He withdrew the resolution in order to study different aspects of growth, but the reaction on both sides was strong.\n\nRELATED:Mt. Juliet growth and development ban stalls\n\nMt. Juliet West Wilson Chamber of Commerce Director Mark Hinesley stated even a hint of a moratorium could be detrimental to the city\u2019s momentum and fellow commissioners seemed unwilling to go that far, though it never reached a vote.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing incredibly well,\u201d Hagerty said, pointing to Mt. Juliet\u2019s consistent high rankings in family-friendly, business-friendly and safety rankings as it\u2019s grown. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure we\u2019ve had good quality growth and the proof is in the pudding. People are coming in droves.\u201d\n\nBut residents understood why Justice raised the issue.\n\n\u201cTraffic is the main concern,\u201d said resident Mary Rehovsky. \u201cAnd the more people you have move into the area, the more traffic you create.\u201d\n\nProvidence\n\nMt. Juliet\u2019s growth centers around Providence and Providence Marketplace just off Interstate 40 built in 2006.\n\nJoe Tomlinson, 61, remembers hunting on the property before it was transformed into a sprawling retail and commercial development.\n\nIt now has 1,800 of the 2,041 approved single-family homes finished and an outdoor mall with more than 50 retailers, 18 restaurants and a 14-screen movie theater. The residential portion of Providence includes 790 multi-family units that have been approved, but not all of them have been built.\n\n\u201cWe could have never stayed Mayberry or it would have died,\u201d Tomlinson said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve done pretty well, but I don\u2019t think they recognized the growth being as quick around Providence.\u201d\n\nThe growth has spread around Providence, mostly on the south end of the city with the Paddocks of Mt. Juliet shopping center just north of I-40. It includes a Walmart superstore with a Lowe\u2019s, Academy Sports & Outdoors and a number of restaurants through the strip.\n\n\u201cMt. Juliet is extremely fortunate because retailers want to be there,\u201d said Jeff Browning of Browning Solutions which has been involved in multiple developments in Mt. Juliet. \u201cIf there was a glaring hole (in the Nashville market) it was on the east side, which led to Providence. It has the demographics, the income level and as long as residential growth continues, (developers) will look there.\u201d\n\nThe apartment debate\n\nThe city has just over 1,200 apartment units, but the amount either under construction or approved would about double that total, with another complex proposing 384 units pending approval.\n\nHagerty maintains the city has been vigilant in demanding high standards on multi-family housing. Residents who support growth say that will attract young professionals not ready to buy a house who want to live in the suburbs and are missing from Mt. Juliet\u2019s demographics.\n\nOhio-based Lifestyle Communities is one 451-unit multi-family development planned behind Jonathan\u2019s Grille near Providence that will include amenities such as a restaurant and programs designed to create a community atmosphere.\n\nDevelopers R. Dudley Smith and Frank Horton of CPS Land recently closed on 18 acres to build a 209-unit apartment complex called Creekside at Providence that will be part of a mixed use development dubbed Providence Central.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thought in Nashville, Tennessee, that many people would prefer not to have a car, but people think differently today,\u201d Smith said. \u201cDo you run from growth, or do you embrace growth?\u2019 that\u2019s the question Mt. Juliet has.\n\nBut the multi-family projects will strain already problematic traffic near Providence and on the county school system, opponents say,\n\n\u201cMy constituents are saying no more,\u201d said Commissioner Jim Bradshaw, who represents the Providence area where the bulk of new apartment complexes are coming.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, yes, you\u2019re hearing these are on the top end. But if more are built and it becomes saturated, is it going to drop the price down? I keep hearing these references to Antioch and telling me \u2018don\u2019t go like Antioch and Hickory Hollow.\u2019 \u201d\n\nReach Andy Humbles at 615-726-5939 and on Twitter @AndyHumbles.\n\nWhat could be in Mt. Juliet\u2019s future\n\nFedEx and Under Armour: The delivery giant and sport apparel company are apparently both interested in separate properties along I-40 for industrial-type operations, which could bring a large number of new jobs to the city.\n\nBel Air Providence: A massive mixed-use development proposed for about 500 acres in Mt. Juliet and Lebanon along I-40 near Beckwith Road with plans for multi-family and single-family homes and several million square feet of office and retail space. Initial clearing work began in 2012, but stopped abruptly because of a dispute between the cities and Water & Wastewater Authority of Wilson County over who would provide sewer service. Lebanon recently reached an agreement with the Wastewater Authority over service area, and Mt. Juliet believes one is close.\n\nProvidence Central: A mixed-use development on 275 acres on the west side of Mt. Juliet Road across from Providence planned for more than 1.5 million square feet of office space with buildings three to six stories that would add white collar jobs important to spending. The project is also approved for around 300,000 square feet of commercial space, with a combination of single family, townhomes and apartments up to 1,000 units.\n\nLebanon: Mt. Juliet\u2019s eastern neighbor is moving forward on a final design for a new road the city has approved to build along Interstate 40 between Highway 109 and Beckwith Road on the south side of I-40.\n\nThe new thoroughfare could essentially extend Providence Marketplace and provide store frontage visible from I-40, as well as spread retail options over multiple exits similar to Cool Springs in Williamson County.\n\nCentral Pike interchange: City officials hope to convince the Tennessee Department of Transportation to partner on a new interchange off I-40 to relieve congestion off Mt. Juliet Road around Providence.\n\nImpact fee: Mt. Juliet\u2019s public works staff will conduct a study on anticipated costs related to growth and whether to recommend the city commission consider a comprehensive impact fee on all new construction.\n\nMt.
