The dramedy, based on Piper Kerman\u2019s memoir, will compete for Emmy notice in the comedy category but beautifully stradles that line.\n\nNo spoilers ahead, I promise.\n\nJust know that Season 2 of \u201cOITNB,\u201d which drops Friday on Netflix, is indeed a darker, more probing exploration of incarcerated women, the prison system and society than the first season.\n\nCreator Jenji Kohan (\u201cWeeds\u201d) nails the angst by delving deeper into the backstories of numerous characters, effectively laying out more storytelling track. Flashbacks can be a weak crutch in some TV efforts but here the added details and motivations enrich. She\u2019s not only extended the route but enlarged the train, adding characters and increasing our understanding of circumstances and social structures.\n\nIf Season 1 dealt with the shock of a sheltered, white, upper-middle-class woman entering the system, Season 2 continues that journey and further examines the power politics of groups. It doesn\u2019t spoil anything to note the season opens with a guest appearance by Laura Prepon as Alex Vause.\n\nJudging by the first six episodes, this round is just as addicting as the first, the ensemble rising to the occasion of topping their first outting.\n\nSuffice to say the sex is more graphic, the language coarser, the craziness more sociopathic. And that\u2019s after the bloody finale to the initial season that introduced Piper\u2019s (Taylor Schilling) first months in prison.\n\nKohan has found clever ways to take the characters outside their confinement \u2014 either into the pre-prison past, particularly in the case of Suzanne \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d Warren (Uzo Aduba) or in the present, with Lorna Morello (Yael Stone), the Boston-accented van driver, on a mission.\n\nSeason 2 newcomer Yvonne \u201cVee\u201d Parker (played by Lorraine Toussaint) is a strong addition, upsetting the balance of power and giving Red (Kate Mulgrew) a once and future rival.\n\nLast year\u2019s surprise hit is now established for a longer run. Here comes another binging pleasure. Clear the weekend.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d season 2 goes darker, deeper", "title": "Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d season 2 goes darker, deeper", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/02/netflixs-orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-goes-darker-deeper/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140602__AE02TVOITNB-1p1.jpg", "height": 524}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140602__AE02TVOITNB-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-02T12:46:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:30:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Let\u2019s be clear: women\u2019s prison isn\u2019t a sorority and the abundant humor of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d should not mask the pain that led the inmates to their current situation.\nJust know that Season 2 of \u201cOITNB,\u201d which drops Friday on Netflix, is indeed a darker, more probing exploration of incarcerated women, the prison system and society than the first season.\nIf Season 1 dealt with the shock of a sheltered, white, upper-middle-class woman entering the system, Season 2 continues that journey and further examines the power politics of groups.\nAnd that\u2019s after the bloody finale to the initial season that introduced Piper\u2019s (Taylor Schilling) first months in prison.\nIt doesn\u2019t spoil anything to note the season opens with a guest appearance by Laura Prepon as Alex Vause."}
