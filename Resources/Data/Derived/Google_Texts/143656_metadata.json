He now says, \u201cI am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\u201d\n\nSenator Ron Wyden (D-OR) once asked Director of Intelligence James Clapper, \u201cDoes the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u201d Clapper replied \u201cNo.\u201d He now says, \u201cI responded in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful manner\u2026\u201d\n\nGovernment lies. It is incompetent and inefficient. It cheats. It destroys. It deceives. Conservatives know this. Our entire philosophy is dedicated to that knowledge.\n\nThe rollout of the Affordable Care Act has taught millions this lesson in spectacular fashion. Americans have seen their plans dropped and premiums doubled or tripled. Healthcare.gov is a joke. The President\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted. The Washington Post\u2019s Marc Thiessen says it\u2019s about to get worse: \u201c5.5 million. That is how many people the administration needs to sign up in just 23 days because Obamacare drove them out of their health-care plans. That\u2019s some 240,000 sign-ups every single day, just to break even.\u201d\n\nThe revelation in June that the National Security Agency was collecting the phone data of every American outraged millions. Recently we learned that the Guardian newspaper, responsible for publishing Snowden\u2019s leaks, claims to have only released 1 percent of the information he gave them. The original leak about NSA collecting phone metadata was only the starting point in painting a picture of an agency completely unbound in its surveillance power.\n\nOn Sunday, we learned that NSA officials are so worried about what Snowden might yet reveal, there is talk of amnesty in exchange for him returning his documents.\n\nAs with Obamacare, the more we have learned about the NSA\u2019s activities, the worse it gets. Both the ACA and NSA have quickly become exemplary models of how abhorrently the government mismanages its commitments.\n\nPerhaps no one is more fed up than young Americans. A Harvard poll released this month showed that among millennials, 57 percent disapproved of Obamacare. National Journal also reported: \u201cIn addition to health care, domestic spying is an issue that puts Obama on the wrong side of the rising generation \u2026 strong majorities of 18-to-29-year-olds oppose the government collecting information from social networks, Web-browsing histories, email, GPS locations, telephone calls, and text messages\u2026\u201d\n\nAdded National Journal: \u201cA majority of Americans under age 25 \u2014 the youngest millennials \u2014 would favor throwing Obama out of office.\u201d\n\nObamacare is not the same thing as national security. We do not have to have government healthcare but we certainly do need intelligence and spying for security purposes. Still, it is not an accident that the Obamacare mess is mirrored by an out-of-control NSA. Both are massive government bureaucracies and behave as such. Both abuse their power and the people they allegedly serve.\n\nAmericans deserve to know the truth about the damage caused by the ACA and NSA. With Obamacare, we continue to see this monstrosity before us, with each passing, painful day.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jack Hunter", "description": "Knowing is half the battle", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "\u201cIf you like your plan you can keep it,\u201d President Obama once said.
