While rate increases for the majority of Illinois counties will range from 5 percent to 10 percent for the cheapest silver plan and 15 percent to 20 percent for the second-cheapest silver plan, Cook County is the only one of the state\u2019s 13 \u201cRating Areas\u201d in which rates will drop next year \u2014 by an average of 8 percent.\n\nMore from the Chicago Tribune:\n\nAcross Illinois, 2016\u2019s second-cheapest silver plan is rising an average of 6.1 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Health insurance policies sold on the federal exchange are arrayed in bronze, silver, gold and platinum categories, with silver considered the mid-range plan. Illinois\u2019 price hike on the silver plan compares favorably against a block of other states. Across all 37 states that rely on the federal exchange as the enrollment system for people who buy health plans under the Affordable Care Act, the cost of the second lowest-cost silver plan will increase on average 7.5 percent next year.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note price decreases in Chicago are helping to keep the statewide average increase low. Residents in each county will have a minimum of 37 plan offerings from 10 different insurers to choose from in the individual market place.\n\nHere are some highlights from the Illinois Department of Insurance\u2019s analysis of 2016 health insurance plans and rates:\n\nOverall average increase in lowest cost plans\n\nLowest silver plan average increase is 5.3 percent\n\nLowest bronze plan average increase is 11.3 percent\n\nRate changes vary\n\nRate changes in lowest silver plan range from -8 to 28 percent\n\nRate changes in lowest bronze plan range from -4 to 39 percent\n\nRate changes in lowest gold plan range from 3 to 34 percent\n\nCompetition generates lower rate increases\n\nRate increases in the lowest plan tend to be lower when there is a new issuer in that spot, or where an existing carrier has expanded their service area.\n\nMajority of areas show increase in choices over 2015\n\nNumber of plans increase to 480 in 2016 from 410 in 2015 (includes multi-state plans) 290 individual plans and 190 small group plans\n\nThree new issuers on the Individual Marketplace for a total of 10 Aetna, Celtic, Harkin\n\nCounties with a decrease in the number of issuers include: Adams, Logan, Mason, Menard, Morgan, Pike and Sangamon\n\nNumber of issuers in down-state counties did not change\n\nAll platinum plans in the Individual Marketplace were terminated\n\nThe third open enrollment season begins Nov. 8, 2015 and ends Jan. 31, 2016. According to the Tribune, roughly 350,000 Illinoisans enrolled in Obamacare plans through the federal exchange at the end of the second enrollment season.\n\nMore from the Tribune:\n\nThe premium increases in Illinois and nationally do not account for income-based tax credits that reduce costs for some people. About 8 in 10 who bought an exchange-based plan this year qualified for financial assistance, HHS said.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Insurance\u2019s full analysis of 2016 rates and plans can be found below.\n\nIllinois Rate and Plan Analysis\n\n[RECOMMENDED]", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 RebootIllinois.com 2016.
