An Eagle Butte man facing federal charges stemming from a shootout and standoff that occurred in late October has been indicted in Hughes County on two counts of attempted first-degree murder.



27-year-old Jason Todd Garreau made his initial court appearance Monday.



Authorities say Garreau held officers at bay for nine hours Oct. 31 at a Pierre trailer home. Gunfire was exchanged and two Pierre police officers were hurt.



A federal grand jury has already indicted Garreau with 19 felony counts related to the standoff and an Oct. 30 Hyde County shootout with law enforcement officers in which a 24-year-old Dupree man was killed.



Hughes County State's Attorney Wendy Kloeppner says she has been working with federal authorities on the case.



Garreau is being held without bond.
