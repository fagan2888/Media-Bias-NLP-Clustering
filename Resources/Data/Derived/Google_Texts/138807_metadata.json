A realignment of post-apartheid politics, long predicted but always delayed, now seems plausible as the ANC faces the prospect of splits within and erosion from without. The process is being hastened by the faltering president, Jacob Zuma, who is threatened with yet another round of scrutiny over allegations of corruption going back to an arms deal in 1997.\n\nWith the economy stalled, the ANC is being squeezed on the populist left and the liberal right. To the left, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), founded last year by Julius Malema, a firebrand who used to head the ANC\u2019s Youth League, is gaining ground after winning 6% of the votes in a general election in May; its 25 members of parliament, often clad in red overalls and berets intended to signify their solidarity with workers, seem to hog the headlines. The EFF appeals, too, to young middle-class nationalists fed up with the ANC. Splinter groups in South Africa have often risen and then faded. But Frans Cronje, who runs the South African Institute of Race Relations, a think-tank, says: \u201cThere\u2019s huge sympathy for the EFF within the ANC.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), the country\u2019s biggest labour union, which told its voters to dump the ANC at the last election, may set up its own party of the left, which could emerge as the labour arm of the EFF, though so far its leaders have derided such an idea. The umbrella Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), led by Zwelinzima Vavi, who is another thorn in the side of the ANC, is split down the middle, weakening the so-called \u201ctripartite alliance\u201d\u2014the ANC, the unions and the South African Communist Party (SACP)\u2014which has run the country since 1994. Mr Malema, Mr Vavi and NUMSA\u2019s Irvin Jim would pose a tough opposition on the left, should they join forces.\n\nMeanwhile the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition, led by a white woman, Helen Zille, rose to 22% from 17% at the last election and is eyeing the no longer outlandish prospect of winning several of the country\u2019s biggest cities, or at least running them in coalition, when their councils are next elected in 2016. They include Johannesburg, Pretoria and the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, which embraces Port Elizabeth. The DA already runs Cape Town and most of the municipalities in the Western Cape, the second richest of the country\u2019s nine provinces. In the general election in May the ANC vote tumbled to 55% in Gauteng, the wealthiest province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria.\n\nMr Malema rubbishes the DA as \u201cracist\u201d. But in a future parliament and in various municipalities the EFF and the DA could undermine the ANC in a twin assault, whether or not in a tactical alliance. The DA is now backed by most Coloureds (people of mixed race) and South Africans of Indian descent, as well as most whites. Though it reckons it got 750,000 black votes at the last election and has black leaders in several provinces, it is still viewed by many blacks as \u201ctoo white\u201d.\n\nIn any event, the ANC is in a bind. If it tacks to the left, to fend off trade-union militancy and the populism of the EFF, which wants to nationalise mines, banks and white-owned farms, the ANC will lose more of its support among the growing black middle class. But if it sticks to a more market-friendly path, albeit with rampant corruption and patronage causing increasing outrage across the board, it will continue to lose the backing of the urban poor.\n\nBoth Mr Malema and Mr Zuma face legal entanglements. Earlier this month Mr Malema\u2019s trial on charges of fraud and racketeering, among other things, was postponed until next August on the peculiar ground that not all the lawyers involved in the case were available. The ANC would love to see Mr Malema behind bars, deeming the EFF to be a one-man show.\n\nBut Mr Zuma, who looks haggard, may be more immediately embarrassed by fresh legal tangles, thanks to South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times, if allegations by a lawyer called Ajay Sooklal are taken up by the authorities. Described as a \u201cfixer\u201d for Thales, a multinational French electronics and arms firm, Mr Sooklal has revived old allegations of bribery against him.\n\nMr Zuma, aged 72, denies them all\u2014and may well again fend them off before his constitutionally limited term ends in 2019. But there is renewed talk of an early presidential succession. If so, Cyril Ramaphosa, a former miners\u2019 leader who is one of the country\u2019s greatest magnates, would take the job, at least temporarily, since he is the deputy president. He would seek to lead South Africa on a constitutional and free-market road. But in a fresh election he might fail to win the ANC\u2019s nomination, as he lacks a base within the party and is reviled on the left.\n\nMr Zuma would prefer a successor who could be relied on to back him in his retirement. One of his former wives, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former foreign minister now chairing the African Union\u2019s commission in Ethiopia, is often mentioned. It would be nice, from Mr Zuma\u2019s point of view, to keep things more or less in the family. But that could make it harder still to restore the good name of the ANC.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20141018_MAP005_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "South African politics", "description": "The multiple threats facing the ruling party", "pubdate": 20141018, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "The multiple threats facing the ruling party", "title": "Shaking the kaleidoscope", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21625873-multiple-threats-facing-ruling-party-shaking-kaleidoscope", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141018_MAP005_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "The multiple threats facing the ruling party", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-18 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141018_MAP005_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141018_MAP005_0.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Middle East and Africa", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20141018_MAP005_0.jpg", "articleid": 21625873, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20141018_MAP005_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "South African politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-10-18 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "South African politics"}, "article_summary": "Mr Malema, Mr Vavi and NUMSA\u2019s Irvin Jim would pose a tough opposition on the left, should they join forces.\nBoth Mr Malema and Mr Zuma face legal entanglements.\nMr Zuma would prefer a successor who could be relied on to back him in his retirement.\nMr Zuma, aged 72, denies them all\u2014and may well again fend them off before his constitutionally limited term ends in 2019.\nThe ANC would love to see Mr Malema behind bars, deeming the EFF to be a one-man show."}
