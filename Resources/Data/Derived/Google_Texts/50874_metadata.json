But now, in the name of religion, some people want to add an asterisk.\n\nIn the next few weeks, the Supreme Court of the United States will rule on two cases taken up this term: Hobby Lobby vs. Sibelius and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. vs. Sibelius. Both claim to be about the freedom to practice one\u2019s own religion without interference by the government, but both are actually about whether or not broad exemptions to disregard antidiscrimination laws should be granted to people\u2014and corporations\u2014who oppose them on religious grounds.\n\nMost embarrassing of all is the specter of people asking in the name of religion for permission to discriminate. This flies in the face of what every world religion claims in their own version of the Golden Rule: \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d Such a \u201cgolden rule\u201d is the great common teaching among all religions, an understanding shared with non-religious people, atheists, humanists and most civilized societies. Why would some religious people want an exemption from following a core teaching of their religion?\n\nOstensibly, the devoutly religious owners of the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores (no one is disputing the Greens\u2019 sincerity or devotion) do not want to fund the contraception coverage offered in the Affordable Care Act because they consider certain types of birth control to be abortificients. This is in the face of the medical community\u2019s clear determination that this is not the case. But when your mind is already made up, facts seem not to matter.\n\nAdd to that the Hobby Lobby case\u2019s assertion that the freedom to practice one\u2019s religion without interference by the government extends beyond individuals to corporations. Such an assertion trivializes religion itself. Corporations don\u2019t gather in religious community, don\u2019t worship anything (except perhaps the bottom line), don\u2019t pray, and they don\u2019t possess a soul in need of redemption.\n\nReligion already reaps enormous benefits from American society and government. Because they are charitable organizations, ostensibly devoted to beneficial care of the poor and needy, they are already exempt from helping fund (through taxes) the very government that supports them. As long as they abide by their own internal rules of governance, the secular society imposes no meddling restrictions. hey can discriminate all they like on the selection of their clergy, lay leaders and membership. Until relatively recently, Mormons excluded African-Americans from the priesthood. Roman Catholics, Mormons, and many evangelical churches continue to exclude women from the highest levels of participation and leadership. Instead of being grateful for such accommodations and freedoms\u2014unusual even in most Western, democratic countries\u2014some religions want more.\n\nReligious freedom and liberty is a precious right, guaranteed by our Constitution. But shouldn\u2019t such freedom to practice one\u2019s religion stop where another person\u2019s freedom and liberty start? Under the Affordable Care Act, which is the law of the land whether or not one likes it, access to contraceptive care is a right extended to those covered by health insurance plans. Should the Hobby Lobby owners\u2019 personal religion\u2014and their denial of the scientific, factual evidence to the contrary\u2014be allowed to trump the rights of their employees and their families to exercise their right of access to contraceptive care? Surely not.\n\nNo one is threatening the Greens\u2019 right not to use certain forms of birth control, nor is anyone being forced to have an abortion. But the owners of a corporation should not be allowed to decide for their employees what is moral or immoral in their decision-making. The religious freedom promised in the Constitution was never meant to extend to big businesses (or small ones, for that matter). Asserting that such corporations are \u201cpracticing\u201d religion is patently absurd. And if the Greens didn\u2019t want to follow the laws applying to the public, then they should never have opened a corporation whose business is based on serving the public.\n\nThe slippery slope here is long and steep. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Hobby Lobby, the ramifications are enormous. Religion, after all, does not merely include mainstream Methodists, Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, but countless small and outlandish \u201creligions\u201d on the fringes of society. Some of these \u201creligions\u201d have beliefs and practices that border on the bizarre and disturbing. If Hobby Lobby is accorded these exemptions, there will be no end to the attempts to \u201cprotect\u201d these more radical beliefs and practices, all in the name of religious freedom.\n\nMost disturbing of all to those of us in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community is the threat of our hard-won civil rights being abridged and denied, all in the name of religious belief. Don\u2019t get me wrong; while I don\u2019t agree with religious condemnation of homosexuality, I would die in the ditch for protecting churches, synagogues, mosques and other truly religious entities from having to ordain or marry LGBT people, based on their religion. But how long will it take for religiously-sponsored homeless shelters to reject homosexual clients? Will doctors be free, based on their personal religious beliefs, to deny medical services to gay patients? Will hospitals run or owned by religious institutions be free to deny health services to those who are LGBT\u2014or for that matter, to cohabiting-but-unmarried heterosexuals?\n\nReligion\u2014unfortunately often defined in America by the religious right\u2014doesn\u2019t need to tarnish its reputation further by such a public desire to discriminate. Many have left the religion of their childhoods because of such narrow and limiting attitudes. As far as I know, no religion places an asterisk after its recitation of the Golden Rule, indicating those who can (and should) be exempted from the command to love and treat others as they would themselves want to be treated. The Supreme Court shouldn\u2019t help the ones who are trying.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "BishopGRobinson"}, "keywords": "United States Supreme Court, Gay Rights, religion", "publicationDate": 201406081045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/blogs/religion", "news_keywords": "United States Supreme Court, Gay Rights, religion", "pageNum": 1, "title": "A Victory for Religious Freedom is a Loss for Religion", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "A version of the Golden Rule is at the heart of every religion.
