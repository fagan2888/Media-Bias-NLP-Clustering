Fearful for his safety, they say\u2014he might choke!\u2014and fearful for officer safety\u2014one of them had his arm pinned under Flores' body smashed to the ground!\u2014they beat his head into the asphalt.\n\nHis 7-month-pregnant girlfriend Mayra Lazos-Guerrero shouts at them to stop and approaches them, gets legswept into the asphalt herself, face and belly first.\n\nPasserby Levi Frasier videos it all, cops take his tablet and apparently try to erase the evidence, though he tells local TV station Fox 31 that he recovered it when syncing later to cloud. Frasier admits it's possible that both he and the officer somehow missed it and that perhaps it was there all along.\n\nStill:\n\nFrasier said, officers on scene threatened him with arrest, demanded he turn over all photos and videotape to them and then seized his tablet over his objections. \u201cWhen he took it, I said, \u2018Hey! You can\u2019t do that. You need a warrant for that!\u2019 and he said, \u2018What program did you take the video with? Where is that?\u2019\u201d Frasier said. He said police ignored his objections and dug through his personal photos without obtaining a court order. \u201cThe first officer that comes up to ask me about my witness statement brings me to the police car and says we could do this the easy way or we could do this the hard way,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cIt was taken as \u2018You can either cooperate and give us what we want or we\u2019re going to incarcerate you.\u2019\u201d Although official police reports mentioned an officer thought Frasier took video, there is nothing written about taking, searching or possessing his tablet. That\u2019s something Frasier swears occurred.\n\nFrasier tells Fox 31 that even in his days cage fighting he never saw such hard punches as Flores was suffering. (It's on the video.)\n\nGreat video report from Fox 31, well worth watching, including the brave takedown of the pregnant lady:\n\nFlores now faces two felony drug charges. Lazos-Guerrero is now herself facing charges, including child abuse, since a child was in the car when Flores and Lazos-Guerrero were physically abused by police.\n\nThe report from local Fox 31 is really refreshing, particularly an exchange between anchors at the end containing these bits of advice: \"If there's one takeaway for the viewer\u2014if you're in public and see something happening and it's in public you can vidoetape it and no one can do anything about that...you don't have to listen to police when they say turn it over if they don't have a search warrant.\"\n\n[Hat tip: Free Thought Project.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Denver cops think they see a guy, David Flores, swallowing a sock they think contains illegal drugs.
