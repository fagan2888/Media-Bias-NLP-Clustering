( Carie Canterbury / Daily Record )\n\nOne idea, two friends and their moms, and countless hours of painting equate to lots of happy children \u2014 and parents.\n\nCa\u00f1on City Girl Scout Angel Potter, from Troop 255, recently completed her Gold Award qualifications through the Scouting program.\n\nFor her seven-step community project, Potter, 18, redecorated the reception area of Loaves & Fishes Ministries to make it more child friendly. The waiting area now features a fun wall mural with encouraging messages, a small play area and a variety of books. The new area adds a lot of color and brightness to the foyer, Potter said.\n\n\"This is to offer more activity for the kids here,\" she said. \"The kids don't have a lot to do when they are staying in the shelter, and it also helps the parents when they bring kids up front and they are really bored.\"\n\nThe community pitched in to donate books and toys, and the project materials largely were donated by Home Depot. Potter purchased a chalk table at New Horizons Thrift Store, and Design u'r Memories assisted with the vinyl lettering.\n\nAlong with her fellow Girl Scouts, Katie Abbott and Nani Albertson, Potter spent several hours after school last spring painting and redecorating. She recently completed all the steps required to earn the prestigious Gold Award.\n\nThe Girl Scouts' website states Girl Scout Gold Award recipients \"do well in life. They rate their general success in life significantly higher and report higher success in reaching their goals within many areas.\"\n\nPotter said sticking with Girl Scouts through high school is an accomplishment in itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Most girls quit Girl Scouts around middle school because they have too many activities going on, they don't like it anymore or they don't have the motivation to do it,\" she said. \"There are six girls at the high school, or less than that, that are in Girl Scouts.\"\n\nPotter participated in Girl Scouts from first through 12th grade, and she graduated from Ca\u00f1on City High School in May. Her favorite part of Scouting, without question, has been Girl Scout camp. As a camper, she participated in zip-lining activities, rock climbing, hiking and backpacking events.\n\nShe can't be a camper anymore, but she can be a worker. She worked at two different camps last year washing dishes and planning events and theme-weeks. Being a camp leader requires some sacrifice, she said.\n\n\"I participated in the 'Hunger Games' with girls for two weeks,\" she said. \"Each team got a bag of colored paint with glitter, and I sacrificed myself and got every single color of paint on my shirt \u2014 it didn't come out of my clothes or off my skin for a week.\n\n\"It was so fun \u2014 it was great.\"\n\nShe also will miss the annual bridging ceremony at the Royal Gorge Bridge, father-daughter dances, mall lock-ins, tea parties, come-as-you-are breakfasts, World Thinking Day, and all the other events and activities she has enjoyed for years.\n\nIn addition to Girl Scouts, Potter also has been active with the yearbook staff at CCHS and she sometimes babysits. This fall she will begin classes at the University of Northern Colorado. Her goal is to earn a PhD in psychology with a minor in Spanish.\n\nPotter and her brothers, Walter and Fred, each have achieved the highest advancement rank in Scouting. The triplets' parents, Dion and Bettina Potter, heavily have been involved in their Scouting journeys since day one.\n\nCarie Canterbury: 719-276-7643, canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28535606/canon-city-high-school-graduate-wraps-up-career", "modificationDate": "2015-07-25T08:10:35-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0724/20150724__25DRGIRLSCOUT~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "One idea, two friends and their moms, and  countless hours of painting equate to lots of happy children \u2014 and parents.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28535606:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-25T08:09:36-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28535606/canon-city-high-school-graduate-wraps-up-career", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0724/20150724__25DRGIRLSCOUT~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One idea, two friends and their moms, and  countless hours of painting equate to lots of happy children \u2014 and parents.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City High School graduate wraps up career in Girl Scouts, earns prestigious Gold Award"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "One idea, two friends and their moms, and  countless hours of painting equate to lots of happy children \u2014 and parents.", "title": "Ca\u00f1on City High School graduate wraps up career in Girl Scouts, earns prestigious Gold Award", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28535606/canon-city-high-school-graduate-wraps-up-career", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0724/20150724__25DRGIRLSCOUT~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-25T08:09:36-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-07-24T20:33:12-0600", "sailthru.title": "Ca\u00f1on City High School graduate wraps up career in Girl Scouts, earns prestigious Gold Award", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie CanterburyThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0724/20150724__25DRGIRLSCOUT~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-07-25T08:12:14-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "The Girl Scouts' website states Girl Scout Gold Award recipients \"do well in life.\nPotter participated in Girl Scouts from first through 12th grade, and she graduated from Ca\u00f1on City High School in May.\nIn addition to Girl Scouts, Potter also has been active with the yearbook staff at CCHS and she sometimes babysits.\nCa\u00f1on City Girl Scout Angel Potter, from Troop 255, recently completed her Gold Award qualifications through the Scouting program.\n\"There are six girls at the high school, or less than that, that are in Girl Scouts.\""}
