Bruce Poliquin called for a balanced budget and dove into energy issues.\n\nThe new Republican congressman from Maine\u2019s 2nd District has challenges, including a Democratic president, anger among some conservatives for his support of the House speaker and four Democrats that could be considering runs to oust him in 2016.\n\nAdditional Images U.S. Rep.

The locations in Bangor, Lewiston and Presque Isle are the same spaces once occupied by Democrat Mike Michaud, but the phone numbers have changed.

He became the first Republican in 20 years to represent the district. His party succeeded nationwide in 2014, widening its edge in the U.S. House of Representatives and taking control of the Senate.\n\nThe former Maine state treasurer\u2019s first floor speech in Congress on Wednesday tackled federal debt, calling for an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget each year. Such a measure is unlikely: It would need a two-thirds vote in Congress before being sent to state legislatures for approval. Critics say it could harm the country\u2019s ability to respond to crises.\n\nBut Poliquin said in an interview that it would instill \u201can institutional discipline to make sure that Congress can control its spending,\u201d which will \u201cgive a lot more confidence to job creators.\u201d\n\nHe also said he will co-sponsor a bill that would force federal regulators to approve or deny new natural gas pipeline projects within a year or trigger automatic approval, a measure that Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, pushed for last year. The White House has said that President Barack Obama would likely veto the bill because it \u201ccould force agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information.\u201d\n\nBut Poliquin, who also voted with a majority of House members Friday to approve the Keystone XL pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to Texas refineries on the Gulf of Mexico, said expediting the natural gas permitting process would help Maine consumers.\n\n\u201cIf you can do that, you drive down the cost to heat our homes and drive down the energy costs to operate our paper mills,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Poliquin also voted for a bill that would alter standards under the Affordable Care Act that determine who must be offered employer-provided health coverage, defining full-time workers as working 40 hours per week instead of 30 hours. The House approved the bill, whose supporters say the current standard pressures businesses to save money by cutting workers\u2019 hours.\n\nJust after Poliquin\u2019s swearing-in on Tuesday,25 Republicans voted against House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Those members didn\u2019t think Boehner was conservative enough, but Poliquin and other Republicans rallied to win him a third term in charge.\n\nAt the party\u2019s 2012 national Convention, Boehner approved a group of delegates that left out 10 supporters of Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning presidential candidate who lost the party\u2019s nomination to Mitt Romney. The Republican Liberty Caucus, a libertarian conservative group, endorsed Poliquin in 2014, but it lobbied for Boehner\u2019s removal as speaker.\n\nVic Berardelli of Newburgh, the RLC\u2019s northeast director, said he got emails and calls from people who said they may leave the party because of Poliquin\u2019s vote for Boehner. But Berardelli said he\u2019s giving Poliquin a pass because party leaders gave him a plum assignment on the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the securities, banking, insurance and housing industries.\n\nEven so, Berardelli said Poliquin will have to prove his conservative mettle to activists if he wants to gain their future support, calling the congressman\u2019s job \u201ca delicate balancing act.\u201d\n\nPoliquin\u2019s Facebook page was littered with comments asking him to vote against the speaker, but he said he wasn\u2019t lobbied to vote against Boehner. In meetings with leaders, Poliquin said he has been convinced that they share his pro-jobs agenda, even if they may not always agree.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to vote with them on everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t work for Mr. Boehner; I work for the people of the 2nd District.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are already gunning for him in 2016.\n\nCain, a former state senator from Orono, has been asked by party leaders to run again in a presidential year, which traditionally boosts voter turnout. Maine House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, has said he may run. Also, two Bangor city councilors, Joe Baldacci and Ben Sprague, said they aren\u2019t ruling out runs.\n\nBaldacci, 49, a lawyer and the brother of John Baldacci, a former Democratic governor and congressman, and Sprague, 31, a financial adviser and former independent who registered as a Democrat in December, said they\u2019ve both been encouraged to run.\n\nJoe Baldacci said his party should spend \u201cmore time focusing on issues that resonate with the voters in order to understand the lessons of 2014\u201d before politicking for the seat, while Sprague said for now, his priorities are Bangor and his family and \u201cit doesn\u2019t do the process any good to start the campaign season this early.\u201d\n\nPoliquin brushed off potential challenges, saying he\u2019s \u201cfully consumed with helping our families live better lives.\u201d On Thursday, Poliquin said he was set to meet with Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, to urge him to support the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work with anybody to make sure that we move a pro-jobs agenda forward in Washington to grow jobs in Maine,\u201d Poliquin said.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new Republican congressman says his agenda is 'all about jobs,' but he faces hurdles among some conservatives for his support of the House speaker.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The new Republican congressman says his agenda is 'all about jobs,' but he faces hurdles among some conservatives for his support of the House speaker.", "title": "Maine's Bruce Poliquin dives into budget, energy issues - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/357852_New-Congress-House.JPEG-05c.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2015-01-12T17:09:16-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/01/11/maines-bruce-poliquin-dives-into-budget-energy-issues/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/357852_New-Congress-House.JPEG-05c.jpg", "description": "The new Republican congressman says his agenda is 'all about jobs,' but he faces hurdles among some conservatives for his support of the House speaker.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Maine's Bruce Poliquin dives into budget, energy issues - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-01-11T15:59:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T17:09:16-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15b4\"", "article_summary": "Last week when he was sworn into Congress, U.S. Rep.
