DAKAR, Senegal — The mob violence wracking Central African Republic imperils the future of the country’s Muslims, with tens of thousands fleeing the violence and untold numbers killed.

Bangui, the capital, is engulfed in an orgy of bloodshed and looting despite the presence of thousands of French and African peacekeepers.

“We are in a moment where immediate action is needed to stop the killings,” said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch, calling for a full U.N. peacekeeping mission. “Otherwise, the future of the Muslim community of this country will be gone.”

Muslims make up about 15 percent of Central African Republic’s 4.6 million people. More than 800,000 people have fled, according to the United Nations.

“There are some who don’t want Muslims in this country,” Prime Minister Andre Nzapayeke said on local radio Saturday. “But when the Muslims have left the country, what happens next? The Protestants will throw out the Catholics, and then the Baptists against the Evangelists, and finally the animists? It is time we regain control and stop ourselves from plunging into an abyss.”

Thousands of Muslims left Bangui in a massive convoy Friday that was jeered by crowds of Christians. One Muslim who fell off a truck was quickly killed by the mob. Muslim women who could not get on the trucks tried to hand their children to strangers aboard the vehicles.

No one knows the true death toll from two months of the worst inter-communal violence in this country’s history: It is often too dangerous for crews to recover the corpses. More than 1,000 were killed in early December, when a Christian militia attempted to overthrow the Muslim rebel government then in power.

Babacar Gaye, the U.N.’s special representative to the Central African Republic, has called for the murderers to be held accountable. Yet in a country where police officers long ago fled their jobs and courthouses are shuttered and looted, it’s not even clear where to begin.
