The Inquisitr covered their plight last month, in the story at this link.\n\nAmazingly, Mack met his funding goal, largely due to donations from people who told the sheriff they disagreed with his refusal to buy his own insurance, but were giving him money anyway because, as one donor wrote, \u201cNo one\u2019s life should be ruined by health care bills.\u201d\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve learned two things for sure about Richard Mack. He still refuses to buy insurance because he hates Obamacare \u2014 and he\u2019s back to plead with strangers to give him even more money.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go again!! The goal of this GoFundMe is to help Sheriff Mack and his wife pay all of their hospital and medical recovery bills and basic living expenses for a few months so that they can return to service stronger than ever,\u201d his GoFundMe page says.\n\n\u201cWe are all grateful for each person who helped reach and exceed the first milestone of $30k. Let\u2019s go to second base \u2026 on to 60. Thank you so much!\u201d\n\nBut what did Mack think about the large number of his ideological opponents donating their own hard-earned cash to his cause?\n\nNot surprisingly, many believed, as one donor phrased it, \u201cturning around and BEGGING FOR MONEY to pay for your health recovery, AFTER YOU staunchly tried to OBSTRUCT the ACA, is APPALLING, REPREHENSIBLE, AND OBSCENE!!! [sic]\u201d\n\nMack, in a recent interview, appeared amused by what he called the \u201clectures\u201d he received from those generous enough to help him with his health care crisis, even if they believed he brought his troubles in himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like \u2018Go to GoFundMe.com, help Sheriff Mack, and you can tell this conservative creep off if you just donate five dollars or more.\u2019 \u201d Mack remarked.\n\nMack also continues to refuse to participate in the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you call it, it\u2019s a socialistic program that I totally disagreed with and still do,\u201d Mack said. \u201cIf I had the right to choose for myself, then it would be different. But government forcing me and forcing the rest of the country to compassionate \u2014 compassion and charity does not come at the end of a gun from the IRS. [sic]\u201d\n\nOf course, Richard Mack did have the right to choose for himself, choosing not to purchase health insurance through Obamacare and as a result, going online to ask others to send him money.\n\n[Image: YouTube Screen Grab]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember Richard Mack, the sheriff who hated Obamacare so much he refused buy health inusrance?
