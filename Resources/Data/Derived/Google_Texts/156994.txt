It took firefighters the majority of the day Wednesday to put out a large fracking operation fire in Grady County.

Continental Resources said it's moving swiftly to replace firefighting gear that was ruined last week after a fracking accident near Chickasha led to an explosion and fire.

Amber fire Chief Mike Norman said crude oil and other chemicals caked the gear of seven of his firefighters. He said the gear was brand new, and had only been in service for two weeks.

"Another hard hit like this on gear, it can put us out of service completely," Norman said.

Grady County fire spokesman Buddy Myers said Monday night that he's confident Continental is working in good faith to get firefighting gear replaced quickly.

"Continental is a committed employer in the Grady County community. In fact, in 2015, we donated a truck to the Grady County Sheriffâ€™s department and thousands of dollars in additional donations for other equipment in the county. Of course we will make sure that any gear that needs to be replaced or repaired will be taken care of," a spokeswoman for the company said Monday night.
