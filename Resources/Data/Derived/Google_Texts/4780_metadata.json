It is believed that the group has no fewer than 1,000 members.\n\nOne of its most recent and deadliest attacks was a massive car bomb explosion at a checkpoint northwest of the Egyptian town of Arish that killed 28 soldiers, followed by a drive-by shooting several hours later at a checkpoint in Arish, that killed three. Both attacks took place last month. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi declared a state of emergency in Sinai after the attack.\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nA few hours after the Egyptian announcement, four more audio statements were broadcast online. Algerian group \u201cJund al-Khilafa in the land of Algeria\u201d (the soldiers of the caliphate) is a new group formed after the breakup of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb by the leader of the latter\u2019s central region, Khaled Abu Suleiman, in September. Abu Suleiman left al-Qaeda and joined ISIS in Algeria. In the same month, the group kidnapped and beheaded a French citizen in obedience with an ISIS spokesman\u2019s call to kill citizens of the countries conducting the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe three other groups are all called \u201cal-Mujahidin\u201d in the Arabian peninsula, Libya, and Yemen, respectively. It seems that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Ansar al-Sharia in Yemen (an al-Qaeda formed organization) and Ansar al-Sharia in Libya, which was involved in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September 2012, have suffered a break up.\n\nRelated: How Yemen Is Making ISIS and al-Qaeda Even More Dangerous\n\nThe five statements were similar in condemning the Arab ruling regimes and armies and despising democracy. The Saudi group has denounced the Saudi King and its policies of not fighting Israel or the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. It also said that an Islamic state will be achieved in Saudi Arabia soon.\n\nThe Libyan statement was similar. It mentioned that battalions from Tripoli, Barqa, and Fazzan have joined the caliphate.\n\nWith all these groups joining ISIS, the terror group has found a foothold in almost every major Arab country, which will boost the recruitment and perhaps operational cooperation between ISIS and these groups.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s fate is still unclear after a U.S.", "title": "5 More Mideast Jihadist Groups Join ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/11/5-More-Mideast-Jihadist-Groups-Join-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06302014_ISIL_Fighter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/11/5-More-Mideast-Jihadist-Groups-Join-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06302014_ISIL_Fighter.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@AlhamdaniRiyadh"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s fate is still unclear after a U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde85c\"", "article_summary": "With all these groups joining ISIS, the terror group has found a foothold in almost every major Arab country, which will boost the recruitment and perhaps operational cooperation between ISIS and these groups.\nThe Saudi group has denounced the Saudi King and its policies of not fighting Israel or the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\u201cAl-Bunyan\u201d and \u201cal-Battar\u201d media foundations, which are part of the ISIS media organization, published five audio messages online on Monday from these groups declaring their allegiance to ISIS.\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock YouA few hours after the Egyptian announcement, four more audio statements were broadcast online.\nThe three other groups are all called \u201cal-Mujahidin\u201d in the Arabian peninsula, Libya, and Yemen, respectively."}
