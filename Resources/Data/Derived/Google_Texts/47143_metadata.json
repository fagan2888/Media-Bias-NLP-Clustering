I\u2019d feel that way if my faith were under attack, too (and, since it is, sometimes do). What\u2019s extraordinary is the irrational, vicious language being used about conservatives and the GOP by those who oppose them.\n\nRemember too, this is coming from an organization that has been identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. And remember, this is being written by a man who said,\n\n\u201cThe reality is, homosexuals have entered the Scouts in the past for predatory purposes.\u201d\n\n\u2013 FRC vice president Rob Schwarzwalder, on radio\u2019s \u201cThe Janet Mefferd Show,\u201d Feb. 1, 2013.\n\nThe Family Research Council is a group, that as the SPLC explains,\n\nThe Family Research Council (FRC) bills itself as \u201cthe leading voice for the family in our nation\u2019s halls of power,\u201d but its real specialty is defaming gays and lesbians. The FRC often makes false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science. The intention is to denigrate LGBT people in its battles against same-sex marriage, hate crimes laws, anti-bullying programs and the repeal of the military\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy. There is no effort to engage John Boehner or Ted Cruz at a serious intellectual level. Instead, the ever-eloquent Alan Grayson takes to the floor of the House to cite a poll comparing Republicans to \u201cdog poop.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jack Tapper puts it this way, when asked by Hugh Hewitt about the rhetoric employed by the Left about the current impasse: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard Republicans comparing the Democrats to suicide bombers or to kidnappers or to arsonists.\u201d\n\nTrapper, and Schwarzwalder, both ignoring the numerous examples of Republicans doing exactly that.\n\nHere\u2019s a small sample of the kind of thing to which Tapper is referring: \u201cThis is the resurrection of the Confederacy.\u201d \u2013 Jesse Jackson \u201cHostage Holdup\u201d \u2013 Markos Moulitsas \u201cRacism & Cruelty Behind Obamacare Attacks\u201d \u2013 Robert Scheer \u201cRepublicans\u2019 Fringe Festival\u201d \u2013 Thomas Friedman Republicans are guilty of \u201cextortion \u2026 demanding a ransom \u2026 (they are threatening) to crash the global economy\u201d \u2013 The President of the United States Republicans are guilty of \u201cextortion\u201d and \u201cblackmail,\u201d and are \u201cdelusional\u201d \u2013 Paul Krugman \u201cWhat we\u2019re not for is negotiating with people with a bomb strapped to their chest. We\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d \u2013 White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer \u201cA radical, militant organization \u2026 why shouldn\u2019t we consider the Republican Party\u2019s similar acts of extortion of the past week terrorism? \u2026 The House\u2019s suit-clad terrorists could end this unprecedented, apocalyptic standoff.\u201d \u2013 Andy Ostroy \u201cGore Calls Defund Effort \u2018Political Terrorism\u2019.\u201d \u2013 National Review Online headline \u201cThose who encourage young people to steer clear of their ObamaCare fleecing are \u2018guilty of murder, in my opinion\u2019.\u201d \u2013 U.S. Senator Angus King (I-ME) \u201cRepublicans are like arsonist (sic)\u201d \u2013 U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) Republicans are on a \u201cjihad\u201d against the country \u2013 U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-CA)\n\nSchwarzwalder criticzes these comments, but look at some of the things conservatives have said, for example, Ann Coulter in her book, Treason : Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism (2003): \u201cLiberals have a preternatural gift for striking a position on the side of treason,\u201d or Coulter\u2019s exchange with Linda Vester on Fox News (October 6, 2004):\n\nVester: You say you\u2019d rather not talk to liberals at all?\n\nCoulter: I think a baseball bat is the most effective way these days.\n\nBecause a bat is such an intellectual argument.\n\nOr Coulter\u2019s \u201cloving\u201d response to a student\u2019s question at Indiana University on February 23, 2006:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the Republicans in power, does that mean you want a dictatorship, gay boy?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s make it easy: Look at the list the SPLC has compiled of some of the things the FRC \u2013 the organization of which Schwarzwalder is Senior Vice President \u2013 itself has said recently:\n\n\u201c[H]omosexual activists vehemently reject the evidencewhich suggests that homosexual men \u2026 are \u2026 relative to their numbers, more likely to engage in such actions [childhood sexual abuse] than are heterosexual men.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Peter Sprigg, Senior Fellow for Policy Studies at FRC, on why the Boy Scouts should not allow LGBT Scouts or leaders, FRC blog, February 1, 2013. \u201cThe videos are titled \u2018It Gets Better.\u2019 They are aimed at persuading kids that although they\u2019ll face struggles and perhaps bullying for \u2018coming out\u2019 as homosexual (or transgendered or some other perversion), life will get better. \u2026It\u2019s disgusting. And it\u2019s part of a concerted effort to persuade kids that homosexuality is okay and actually to recruit them into that lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tony Perkins, FRC fundraising letter, August 2011 \u201cThose who understand the homosexual community\u2014the activists\u2014they\u2019re very aggressive, they\u2019re\u2014everything they accuse us of they are in triplicate. They\u2019re intolerant, they\u2019re hateful, vile, they\u2019re spiteful. \u2026. To me, that is the height of hatred, to be silent when we know there are individuals that are engaged in activity, behavior, and an agenda that will destroy them and our nation.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tony Perkins, Speaking to the Oak Initiative Summit, April 2011 \u201cWe believe the evidence shows \u2026 that relative to the size of their population, homosexual men are more likely to engage in child sexual abuse than are heterosexual men.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Peter Sprigg, \u201cDebating Homosexuality: Understanding Two Views.\u201d 2011. \u201cWhile activists like to claim that pedophilia is a completely distinct orientation from homosexuality, evidence shows a disproportionate overlap between the two. \u2026 It is a homosexual problem.\u201d\n\n\u2014 FRC President Tony Perkins, FRC website, 2010 \u201c[W]elcoming open homosexuality in the military would clearly damage the readiness and effectiveness of the force \u2013 in part because it would increase the already serious problem of homosexual assault in the military.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Peter Sprigg, \u201cHomosexual Assault in the Military,\u201d 2010 \u201cA little-reported fact is that homosexual and lesbian relationships are far more violent than are traditional married households.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Timothy Dailey, FRC publication, \u201cHomosexual Parenting: Placing Children at Risk,\u201d 2002 \u201cGaining access to children has been a long-term goal of the homosexual movement.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Robert Knight, FRC director of cultural studies, and Frank York, 1999 \u201c[Homosexuality] \u2026 embodies a deep-seated hatred against true religion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steven Schwalm, FRC senior writer and analyst, in \u201cDesecrating Corpus Christi,\u201d 1999 \u201cOne of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the \u2018prophets\u2019 of a new sexual order.\u201d\n\n\u20141999 FRC publication, \u201cHomosexual Behavior and Pedophilia,\u201d Robert Knight and Frank York\n\nThe Family Research Council is, like the American Family Association, and tea party organizations, all about hate, all about making religion and patriotism an excuse for such hate, all about the demonization of the constructed other \u2013 and, most obviously of all based on Schwarzwalder\u2019s claims here, all about lies.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Conservatism in the United States, Family Research Council, Hate, homophobia, LGBT, Republican Party, Rob Schwarzwalder, Tony Perkins, United States", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "After years of conservatives demonizing liberalism and progressivism, atheists, Muslims, environmentalists, Pagans, moderate Christians, and, especially, members of the LGBT community, the Family Research Council is acting like they don't understand why people are so angry. \r\n\r\nSenior Vice Pres", "title": "Hate Spewing Family Research Council Asks, Why So Angry, Bro?", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/11/hate-spewing-family-research-council-asks-angry-bro.html", "updated_time": "2013-10-11T08:01:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Republican Party,Conservatism in the United States,Family Research Council,Hate,homophobia,LGBT,Rob Schwarzwalder,Tony Perkins,United States,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2013-10-11T08:01:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-11T08:01:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba69\"", "article_summary": "The Family Research Council is a group, that as the SPLC explains,The Family Research Council (FRC) bills itself as \u201cthe leading voice for the family in our nation\u2019s halls of power,\u201d but its real specialty is defaming gays and lesbians.\nAfter years of conservatives demonizing liberalism and progressivism, atheists, Muslims, environmentalists, Pagans, moderate Christians, and, especially, members of the LGBT community, the Family Research Council is acting like they don\u2019t understand why people are so angry.\nRemember too, this is coming from an organization that has been identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nThe FRC often makes false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science.\nWhat\u2019s extraordinary is the irrational, vicious language being used about conservatives and the GOP by those who oppose them."}
