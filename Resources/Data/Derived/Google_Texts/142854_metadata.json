Joining Ginsburg as witnesses were Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna Inc.; Joseph Swedish, president and CEO of Anthem Inc.; Leemore Dafny, research professor in hospital and health services at Northwestern University; Richard Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospitals Association; and George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumers Union.\n\nWill consumers save?\n\nFor more than two decades, Ginsburg has studied how changes in the financing and delivery of health care affect people. Explaining why the health insurance market is so complex, he said insurers sell to different market segments, including individuals, Medicare beneficiaries and national corporations \u2014 in many distinct geographic areas. Additionally, the companies act as intermediaries, buying from health providers and selling insurance to consumers.\n\nGinsburg acknowledged potential upsides.\n\n\u201cFor one, Wall Street analysts believe that these mergers will lead to substantial reductions in administrative costs,\u201d he said.\n\nBut will consumers see those savings in their premiums?\n\n\u201cWe may believe that a merger will lower prices paid to providers, but we then need to analyze whether fees will be passed on to those buying insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nChief executives of the insurance companies assured the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee that consumers will win from the proposed mergers.\n\n\u201cBetter health insurance to more people,\u201d said Swedish, whose company Anthem wants to acquire Cigna for $48 billion.\n\nHe and Bertolini, CEO of Aetna, which has agreed to buy Humana and its huge Medicare Advantage business for $37 billion, insisted that fewer, bigger insurance companies will expand competition, improve health care and lower prices.\n\nWhen asked to assess the Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on the mergers, Ginsburg said the provisions that do come into play \u201cshould be seen in a positive light,\u201d even if they contribute to the urge to merge. The ACA encourages insurers to become more efficient and spurs experimentation in methods of payment, moving away from the traditional fee-for-service model.\n\nGinsburg is director of public policy at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and is holder of the Norman Topping Chair in Medicine and Public Policy at the USC Price School of Public Policy. An economist, he founded the Center for Studying Health System Change and served as president from 1995 to 2013.\n\nThe ultimate arbiter\n\nThe Department of Justice \u2014 not Congress \u2014 ultimately will decide whether to allow the insurance deals. It will conduct a detailed analysis of the possible effects of the mergers and may require the firms to divest some operations, as Anthem had to do in 2012 before buying Amerigroup. The department holds this data private.\n\n\u201cWithout being privy to this analysis, I do not have a position concerning whether or not these mergers should be approved,\u201d Ginsburg said. He and Dafny both said they wished the data would be made public.\n\nGiven the significance of the insurance sector to our wallets and to the functioning of our health care system, the public deserves better data. Leemore Dafny\n\n\u201cGiven the significance of the insurance sector to our wallets and to the functioning of our health care system, the public deserves better data,\u201d Dafny said.\n\nThe antitrust subcommittee rarely tackles health issues, but subcommittee chairman Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said he called the hearing to help the public and lawmakers understand the consolidation trend in the health care industry and how it may affect consumers.\n\nSteep stakes\n\nHow the mergers may affect the 90 million people \u2014 three out of 10 Americans \u2014 who have insurance through the four companies was on the mind of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the subcommittee.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that these deals do not harm consumers by increasing premiums or reducing benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he\u2019s \u201cdeeply concerned about these mergers.\u201d\n\nSlover also noted that stakes for consumers are high.\n\n\u201cThere are strong indicators, to us, that these mergers could create too much concentration in too many markets and cause too much harm to consumer choice,\u201d Slover said.\n\nPollack said the mergers \u201ccould be a blow to millions of health consumers, as well as the hospitals, doctors and others who are working to improve quality and efficiency while making care more affordable to patients.\u201d\n\nFor Ginsburg, who has testified as an expert witness at dozens of Congressional hearings over the last 35 years, the morning policy discussion was a departure from the contentious political tone of other hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cMy main message was trying to broaden the discussion \u2014 to think not only about consolidation or these mergers but ways to make insurance markets more competitive and how to pursue alternative payment models,\u201d he said after the hearing.\n\nMore stories about: Health Care, Health Policy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://news.usc.edu/86864/health-policy-expert-paul-ginsburg-weighs-in-on-insurance-mergers-at-senate-hearing/", "image": {"width": 480, "secure_url": "https://news.usc.edu/files/2015/10/pgusc0063_WEB-480x320.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://news.usc.edu/files/2015/10/pgusc0063_WEB-480x320.jpg", "height": 320}, "type": "article", "description": "USC Price public policy director Paul Ginsburg aims to broaden the discussion, thinking of ways to make insurance markets more competitive.", "title": "Health policy expert weighs in on insurance mergers at Senate hearing"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "More stories about: Health Care, Health Policy\nGinsburg is director of public policy at the Leonard D.
