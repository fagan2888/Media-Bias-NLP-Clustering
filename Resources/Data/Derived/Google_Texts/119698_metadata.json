They apparently crossed the Hudson River and thundered onto the Thruway heading south toward New York City before being shot dead on Friday April 24 by hunters hired by their owner, George Mesick.\n\nThe 15 animals apparently escaped via a broken fence from a farm in a town called Schodack, on the east side of the Hudson River. Mesick told the Albany Times Union that the bison could not be captured unharmed or be tranquilized, leaving no other option.\n\n\u201cThe buffalo are wild animals, they\u2019re not tame animals,\u201d Mesick said before the bison were gunned down. \"There is a zero percent chance of getting them back right now, I think. I just want to get this done with as fast as possible so that no one gets hurt.\"\n\nThough Mesick raises the bison for meat, the shooting resonated with controversial culling that occurs annually just outside the borders of Yellowstone, in Montana. Bison are killed there every year when they cross the boundary seeking food and lower altitudes in the depths of winter.\n\nRELATED: More Than 400 Yellowstone Bison Slaughtered So Far This Year in Montana\n\nHazed and Confused: Documentary Highlights Yellowstone Bison Plight in Montana\n\nABC News reported the incident, which occurred about 10 miles south of Albany, and posted a slide show of the saga as it unfolded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifteen bison were shot dead in upstate New York after escaping from a farm and thundering across Interstate 87, the New York Thruway.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/24/video-15-escaped-bison-shot-dead-after-overrunning-new-york-state-thruway-160138", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/escaped_bison_shot-upstate_ny-ap-mike_groll.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: 15 Escaped Bison Shot Dead After Overrunning New York State Thruway"}, "abstract": "Fifteen bison were shot dead in upstate New York after escaping from a farm and thundering across Interstate 87, the New York Thruway.", "dc": {"title": "Video: 15 Escaped Bison Shot Dead After Overrunning New York State Thruway"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/24/video-15-escaped-bison-shot-dead-after-overrunning-new-york-state-thruway-160138", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "bison, upstate New York, New York Thruway, I-87, bison deaths", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-24T21:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Video: 15 Escaped Bison Shot Dead After Overrunning New York State Thruway"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe buffalo are wild animals, they\u2019re not tame animals,\u201d Mesick said before the bison were gunned down.\nMore than a dozen bison escaped from a farm in upstate New York on Thursday April 23.\nIt could have been a scene out of Yellowstone National Park\u2019s Montana in winter, but instead it unfolded in upstate New York on a windswept April day.\nBison are killed there every year when they cross the boundary seeking food and lower altitudes in the depths of winter.\nThough Mesick raises the bison for meat, the shooting resonated with controversial culling that occurs annually just outside the borders of Yellowstone, in Montana."}
