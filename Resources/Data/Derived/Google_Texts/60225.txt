Editor’s note: The following post contains some graphic language.

If you’re a frequenter of the Obamacare exchange and have had occasion to call the hotline and ask questions about the program, then this phone number is a familiar one:

But it might come as a surprise what the hotline number becomes when corresponding keypad letters are substituted, as one writer has discovered (Warning: Rough language ahead):

Among the caveats in this interesting observation is that the number 1 on most phone keypads has no letters associated with it, so in essence one seeking help with Obamacare is dialing 1-800-F1U-CKYO.

Also, the crucial “U” is missing from the end this number, but the similarity is ironic at least.

So one might say Obamacare officials just missed out on a pretty entertaining possibility when they didn’t remove the unassigned number 1 and chose not to place an 8 at the end, but if you want to commit the number to memory, this isn’t an ineffective method.

Conservatives, however, might say the phrase is closer to a Freudian slip.
