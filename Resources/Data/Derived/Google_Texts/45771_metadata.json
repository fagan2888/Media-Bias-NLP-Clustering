It also includes mandatory background checks before buying guns, more money for public education and repeal of a law requiring women seeking an abortion to get an ultrasound.\n\nWith Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, leaders of the Black Caucus said they realize it will be a struggle to achieve their legislative goals.\n\n\u201cWe know that they are going to push back on any number of the issues that are on the agenda,\u201d said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who chairs the caucus. \u201cBut our focus is going to be on what our constituents want.\u201d\n\nOf the General Assembly\u2019s 140 members, 17 are African American; all of them are Democrats. Here are several issues the Black Caucus hopes to address during the General Assembly session that opened Wednesday and runs through Feb. 28.\n\nCriminal justice\n\nIn the wake of police shootings across the country, some police departments are requiring officers to wear body cameras that record their interactions with citizens. The Black Caucus wants to make this practice commonplace across Virginia.\n\nDelegate Joe Lindsey, R-Norfolk, has introduced House Bill 1521, which would require police agencies with 100 or more officers to begin wearing body cameras by Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nThe caucus also hopes to pass legislation that would require universal background checks for gun buyers. Last year, Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Burke, introduced a bill mandating these checks, but it never got out of committee. No new legislation on the topic has been introduced this session.\n\nRegarding criminal justice, the caucus also supports:\n\nA constitutional amendment to automatically restore the voting rights of nonviolent offenders who have completed their sentences\n\nLegislation to limit gun purchases to one per month\n\nMeasures to encourage the recording of police interrogations; caucus members say this would reduce the likelihood of false confessions.\n\nEfforts to give indigent defendants more access to court-appointed lawyers\n\nHealth care\n\nThe caucus wants Virginia to expand Medicaid, the health coverage program for low-income individuals. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has offered to pick up most of the cost of Medicaid expansion. Most Republicans oppose Medicaid expansion because they fear the state eventually will be stuck with the bills.\n\nLocke said it would be \u201chypocritical\u201d for the Republican Party to pass up the chance to expand Medicaid.\n\nAt a prayer breakfast early Wednesday morning, she said, Republicans talked about supporting programs to help the poor and hungry. \u201cAll of that is encapsulated in Medicaid expansion,\u201d Locke said.\n\nRegarding health care, the Black Caucus also supports:\n\nMore funding for indigent health care and free clinics\n\nReform of Virginia\u2019s mental health system\n\nEfforts to keep prescription drugs affordable\n\nEconomic development\n\nThe minimum wage mandated by the federal government and in effect in Virginia is $7.25 an hour. The Black Caucus advocates raising the minimum wage, as some other states have done.\n\nSeveral bills before the 2015 General Assembly would do that. House Bill 1654, sponsored by Del. Ken Plum, D-Reston, would raise Virginia\u2019s minimum wage to $8 an hour this July and to $10 an hour by July 2017; an almost identical bill, Senate Bill 681, has been introduced in the Senate by Marsden. Del. Marcus Simon, D-Falls Church, has introduced House Bill 1512, which would boost the minimum wage to $15.15.\n\nAlso regarding economic development, the caucus supports:\n\nEfforts to create jobs, especially environment-friendly \u201cgreen\u201d jobs\n\nWorkforce development and training\n\nSmall business development\n\nBy Matt Leonard/Capital News Service\n\nCapital News Service is a flagship program of the VCU School of Mass Communications.
