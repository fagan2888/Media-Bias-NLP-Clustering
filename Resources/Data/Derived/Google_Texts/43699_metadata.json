Their findings don\u2019t prove that one leads to the other, but they do affirm the complexity of domestic violence.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know yet is whether financial stress makes a violent couple more violent, or is financial stress enough of a disruption in a relationship that violence begins?\u201d says Corinne Peek-Asa, a corresponding author and director of the Injury Prevention Research Center at the UI College of Health. \u201cBoth are plausible.\u201d\n\nWhat researchers did discover is more women than men report experiencing financial stressors; more women than men also report lashing out verbally and physically at their partners. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean women are more likely than men to respond to financial stressors with violence.\n\nLike relationships themselves, teasing out cause and effect is complicated.\n\nThough researchers aren\u2019t ready to identify specific interventions for couples that are struggling with finances and domestic abuse, they are beginning to see that stressors beyond health, such as financial strain or unstable housing, may be at the root of some health-related problems.\n\nThe study, \u201cAssociation of financial stressors and physical intimate partner violence perpetration,\u201d was published March 1 online in Injury Epidemiology.\n\nUsing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\u2014a study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents that began in 1994, when participants were in grades 7 through 12\u2014researchers examined the association between financial stressors and three levels of violence, as reported by 11,499 participants. The researches gathered data for the UI study in 2008, when participants in the initial longitudinal study were between the ages of 24 and 32. The three levels of violence were \u201cmaking threats/minor physical abuse,\u201d \u201csevere physical abuse,\u201d and \u201cphysical abuse causing injury.\u201d\n\nParticipants recounted how often they committed each form of violence on a scale ranging from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201cmore than 20 times in the last year.\u201d They also reported if they had experienced six types of financial stressors at least once in the past 12 months: nonpayment of utilities, nonpayment of housing, fears of food unavailability, utilities turned off, and eviction.\n\nResearchers found that more women (27.7 percent) than men (22.9 percent) experienced at least one financial stressor. A higher percentage of women than men reported experiencing three of the six types of financial stressors. Plus, a higher percent of women than men were unable to pay their utilities (17.6 percent vs. 12.7 percent), reported food insecurity (14 percent vs. 9.9 percent), and experienced disconnected phone service (10.4 percent vs. 7.8 percent).\n\nAccording to the data, men and women experienced housing nonpayment, having utilities turned off, and eviction in about the same proportions.\n\nAlso, a higher number of women than men reported perpetrating threats/minor physical abuse (11.4 percent vs. 6.7 percent) and severe physical abuse (8.8 percent vs. 3.4 percent). But more men who perpetrated violence reported causing injury to their partner (32 percent vs. 21 percent). Overall, 92.9 percent of men and 86.7 percent of women reported they had committed no form of violence to their partner in the prior year.\n\nLaura Schwab-Reese, lead author and Ph.D. graduate in the Department of Community & Behavioral Health at the UI College of Public Health, says the data is helpful, but it isn\u2019t conclusive enough to develop interventions.\n\n\u201cSo, we know violence happened in the last year, and we know that financial stressors happened in the last year,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what we haven\u2019t been able to tease apart with this data is whether the financial stressor happened immediately before a violent episode, or did it exacerbate an already violent relationship? That is a really important point in terms of developing interventions.\u201d\n\nPeek-Asa says pinpointing the root issue is key to providing meaningful help.\n\n\u201cWhen we are developing interventions, do we need to focus on reducing the event, such as reducing the financial stressor, or do we need to help people manage the stress that happens as a result of the financial stressor?\u201d she says.\n\nPeek-Asa says the study comes at an important time, when more people than ever have access to health care because of the Affordable Care Act, which requires all hospitals to conduct a community needs assessment and increase efforts to refer patients to community resources.\n\nThat could mean expanding the scope of what doctors typically consider health-related stress, from things such as being overweight, smoking, and drinking, to include such stressors as food insecurity, unpaid bills, and eviction.\n\n\u201cAlthough hospitals aren\u2019t quite there yet, some of the most important health needs of patients are things like housing, employment services, and financial consulting\u2014things that could reduce financial stress and potentially reduce intimate partner violence,\u201d says Peek-Asa.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UI researchers find an association between financials stress and severe domestic abuse, but the discovery doesn't prove one leads to the other.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Iowa Now", "description": "UI researchers find an association between financials stress and severe domestic abuse, but the discovery doesn't prove one leads to the other.", "title": "Are money problems and violence related?", "url": "http://now.uiowa.edu/2016/04/are-money-problems-and-violence-related", "image": "http://now.uiowa.edu/files/now.uiowa.edu/files/primary-media/iStock_000017540074_Full.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-22T12:42:56-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UI researchers find an association between financials stress and severe domestic abuse, but the discovery doesn't prove one leads to the other.", "creator": {"identifier": "uiowa", "id": 14534931}, "url": "http://now.uiowa.edu/2016/04/are-money-problems-and-violence-related", "image": "http://now.uiowa.edu/files/now.uiowa.edu/files/primary-media/iStock_000017540074_Full.jpg", "title": "Are money problems and violence related?", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-22T12:43:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T12:42:56-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean women are more likely than men to respond to financial stressors with violence.\nThe study, \u201cAssociation of financial stressors and physical intimate partner violence perpetration,\u201d was published March 1 online in Injury Epidemiology.\n\u201cSo, we know violence happened in the last year, and we know that financial stressors happened in the last year,\u201d she says.\nBut more men who perpetrated violence reported causing injury to their partner (32 percent vs. 21 percent).\nA higher percentage of women than men reported experiencing three of the six types of financial stressors."}
