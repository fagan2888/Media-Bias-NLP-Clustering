Many of them may have started in a hatchery, but it takes some survival skills to work your way up to mossback status.\n\nSo catching a bona fide bruiser in a public pond or stream merits some bragging. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Clearly, they are not.\n\nThat\u2019s the reason for Colorado\u2019s Master Angler Program that recognizes fishermen for success in their sport. And a lot of fishermen will tell you it\u2019s the reason the camera was invented.\n\nBig fish are also the reason many anglers pick up their fishing rods at all. And the abundance of lunkers coming out of hiding come spring offers all the incentive they could ask for.\n\n\u201cIt took me all week, but I finally caught one that measured 40 inches,\u201d said Bob Dye, a Denver guide who recently returned from his annual steelhead fishing trip to northern Idaho. After landing several 37-inch steelies on a public stretch of the South Fork of the Clearwater, he finally taped a personal best.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most powerful fish I\u2019ve ever caught,\u201d Dye said.\n\nCloser to home, anglers have been reaping rewards from last weekend\u2019s opening of Spinney Mountain Reservoir in South Park, soon followed by boating access at nearby Eleven Mile State Park.\n\nEleven Mile regular Greg Sheldon unabashedly removed a pair of bruiser cut-bows in the 8-pound range from the reservoir just before full ice-out last Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mike Deherrera of Denver has been landing the pigs prowling their way into the South Platte River just upstream for weeks, inching his way up to Spinney once the park opened to anglers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to say Spinney fished very well for me on last Friday\u2019s opener and again on Sunday before the winds picked up at noon,\u201d Deherrera reported. \u201cThe river has produced lots of big trout the past couple of weeks, in the 8-pound range. San Juan worms were the ticket on hooking these giants.\u201d\n\nThe giants are very much in play at the moment, but they\u2019re going to take some effort. Just remember: When you find them, they\u2019re also going to take some pretty pictures.\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby@denverpost.com or twitter.com/swilloughby", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nothing better than landing monster fish in public waters in Colorado", "title": "Nothing better than landing monster fish in public waters in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/18/nothing-better-than-landing-monster-fish-in-public-waters-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150418__20150419_C13_SP19OUTMAINp1.jpg", "height": 368}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150418__20150419_C13_SP19OUTMAINp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-18T20:08:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T12:41:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "article_summary": "If there is anything that trumps the sensation of hooking into a monster fish on a fly rod, it\u2019s the satisfaction of catching it in public fishing water.\nAfter landing several 37-inch steelies on a public stretch of the South Fork of the Clearwater, he finally taped a personal best.\nBig fish are also the reason many anglers pick up their fishing rods at all.\nSo catching a bona fide bruiser in a public pond or stream merits some bragging.\nMany of them may have started in a hatchery, but it takes some survival skills to work your way up to mossback status."}
