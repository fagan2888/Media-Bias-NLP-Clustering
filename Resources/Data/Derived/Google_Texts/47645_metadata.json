Persuasion relies on psychology, which means if you change how people think about the favor, you can change their willingness to do it.\n\nIs knowing how to get people to do you favors exploitative and wrong? Maybe a little. But the magic of psychology isn\u2019t confined to laboratory studies with tangles of wires snaking from patients\u2019 scalps. There\u2019s always room for mind games, and when it comes to asking favors no two techniques work better than those involving four ordinary letters: D, I, T, and F.\n\nConsider two scenarios. You ask someone to help wash your car this weekend. The weather\u2019s nice and it\u2019s a small car, so it shouldn\u2019t take too long. He complies.

Rather than ask for the favor outright, you begin with a request to clean the house \u2014 a sizable favor, especially on a sunny weekend. Your friend shoots you down. But then you follow up with a request to help wash the car. The second technique, the \u201cDoor-in-the-face\u201d (DITF) technique, says he\u2019ll see the lesser option and be primed to say yes.\n\nLearn more below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "do, me, favor, 2, persuasion, techniques, get, people, do, just, about, anything, you", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In asking for favors, a \"No\" is just a formality before the eventual \"Sure thing, pal.\"", "title": "How To Persuade People To Do You Big Favors [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/do-me-favor-2-persuasion-techniques-get-people-do-just-about-anything-you-292214", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/persuasion.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In asking for favors, a \"No\" is just a formality before the eventual \"Sure thing, pal.\"", "title": "How To Persuade People To Do You Big Favors [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/do-me-favor-2-persuasion-techniques-get-people-do-just-about-anything-you-292214", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/persuasion.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/persuasion.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-09T16:37:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T16:39:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In asking for favors, a \"No\" is just a formality before the eventual \"Sure thing, pal.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb30\"", "article_summary": "If you find yourself doing lots of little favors for people, or a few major favors for one person, careful examination may reveal the same persuasion techniques crop up in most cases.\nPersuasion relies on psychology, which means if you change how people think about the favor, you can change their willingness to do it.\nBut then you follow up with a request to help wash the car.\nThere\u2019s always room for mind games, and when it comes to asking favors no two techniques work better than those involving four ordinary letters: D, I, T, and F.Consider two scenarios.\nYou ask someone to help wash your car this weekend."}
