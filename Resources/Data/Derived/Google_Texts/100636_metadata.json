At $60 a pop, total retail revenues translate into 13 to 14 million units of the game sold, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cBeginning at midnight on Monday, consumers around the world gathered in anticipation to be among the first to experience the evolution of this remarkable series,\" Strauss Zelnick, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two, stated in a press release. \u201cIn North America alone, more than 8,300 stores opened their doors at midnight to welcome fans whose loyalty and enthusiasm were rewarded with what The New York Times called \u2018the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment.\u2019\u201d GTA 5 was so desirable, that one fan was stabbed and hit over the head with a brick for his copy.\n\nDid You Say Spectacle?\n\nIn Society of the Spectacle, a slender book originally published in 1967, Guy DeBord begins with these words: \u201cIn societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.\u201d\n\nFrom there he launches into a discussion that explores the idea that those who make and control the images control society. Each of us is shaped, then, by distorted images of reality instead of being shaped by our own experience of reality. And in this age of incessant TV, movies, online webjunk, and video games like GTA 5, the image-makers have even more access to shaping not only our vision of the world but also ourselves. And that view is artificial.\n\n\u201cIn a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false,\u201d DeBord wrote. With the latest wave of entertainments, the false never looked so real. And for at least 13 to 14 million people, the false was never more difficult to resist.\n\nIf as DeBord believes, the spectacle is shaping us, can that be proven? Researchers in the US and the Netherlands may already have done so.\n\nSensitivity to Violence\n\nGTA 5 (and the entire Grand Theft Auto series) has been criticized for its graphic portrayal of violence and sexuality. Many critics claim that the game glorifies violence by rewarding senseless violent behavior. The debate is often framed in terms of the real-life effects of the game: whether playing GTA 5 makes gamers more likely to commit violent acts in the living world.\n\nTo examine whether media violence exposure causes desensitization, a set of researchers created an experiment where participants played either a violent or nonviolent video game, viewed violent or nonviolent photos (while their brain activity was measured), and then made the choice whether to give an opponent a blast of unpleasant noise. What did the researchers discover?\n\nAlthough men were more aggressive than women, violent video game content had a similar effect on men and women. The brain scans of those participants who previously had not been exposed to video game violence but now played a violent game showed actual physiological desensitization to violent images. Meanwhile, the brains of those who had a high level of exposure to video games liek Grand Theft Auto V were unaffected by the images \u2014 they had been desensitized.\n\n\u201cThese data provide the first experimental evidence linking violence desensitization with increased aggression, and show that a neural marker of this process can at least partially account for the causal link between violent game exposure and aggression,\u201d the authors state in their study. Although false from the start, the spectacle eventually becomes the true.\n\nSource: Engelhard CR, Bartholow BD, Kerr GT et al.
