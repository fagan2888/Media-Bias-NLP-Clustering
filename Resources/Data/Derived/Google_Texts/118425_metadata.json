That\u2019s on Hutchinson\u2019s east side.\n\nThree people in the pickup said they were confronted by a woman in the parking lot of a nearby Walmart. After a brief argument, the three fled the area and headed south on K-61. Police say the suspect pursued and shot at them repeatedly until they crashed into the Midas.\n\nDale Jester was working at the Midas when the vehicle crashed into the building. \"We heard noises but at the time we didn't know it was gunshot...and here laid the truck,\" he said outside the Midas.\n\nThe suspect left the scene but later turned herself in. Police identified her as 35-year-old Nichole Rene Green of Hutchinson.\n\nGreen was booked into the Reno County Jail on three counts of attempted second-degree murder and criminal discharge of a firearm.
