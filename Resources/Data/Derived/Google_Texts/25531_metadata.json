(iStockPhoto)\n\nThe federal government spent more on health care in 2015 than on Social Security for the first time ever.\n\nSo finds the Congressional Budget Office, the government\u2019s nonpartisan scorekeeping agency, in a 200-page report it released about fiscal 2015, which ended Sept. 30.\n\n\n\n[SPECIAL REPORT: Health Care Index]\n\nThe federal government spent $882 billion on Social Security, compared with $936 billion in spending on health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and tax subsidies that help people pay for private health plans under Obamacare. The total represents a 13 percent jump in health care spending from fiscal 2014, according to the report.\n\nMedicaid spending accounted for the largest increase in growth, at 16 percent or by $48 billion, because of the 30 states and District of Columbia that expanded the program to 9.6 million more enrollees under Obamacare.\n\n\n\n[READ: For Obamacare, Who Is Running States Matters]\n\nAuthors of the report warn that the federal budget deficit will increase in relation to the size of the economy for the first time since effects of the Great Recession began in 2009, projecting that the 2016 budget deficit will reach $544 billion, or $105 billion more than the previous year. The projected deficit would increase debt held by the public to 76 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2016.\n\nComponents of the Total Increase in Outlays in CBO\u2019s Baseline Between 2016 and 2026.\n\nCourtesy Congressional Budget Office\n\nIf laws around federal programs remain unchanged, authors of the report write, the deficit will continue to grow over the next 10 years, becoming even larger than its average during the past 50 years. Health care programs are projected to total 5.5 percent of GDP in 2016 and to grow quickly in subsequent years, reaching 6.6 percent of GDP in 2026. Medicare is projected to account for about three-quarters of that growth as the baby boomer population continues to age into the program.\n\nThe report could give ammunition to Republicans and others opposed to Obamacare, who predicted such an outcome on the federal budget. Supporters of the law may call for strengthening it, or for putting more cost controls on medical care and on prescription drugs.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Social Security", "title": "Health Care Programs Contribute to Increasing Federal Deficit", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare contributed to the jump.", "title": "For the First Time, Health Care Spending Higher than Social Security", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-25/health-care-programs-contribute-to-increasing-federal-deficit", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/49/7367c40749d249da1c48e8cb854496/42392WideModern_SocialSecurity_053013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Health Care Programs Contribute to Increasing Federal Deficit", "description": "Spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare contributed to the jump.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 25, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,health care,health care reform,Affordable Care Act,federal budget,deficit and national debt,Social Security", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare contributed to the jump."}, "article_summary": "[SPECIAL REPORT: Health Care Index]The federal government spent $882 billion on Social Security, compared with $936 billion in spending on health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and tax subsidies that help people pay for private health plans under Obamacare.\n(iStockPhoto)The federal government spent more on health care in 2015 than on Social Security for the first time ever.\nThe U.S. spent less on Social Security in 2015 than on health care, a new report finds.\nThe total represents a 13 percent jump in health care spending from fiscal 2014, according to the report.\nHealth care programs are projected to total 5.5 percent of GDP in 2016 and to grow quickly in subsequent years, reaching 6.6 percent of GDP in 2026."}
