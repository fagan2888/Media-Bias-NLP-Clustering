SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Illinois regulators have disciplined a Springfield psychiatrist for alleged sexual misconduct with a female patient.

The (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports (http://bit.ly/1vC8Osj ) that the state has temporarily suspended the license of 64-year-old Dr. Duttala Obula Reddy of Psychiatric Associates of Central Illinois.

He’s accused of engaging in multiple sexual encounters with a patient at his office and other locations while also prescribing the patient antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs. The patient had been referred to him by another psychiatrist who also was disciplined for having inappropriate sexual contact with patients.

Court filings show Reddy is also accused of sending the patient romantic, flirtatious emails.

He can refute the state’s allegations at a hearing later this month. A phone message left for Reddy at his office by The Associated Press wasn’t immediately returned.
