However, a slight majority of people are concerned that Medicare will be unable to give enrollees the same level of health benefits in the future, according to Kaiser's poll, which was released Friday.

And more than two-thirds of respondents said Medicare needs to undergo at least some changes, however slight, to keep it financially stable in the future. A whopping 87 percent of respondents favored giving the federal government power to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, which President Barack Obama has proposed in his most recent budget plan.

Medicare and Medicaid, which in 2015 will cost more than $1 trillion in government spending, "are important programs to people," that "are really woven into the fabric of American lives," said Mollyann Brodie, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and head of that group's survey team.

"The American public prefers the status quo, and they get anxious about changes to the programs," Brodie said. "They don't want the beneficiaries of the programs to bear any additional cost burdens."

However, Brodie noted that with regard to Medicare—the second most-popular government program after Social Security—"There is worry among younger Americans about whether it's going to be there for them" when they get old.

She also said that unlike the Affordable Care Act, which remains unpopular among Republicans, "We see much more across-the-board bipartisan support and agreement about these programs."

"Many more Americans feel that these programs are personally impacting their lives than are saying the same about Obamacare," Brodie said.
