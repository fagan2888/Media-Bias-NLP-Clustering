Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), Linda S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.) and 26 of their Democratic colleagues sent a letter to FIFA President Sepp Bladder on Monday asking the international soccer association to make good on its mission, to \u201cdevelop football everywhere and for all.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe letter asked FIFA to equalize pay between men and women players; review current policies and commercial arrangements to ensure they reflect a modern understanding of the sport\u2019s popularity; increase global investment in women\u2019s soccer; and provide equal facilities for male and female players.\n\nThe lawmakers said unequal pay is indefensible.\n\n\u201cThe three-time world championship winning Team USA team received a $2 million prize, just one-fourth of the $8 million that a men\u2019s team receives for losing in the first elimination round of the Men\u2019s World Cup,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAnd the total payout for the Women\u2019s World Cup this year is 40 times less, at $15 million, than the 2014 Men\u2019 World Cup award of $576 million.\u201d\n\nAnd though their letter said corporate actors often cite a weak American and global marker for women\u2019s sports, the 2015 Women\u2019s World cup was the most-watched soccer game in American history, garnering 26.7 million viewers.\n\n\u201cThere is ample evidence that FIFA has underinvested in women\u2019s sports out of motives ranging from apathy to discrimination,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nIn the letter they quoted remarks Bladder made in 2004, \u201cyou suggested that the way to improve women\u2019s soccer was to \u2018let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so.\u2019\u201d\n\nTheir response: \u201cWomen\u2019s sports aren\u2019t a sideshow and FIFA should do its utmost to ensure it doesn\u2019t treat them like one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cWomen\u2019s sports aren\u2019t a sideshow,\" lawmakers said in their letter to the FIFA president.", "description": "\u201cWomen\u2019s sports aren\u2019t a sideshow,\" lawmakers said in their letter to the FIFA president.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cWomen\u2019s sports aren\u2019t a sideshow,\" lawmakers said in their letter to the FIFA president.", "title": "House Dems demand FIFA treat men, women's soccer equally", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/249516-house-dems-demand-fifa-treat-men-and-womens-soccer-equally", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/worldcup.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/249516-house-dems-demand-fifa-treat-men-and-womens-soccer-equally", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-28T16:54-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Sports, FIFA, FIFA World Cup, women's soccer, Equal pay, Association football, Women's association football,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-28T16:54:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/249516-house-dems-demand-fifa-treat-men-and-womens-soccer-equally", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cWomen\u2019s sports aren\u2019t a sideshow,\" lawmakers said in their letter to the FIFA president.", "card": "summary", "title": "House Dems demand FIFA treat men, women's soccer equally"}, "dcterms.title": "House Dems demand FIFA treat men, women's soccer equally"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0742\"", "article_summary": "House Democrats are calling on FIFA to eliminate the disparities between men and women\u2019s soccer in pay, publicity and investments.\n\u201cThere is ample evidence that FIFA has underinvested in women\u2019s sports out of motives ranging from apathy to discrimination,\u201d the lawmakers said.\nIn the letter they quoted remarks Bladder made in 2004, \u201cyou suggested that the way to improve women\u2019s soccer was to \u2018let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball.\nFemale players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so.\u2019\u201dTheir response: \u201cWomen\u2019s sports aren\u2019t a sideshow and FIFA should do its utmost to ensure it doesn\u2019t treat them like one.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the total payout for the Women\u2019s World Cup this year is 40 times less, at $15 million, than the 2014 Men\u2019 World Cup award of $576 million.\u201dAnd though their letter said corporate actors often cite a weak American and global marker for women\u2019s sports, the 2015 Women\u2019s World cup was the most-watched soccer game in American history, garnering 26.7 million viewers."}
