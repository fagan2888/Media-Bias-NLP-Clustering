Roosevelt, Political Parties, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, The New Deal, U.S. Politics, Entertainment News, Politics News\n\nSince at least the end of the Reagan administration, we\u2019ve seen occasional pronouncements from political commentators about the impending breakup of the Republican Party, pulled in one direction by its fire-breathing conservative base and in another by corporate elites and Washington insiders. It keeps not happening. One factor here is just magical thinking on the part of liberals, along with the continual frustration of losing elections to an opponent who combines troglodyte social views with discredited economic fantasies and a paranoid, mythological foreign policy. (Let\u2019s leave aside, for the moment, that on the latter two questions the Democrats are only marginally better.) Wouldn\u2019t it be a nicer country if the nasty Republicans, and the millions of citizens who vote for them, simply went away?\n\nStill, there really are significant divisions within the GOP, as the party\u2019s panicked post-2012 retreat on immigration reform, and the humiliating aftermath of the government shutdown, have made clear. (With lightning speed, Ted Cruz went from Our Next President to Our Next Prime-Time Fox News Host.) To the immense frustration of the Republican establishment in Washington, the party faithful have repeatedly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by nominating some Tea Party zealot or Christian flat-earther who blunders away a potentially winnable statewide election by saying something stupid about women and sex. As things stand, the Republicans have a good chance of retaking the Senate majority in this year\u2019s midterm elections, even though they have no coherent policies on any major issue and their only platform is to run out the clock on the Obama administration and hope against hope they can beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Amazingly enough, if it weren\u2019t for their propensity to commit ritual suicide in close elections, the Republicans would already hold the Senate majority, in all likelihood.\n\nTo a large extent, the predictions of a GOPocalypse that\u2019s coming someday soon but not right now are based on observable political and demographic factors I don\u2019t need to explore at any length here. As John Judis and Ruy Teixeira argued 12 years ago in \u201cThe Emerging Democratic Majority,\u201d long-term shifts in the American population, as the country grows steadily more diverse and more metropolitan, would seem to favor the Democrats. And there\u2019s no question that the Republican Party of 2014 is a peculiar coalition of groups with distinct worldviews and ideologies that don\u2019t always overlap: The corporate overlords and 1-percenters, the burn-it-down Tea Partyers, the decaying but still vocal \u201cChristian conservatives\u201d and the Ayn Rand libertarians are united only by a strident rhetoric of American exceptionalism, a professed dislike of big government, and by what we might call the identity politics of whiteness. They can all agree that they hate Obamacare (for varying reasons) and view the presidency of its author as a continuing nightmare. But they disagree about almost everything else.\n\nAnother factor in forecasting Republican doom, I think, is the dim historical sense that political parties are not necessarily permanent phenomena, and that we\u2019ve had various permutations of a two-party system throughout American history. Four American presidents belonged to the Whig Party \u2014 actually, the number is six if you count Abraham Lincoln and Rutherford B. Hayes, who were prominent Whigs before they became Republicans \u2014 and that\u2019s been gone for more than 150 years. The Federalist Party, our nation\u2019s very first, barely limped into the 19th century and was dissolved in 1824. What historians now call the Democratic-Republican Party (technically an ancestor to both of today\u2019s major parties) dominated national politics for more than 20 years and then abruptly split apart. Couldn\u2019t some version of what happened to them happen to today\u2019s Republican Party?\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty obvious that the answer is no, or maybe no with an asterisk. But history still has some interesting lessons to offer in this regard. The facetious explanation for why it can\u2019t happen is also partly a true answer: The Whigs and the Federalists never had a website. They didn\u2019t spend millions of dollars a year on branding and consultants; they didn\u2019t have thousands of employees, and millions of volunteers, who were deeply committed to their party\u2019s name, heritage, symbolism and mythology.\n\nGenerally speaking, political parties die when they suffer an abrupt and massive loss of popular support (which was what was happened to the Federalists), or become divided and paralyzed by issue they can\u2019t resolve. That\u2019s what befell the Whigs, in most respects a liberal, modernizing, reform-minded party that could never decide what position to take on slavery. Today\u2019s Republicans, you might say, face both dangers in the long term, having decisively lost two consecutive presidential elections and facing a mine-studded landscape of contentious issues they\u2019d rather not deal with, including women\u2019s reproductive rights, same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and (especially) immigration reform.\n\nBut I don\u2019t believe either of today\u2019s parties is likely to break up or fade away, 19th-century style. Every few years someone makes a semi-serious effort to launch a new political party of the right or left or center \u2014 from Henry Wallace to George Wallace, Ross Perot to Ralph Nader \u2014 and they always end up disappearing or being absorbed. The two-party system is baked into American politics at this point, but just because the two parties have familiar names doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re always the same thing. You don\u2019t have to have a political science degree to understand that today\u2019s Republican Party has nothing in common with the one that nominated Lincoln in 1860, and very little in common with the one that nominated Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. Intra-Republican discord does suggest the birth of a possible new alignment in American politics, which may someday be called the \u201cSeventh Party System.\u201d\n\nWhile not all historians agree about this (since their job is to disagree about things), there\u2019s a commonly used division of American political history into five or six distinct periods. The First Party System prevailed from the birth of partisan politics in the new republic, around 1792, and lasted less than 30 years. As distant as the conflict between Alexander Hamilton\u2019s Federalists and the opposition led by Thomas Jefferson (usually called the Republicans at the time) now seems, many of the issues sound familiar. The Federalists, based in New England, favored a strong executive, a strong central government and especially a central bank and a national economic policy. The Jeffersonian Republicans, while they claimed to identify with the ideals of the French Revolution, had their roots in the plantation South, favored an extremely limited central government and a literal-minded reading of the Constitution, and presented themselves as apostles of individual freedom (as long as those individuals were propertied white men). Set aside your prejudices about Hamilton as a right-winger and Jefferson as the father of democracy and those sound a heck of a lot like today\u2019s Democrats and Republicans, respectively.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It would take a huge defeat or a civil war to kill the GOP -- but its dysfunction may augur a new political era", "title": "Will the Republicans go the way of the Whigs?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It would take a huge defeat or a civil war to kill the GOP -- but its dysfunction may augur a new political era", "title": "Will the Republicans go the way of the Whigs?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/22/will_the_republicans_go_the_way_of_the_whigs/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/lincoln_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It would take a huge defeat or a civil war to kill the GOP -- but its dysfunction may augur a new political era", "title": "Will the Republicans go the way of the Whigs?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/lincoln_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abraham Lincoln, American History, American Politics, Democratic Party, Franklin D.
