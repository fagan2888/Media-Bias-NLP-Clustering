Ted Cruz is spending the day in New Hampshire, rubbing elbows with voters. At Nashua City Hall this morning. Cruz spoke with about 50 GOP activists at a New Hampshire Republican Party get out the vote rally.\n\nBefore and after his talk, a number of activists encouraged him to run for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a state that I\u2019m thrilled to have a chance to be back in and visit with the good people here,\u201d he told reporters when asked whether that\u2019s on his mind as he makes his second visit to New Hampshire as a senator. \u201cWe have a national debate right now about the direction this country is going in. and New Hampshire is going to be front and center as part of that national debate.\u201d\n\nDoes he feel that New Hampshire would welcome him in 2016?\n\n\u201cThis is a state that believes in the principle of live free or die. And I\u2019ve got to got to say, that is a proposition that Texans understand.\u201d\n\nHe also weighed in on the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. That, he said, does \u201cnot remotely\u201d end the debate over Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats demanded her head to try to change the subject,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firing Kathleen Sebelius does nothing to help the millions of people who\u2019ve lost their jobs\u201d or been forced into part-time work or who face \u201cskyrocketing\u201d insurance premiums.\n\nHe also took credit for the Obama administration\u2019s decision Friday to refuse a visa to Iran\u2019s pick for ambassador to the United Nations. Hamid Aboutalebi worked as a translator for the militant student group that stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held Americans hostage for 444 days.\n\nCruz worked with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on a bill that sailed through the Senate earlier this week and then cleared the House, barring the envoy. Cruz called the outcome \u201ca terrific demonstration of how the political process could work.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s choice \u201cwas a deliberate slap in the face. That was an insult. That was meant to be a direct provocation.\u201d\n\nSo, he said, \u201cI was very, very pleased to see yesterday the White House announced that we\u2019re going to deny the visa and not allow somebody who participated in taking Americans hostage to move to New York City, to live in Manhattan with diplomatic immunity. That was the right thing to do and I\u2019m very pleased to see the president did the right thing.\u201d\n\nCruz attended a similar rally in Manchester before heading to the New Hampshire Freedom Summit, a conservative gathering organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.\n\nSen. Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee are among the other potential 2016 contenders appearing at the event.\n\nAs for that baby in the photo, Clare Sanborn. Cruz spotted the 17-month-old after his talk to GOP activists at a park in Manchester and made a beeline, playfully chasing her around a tree. Her mom, Molly Sanborn of Concord, 34, chairs the New Hampshire Young Republicans and chatted with Cruz briefly. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful. He\u2019s so personable and sincere,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNC80MTk4NC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
