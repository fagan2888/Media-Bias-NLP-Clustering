Refurbished PATCO train cars return to service at the Woodcrest Station for ceremonial trip to Philadelphia on Thursday, May 28, 2015.

A gas main break disrupted PATCO and N.J. Transit train service and prompted officials to briefly close the New Jersey Turnpike between Exits 3 and 4.

Authorities said at about 1:15 p.m. Friday that service was resuming and roads were reopening.

PATCO service had been suspended east of Woodcrest due to the main break. Some delays were expected as service resumes.

Also suspended was service on N.J. Transit's Atlantic City Rail Line between Philadelphia's 30th Street Station and Lindenwold.

Cherry Hill police said the main break also closed roads in the nearby Woodcrest section.

The turnpike service area on the affected stretch of the highway was also closed, police said.
