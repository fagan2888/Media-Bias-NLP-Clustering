But many elderly Hmong patients weren\u2019t following her orders.\n\n\u201cThose of us who are working really hard to reach the elderly Hmong have kind of a fatalist sense for some of them,\u201d said Culhane-Pera, a doctor with Westside Community Health Services in St. Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can to support them, but we\u2019re not on the same road.\u201d\n\nThe doctor\u2019s experience reflects a disparity in the health of minority groups in Minnesota \u2014 particularly among its \u201cNew American\u201d immigrant populations \u2014 that has only been guessed at until now. A report released last week by MN Community Measurement went beyond the prior comparisons of whites, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups, and instead looked at health outcomes for patients based on their national origins and preferred languages.\n\nDoctors agreed over the past three years to ask patients about their national and ethnic origins and input the data into electronic medical records. The nonprofit Community Measurement organization found some unexpected trends there.\n\nOne was that 52 percent of Vietnamese-speaking diabetics were in optimal health \u2014 meaning they didn\u2019t smoke, they took daily aspirin, and their blood sugar and blood pressure levels were under control. By comparison, only 39 percent of their English-speaking peers were at optimal health.\n\nAmong diabetics who prefer to speak Hmong, only 26 percent were at optimal health.\n\nThe gap between the Vietnamese and Hmong populations surprised some health care officials, but Culhane-Pera said there are important differences between the two Asian immigrant populations that help explain it.\n\nThe Hmong came from more of a rural, agricultural lifestyle with an oral tradition of storytelling rather than the written word. Some older Hmong patients had very limited \u201cnumerical literacy,\u201d she added, which can make it challenging when explaining that they have blood sugar levels of 13 milligrams per deciliter and need to get them down to 7.\n\nThe notion of taking medication, even when feeling healthy, can be foreign as well, said Mollie O\u2019Brien, program manager for health equity at Allina Health. \u201cIn their worldview, there isn\u2019t sort of a concept of chronic illness, that they\u2019re taking a medication for life.\u201d\n\nMay Yia Yang ignored her diabetes diagnosis, made shortly after her arrival in the U.S. in 1976, but her health deteriorated over time and she left her job in medical assembly one day in 1999 because she was so sick.\n\n\u201cWhen I lived in Laos, we didn\u2019t have a doctor,\u201d she said through an interpreter. \u201cI really didn\u2019t understand what diabetes was. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nMinnesota has long been known for its top health, but also as a state with one of the widest gaps between the health of its white majority and minority populations. Signs of change \u2014 or at least attempts at change \u2014 are emerging.\n\nIn a test program last year, Allina eliminated a racial disparity in colorectal cancer screening at its Plymouth clinic by sending home stool test kits to patients from minority groups that have typically refrained from invasive medical screening procedures.\n\nSide effects of inequities\n\nIn annual reports and legislative testimony, state health officials have argued that white, healthy Minnesotans should care about health inequities because they affect the vitality of the state\u2019s workforce and the amount of health insurance premiums and state taxes that they pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an essential challenge for Minnesota as a whole if we are going to continue to be a healthy and prosperous state,\u201d Dr. Ed Ehlinger, state health commissioner, said in testimony Wednesday to the Senate Health, Human Services and Housing Committee. \u201cEverybody should have the opportunity to be healthy, regardless of your ZIP code, your race, your ethnicity, your language, your sexual preference.\u201d\n\nThe Community Measurement data could present opportunities for improvement by identifying successful minority groups. For instance, Vietnamese-speakers with vascular disease also were among the healthiest.\n\nVietnamese Social Services of Minnesota provides regular forums for diabetics on healthy eating tips, such as reducing rice intake or substituting healthier wild rice in recipes, said Dung Pham, health program manager for the St. Paul-based organization.\n\n\u201cWe ask people to eat more fruits and vegetables. Lots of Vietnamese and Karen people [from Myanmar] are unfamiliar with American fruit,\u201d Pham said.\n\nIf community supports make a difference, efforts in the Hmong community also should be working. Westside Community Health now employs a Hmong doctor and Hmong educators for monthly diabetes classes. Information on diabetes has been converted to audio and video to respect the Hmong oral communication tradition.\n\nLimits of the study\n\nCulhane-Pera said the Community Measurement report is limited. Two populations with the worst health outcomes are the Hmong and Somalis, who also happen to have higher rates of poverty. It\u2019s possible the poor outcomes are less about cultural resistance to health care and more about the struggle to afford insurance premiums and copays for prescriptions and office visits.\n\nDiabetics who prefer to speak native languages are probably older, first-generation immigrants, Culhane-Pera added. The disparity in health outcomes might not look as severe when comparing the second and third generations. Some have entered health care professions, which might make their elders more comfortable with American medical care.\n\nDr. Nam Ho was born in 1976, the year after his Vietnamese parents arrived in the U.S. Now many Vietnamese patients seek his care.\n\n\u201cI was born here and know Vietnamese and can understand what they\u2019re saying,\u201d said Ho, who works in Fairview\u2019s Brooklyn Park Clinic. But he still uses a translator for Vietnamese-speaking patients to make sure they understand their health information.\n\nMay Yia Yang, 72, has lived with diabetes for 40 years since her diagnosis. Some of her friends have remained in denial about the dangers of the disease, and some have died prematurely. She says she feels a responsibility to stick with her meds and daily walks outside or on a treadmill, and to encourage friends to face up to the disease.\n\n\u201cI believe that they know and they understand what diabetes is,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they just refuse to take the medication. I try to convince them every time we have group meetings or when I seem them. I always share my experience, that, in the past, I didn\u2019t believe it either.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Study compares health by national origin and native language.
