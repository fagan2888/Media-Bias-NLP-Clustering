(AP) - There are generals and regular grunts in this group, men who were drafted into military service as well as those who hated mandatory retirement.\n\nBut no one pulls rank at Veterans Breakfast Club of Fredericksburg meetings, held once a month at the Cracker Barrel in Central Park.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s more good-natured ribbing than saluting and as many war stories on the menu as bacon and eggs.\n\nPaul Galanti travels from Richmond for the monthly get-togethers. During the Vietnam War, he spent almost seven years as a prisoner of war in the infamous \u201cHanoi Hilton,\u201d the same accommodations Sen. John McCain had.\n\nA former commissioner for the Virginia Department of Veterans Service, Galanti speaks to various groups about his harrowing experience. Many are awe-struck, but rough-and-ready Marines put a somewhat different spin on his imprisonment.\n\n\u201cOne Marine said I was the luckiest son-of-a-gun_and that\u2019s paraphrasing,\u201d Galanti told the breakfast club. \u201cHe said I only had to do one cruise, then I got to do offshore duty for seven years, in a gated community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd with catering service,\u201d chimed in Ed Boyd, a first sergeant with the Spotsylvania Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cThe Marines haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nBoyd spent 18 years in the Marine Corps and has been with the Spotsylvania department for 19 years. He started coming after meeting Charlie McGhee, who\u2019s 88 and the oldest member of the group.\n\nMcGhee told Boyd he has breakfast \u201cwith a bunch of distinguished fellows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs he started describing them to me, I said, \u2018They sure are,\u2019 \u201d Boyd said.\n\nMcGhee is no slouch. He pitched with the Braves for three years when they were still in Boston, then served 35 years with the Army and 20 years with the FBI.\n\nAdd up the military service of all those around the table and it probably tops 200 years, said Max Garland, a Korean War veteran who organized the group.\n\nThe men represent all branches of the service. Frank Pacello earned three Purple Hearts for combat injuries during the Vietnam War. He took a hit to the shoulder from an AK-47 and had a grenade blow up in front of him.\n\nStill, his dark eyes twinkled when he talked about his 25 years with the Marine Corps.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was a good career,\u201d he said.\n\nGene Taylor was drafted in the Army during the Vietnam War and served two years as a medic. But he carried on a family tradition: his father was a scout and sniper during World War II, and his grandfather, a soldier in France during World War I.\n\nSeveral men have defended their country and their communities, first in the military and then in law enforcement. Jack Lohmeyer did triple duty: as a Navy captain, Internal Revenue Service agent and Virginia State Police trooper.\n\nThere are two Army generals among the 15 regulars: Maj. Gen. Daniel \u201cChip\u201d Long and Maj. Gen. Carroll Childers.\n\nChilders faced mandatory retirement after 44 years in the service, but Long\u2019s duty was extended after \u201cthe world changed after 9/11,\u201d Childers said.\n\nLong was called up for several active-duty assignments, served as the adjutant general of Virginia and was able to stay in uniform for more than 50 years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most fortunate guy in the world,\u201d Childers said, in all seriousness.\n\nMcGhee likes to point out that he was a first sergeant with the Virginia National Guard, the one who enlisted Long into the service.\n\n\u201cI knew right away he was going to be a good man,\u201d McGhee said, and the joke made it around the table that McGhee taught \u201cthe general\u201d everything he knows.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he taught me everything, but he taught me a lot,\u201d Long said.\n\nLater, as others jokingly pointed out the parts they played in Long\u2019s distinguished career, Long smirked and added: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for these guys, I wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much useless.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hicks said he\u2019s often in awe of the history made by those around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here, with my mouth open listening to them,\u201d he said.\n\nHicks said his service of six years in the Air Force often pales in comparison to the others. Yet, there\u2019s no bragging at the table, just camaraderie among those who have shared similar experiences.\n\n\u201cWe basically leave any egos and former military ranks at the door,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are generals and regular grunts in this group, men who were drafted into military service as well as those who hated mandatory retirement.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There are generals and regular grunts in this group, men who were drafted into military service as well as those who hated mandatory retirement.", "title": "Veterans meet monthly to share stories, good-natured ribbing", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/veterans-meet-monthly-to-share-stories-good-nature/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/11/veterans_breakfast.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/11/veterans_breakfast.jpeg", "description": "There are generals and regular grunts in this group, men who were drafted into military service as well as those who hated mandatory retirement.", "card": "summary", "title": "Veterans meet monthly to share stories, good-natured ribbing"}, "Author": "CATHY DYSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Cracker Barrel"}, "article_summary": "But he carried on a family tradition: his father was a scout and sniper during World War II, and his grandfather, a soldier in France during World War I.\nDuring the Vietnam War, he spent almost seven years as a prisoner of war in the infamous \u201cHanoi Hilton,\u201d the same accommodations Sen.
