Pai argues that the regulations will ultimately harm consumers by raising the cost of Internet service.\n\n\u201cI think what you are seeing is companies less willing to spend money building broadband that is faster and better and cheaper to your homes and businesses,\u201d Pai told The Daily Signal in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that year-over-year investment in broadband has gone down, outside the tech bubble bursting in 2001 and the Great Recession of 2008,\u201d Pai continued. \u201cThe fact it coincides with the FCC adopting these heavy-handed regulations, I think, is directly related. And that\u2019s unfortunate for American consumers, especially in rural areas where the business case for building our broadband is already tough as it is.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to Pai\u2019s assertion, Kim Hart, the press secretary for FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, denied that net neutrality has affected investment in broadband.\n\n\u201cChairman Wheeler has long said that strong open Internet rules using a light-touch Title II regime would promote innovation and investment from broadband providers and edge providers alike, benefiting consumers,\u201d Hart wrote in an emailed statement to The Daily Signal. \u201cWireline and wireless investment and deployment continues, consistent with our expectations.\u201d\n\nWheeler doubled down on that assertion when he and his fellow FCC commissioners testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing a decline in broadband infrastructure investment,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cYou can say it, and say it, and say it, but that doesn\u2019t make it a fact.\u201d\n\nWheeler added that more people are using the Internet since the regulations went into effect last June, which he says has driven an increase in Internet service providers\u2019 average revenue per user. Pai contends that the higher revenue shows that providers are charging broadband consumers more.\n\nThe net neutrality rules reclassify high-speed Internet service as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.\n\nThe concept of net neutrality is that leading Internet providers like Verizon and Comcast should not play favorites with the content on their networks, such as Hulu and Netflix, based on what these services are able to pay the provider.\n\nWhile the FCC refers to its new authority as a \u201clight touch\u201d regulatory framework since the agency will not get directly involved in price-setting, the rules prohibit Internet service providers from charging content providers for quicker delivery of their content on \u201cfast lanes\u201d and from deliberately slowing content for those who can\u2019t afford that.\n\nIn February of 2015, the FCC passed net neutrality 3-2 along party lines, with supporters arguing that prohibiting Internet service providers from discriminating against content will ensure that start-ups and entrepreneurs can have equal access to broadband networks, meaning consumers will have more content and application options.\n\nOutside observers say it\u2019s difficult to directly relate investment levels with the net neutrality rules, since they have been enforced for such a short period of time.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a case to be made that investment is down,\u201d said James Speta, a telecommunications and Internet policy expert at Northwestern University. \u201cThere is also a case to be made that macro factors and industry factors are driving this, not net neutrality. It is very hard to disentangle the effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question with respect to whether a decrease in investment matters is whether it\u2019s associated with a decrease in competition,\u201d Speta told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut if you have a small rural cable company serving as an area\u2019s principal provider, and they are engaging in less investment, that\u2019s not a decrease in competition. It does not affect the number of players in the market.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Speta said it\u2019s challenging to contextualize current trends in the content side of the market.\n\n\u201cOn the content innovation side, you have new players coming in, along with HBO starting to allow subscription-only service, ESPN getting all its content online, and Netflix growing its diversity of offers,\u201d Speta said. \u201cThere seems to be a robust, innovative content and applications market, but I cannot say with any certainty if that\u2019s because of open Internet rules.\u201d\n\nThe FCC is currently grappling with a test whose outcome would more definitively affect consumers.\n\nThe FCC is exploring whether new services from Internet providers Comcast, T-Mobile, and AT&T violate net neutrality rules.\n\nFor example, Comcast, through its own streaming service StreamTV, allows its cable customers the ability to watch online videos for free and not have that content count toward customers\u2019 monthly data limits. Streaming through an outside service such Netflix, however, would still count toward data limits.\n\nSome critics say unlimited streaming, known as zero-rating, is unfair. Whatever the FCC decides, consumers will feel it, Speta said.\n\n\u201cIf the FCC says, no, it is not consistent with the open Internet order to have zero-rating, that is something they will notice, and should notice, when those services disappear in the marketplace,\u201d Speta said. \u201cConsumers like zero-rating services.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard arguments on the legality of FCC rules in December, and the three-judge panel is expected to issue its ruling this spring.\n\nThe issue is likely to go before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition, Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and others introduced legislation last week to repeal net neutrality entirely.\n\nPai argues that the legacy of net neutrality will depend on whether the courts decide that it is legal\u2014and how future FCCs choose to enforce, or potentially expand, the rules if they are confirmed.\n\n\u201cThe net neutrality decision opens the door for the FCC imposing a tax on anybody who accesses the Internet,\u201d Pai said. \u201cThe last thing American consumers want is more expensive Internet access, but that\u2019s what the FCC may soon give them.\u201d\n\nSpeta agrees that a future FCC could impose an Internet tax in the future, but he says it\u2019s doubtful in a contested political environment.\n\n\u201cCommissioner Pai is right\u2014if the FCC wins the D.C. Circuit case, and wins reclassification of the Internet under Title II, that gives the FCC the legal authority to do things it couldn\u2019t do, such as rate regulations and universal services taxes,\u201d Speta said.\n\n\u201cThe FCC has tried to impose a light form of Title II, but if they win the reclassification case, a next FCC could do even more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One year after the Federal Communications Commission imposed net neutrality open Internet rules, observers are measuring their impact.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One year after the Federal Communications Commission imposed net neutrality open Internet rules, observers are measuring their impact.", "title": "After 1 Year, the Effects of the Net Neutrality Regulations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/netneutrality1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T21:21:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1nimpbb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One year after the Federal Communications Commission imposed net neutrality open Internet rules, observers are measuring their impact.", "title": "After 1 Year, the Effects of the Net Neutrality Regulations", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/netneutrality1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2016-03-02T17:13:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T21:21:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "net neutrality, open Internet, FCC, broadband, Comcast, Netflix, AT&T, Tom Wheeler, Ajit Pai, zero-rating"}, "article_summary": "The net neutrality rules reclassify high-speed Internet service as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.\n\u201cThere is also a case to be made that macro factors and industry factors are driving this, not net neutrality.\nThe FCC is exploring whether new services from Internet providers Comcast, T-Mobile, and AT&T violate net neutrality rules.\n\u201cThe net neutrality decision opens the door for the FCC imposing a tax on anybody who accesses the Internet,\u201d Pai said.\nMike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and others introduced legislation last week to repeal net neutrality entirely."}
