Curtis M. Scaparrotti, the head of U.S. forces in Korea.\n\nRelated: How to Blast Billions from the DOD Budget\n\nJapan has also been considering adding THAAD to boost its own missile defenses.\n\nOne THAAD system costs $800 million. That price tag, and lingering questions about the system\u2019s effectiveness against long-range rockets, has led Washington to buy only five of the weapons, much to the dismay of missile defense proponents.\n\nWashington deployed one of its five THAAD systems to Guam in 2013 following another round of North Korean belligerence. South Korean officials have resisted previous efforts to place the weapons system on their territory because THAAD\u2019s radar systems would be able to scan territory that includes mainland China, a no-go with Beijing.\n\nHowever, China hasn\u2019t weighed in on North Korea\u2019s latest provocation, and talk of putting a U.S. missile defense system on the country\u2019s doorstep could be a ploy to force Beijing to take a stronger hand with Pyongyang.\n\nThe rocket launch seeped into the presidential campaign in the U.S. over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWith respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said during Saturday night\u2019s GOP debate, a line echoed by other White House hopefuls and congressional Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "North Korea\u2019s rocket launch this weekend has prompted the United States and South Kore", "title": "The $800 Million Weapon the US Wants to Send to South Korea", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/800-Million-Weapon-US-Wants-Send-South-Korea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/THAAD_Launcher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/800-Million-Weapon-US-Wants-Send-South-Korea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/THAAD_Launcher.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "North Korea\u2019s rocket launch this weekend has prompted the United States and South Kore", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "South Korea wants them,\u201d Sen.
