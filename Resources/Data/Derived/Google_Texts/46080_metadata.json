But under Mr. Obama, the economy has stalled and job growth has remained stagnant, and those who have given up the search for work have been pushed to take food stamps to survive, the outlet found.\n\nSome of the demographic change is due to couples having fewer children, the Associated Press said. Regardless, the fact that now working age people top the list of food stamp recipients is historic for the nation.\n\nAnd the statistic suggests that the $80 billion taxpayers now pay for the program won\u2019t be trimmed back any time soon. That $80 million is double the amount of money funneled to the program just five years ago.\n\nBroken down further, the stats show that since 1980, the segment of the working population that\u2019s seen the biggest jump in taking food stamps is the partially college educated, or America\u2019s former middle class, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cA low-wage job supplemented with food stamps is becoming more common for the working poor,\u201d Timothy Smeeding, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told AP. \u201cMany of the U.S. jobs now being created are low- or minimum-wage \u2014 part-time or in areas such as retail or fast food \u2014 which means food stamp use will stay high for some time, even after unemployment improves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economy under President Obama has changed so dramatically that food stamps are no longer given mostly to the very old or the very young, but rather to working class and working age individuals.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The economy under President Obama has changed so dramatically that food stamps are no longer given mostly to the very old or the very young, but rather to working class and working age individuals.", "title": "Face of food stamps under Obama changes from elderly to working age", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/27/face-food-stamps-under-obama-changes-elderly-worki/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/26/food-stamps-income-inequalityjpeg-0df9b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/26/food-stamps-income-inequalityjpeg-0df9b.jpg", "description": "The economy under President Obama has changed so dramatically that food stamps are no longer given mostly to the very old or the very young, but rather to working class and working age individuals.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Face of food stamps under Obama changes from elderly to working age"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
