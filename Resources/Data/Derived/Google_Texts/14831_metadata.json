Why? Because Obamacare \u201chasn\u2019t brought in nearly as much money as it needs to pay out.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for insurance companies, they have enrolled higher numbers of older and sicker customers than anticipated. The Obama Administration promised the insurers federal funds \u201cto help cover their costs, through a program known as risk corridors.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the program was supposed to work:\n\nIf a health plan found itself with at least 3 percent more medical claims than it had anticipated, the government would reimburse it for half of those losses. If claims surpassed expectations by more than 8 percent, the government would pay 80 percent of the losses.\n\nHowever, \u201cthe law requires the program to be budget-neutral, meaning that if there aren\u2019t adequate funds, insurers have to go without.\u201d There\u2019s the fine print that is the crux of the problem.\n\nThe response from the insurance industry (hoping to see a boon to their bottom line under Obamacare) was harsh and swift.\n\n\u201cStable, affordable coverage for consumers depends on adequate funding of the risk corridor program,\u201d said Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that Congress and CMS act to ensure the program works as designed and consumers are protected.\u201d\n\nNotice the line, \u201cstable, affordable coverage for consumers.\u201d Many Obamacare enrollees would say that coverage has been anything but stable and affordable so far. Rates for plans offered through Obamacare are continuing to climb, and that doesn\u2019t seem likely to change. With the loss of these expected funds to help prop up the bottom line of these insurers, further price increases in Obamacare plans are certain.\n\nThere is a ray of hope, if only a tiny one, as the Obama Administration said that insurers will \u201ceventually\u201d get their money. That\u2019s likely little consolation to insurers if the federal government\u2019s track record is considered. One only has to look to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), passed in 1975. During the years 1981-2010, states were shorted over $250 billion promised to them under the new law, but were of course still expected to comply.\n\nWith a mounting national debt of over $18 trillion, Washington\u2019s ability to keep its promises isn\u2019t likely to improve any time soon, and customers are likely going to continue to see higher premiums, larger deductibles, and smaller networks \u2013 exactly the opposite of what was promised under Obamacare.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
