It seems that fact has not gone unnoticed to the meme makers of the Internet.\n\nHere are five tasteless gems we have found involving Andrew Jackson and his treatment of Indians.\n\nMost of these memes refer to Jackson\u2019s signing of the Indian Removal Act just one year after taking office. The act legalized ethnic cleansing and led to the Trail of Tears.\n\nThis meme especially refers to the Indian Removal Act, and the Trail of Tears. The Cherokee were forced from their homelands east of the Mississippi to Oklahoma, and their land was then used by white colonists to grow cotton.\n\nThis one may need some explaining. Jackson had a pet parrot named Poll, who was reportedly removed from Jackson\u2019s funeral for cursing. We\u2019ll blame the parrot for this meme then.\n\nRELATED: 4 Reasons to Boycott the $20 Bill\n\nRELATED: Indian-Killer Andrew Jackson Deserves Top Spot on List of Worst U.S. Presidents", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here are five tasteless memes we have found involving Andrew Jackson and his treatment of Indians.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/19/5-tasteless-andrew-jackson-memes-157238", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/default/files/uploads/jackson-meme-rules.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "5 Tasteless Andrew Jackson Memes"}, "abstract": "Here are five tasteless memes we have found involving Andrew Jackson and his treatment of Indians.", "keywords": "Andrew Jackson, Indian Removal Act of 1830, Trail of Tears, Native American History", "dc": {"title": "5 Tasteless Andrew Jackson Memes"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/19/5-tasteless-andrew-jackson-memes-157238", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-19T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "5 Tasteless Andrew Jackson Memes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2366\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: 4 Reasons to Boycott the $20 BillRELATED: Indian-Killer Andrew Jackson Deserves Top Spot on List of Worst U.S. Presidents\nHere are five tasteless gems we have found involving Andrew Jackson and his treatment of Indians.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Andrew Jackson is our least favorite president due to his treatment of Native Americans.\nMost of these memes refer to Jackson\u2019s signing of the Indian Removal Act just one year after taking office.\nThis meme especially refers to the Indian Removal Act, and the Trail of Tears."}
