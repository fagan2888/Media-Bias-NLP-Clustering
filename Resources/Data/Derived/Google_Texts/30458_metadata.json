That\u2019s just after Michigan\u2019s legislature approved the Healthy Michigan bill in late August, and just before Governor Rick Snyder signed it into law on September 16.\n\n\u201cIt has been fascinating to watch as the key leaders from both political parties have come to agreement on the specific provisions of this new law, and it will be equally important to understand how expansion plays out and affects the health of Michiganders and the Michigan economy,\u201d says Ayanian, who heads an institute that includes more than 400 health care researchers from across U-M and partner organizations.\n\n\u201cAs a primary care physician and as a health researcher, I have seen how insurance coverage can help people\u2019s health and finances , especially for those with serious conditions such as diabetes and depression,\u201d adds Ayanian, who is a professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School. \u201cMichigan\u2019s expansion was driven by a sense of community and compassion and by economic realities. That\u2019s a combination that other states can consider as they debate whether to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nIn the article, which will be published in print on November 7, he lays out the long debate that led Michigan to agree to accept funds under the federal Affordable Care Act to offer Medicaid coverage to low-income adults. He also examines the main provisions of the law.\n\nThe blend of approaches adopted by Michigan could help other states that are still pondering Medicaid expansion, he says \u2013 especially states where Republicans hold the majority of seats in one or both houses as well as the governorship. It could also be a model for future efforts to refine the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Healthy Michigan plan includes market-oriented reforms and provisions that will limit the Medicaid expansion\u2019s impact on the state budget if certain benchmarks aren\u2019t hit when the federal government\u2019s share of the funding decreases to 95 percent in 2017 and 90 percent in 2021.\n\nSpecifically, he points to the plan\u2019s provision that Michigan can withdraw from the Medicaid expansion in 2017 or later if the state\u2019s share of the cost has not been offset by savings in other areas of health care, such as the expected savings in prison health costs and mental health costs that have been predicted.\n\nSome of Michigan\u2019s new Medicaid enrollees will also be responsible for shouldering a share of their health costs up to 5 percent of their income, though their share will be lower if they engage in healthy behaviors.\n\nAnd, since the new enrollees will be required to have health savings accounts and will be enrolled exclusively in privately run managed-care plans, which must cover primary care and preventive services and can earn bonuses for controlling costs, Michigan will be a test-bed for a number of market-oriented Medicaid reforms.\n\nAyanian also points to the requirement that plans use a concept called \u201cvalue-based insurance design\u201d when deciding how much individuals must pay out of pocket for their care.\n\nU-M researchers helped develop and test this concept, which lowers patients\u2019 costs for the services that can benefit each patient most, depending on their health status. Employers and large private insurers are also adopting the concept.
