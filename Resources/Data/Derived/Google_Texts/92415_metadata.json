Even then I was willing to hope his hubris might be tempered by a touch of humility.\n\nNot anymore. If you watched the \u201c60 minutes\u201d interview with Steve Kroft Sunday, you realize even those who have most pandered to this most pandered-to president (like Kroft) simply find what Mr. Obama says impossible to square with the world around us.\n\nThe disconnect is startling.\n\nThen, nudged ahead by a piece in The Hill, I read the first part of a discussion Mr. Obama had last month while he was in Iowa with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marilynne Robinson. The first part is up on the webpage of the New York Review of Books [www2.nybooks.com/articles/s3/2015/nov/05/president-obama-marilynne-robinson-conversation.html]. The second part, we\u2019re told, will be in the magazine\u2019s next issue.\n\nAs The Hill put it, \u201cObama has increasingly turned to unorthodox formats for media interviews in the final stretch of his presidency.\u201d Translated that means he wants to ask questions, rather than answer them, and in the process preen.\n\nIn this instance, he essentially interviewed Robinson, fishing for the right response to his leading questions so he could let us know how aggrieved he is and unfair American politics is to the noblest amongst us. (Hint: that would be him.)\n\nThe quote that has gotten the most traction had to do with his customary put down of conservation Christians. (I will offer a slightly longer quote for context.)\n\nThe President: But you\u2019ve struggled with the fact that here in the United States, sometimes Christian interpretation seems to posit an \u201cus versus them,\u201d and those are sometimes the loudest voices. But sometimes I think you also get frustrated with kind of the wishy-washy, more liberal versions where anything goes.\n\nRobinson: Yes.\n\nThe President: How do you reconcile the idea of faith being really important to you and you caring a lot about taking faith seriously with the fact that, at least in our democracy and our civic discourse, it seems as if folks who take religion the most seriously sometimes are also those who are suspicious of those not like them?\n\nThink about that for a few minutes. The President\u2019s lack of respect for Republicans extends back to his first meetings, the message of which was to them: I won, you lost.\n\nFlush with his own power, he offered a handful of gullible House Democrats bogus assurances to secure the final few votes for Obamacare, a transparently political move that allowed him to secure his \u201csignature\u201d domestic achievement without a single Republican vote.\n\nSuspicious of \u201cthem\u201d ? I would argue there hasn\u2019t been such an \u201cus versus them\u201d president since Richard Nixon.\n\nBut it\u2019s the remarks he made before that help us understand where he\u2019s headed and how he arrived there. (And I do not mean telling us in 2008, \u201cWe are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d Or after securing his party\u2019s nomination for President, modestly suggesting that \u201dthis was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\u201d)\n\nRobinson feeds Obama\u2019s conviction that there are people for whom there exists a \u201csinister other.\u201d She\u2019s referring to those she says \u201cwho never accept the argument that is made for a position that they don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\n\nObama agrees.\n\nThe President: Well, now there\u2019s been that strain in our democracy and in American politics for a long time. And it pops up every so often. I think the argument right now would be that because people are feeling the stresses of globalization and rapid change, and we went through one of the worst financial crises since the Great Depression, and the political system seems gridlocked, that people may be particularly receptive to that brand of politics.\n\n(Not surprisingly, it never dawns on the president that he might be one of the most receptive.)\n\nNever once in the conversation does Obama suggest that, if this is true, he might share some of the responsibility. In fact, just the opposite:\n\nI\u2019m always trying to push a little more optimism. Sometimes you get\u2014I think you get discouraged by it, and I tell you, well, we go through these moments.\n\nTo which Robinson, whom Obama awarded the 2012 National Humanities Medal, dutifully responds:\n\nBut when you say that to me, I say to you, you\u2019re a better person than I am.\n\nCan we avoid the obvious conclusion? That Obama might, just might, believe he\u2019s a better person than any of us, surely all of us who believe, for example, in the sanctity of unborn human life?\n\nThere are tons of jaw-dropping remarks from the president that are outside our single issue purview. They are useful as a way of understanding our 44th president.\n\nI would strongly suggest you read the exchange at nybooks.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/robinsonObama-300x200.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca35\"", "article_summary": "Never once in the conversation does Obama suggest that, if this is true, he might share some of the responsibility.\nThen, nudged ahead by a piece in The Hill, I read the first part of a discussion Mr. Obama had last month while he was in Iowa with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marilynne Robinson.\nThat Obama might, just might, believe he\u2019s a better person than any of us, surely all of us who believe, for example, in the sanctity of unborn human life?\nI would argue there hasn\u2019t been such an \u201cus versus them\u201d president since Richard Nixon.\nTo which Robinson, whom Obama awarded the 2012 National Humanities Medal, dutifully responds:But when you say that to me, I say to you, you\u2019re a better person than I am."}
