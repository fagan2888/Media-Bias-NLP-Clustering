First, with significant deflation at the producer level, real interest rates have risen sharply and are now relatively high. Even if interest rates are slashed to the bone, China may still face a serious 'zero lower bound' problem,\" Slater said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Chinese stocks rallied for their fifth successive day Monday to breach seven-year highs but growth prospects for the world's largest economy this year are yet to pick up according to economists.", "author": "Jenny Cosgrave", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Chinese stocks rallied for their fifth successive day Monday to breach seven-year highs but growth prospects for the world's largest economy are still weak.", "title": "China stocks hit 7-year high, but where's the growth?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/25/china-stocks-hit-7-year-high-but-economic-growth-is-still-missing.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/19/102691844-472565896.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chinese stocks rallied for their fifth successive day Monday to breach seven-year highs but growth prospects for the world's largest economy are still weak.", "title": "China stocks hit 7-year high, but where's the growth?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/25/china-stocks-hit-7-year-high-but-economic-growth-is-still-missing.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/19/102691844-472565896.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@jenny_cosgrave", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Asia: News, Shanghai, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-05-25T06:34:43-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Asia: News", "modified_time": "2015-05-25T07:06:40-0400", "tag": "Shanghai"}, "pageNodeId": 102705051, "news_keywords": "China stocks, Shanghai Composite, Chinese growth, China deflation, ETFs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10dd\"", "article_summary": "First, with significant deflation at the producer level, real interest rates have risen sharply and are now relatively high.\nEven if interest rates are slashed to the bone, China may still face a serious 'zero lower bound' problem,\" Slater said.\nRecently, China introduced a series of measures including rate cuts and reductions in reserve requirement ratios, or the amount of reserves commercial banks are required to hold, in an attempt to ease monetary conditions.\n\"There are constraints on Chinese policymakers too.\n\"We are optimistic that growth should at least stabilise, or downwards pressure on growth should at least should ease somewhat \u2013 but the long-run picture is on-going structural slowdown in investment and that is not going to reverse any time soon,\" he said, adding that in the next few years growth is set to slow further."}
