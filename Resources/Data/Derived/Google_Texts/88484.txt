Century Considers New Animal Control Law Banning Barnyard Animals

The Town of Century is considering a new animal control ordinance that will ban barnyard animals and livestock within most areas of the town.

If the town council approves the ordinance, it would immediately become illegal to keep any horse, mule, donkey, goat, sheep or cattle within the town limits, except on property zoned as agricultural.

The council will hold a first public reading of the ordinance during their regular meeting at 7 p.m. A second reading and public hearing will be held on November at 7 p.m., after which the council is scheduled to vote on the ordinance.
