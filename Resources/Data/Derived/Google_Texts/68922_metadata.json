Reuters could not independently verify this.\n\nThe five-year Syrian civil war has killed more than a quarter of a million people and created a massive refugee crisis in Lebanon, Turkey and the European Union.\n\nThe partial truce, drawn up by Washington and Moscow, came into force a week ago and has slowed the pace of the war, although it does not include Islamic State militants or the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.\n\nThe opposition is dissatisfied with the implementation of the deal and has yet to say whether it will attend the new talks. Fighting continues in many parts of Syria, and the rebels say the government has kept up attacks on strategically important frontlines.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 135 people were killed in areas covered by the 'cessation of hostilities' agreement since it came into force on Feb. 27. In areas not covered by the truce, 552 people were killed, said the Britain-based group, which tracks the conflict via sources on the ground.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a phone conversation late on Friday, called for a prompt start to the peace negotiations, Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The two sides called to start the negotiations as soon as possible... between the Syrian government and the whole spectrum of the opposition, during which the Syrians themselves should determine the future of their country,\" the ministry said.\n\nASSAD'S DEPARTURE\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, whose country backs the rebels, said on Saturday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must leave at the beginning of a political transition, not at the end.\n\n\"For us it is very clear it's at the beginning of the process, not at the end of the process, it's not going to be 18 months,\" Jubeir said during a visit to France.\n\nAssad, however, enjoys firm backing from Iran and Russia and his military position has strengthened, especially since Russia entered the war by launching waves of air strikes last September. The United States and other Western governments that previously called for the president's early departure have quietly backed away from that demand.\n\nDe Mistura attempted to convene peace talks in January, but these failed before they had even started in earnest. The new talks will be conducted indirectly, not face-to-face, he told Al Hayat.\n\nThe fall-off in violence has made aid deliveries easier in some areas of the country, but de Mistura said the Syrian government should be processing aid faster.\n\n\"Lorries are waiting for 36 hours,\" he said. \"And medical aid must be allowed.\"\n\nOn Wednesday the World Health Organization said Syrian officials had rejected the delivery of medical supplies, including trauma and burn kits and antibiotics, in a convoy to the besieged town of Moadamiya two days earlier.\n\nSyrian opposition coordinator Riad Hijab said on Friday conditions for talks were \"not favorable\" and medical and food supplies were being blocked despite the truce.\n\nOn Saturday, the opposition Syrian National Coalition, which is part of the main Saudi-backed opposition High Negotiations Committee, said it had named a new president.\n\nAnas Abda will replace Khaled Khoja as head of the group, the SNC said in a statement on its Twitter account.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut and Omar Fahmy in Cairo, Lidia Kelly in Moscow and Leigh Thomas in Paris; writing by Ros Russell; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - A total of 135 people were killed in the first week of a partial t", "title": "U.N. seeks to build peace talks on fragile Syria truce", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/05/UN-envoy-sees-staggered-start-Syria-peace-talks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-demistura_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/05/UN-envoy-sees-staggered-start-Syria-peace-talks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-demistura_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - A total of 135 people were killed in the first week of a partial t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday, the opposition Syrian National Coalition, which is part of the main Saudi-backed opposition High Negotiations Committee, said it had named a new president.\nSyrian opposition coordinator Riad Hijab said on Friday conditions for talks were \"not favorable\" and medical and food supplies were being blocked despite the truce.\nDe Mistura attempted to convene peace talks in January, but these failed before they had even started in earnest.\nA pro-Damascus Lebanese TV channel, al-Mayadeen, reported from its own sources that talks had been moved to March 13.\nThe opposition is dissatisfied with the implementation of the deal and has yet to say whether it will attend the new talks."}
