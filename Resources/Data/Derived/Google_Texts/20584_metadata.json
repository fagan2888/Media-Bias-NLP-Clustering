Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin\u2019s proposed 45-cent tobacco tax increase would generate roughly $79 million, and he has proposed a sales tax increase of up to 1 percent, as well as a repeal of the sales tax exemption for telecommunications services.\n\nRepublicans in both the House and Senate are overwhelmingly against tax increases of any kind, and Senate President and gubernatorial candidate Bill Cole, R-Mercer, said the gap could be closed through a combination of cuts, money from the state\u2019s Rainy Day Fund and sweeping accounts of reappropriated funds.\n\nTim Morris, the regional director for REM, a home and community-based health services provider, said that although he understands the position the state is in financially, the reality for health providers is also dire \u2014 many have also suffered from year-over-year budget cuts, and several smaller providers have been forced to close their doors in the last few months.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t throw in two minimum wage increases, Obamacare, increased regulations and cut rates and think that anybody is going to be left standing,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt gets done to this population a lot because they\u2019re not the teachers\u2019 union and they\u2019re not AARP; it happens because it can happen, and the sad part is that if we got the right people in the room and said \u2018We\u2019re going to lock ourselves in here until we figure this out,\u2019 we could figure this out.\u201d\n\nWVBHPA represents 26 of the more than 100 behavioral health care providers statewide that are already running on razor-thin margins \u2014 providers like Highland Hospital, who are treating people with increasingly serious mental illness who, if left alone, are far more likely to end up homeless or unemployed, according to Cynthia Persily, president and CEO of Highland Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cWhat I hear my staff saying every day is, \u2018We can\u2019t go any further and continue to provide high-quality care to patients who desperately need us,\u2019\u201d Persily said. \u201cIt\u2019s perpetuating that cycle of not having care services, which fuels all these other problems. Go into the justice system, go into the juvenile justice systems, problems in schools \u2014 all of those things are treatable, and we\u2019re treating them every day.\u201d\n\nSince the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, the question of how the state will absorb the cost of more than 170,000 new Medicaid patients has become another pressing issue, but one that both Persily and Morris said could be better addressed. Currently, the federal government matches state Medicaid dollars nearly 3 to 1, so that any cuts to the state\u2019s Medicaid budget means a three-fold loss in Medicaid dollars. Mark Drennan, executive director of the WVBHPA, noted that while community-based providers receive the Medicaid match, those who are institutionalized are paid for entirely by state dollars.\n\n\u201cWe understand that when you don\u2019t have money, you don\u2019t have money,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThe problem is, from my viewpoint, that if you get to the point where you\u2019re willing to cut from this population \u2014 from the most vulnerable population that needs it as much as anybody \u2014 and you\u2019re willing to do that to the point that you\u2019ll give up three times as much as you pay, that sends a message that we\u2019re doomed.\u201d\n\nDrennan said even a $1 tobacco tax increase, which would generate an estimated $115 million in additional revenue, wouldn\u2019t be enough to entirely bridge the budget gap, but other regulatory measures that affect behavioral health providers could be streamlined to help. The state\u2019s recent move to unbundle child residential services \u2014 forcing providers to bill separately for services that were once bundled together \u2014 replaces Medicaid dollars with state dollars and contributes to the state\u2019s fiscal issues, Drennan said.\n\nOther changes only require DHHR approval \u2014 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently changed a rule that will allow freestanding psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds, like Highland Hospital, to treat Medicaid recipients between the ages of 21 and 64, something the facility is currently barred from doing, Persily said.\n\n\u201cWhen the ACA was passed, there was a demonstration project that allowed freestanding psychiatric hospitals to be reimbursed for Medicaid; it lasted for three years and ended last May with no changes in policy, so for three years we could take care of Medicaid patients, and now we cannot,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you have then is beds that are sitting empty and people who need services, and what you also have is people backed up in emergency rooms waiting for a placement, because we can\u2019t use the 40 beds we have at Highland, or at River Park [in Huntington] for adults with Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAccording to Morris, another blow to funding for behavioral health could prove disastrous, and has the potential to create a cascade of closures as smaller agencies fold and increase the burden for larger ones like REM.\n\n\u201cWe take care of people 24 hours a day \u2014 when I first got into this business, for the first six months, every night I went to bed it occurred to me that I had 200 employees making a low wage, and all they\u2019d have to do is get mad and walk out in the middle of the night, leaving a vulnerable person alone, and we could be put out of business,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the money to pay the wages I feel comfortable with, and if we keep taking these hits ... you\u2019re seeing it with the smaller providers already, who have folded up, and it\u2019s working its way up.\u201d\n\nReach Lydia Nuzum at lydia.nuzum@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5189 or follow @lydianuzum on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports-mitch-vingle/20160524/mitch-vingle-examining-the-states-d-i-baseball-crop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg"}, "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop"}, "article_summary": "Currently, the federal government matches state Medicaid dollars nearly 3 to 1, so that any cuts to the state\u2019s Medicaid budget means a three-fold loss in Medicaid dollars.\n\u201cIt\u2019s perpetuating that cycle of not having care services, which fuels all these other problems.\nThe state\u2019s recent move to unbundle child residential services \u2014 forcing providers to bill separately for services that were once bundled together \u2014 replaces Medicaid dollars with state dollars and contributes to the state\u2019s fiscal issues, Drennan said.\nMembers of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association met with Gazette-Mail editors on Tuesday to talk about how the state\u2019s continued budget impasse, and the threat of more budget cuts, could hurt behavioral health providers in the state.\nLegislators began a special session Monday to decide how to address a $270 million shortfall in the 2016-2017 budget, with the governor and the Legislature at odds."}
