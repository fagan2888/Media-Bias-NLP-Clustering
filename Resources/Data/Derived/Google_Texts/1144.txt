Maybe they'll buy it.

Maybe they'll buy it.

The lines between satire and conservative political commentary can admittedly seem blurry at times, but this National Review piece yesterday is, as best as I can tell, intended to be serious. The author's goal is to condemn the international nuclear agreement with Iran, but the more salient point is to draw a parallel between the diplomatic solution and the Affordable Care Act.

Much like Obamacare, ObamaNuke is a high-priority, highly convoluted, highly opaque mess that is being ramrodded through Congress by dodgy means, even as the American people overwhelmingly reject what is being barge poled down their throats. "ObamaNuke," the National Review headline insists, "really is an Atomic Obamacare."

What must it be like inside the brain of a movement conservative? Judging by this nugget Steve Benen finds , pretty fucking bizarre.No, that's not. That's National Review. As Benen points out, this isn't the first time they've used Obamacare to condemn anything they hate, or rather anything Obama does or supports: net neutrality, education reform, clean energy proposals, Wall Street reform.

But here's the thing that makes this all so much more insane: Obamacare is working! Against all evidence, against the actual reality of millions of people who were uninsured now having health insurance, of Medicare finances being stabilized, of the growth of healthcare cost increases slowed for the first time in decades, against all of that it's just an article of faith among these people that it hasn't worked. They're stuck in 2010, where their cognitive dissonance is apparently going to keep them forever.

If the Iran agreement works as well as Obamacare, we're not going to be worrying so much about a nuclear Iran in the coming decades.
