And that trauma must be upped to the nth degree if a surgeon removes a leg without having taken all possible actions to save it.\n\nLeaders in the field gathered here in Chicago last week to discuss some of the latest advances in this area of medicine at the Amputation Prevention Symposium, which wrapped up Saturday. Jihad Mustapha, M.D., a cardiologist and researcher with Metro Health Hospital in western Michigan, founded the conference five years ago with the \"goal of providing every physician the opportunity to embrace innovation and the vital role emerging therapies play in preventing amputations,\" he said in a recent news release.\n\nDoctors perform some 185,000 amputations in the United States annually, and one of the top causes is vascular disease, specifically diabetes and peripheral arterial disease. PAD is a circulatory problem that narrows the arteries and blocks blood from flowing to limbs, leading to amputation. One specific form of peripheral arterial disease, called CLI, is responsible for upward of 75,000 major amputations a year, one expert estimates, costing the health care system billions. About half of those who have an amputation stemming from vascular disease die within five years \u2014 a mortality rate higher than breast, colon and prostate cancer.\n\nBut often, amputations performed because of critical limb ischemia are unnecessary and preventable, and that's been the focus of Mustapha's research and the symposium, which drew about 750 attendees this year. The doctor \u2014 who has earned the nickname \"The Leg Saver,\" and carries an interesting backstory \u2014 believes the tide is starting to turn in preventing amputations.\n\n\"There are many available therapies for patients with critical limb ischemia that didn't exist before,\" Mustapha told me last week. \"I really want to send the clear message that, if a patient receives an amputation without proper evaluation in this day and age, that's unethical and almost criminal in 2015.\"\n\nMustapha and Metro Health have worked as pioneers in the field of limb prevention. Just last year, the doctor was one of the first in the country to use a new drug-coated balloon that allows him to reopen the narrowed arteries in patients' thighs and knees due to PAD. That was one of several new medical devices debuted at Metro Health to treat the vascular disease.\n\nMedical leaders around the world are taking note of the work going on in West Michigan, the Grand Rapids Press reports. He's taught his techniques to folks from Japan, China, South Korea and Australia. \"His reputation is growing by leaps and bounds,\" the Press quotes one source in its profile piece. \"He's extremely innovative and forward-thinking. Far ahead of the curve.\"\n\nOften, unnecessary amputations related to PAD happen because doctors lack education about new treatment methods, and are still stuck on old solutions. Physicians make up most of the attendees at the symposium, but the Leg Saver hopes to eventually draw more hospital administrators. Without executive support at Metro Health, their program likely wouldn't have blossomed into what it is today.\n\n\"I would just like to encourage hospital administrators to create programs within their hospitals on CLI awareness for their physicians and health care providers, and also for their communities,\" Mustapha says. \"It's definitely a deadly disease that is silent, and without awareness, we can't reach those patients that really need help.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Jihad Mustapha's Amputation Prevention Symposium, in its fifth year of highlighting innovations in the field, just wrapped up here in Chicago.", "csrf-token": "kGJf49jzjj3LfyK2txnaXl1iioMsK3w74qNDM0reMfI=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/August/Mustapha_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "description": "Jihad Mustapha, M.D.'s Amputation Prevention Symposium, in its fifth year of highlighting innovations in the field, just wrapped up SAturday here in Chicago.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Care's 'Leg Saver' Encourages Hospitals to Raise Awareness About Preventable Limb Loss"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/August/Mustapha_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Jihad Mustapha, M.D.'s Amputation Prevention Symposium, in its fifth year of highlighting innovations in the field, just wrapped up SAturday here in Chicago.", "title": "Health Care's 'Leg Saver' Encourages Hospitals to Raise Awareness About Preventable Limb Loss"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "Metro Health, West Michigan, The Leg Saver, Amputation Prevention Symposium, Jihad Mustapha, peripheral arterial disease, PAD, amputation, critical limb ischemia, CLI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Without executive support at Metro Health, their program likely wouldn't have blossomed into what it is today.\nThat was one of several new medical devices debuted at Metro Health to treat the vascular disease.\nMustapha and Metro Health have worked as pioneers in the field of limb prevention.\nDoctors perform some 185,000 amputations in the United States annually, and one of the top causes is vascular disease, specifically diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.\nAbout half of those who have an amputation stemming from vascular disease die within five years \u2014 a mortality rate higher than breast, colon and prostate cancer."}
