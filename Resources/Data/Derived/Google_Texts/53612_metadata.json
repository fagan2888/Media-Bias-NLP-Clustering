And to mount a competitive challenge in what may be the most expensive presidential election in history, he\u2019ll have to take the thing he hates most in politics: money.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not in presenting a compelling progressive alternative,\u201d Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, told Fusion in an interview in New York on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe problem in the country now where running for president may cost more than a billion dollars is how do you get that message out? And it may in fact be too late. It may be that the billionaire class is so powerful in their control over the economy, in their control over the political country, in their control over the media and what gets focused on\u2014it\u2019s possible that they can\u2019t be beaten.\u201d\n\nSanders was in the midst of a media tour in New York City, and he promised to decide \u201cvery soon\u201d on whether he\u2019ll run for president. There\u2019s also the question of whether he\u2019ll do it as part of the Democratic field\u2014he\u2019s an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats\u2014or whether he\u2019ll run as a true independent.\n\nLate in the morning was an interview with The Huffington Post. Then Bloomberg Politics with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. The nightcap: An appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on Comedy Central. Sandwiched between all of this, he sat on a couch in the lobby of the luxurious Lucerne hotel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West side (as Marvin Gaye played on loop in the background)\u2014a couch he joked has become his \u201coffice\u201d over parts of the past two days.\n\nBut the day started in midtown, where he spoke at the annual convention of the National Action Network, the organization co-founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Here, he showed the type of prowess he could present as a potential progressive alternative to Clinton, rousing the audience of enthused activists and prompting chants on \u201cRun, Bernie, run!\u201d at the end of his speech.\n\nHe talked about issues on which he said he\u2019d like to see Clinton and every other candidate get challenged\u2014income inequality, unemployment, the minimum wage, pay equity, single-payer health care, and trade deals. He proposed pilloring tax havens outside the U.S. to help create millions of new jobs by rebuilding the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\n\nIn a veiled slight to Clinton, he gave a nod to \u201cwomen governors and women senators\u201d who have helped progress feminist causes in the U.S.\u2014but did not mention the possibility of a woman becoming president for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of just challenging her,\u201d he said later. \u201cThere are enormous issues facing the country that every serious candidate has to focus on\u2026What does Hillary, what does Ted Cruz, what does Bernie Sanders, what does any candidate propose to address those issues?\u201d\n\nSanders has served in the Senate with both Cruz, of Texas, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the only two major declared candidates for president. A self-described \u201cDemocratic socialist,\u201d Sanders has been compared as a person who could bring the same vigor to the Democratic debate as Cruz and Paul are expected to bring to the GOP primary.\n\nIt\u2019s a comparison for which he doesn\u2019t much care. He plays up the underdog role even in that context, noting that his 8.5-hour filibuster in 2010 on the Obama administration\u2019s tax-cut deal isn\u2019t remembered nearly as much as Paul\u2019s 13-hour one on drones or Cruz\u2019s 21-hour talk-a-thon on the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen I did my filibuster, which was shorter but first, there\u2026was a huge amount of social traffic on it,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cThe media wasn\u2019t particularly interested in covering it. But when you have my political point of view, you\u2019re not going to get on network television very often. And that\u2019s part of the reality. When you\u2019re taking on the billionaire class, you\u2019re taking on the media, too. And the media would be more sympathetic to a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz than a Bernie Sanders, in my eyes.\u201d\n\nTherein, again, lies the challenge for Sanders. He knows he needs the press, which is why he\u2019s running back and forth from his hotel room to the lobby\u2014back to the room\u2014to various Manhattan spots for national hits on Wednesday. And he knows he\u2019ll need a comfortable-enough amount to present a serious challenge.\n\nMaybe a surprise endorsement, too? At the National Action Network convention, Sharpton joked that the next-day media story would focus on the fact that Sanders and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive darling, were seen whispering to each other on stage during a panel.\n\n\u201cSo watch out, Hillary,\u201d Sharpton joked.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "To mount a competitive challenge in what may be the most expensive presidential election in history, he\u2019ll have to take the thing he hates most in politics: money.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "To mount a competitive challenge in what may be the most expensive presidential election in history, he\u2019ll have to take the thing he hates most in politics: money.", "title": "Bernie Sanders on what it would take to beat Hillary", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/117080/as-marvin-gaye-played-in-the-background-bernie-sanders-talked-about-what-it-would-take-to-beat-hillary-clinton/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/468908200-e1428553561832.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To mount a competitive challenge in what may be the most expensive presidential election in history, he\u2019ll have to take the thing he hates most in politics: money.", "title": "Bernie Sanders on what it would take to beat Hillary", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/117080/as-marvin-gaye-played-in-the-background-bernie-sanders-talked-about-what-it-would-take-to-beat-hillary-clinton/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/468908200-e1428553561832.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdad1\"", "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders admits there\u2019s something paradoxical about his situation.\nHere, he showed the type of prowess he could present as a potential progressive alternative to Clinton, rousing the audience of enthused activists and prompting chants on \u201cRun, Bernie, run!\u201d at the end of his speech.\nAnd the media would be more sympathetic to a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz than a Bernie Sanders, in my eyes.\u201dTherein, again, lies the challenge for Sanders.\nBut then he\u2019s weighing a Democratic primary challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether he\u2019ll do it as part of the Democratic field\u2014he\u2019s an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats\u2014or whether he\u2019ll run as a true independent."}
