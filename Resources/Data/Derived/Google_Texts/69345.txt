UTICA, N.Y. - The tax filing deadline is fast approaching, but for low and middle income residents locally, if you were holding off because you couldn't find the money to pay for a tax filing service, wait no more.

AARP is offering free tax services locally. Certified public accountants are on hand at Utica City Hall on March 16, and each Monday, Wednesday and Friday until the tax filing deadline.

One CPA says he's been doing this for the past 20 years, and each year, he says he helps a few hundred filers fill out their forms for free.

The volunteer says, “We tell them to bring last year's return, and then bring every tax document they got this year, and we like to have last year's return so we can look back and see if it's changed, and why it's changed.”

A source of some difficulty this year, has been the affordable care act and fear of penalties for not having insurance.

AARP tax preparers will also be at Utica Public Library on Saturday.

The income requirement is $62,000 and under.
