The conservative-media world is both completely obsessed with Obamacare and creating a news cocoon in which the most important news about the law \u2014 the lower-than-expected premiums and sharply falling health-care inflation \u2014 doesn\u2019t exist at all, and the fate of the law can instead be tracked through a procession of exaggerated or completely imaginary events all showing its rapid collapse. Conservative news sites churn out new Obamacare collapse stories every single day, creating the impression of the law\u2019s continued and unmistakable destruction.\n\nA perfect example comes via a National Review report from the House Republican meeting today. Influential Republican Jim Jordan waxes enthusiastic about the agreed-to plan to threaten to default on the national debt in order to force President Obama to destroy his own health-care plan:\n\n\u201cAll the momentum is in our direction. Warren Buffett said yesterday, \u2018Scrap the bill.\u2019 The AFL-CIO said last week, \u2018Repeal the bill if you\u2019re not going to fix it.\u2019 Everyone knows this thing isn\u2019t ready. Everyone knows,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a former Republican Study Committee chairman, referring to the health-care law.\n\nWait. Warren Buffett said scrap the bill? Really? That sounds like news I should have heard.\n\nIt turns out a right-wing site called Money Morning quoted Buffett saying the following:\n\nBuffett insists that without changes to Obamacare average citizens will suffer. \"'What we have now is untenable over time,' said Buffett, an early supporter of President Obama. 'That kind of a cost compared to the rest of the world is really like a tapeworm eating, you know, at our economic body\n\nThe quote was picked up by Jeffrey H. Anderson of the Weekly Standard \u2014 \u201cYou know things are bad for President Obama when even Warren Buffett has soured on Obamacare and says that \u2018we need something else\u2019\u201d \u2014 and ricocheted around the conservative-news world, implanting itself in Jordan\u2019s mind as yet the latest evidence that even supporters of Obamacare recognize it is doomed to failure.\n\nIn fact, the Buffett quote came from comments he made in 2010, when the health-care law was being cobbled together in Congress. His denunciation of \u201cwhat we have right now\u201d refers to the pre-Obamacare status quo. Buffett said in that interview he would prefer a better health-care bill than the one that was before Congress, but also preferred the one before Congress to doing nothing and would vote for it: \u201cIf it was a choice today between plan A, which is what we've got, or plan B, what is in front of \u2014 the Senate bill, I would vote for the Senate bill,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cBut I would much rather see a plan C that really attacks costs.\u201d\n\nBuffett today told the Omaha World-Herald he has no idea where these stories came from and strongly supports Obamacare:\n\nStories saying that Warren Buffett wants to \u201cscrap Obamacare\u201d are false, the Omaha investor said Tuesday. \u201cThis is outrageous,\u201d Buffett said in a World-Herald interview Tuesday. \u201cIt's 100 percent wrong ... totally false.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI've never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped,\u201d said Buffett, who has supported Obama's political campaigns. \u201cI support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That's something I've thought should be done for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nAnderson hilariously issued an \u201cupdate\u201d to his completely false item, in which he notes: \u201cIt appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed.\u201d This is also completely untrue, since Buffett endorsed the passage of the bill in that interview and others.\n\nBut the Jim Jordans of the world are probably never going to read untrustworthy lame-stream media organs like the Omaha World-Herald. Trusted sources like Jeffrey H. Anderson have told them once again what they know to be true: Obamacare is collapsing, and even its staunchest supporters know it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Warren Buffett is the latest unwilling conscript into the war against Obamacare.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Warren Buffett is the latest unwilling conscript into the war against Obamacare.", "title": "Today in Conservative Obamacare Self-Delusion", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/today-in-conservative-obamacare-self-delusion.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/04/11/11-buffett-obama.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Warren Buffett is the latest unwilling conscript into the war against Obamacare.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/04/11/11-buffett-obama.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Today in Conservative Obamacare Self-Delusion", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, obamacare, james jordan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,obamacare,james jordan", "published_time": "2013-09-18T18:39:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, obamacare, james jordan", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7a0\"", "article_summary": "Everyone knows,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a former Republican Study Committee chairman, referring to the health-care law.\nConservative news sites churn out new Obamacare collapse stories every single day, creating the impression of the law\u2019s continued and unmistakable destruction.\nIn fact, the Buffett quote came from comments he made in 2010, when the health-care law was being cobbled together in Congress.\nWarren Buffett said scrap the bill?\nWarren Buffett said yesterday, \u2018Scrap the bill.\u2019 The AFL-CIO said last week, \u2018Repeal the bill if you\u2019re not going to fix it.\u2019 Everyone knows this thing isn\u2019t ready."}
