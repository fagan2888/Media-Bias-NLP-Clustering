Tens of millions of Americans are on welfare, unemployment, and public assistance,\u201d Sessions said on Monday. \u201cYet the White House and their Senate Majority seem more concerned about the economic demands of large corporations, or the citizens of other countries, than about getting our own citizens back to work.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSessions cited reports that tech industry lobbyists were meeting with Obama in order to request more guest worker visas to fulfill specialized jobs within the United States. According to reports, Obama is also considering an executive order to extend the expired work visas of nearly 5 million immigrants who are the parents of U.S. children.\n\n\u201cThe increases in foreign workers demanded by corporate lobbyists would be in addition to the administration\u2019s plan to implement amnesty by executive fiat, providing work permits to 5-6 million illegal immigrants and visa overstays who will be able to take any job in any industry, public or private,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nSessions has been an ardent critic of Obama\u2019s immigration policies, accusing him of creating an \u201copen border\u201d and granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.\n\nBefore Congress adjourned for the August recess, the House passed a measure that would prevent Obama from issuing any more executive actions on immigration.

And Senate Democrats, instead of defending Congress and their constituents, are handing their vote over to Leader Reid and President Obama,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cNot one single Senate Democrat has publicly stood up to their Democrat leaders and demanded a vote on the House bill to block this executive amnesty. As a result, they are as complicit as if they sat in the room with these executives themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
