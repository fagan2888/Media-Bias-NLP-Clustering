Hobby Lobby\u201d and \u201cConestoga Wood v. Sebelius\u201d (nrlc.cc/1iBhOKX and nrlc.cc/QgOVKJ), so this post will be more of a series of hopefully informed impressions.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s fairly common, but the lawyer for the plaintiffs had not completed his second sentence before former Solicitor General Paul Clement was interrupted by Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Her line of questioning was one she (and other justices, particular Elena Kagan) used as a kind of moat to try to separate the Obama mandate from Clement\u2019s extremely effective attacks.\n\nIn a word if Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood can successfully argue a religious objection, then (in Justice Kagan\u2019s words) \u201cyou would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork.\u201d\n\nAs he always is in front of the justices, Clement was unflappable. Each case is different, he argued, and the \u201cparade of horribles\u201d offered up by the government is hypothetical and unconvincing.\n\nThe justices who favored the Obama mandate kept trying to find some irresolvable scenario that would force Clement to back off. Each one they offered\u2014including what happens if a single stockholder in a company does not have a religious objection to providing health coverage for a particular drug or procedures \u2013-Clement provided a perfectly rational, acceptable answer to.\n\nYou had to feel sorry (sort of) for Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who is not nearly as quick on his feet as Clement is. (Every time he said he wanted to \u201cwalk\u201d the justices through a particular point, he stumbled.)\n\nHe made it to his third sentence before Chief Justice John Roberts politely asked if Verrilli\u2019s opening words weren\u2019t \u201cinconsistent with RFRA,\u201d the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was at the core of the defense relied on by the plaintiffs.\n\nUnderstandably a debate on what the RFRA meant/means took up a lot of time.\n\nVerrilli had the unenviable task of trying to demonstrate that the government had a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d in requiring what Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood opposed providing, given the many exemptions the Obama administration had provided. Verrilli had a particularly difficult time with the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d clause [allowing people to hold onto old insurance policies that don\u2019t meet the new ObamaCare requirements], both explaining why it was used and predicting when (in the foreseeable future) it might expire.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Jon Healey described the exchange, \u201cAs [Chief Justice John] Roberts noted, there\u2019s no date certain for grandfathered plans to be eliminated. In theory, they could continue until all of their current holders reach retirement age and switch to Medicare.\u201d\n\nThis intersected with the question of why mandating the services Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood objected to furthered \u201ca compelling governmental interest.\u201d As Healey put it (summarizing a line of questioning from Justices Roberts and Samuel Alito), \u201cIf it\u2019s so compelling to require employers\u2019 health plans\u201d to include this coverage, \u201cwhy did the Affordable Care Act allow people to hold on to \u2018grandfathered\u2019 plans that didn\u2019t include the coverage?\u201d\n\nThere was one other very important point begun with question from Justice Alito: \u201cWhat about the implications of saying that no for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associated with the for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all,\u201d which is the government\u2019s position.\n\nWhat about abortion? Justice Anthony Kennedy put it this way:\n\n\u201cUnder your view, a profit corporation could be forced \u2014 in principle, there are some statutes on the books now which would prevent it \u2014 could be forced in principle to pay for abortion.\u201d\n\nVerrilli responded:\n\n\u201cWell, I think that if it were for a for\u00ad profit corporation and if such a law like that were enacted, then you\u2019re right, under our theory that the for\u00ad profit corporation wouldn\u2019t have an ability to sue. But there is no law like that on the books.\u201d\n\nIn the four minutes he was given in rebuttal time, Clement picked up on Verrilli\u2019s less than sterling response. Clement said\n\n\u201cLet me start with the Abortion Conscience Clause, because it tells you something about where Congress has drawn the line and it tells you the consequences of the government\u2019s position. Historically, those conscience provisions have applied to all medical providers, including for-profit medical providers. But we learned today that as far as the government\u2019s concerned, that\u2019s just Congress\u2019 judgment. If Congress changes its judgment and says that a for-profit medical provider has to provide an abortion, RFRA doesn\u2019t apply. That, with all due respect, cannot be what Congress had in mind when it passed RFRA.\u201d\n\nPlease join those who are following me on Twitter at twitter.com/daveha.
