Ted Cruz (R-Cruz) announced his presidential bid in a midnight tweet. He gave his first official campaign speech at Liberty University with about 12,000 students in attendance.\n\nWhile Cruz has said that his election strategy in 2016 will be to reunite evangelicals and Reagan Democrats with the Republican Party, he told Red Alert Politics Monday that he also plans to build \u201can army of young people\u201d to carry him to victory.\n\nAnd Cruz, the first official candidate of the 2016 cycle, believes that there is no better time to reach millennials than right now.\n\n\u201cYoung people went 70-30 for Barack Obama in the last two elections. But I believe that there is an incredible opportunity with young people in 2016. A great many young people are right now demoralized and disillusioned by the false promises that President Obama gave them. They have been impacted by coming out of school at a time of stagnation where they are finding it harder and harder to get jobs,\u201d Cruz said during a phone call with reporters and bloggers.\n\n\u201cThere young people across this country with faded posters of \u2018Hope and Change\u2019 on their wall who are still sleeping in their parent\u2019s basement. And they have paid the price for Obamacare. One of the simplest ways to understand Obamacare is that it is a massive wealth transfer from young, healthy people to everybody else. We have a tremendous opportunity with young people.\u201d\n\nCruz said that one of the ways he plans to take advantage of this opportunity is through social media, like his Twitter announcement.\n\n\u201cSocial media is an incredible tool to connect with young people, to energize them, to empower them,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz is ahead of the rest of the potential GOP presidential candidates when it comes to social media measurements, though he falls behind the reach of likely Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, according to Fox News.\n\nCruz did not list any other specific ways he hopes to reach out to young people, but told bloggers that he plans to run \u201can energetic, passionate campaign that inspires young people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe the key to doing so is having a bold, positive, hopeful vision and also communicating that in a way that has some fun,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans carry the youth vote, we will win in 2016,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cAnd I intend to work hard to energize an army of young people who want to reignite the promise of America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sen.
