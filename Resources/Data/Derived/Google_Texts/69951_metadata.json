Eventually, when he turned around with his flashlight on, he saw a puppy-sized animal rustling around.\n\nThe excitement of Piotr Naskrecki uttered, when the creature turned out to be a goliath spider. \u201cWhen I turned on the flashlight, I couldn\u2019t quite understand what I was seeing,\u201d Naskrecki, from Harvard University\u2019s Museum of Comparative Zoology, stated.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, Goliath Spider, also known as the South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), is supposedly the world\u2019s largest spider. The leg span of this huge arachnid spider can reach up to a foot (30 cms), or about the size of \u201ca child\u2019s forearm,\u201d with a body the size of \u201ca large fist,\u201d Naskrecki claimed. Moreover, the spider can weigh more than 6 oz. (170 grams) \u2014 about as much as a young puppy, the scientist further explained.\n\nThe spider has massive sharp fangs, which could inflict deep wounds, though the venom of the goliath bird eating spider isn\u2019t deadly to humans.\n\nWhen Piotr Naskrecki closely observed the spider, he found that it was rubbing its hind legs against its abdomen- an action, which the scientist found kind of cute. But afterwards, he realized the spider was sending out a cloud of hairs with microscopic barbs on them. It has been known that when these hairs get in the eyes or other mucous membranes, they can turn out to be \u201cextremely painful and itchy,\u201d and can stay there for days, he said.\n\nThough the goliath spider\u2018s bite is poisonous, but it\u2019s not deadly to humans. However, it would still be tremendously painful, \u201clike someone is driving a nail through your hand,\u201d Naskrecki added.\n\nNaskrecki told that, the goliath spider hunts at night, and feeds on small animals, insects, frogs and earthworms. These spiders are also hard to find. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in the tropics in South America for almost the past 15 years, but I only saw the spider three times,\u201d he added.\n\nPiotr Naskrecki took the sample back to his lab to study after catching the same found by him in Guyana. She\u2019s now deposited in a museum.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "170 grams, 30 cms, goliath spider, guyana rainforest, piotr naskrecki, poisnous, puppy-sized spider, south american goliath birdeater, theraphosa blondi", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Capital Wired", "description": "Follow An Entomologist and wildlife photographer, Piotr Naskrecki, who was walking in the Guyana\u2019s rainforest in the midnight and suddenly he heard a rustling sound like something was creeping under his feet.
