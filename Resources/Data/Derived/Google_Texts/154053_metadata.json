They have babies,\u201d Trierweiler explained, noting that he cares for patients with cancer and the practice is overwhelmingly positive.\n\nPerhaps what\u2019s not so pleasant about his business, he said, is dealing with all the paperwork.\n\nTrierweiler noted that it\u2019s difficult to know how the Affordable Care Act will work and he hopes that medicine won\u2019t be destroyed by government interference.\n\n\u201cThe most satisfying thing about practicing medicine is being able to make a difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\n\nGenerally he said people in rural areas better understand the threat of too much interference, perhaps more than those in large cities where medical care is not as personalized.\n\nThe biggest change Trierweiler said he\u2019s witnessed while practicing medicine is how efficiency has increased.\n\nFor example, patients who used to be hospitalized two to three days now return home as outpatients because of different, less painful procedures and medicine.\n\n\u201cRecovery time is quicker,\u201d Trierweiler said.\n\nTrierweiler said the most important preventative action people can take to stay healthy is to stop smoking. Eating healthy food and exercising follow close behind, he said.\n\nAfter receiving a biology degree from the University of California at San Diego, Trierweiler completed a degree in medicine from the University of Southern California School of Medicine.\n\nHe interned in ob/gyn at the University of Colorado and worked for the U.S. Public Health Service for the Navajo Nation in Arizona.\n\nHe has taught at universities in Texas, Colorado and South Dakota and started a practice in North Platte in 1992 after working at a hospital and clinic in Colorado and having a private practice in Texas.\n\nTrierweiler is an avid cyclist. He\u2019s completed the Bike Ride Across Nebraska six times and two years ago biked solo from Canada to Mexico along the Pacific Highway.\n\n\u201cIt was breathtaking,\u201d he said.\n\nCloser to home, Trierweiler often bikes from North Platte to Gothenburg or to Ogallala or even Scottsbluff.\n\nHe also enjoys hunting ducks and deer with his sons.\n\nThe Trierweilers have two grown sons and twins who are juniors at St. Pat\u2019s High School in North Platte.\n\nThis e-mail address is being protected from spambots.
