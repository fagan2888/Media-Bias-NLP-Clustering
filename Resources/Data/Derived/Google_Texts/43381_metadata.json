(The New York Times just ran a similar piece.)\n\nI\u2019m now back from a stimulating health-care economics journalism fellowship at the nonpartisan American Institute of Economic Research (AIER) in Great Barrington, Mass., and am sad to report that things are even worse than I thought.\n\nWhat \u2018Financial Roulette\u2019 Means\n\nThe reason is a phrase that Georgia State University Assistant Professor of Law Erin C. Fuse Brown shared with us at the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) program: \u201cfinancial roulette.\u201d\n\nMore10 Things Your Health Insurer Won\u2019t Tell You\n\nThat was Brown\u2019s description for the game patients are unwittingly playing due to hospital billing and debt collection practices, sometimes finding themselves owing sizable amounts of money and getting dunned by debt collectors painfully. Certain hospitals are garnishing wages, putting liens on patients\u2019 homes and pushing them into bankruptcy due to unpaid medical bills. (Read the eye-opening ProPublica/NPR 2014 story, \u201cFrom the E.R. to the Courtroom: How Nonprofit Hospitals Are Seizing Patients\u2019 Wages.\u201d)\n\nMedical debt in America is enormous. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says \u201cmedical collections make up 52 percent of collection accounts on credit reports, far outpacing all other types of debt.\u201d Some 43 million consumers with an account in collection have medical debt. Some people with medical debt don\u2019t even know they owe it until they apply for a loan or credit card. \u201cThen, they can\u2019t qualify for that mortgage or business loan,\u201d said Brown.\n\nFinancial roulette partly describes the growing possibility some hospital care will be provided by out-of-network physicians you\u2019ve never met.\n\n\u201cFinancial roulette\u201d also aptly describes the growing possibility that your hospital care will be provided, at least in part, by out-of-network physicians \u2014 some of whom you\u2019ve never met. And you\u2019ll pay stiff bills for their services because of that out-of-network status.\n\nNarrow Networks and Balance Billing\n\nOne of the effects of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) has been the rise of \u201cnarrow networks,\u201d where only a small number of local doctors are part of a particular health plan. According to a recent University of Pennsylvania study, 83 percent of health plans offered in Georgia had narrow networks. An October 2015 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) article found that about 15 percent of Obamacare \u201csilver\u201d plans lacked an in-network physician for at least one specialty.And in a new survey of 4,611 adults by the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, 10 percent said access to general or family practice doctors has decreased since 2014; 11 percent said their access to specialists has fallen.\n\nWhen you\u2019re treated by out-of-network docs (say, a new-to-you anesthesiologist who shows up in the operating room to put you out), you then become subject to what\u2019s known as \u201cbalance billing.\u201d That\u2019s health insurance jargon for your health provider requiring you to pay the entire amount of whatever portion of its bill your insurer doesn\u2019t pay, not just your co-pay or deductible. \u201cSurprise medical bills are ubiquitous,\u201d said Brown.\n\nMoreYou Have a $10,000 Hospital Bill: Now What?\n\nOne thing you might not know about the Obamacare law: it caps out-of-pocket costs, but not out-of-network costs.\n\nThere\u2019s no federal protection against balance billing, either. State rules vary; according to Kaiser Health News, roughly a quarter of states ban balance billing in certain circumstances, but the rest do not. Although \u201csome states are starting to move against balance billing,\u201d said Brown.\n\nThe Problems With New IRS Rules on Medical Debt\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS), of all places, recently issued rules that might seem to prevent harsh hospital billing and collection practices. But these rules actually left a loophole big enough to drive an out-of-network ambulance through.\n\nThe rules, which grew out of the Obamacare law, only apply to the roughly 60 percent of U.S. hospitals that are tax-exempt. Most patients don\u2019t choose their hospitals by their tax status, said Brown. They go to the one their doctor referred them to or the nearest facility in an emergency.\n\nThe other problem with the IRS rules: they\u2019re vague and arbitrary.\n\nTax-exempt hospitals can continue using aggressive debt collection practices if they\u2019ve made \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to determine the patient\u2019s eligibility for financial assistance. Talk about a term of art. And \u201celigibility\u201d is in the eye of the hospital.\n\n\u201cSome hospitals are very generous and forthright when determining eligibility, and some are not,\u201d said Brown, who has reviewed the billing and collection rules of 140 not-for-profit hospitals in 14 states. \u201cWhat the rules don\u2019t do are tell hospitals how to determine eligibility. Hospitals have complete discretion.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, she noted, patients are ineligible for financial assistance if they have any form of insurance \u2014 even if their bills are steep, out-of-network ones or the patients have high deductibles. In certain instances, to qualify for financial assistance, a patient\u2019s income can\u2019t be more than 100 percent of the poverty level; in others, it\u2019s 600 percent.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen hospitals make it very hard to apply for financial assistance,\u201d added Brown. \u201cThe list of things they ask for can be worse than tax forms or the FAFSA forms for college financial aid.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Brown added, the IRS hasn\u2019t enforced these rules yet. \u201cIt could yank a hospital\u2019s tax-exempt status and charge penalties, but it\u2019s loath to do that,\u201d she said.\n\nBrown believes it\u2019s time to broaden the protections of fair hospital billing and collection practices to all hospitals and financially vulnerable patients. She thinks any hospital that takes Medicare (which is to say, pretty much every hospital) should then be required to engage in fair pricing and collection practices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to limit these rules to tax-exempt hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cYour house, car, college and hospital are the four biggest expenses in your life and you have no control over the bill for the fourth one.\u201d\n\nWhat Could Curb These Trends\n\nSome help might be on the way.\n\nThe Healthcare.gov site has a new tool in beta that lets some users search for Obamacare health plans by doctor, to easily see whether particular physicians would be in network or out-of-network. I think of it as the Expedia of Obamacare.\n\nRight now, though, you\u2019ll only be able to use the tool if you\u2019re randomly selected. \u201cThe goal is that this will be open to everyone by the end of open enrollment\u201d on January 31, 2016, Justin Giovannelli, project director at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute, told our fellowship group.\n\nThe CFPB is also deciding whether medical debt should be treated just like other debt, and some members of Congress are pushing the agency in that direction. If that happens, the CFPB might require credit bureaus to address credit reporting practices related to medical debt and expand the IRS billing and collection rules to include for-profit hospitals.\n\nLater this month, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may come out with rules requiring insurers give people more choices of doctors in their health plans.\n\nThe biggest assistance for health consumers might come after November 2016. Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute, said at my fellowship that \u201chealth care affordability issues extraordinarily depend on how the next election works out.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, if you\u2019re dealing with medical debt issues, I suggest you read the CFPB\u2019s advisory: 7 ways to keep medical debt in check.\n\nAnd you might want to hire a patient advocate or medical billing advocate to go to bat for you. There\u2019s no guarantee this pro can solve all your health care cost problems, but he or she may offer assistance and, if nothing else, lower your stress.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe that could lower your blood pressure and keep your health costs down.\n\n\u00a9 Twin Cities Public Television - 2016.
