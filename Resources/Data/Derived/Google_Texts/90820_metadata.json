But the Avs didn\u2019t use Bodnarchuk on the penalty kill or power play, so his minutes haven\u2019t been eye-catching.\n\nBeauchemin logged 27 minutes of ice time against the Predators, Bodnarchuk 22. Tyson Barrie (29:01) and Nick Holden (28:09) were out even more, and Barrie scored the tiebreaking power-play goal during the third period of the 5-3 win. He now has seven goals this season and is on pace to at least match his totals of 12 and 13 the past two seasons.\n\nHolden had two assists against the Predators.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see a guy like E.J. go down. He\u2019s kind of a cornerstone and plays so many big minutes for us,\u201d Barrie said. \u201cBut this is a chance for other guys to step up. \u2026 Holdie and I are getting to see more of the top guys and stuff like that, so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nSaid Holden: \u201cThe more we play together, the more in sync we are, just making plays, knowing where each other\u2019s going to be, reading off each other. And it\u2019s being able to talk to each other and getting more help. On the bench, if I made a bad play or a bad read, he can come to me and say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s try this,\u2019 and vice versa.\n\n\u201cI feel like our game is in a good spot, and it\u2019s getting better as we progress here and play more together.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche didn\u2019t practice Saturday before leaving for Chicago, where it will face the Blackhawks on Sunday night. So there were no updates on Johnson and Brad Stuart (back), but neither is likely to be available for the game. Brandon Gormley, who cleared waivers Friday, remains on the official roster and was a healthy scratch against Nashville.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve both been playing well for a while,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said of Barrie and Holden. \u201cThe only game Tyson was so-so was against Calgary, but he was sick before that and it was his first game back. Other than (that), he\u2019s been really solid for us.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche has a three-game winning steak, and heading into Nashville\u2019s game at Arizona on Saturday night, had moved into the final wild-card playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Predators and Avalanche both had 45 points, but Colorado had more regulation and overtime wins.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nCOLORADO AT CHICAGO 5 p.m. Sunday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Phillip Danault:\n\nThe 22-year-old left wing, the Blackhawks\u2019 top draft choice in 2011, had his first NHL goal in Chicago\u2019s 3-1 win over Buffalo on Friday night. Patrick Roy is familiar with him because Danault played four seasons in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with Victoriaville and Moncton. He spent most of the past two seasons, and part of this one, with Rockford of the AHL and was recalled when Marcus Kruger suffered a wrist injury.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nAvalanche:\n\nThis is the teams\u2019 third meeting in 27 days. Colorado won 3-0 at Chicago on Dec. 15, and the Blackhawks beat the Avs 4-3 in overtime in Denver on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u2026 Colorado returns home to face Tampa Bay on Tuesday and New Jersey on Thursday. \u2026 The Avs are 9-2-1 against the Central Division. \u2026 The Colorado power play is 13-of-33, for 39.4 percent, over the past nine games.\n\nBlackhawks:\n\nChicago has won six straight. \u2026 Former Rockies defenseman, Avalanche assistant and head coach Joel Quenneville is two wins short of tying Al Arbour for the No. 2 spot on the all-time regular-season victory list. The Blackhawks\u2019 coach now has 780. Of those, 131 came in Quenneville\u2019s three seasons as Colorado\u2019s coach. \u2026 Winger Marian Hossa is mired in a scoring slump as the Hawks win. He has no goals and five assists in the past 14 games.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche overcoming loss of Erik Johnson by adapting", "title": "Avalanche overcoming loss of Erik Johnson by adapting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/avalanche-overcoming-loss-of-erik-johnson-by-adapting/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__Tyson-Barriep1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__Tyson-Barriep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T19:02:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:59:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019ve both been playing well for a while,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said of Barrie and Holden.\nWith Erik Johnson out because of a lower-body injury, the Avalanche has adapted on defense \u2014 and kept winning.\nThe Blackhawks\u2019 coach now has 780.\n\u2026 Former Rockies defenseman, Avalanche assistant and head coach Joel Quenneville is two wins short of tying Al Arbour for the No.\nSo there were no updates on Johnson and Brad Stuart (back), but neither is likely to be available for the game."}
