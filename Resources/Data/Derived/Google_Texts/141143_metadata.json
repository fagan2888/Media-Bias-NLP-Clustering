Last Wednesday, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) said that Obama should be removed for his \"unconstitutional approaches\" to the Affordable Care Act as well as immigration reform.\n\n\"There isn't going to be any impeachment because there isn't any political will,\" Limbaugh said. \"You're never going to succeed.\"\n\nLimbaugh said the Obama administration is \"destroying the health care system\" and \"screwing up everything,\" but even still, there is very little possibility for impeachment.\n\n\"That would require Obama's approval numbers in the 20's,\" he added. \"And even then, I'm not so sure that the people of this country would ever support removing the first black president.\"\n\nSo while Republicans can dream, Limbaugh said it's time to think of another solution.\n\n\"It's never going to happen!\"\n\n(h/t: Buzzfeed)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh\n\n1 of 27 Els for Autism Pro Am WEST PALM BEACH, FL - MARCH 12: Rush Limbaugh of the USA the radio personality with Greg Norman of Australia during the Els for Autism Pro-am at The PGA National Golf Club on March 12, 2012 in West Palm Beach, Florida.
