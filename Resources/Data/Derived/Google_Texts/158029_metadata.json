Connecticut does not.\n\nAll states exclude certain funds from their caps. Connecticut is among five states that exclude debt service payments, that is, the interest paid on bonded debt.\n\nThat helps Connecticut boost its transportation funding, most of which is raised through bonds and is used to leverage federal funds for transportation improvements.\n\nWhat federal money is under the cap?\n\nMost states exclude the money they receive from the federal government from consideration.\n\nBut not Connecticut. It places some federal programs under its cap, including welfare and other programs that bring in nearly $1.3 billion a year from Washington.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for this.\n\nWhen the cap was created during the administration of former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker, there were lawmakers who wanted to stop Connecticut from creating new programs with federal grants, only to be forced to pick up the tab for those programs if the federal government stopped funding them.\n\nSo Connecticut put a number of federal programs \u2014 but not all of them \u2014 under the cap, even if the federal government eventually reimburses the state for all or most of the cost.\n\nMany federal social service programs are still under the cap. That fuels criticism from Connecticut advocates for those programs, who say the state's spending cap is one of the most restrictive in the nation.\n\nIn 2007, the Connecticut Heath Foundation issued a report that said roughly 80 percent of the state's expenditures were under the cap. The average in other states was about 50 percent, the report said. But there have been alterations to Connecticut's spending cap since then.\n\nCritics say using a five-year average of personal income growth to set the cap is too long and assures that budget growth is divorced from the true state of the economy. After a recession, they argue, the cap\u2019s restrictions on state spending will always lag behind the growth of the economy.\n\nNick DeFiesta, fiscal policy fellow at Connecticut Voices for Children, recommends either a shorter or a longer cap computation. A 10-year average, such as the one Washington state has, would allow a better averaging of personal income, and a three-year cap would avoid the problems of a boom and bust economy, he said.\n\n\"It is crucial that government respect the will of the people to limit spending, but the way the cap was constructed makes it more difficult to fund the programs and services that help the most vulnerable of us,\" he said.\n\nMost federal programs that are still under the cap don\u2019t grow much, so they don\u2019t put too much pressure on the cap.\n\nFederal programs that have grown quickly \u2013 including food stamps and home heating assistance \u2013 are not counted under the cap.\n\nThe last fast-growing program that was under the cap was Medicaid. But when the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid coverage in the state in 2013, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy removed the federal share of the program from under the cap. Medicaid is funded jointly, on about a 50-50 basis by the federal government and the state, and is one of the costliest programs in the state budget.\n\nThe only other states that include some federal programs under their caps are California and Colorado, and they only count their state\u2019s part of federal cost-share programs.\n\nA Taxpayer Bill of Rights\n\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, and New Jersey exclude funds they must spend to comply with a federal mandate or court order.\n\nAbout 10 states exclude emergency funds from their spending limitations; Connecticut is among the states that do not.\n\nSome states exclude grants and gifts from their caps; Connecticut does not.\n\nWhile critics in the state say Connecticut\u2019s cap is severe, Colorado's is reputed to be the toughest. Under Colorado\u2019s \u201cTaxpayer Bill of Rights,\u201d or TABOR, state and local governments can\u2019t raise taxes without voter approval or spend revenues without voter approval if revenues grow faster than the rate of inflation and population growth. Excess revenues must be refunded to taxpayers.\n\nIn nine states, a spending cap has been made part of the state\u2019s constitution. Twelve states have statutory spending caps. The remaining four states, including Connecticut, have both constitutional and statutory provisions. Connecticut\u2019s legislature can vote to modify the state\u2019s cap with the support of a super-majority in both Houses.\n\nBut DeFiesta said considering changes in the cap is \"a politically fraught debate.\"\n\nBen Barnes, secretary of Connecticut\u2019s Office of Policy and Management, said the spending cap is needed to prevent governors and legislatures from spending too much money, even in good times when revenues from taxes and other sources are pouring into state coffers.\n\n\u201cIt moderates the desire to go to the store when you get a bonus,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/04/20/ct-spending-cap-is-unique-and-some-critics-say-among-the-toughest/", "news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Politics, Washington, Ben Barnes, Connecticut Voices for Children, Consumer Price Index, General Assembly, Office of Legislative Research, Office of Policy and Mangement, spending cap", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/04/20/ct-spending-cap-is-unique-and-some-critics-say-among-the-toughest/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Like about half of the states in the nation, Connecticut has imposed a cap on the amount of money the state government can spend.
