MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski asked Monday morning. And CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin took a shot Monday afternoon.\n\nAll lobbed the question that former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D) is sure to get again and again: Will he challenge presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary campaign?\n\nSchweitzer signaled to all three TV hosts that he\u2019s considering running, an acknowledgement that helped fuel even more speculation over the past 24 hours that the ex-governor may make a populist run against the establishment favorite.\n\nThe news media has long been biased toward conflict. And so the notion of an inevitable Democratic candidate coasting toward coronation as the party's presidential nominee is likely the least-desired scenario for journalists eager to cover a race.\n\nSchweitzer has done his part to drum up media speculation over a 2016 run, announcing plans last month to visit all 99 counties in Iowa. And he's provided headline-grabbing conflict, recently criticizing Obamacare as too conciliatory to pharmaceutical companies. He's also taking aim at the war in Afghanistan (which President Barack Obama escalated), and the invasion of Iraq (which Clinton supported).\n\nSchweitzer spoke to Slate's Dave Weigel over the weekend, with the interview published between the former governor's appearances on MSNBC and CNN. In that interview, Schweitzer said the government \"ought to grant\" clemency to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- a view clearly at odds with the Obama White House.\n\nHow Schweitzer differs from Obama and how he would match against Clinton, if such a race were to actually happen, came up in all three TV interviews. \"Would you be left of Hillary Clinton or right of Hillary Clinton?\u201d Baldwin asked Monday afternoon. \u201cProbably both,\u201d Schweitzer replied.\n\nThough the 2016 campaign is years away, the political media has dived head first into the race -- or at least the theoretical race.\n\nClinton, whose \u201cshadow campaign\u201d was pried open by Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman on Sunday night, hasn\u2019t declared she\u2019s running. Nor have the presumed Republican contenders.\n\nOn the Republican side, possible candidates include New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), and Ted Cruz (Texas), and Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.). Mike Huckabee, who vied for the 2008 nomination, told The New York Times last month he\u2019s considering a run, too.\n\nThe media should have a wide-open Republican race to cover, as was the case in 2012 -- a cycle that boasted 20 primary debates. But on the Democratic side, the media seems intent on finding someone who might challenge Clinton.\n\nIn November, The New Republic got the chattering class talking with a cover story suggesting that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would run against Clinton from the left. (In 2005, The New Republic questioned whether Russ Feingold would challenge \"presumed Democratic front-runner\" Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary.) Warren said after The New Republic story was published that she is not running in 2016.\n\nPolitical journalists and pundits have given some oxygen to Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean as potential 2016 Democratic challengers, but neither has recently staked out positions straying as far from Clinton and Obama as Schweitzer has.\n\nAnd Dean has been in this position before, with Politico's Roger Simon suggesting in 2010 that the 2004 Democratic hopeful could possibly challenge Obama in 2012 primary. That theoretical Dean-Obama matchup, however, never materialized.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Hillary And Bill Through The Years Hillary And Bill Through The Years\n\n1 of 21 Their wedding day on October 11, 1975 Share this slide:\n\nFacebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK -- ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos got", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-01-07 19:37:00 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "NEW YORK -- ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos got", "title": "Media's Desperate Search For Somebody To Challenge Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/06/brian-schweitzer-media-hillary-clinton_n_4551245.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1547214/images/o-BRIAN-SCHWEITZER-MEDIA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK -- ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos got", "creator": "mlcalderone", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1547214/images/o-BRIAN-SCHWEITZER-MEDIA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Media's Desperate Search For Somebody To Challenge Hillary Clinton", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-06 19:37:00 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4551245", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "the backstory,Brian Schweitzer,Hillary Clinton media,brian schweitzer media,democratic primary 2016,hillary clinton 2016,brian schweitzer hillary clinton,brian schweitzer 2016", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "the backstory,Brian Schweitzer,Hillary Clinton media,brian schweitzer media,democratic primary 2016,hillary clinton 2016,brian schweitzer hillary clinton,brian schweitzer 2016", "published_time": "2014-01-06 19:37:00 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-01-23 08:17:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf33c\"", "article_summary": "\"Would you be left of Hillary Clinton or right of Hillary Clinton?\u201d Baldwin asked Monday afternoon.\n(In 2005, The New Republic questioned whether Russ Feingold would challenge \"presumed Democratic front-runner\" Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary.)\nBrian Schweitzer (D) is sure to get again and again: Will he challenge presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary campaign?\nHoward Dean as potential 2016 Democratic challengers, but neither has recently staked out positions straying as far from Clinton and Obama as Schweitzer has.\nHe's also taking aim at the war in Afghanistan (which President Barack Obama escalated), and the invasion of Iraq (which Clinton supported)."}
