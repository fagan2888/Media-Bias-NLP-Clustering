A New Ethical Dominion: Maximizing Health in the Information Age.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn the wake of two Supreme Court decisions ratifying the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, there\u2019s a new reality in American health, made possible by new technologies: It\u2019s actually less expensive, to say nothing of more compassionate, for Uncle Sam to help people stay healthier. That is, it\u2019s foolish to try to ration healthcare, or to seek to trick people into spending less on their own well-being. Instead, true political wisdom, true pragmatism, tells us that we should help Americans become healthier and thereby consume less from the healthcare system.\n\nSome might ask: Is the arrival of national health insurance a victory for the Left? For statism? Perhaps. But it\u2019s also a victory for the Judeo-Christian concept that we are our brother\u2019s keeper; the idea of coverage for everyone is fair is deeply embedded in our collective national moral imagination.\n\nSo if we can come to see the American healthcare system in all its glorious potential\u2014as a system for helping people to stay as healthy and hearty as possible for as long as possible\u2014then we can see it as a system for nurturing personal independence and individual autonomy as well. And for sure, good health is the true path to spending less, for the simple reason that good health is less expensive than sickness.\n\nOne final point: cutting-edge computer technology can lead the way. Indeed, as we come to fully appreciate the power of high-tech networks to improve our health, we can see the emergence of a new ethical dominion, in which each of us play a constructive role in the health of all of us.\n\nOkay, so here, at long last, in the second decade of the 21st century, we\u2019re ultimately on the hook for the cost of everyone\u2019s healthcare. And so, in the name of maximizing human freedom, let\u2019s figure out a strategy for making everyone healthier and less dependent on the system. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll save money in the long run, because, again, healthy people don\u2019t cost as much as sick people, and healthy people generate more economic activity, including tax revenue.\n\nThis new reality of healthcare is a point worth pausing over, because it suggests a new opportunity for the Right to shift the argument on national healthcare policy\u2014from the mere distribution of health insurance to the actual creation of better health for all.\n\nTo put the issue a bit differently, if we take universal coverage as a given\u2014that is, if the fight over universal coverage is over, as it would seem to be in the wake of the 2012 presidential election, as well as those two Supreme Court decisions, one in 2012 and one in 2015\u2014then the only question left to wrangle over is this: How do we save money by spending less per patient?\n\nAnd here again, if healthy people cost the system less than sick people, the proper course for a wise and frugal government is clear enough: Let\u2019s make people healthier, and while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s use our brains and take concerted action to get that public-health goal accomplished\u2014and so let\u2019s have a national Cure Strategy. Let\u2019s stop talking about simply spending less, which brings up completely justifiable fears in the public mind of a British-style system of rationing, and let\u2019s start doing more, in the form of enlightened leadership, to help people keep their good health.\n\nThis argument\u2014that good health is less costly than illness, and so let\u2019s have a healthy population and thereby spend less\u2014has not sunk deep into the political system, to put it mildly. Indeed, the Democrats, the self-declared party of compassion, are still on record as wanting to restrict what they spend for each enrollee in Obamacare. Meanwhile, the Republicans, having lost the political and judicial argument over universal coverage, simply don\u2019t say much at all anymore about Obamacare anymore. Oh sure, Republicans snipe about the generalized ills of Obamacare, but one doesn\u2019t hear much these days about the specific pledge to \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d It\u2019s possible to imagine a true replacement model for Obamacare, a replacement that preserves the core idea of universal coverage while leaving out all the stupid stuff in the ACA; it\u2019s possible for Republicans to develop a replacement for Obamacare\u2014but they just haven\u2019t done it yet.\n\nBut in time, the Republicans will, because a political bonanza awaits the first party fully to comprehend the new realities in this technological age and to seize the opportunities it offers.\n\nII. The Four Wins of the Cure Strategy\n\nToday, good health is not just a win, it\u2019s actually a win-win-win-win\u2014four wins. That is, it\u2019s a win for patients, but it\u2019s also a win for the budget\u2014because we\u2019re spending less. And third, it\u2019s a win for the economy, because healthy people are more productive; one can look back at US history and see a close link between the rising life expectancy of the population and real per capita GDP. And fourth and finally, it\u2019s a win for the economy, because a strong health sector will be generating health services that people in other countries want to buy, even as we develop new technological spinoffs. This last idea, that the healthcare system should be seen as an economic asset, has been a particularly tough one for the left-wing healthcare nomenklatura to get its head around.\n\nIndeed, the political Left, which was the architect of Obamacare, has clearly not grasped all these implications from its handiwork. Instead, it is still locked into its own austerity model that is deeply unpopular with ordinary voters.\n\nIII. The Democrats Cling to Scarcity\n\nEmblematic of this \u201cscarcity thinking\u201d is the work of Dr. David Blumenthal, one of the architects of Obamacare. Blumenthal\u2019s exact title in the government, from 2009-2011, was National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, and yet by all accounts, his influence was broader inside the administration than his wonky title might indicate.\n\nIndeed, in a much-cited 2001 New England Journal of Medicine article entitled \u201cControlling Health Care Expenditures,\u201d Blumenthal laid out the eventual Obama policy in stark terms. New medical technology, he argued, is the major driver of healthcare costs, accounting for two-thirds of the increase. And so, he wrote, let\u2019s have less new technology\u2014that\u2019s how we\u2019ll save money:\n\n\u201cAll successful measures for controlling expenditures\u2026 are associated with longer waits for elective procedures and reduced availability of new and expensive treatments and devices.\u201d\n\nYes, \u201clonger waits\u201d and \u201creduced availability\u201d are desirable in order to save money\u2014those will be our \u201csuccessful measures,\u201d Blumenthal says, for saving money.\n\nThat was 2001. In 2008, Barack Obama campaigned on a Democratic platform that called for spending $2500 less per person on healthcare.\n\nTo Blumenthal and the new administration, it was all so simple: The government would save money by doing less. Yet in the real world, of course, it\u2019s hard to implement such a rationing scheme.\n\nAs Dr. Drew Altman the president of the liberal-leaning Kaiser Family Foundation noted in 2009, a huge gap between the views of the policy elite and the popular mass on healthcare; the elite was firmly convinced that a third of healthcare expenditures are wasted (that\u2019s where the Democrats got their $2500-per person figure from in 2008), while the masses think, by a more than 4:1 ratio, that they aren\u2019t getting enough treatment. Yes, a full 67 percent of ordinary Americans think they should be be getting more treatment. We can readily see that it\u2019s hard to make a treatment-limiting scheme work in such an environment.\n\nAn early battle in the Obama administration\u2019s effort to control costs came later in 2009, when Blumenthal\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services sought to cut back on mammograms for women. The popular backlash was ferocious: \u201cThis is how rationing begins. This is the little toe in the edge of the water,\u201d declared Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). The administration backed down, and yet just this summer, in 2015, they were back at it again, still trying to restrict mammograms.\n\nWe might pause and note that it\u2019s a shame that so many smart people inside the government are working so hard to keep women from being healthy, but their determination is a tribute to the power of an idea\u2014in this case, the simplistic idea that blindly chopping away at healthcare expenditures whenever possible is a good thing.\n\nIndeed, the fallacy in Blumenthal\u2019s thinking is three-fold:\n\nFirst, to think that we can spend less by doing less misses the new inclusive reality of Obamacare. That is, if everyone is covered for the entirety of his or her life\u2014\u201ccradle to grave,\u201d as they say\u2014then the system is liable for the costs of the patient till death, including his or her long-term chronic illnesses. And so, for example, if a patient develops the dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), care becomes very expensive, requiring 24/7 nursing that can last for a decade or more. Changing the bedpans of AD dementia patients is low-tech, to be sure, but it\u2019s labor-intensive and thus costly. And that\u2019s the problem: In some instances, such as AD, huge expenditures come from doing nothing. So a smart system would be proactive on AD. It would be looking to stop AD from happening, or at least to delay its onset\u2014not just finance it when it does happen.\n\nUnfortunately for us, Blumenthal and the Obama administration have been mostly silent on the issue of trying to cure AD. And as they say, it\u2019s hard to defeat a foe if you can\u2019t even name it. As a result, the healthcare system must bear the massive expense of AD; today, as the Alzheimer\u2019s Association estimates, it\u2019s more than $200 billion a year, heading toward a cumulative $20 trillion by mid-century.\n\nThe point here is that it would be a lot cheaper, as well as kinder, if we had a cure for AD. Then we wouldn\u2019t have to think about managing\u2014read: rationing\u2014the care of the desperately medically needy.\n\nSecond, Blumenthal & Co. overlook the reality that if we\u2019re healthy, we can get back to work, and that puts money back into the system. Healthy people are not only less expensive to care for, but they also generate wealth, even pay taxes. As noted, it\u2019s no accident that over the last two centuries, life expectancy and real per capita GDP have closely tracked each other.\n\nThird, the Blumenthal worldview overlooks the economic value of medicine as a job- and wealth-creation engine. That is to say, our healthcare system is a lot more than just a cost, it it is also an economic asset. In the US, our hospitals are almost always crowded, and the better hospitals often fill with foreign patients\u2014that is, people bringing their money from around the world to get treatment.\n\nSo while it might seem that the easy answer is simply to spend less per patient\u2014as Blumenthal wrote, \u201clonger waits for elective procedures and reduced availability of new and expensive treatments and devices\u201d\u2014the reality is that this approach costs money, both by allowing conditions of chronic health-dependence to fester and by missing opportunities to sell willing customers more medical treatment.\n\nSo, under the influence of such static-analysis \u201cbean counters\u201d\u2014pursuing their wrong-headed notion of how the health-economy works\u2014the Democrats are stuck in tragically obsolete thinking about the healthcare system they have created.\n\nAnd so here we see the Republican opportunity: Once the GOP fully realizes that everyone is going to be covered, it only makes sense to look for smart ways to save money in that coverage. And that means cures, not reduced availability and longer wait-times.\n\nIn this new environment, if everyone is being covered, then we\u2019re all on the same team, healthcare-coverage-wise, and so now it\u2019s best to shift the focus to getting everyone cured. From being covered to being cured: That\u2019s the paradigm shift we need.\n\nYes, for purely practical reasons, let\u2019s have a strategy aimed at cures. If that strategy works\u2014and our own national history, including the successful campaign to create a polio vaccine, suggests that it will\u2014that would not only be more compassionate, but also less expensive.\n\nFor the reasons noted earlier, we might start by tackling Alzheimer\u2019s. This much is clear: If we had less AD in America, we\u2019d have a healthier, happier, and wealthier population.\n\nMoreover, as we shall see, thanks to new cyber-technology, the fact that everyone is covered makes it easier to think about everyone being cured.\n\nIV. The Impact of Metcalfe\u2019s and Moore\u2019s Law\n\nToday, when we speak of \u201ceveryone,\u201d we are inevitably thinking about larger and larger networks. And so we can apply the Internet wisdom known as Metcalfe\u2019s Law to our public-policy conundrums. Metcalfe\u2019s Law holds that the value of the network is the square of the number of connected nodes on the network. That is, a network of three nodes has a Metcalfean value of 9, a network of four nodes has a value of 16, and so on and on, up into the infinities of Big Data.\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s Law is a powerful and rigorous evocation of the value of a network\u2014for the same reason that a brain is powerful, based on the number of neurons it has, or that an urban cluster is economically valuable, based on the number of contacts and customers it has. Indeed, Metcalfe\u2019s Law is surely one of the most powerful evocations of market forces ever articulated; it tells us that a big network is powerful and valuable, and that bigger networks are even more powerful and valuable.\n\nRepublicans, of course, respect the power of market forces as described by Metcalfe\u2019s Law, and so it\u2019s not surprising that they are beginning to express themselves in Metcalfean terms.\n\nFor example, we can look to what the Koch Brothers are saying: The headline in The Washington Post on August 4, reporting from the Koch Brothers\u2019 recent donor conclave in Dana Point, Calif., reads, \u201cCharles Koch invokes fight for civil rights as model for political activism.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the civil rights movement is a powerful cognate to Metcalfe\u2019s Law: the greater the human network, the greater the potential for justice.\n\nMoreover, we can quickly see that Metcalfe\u2019s Law and the more familiar Moore\u2019s Law\u2014the latter more of an observation and a prediction than a law, that processing power is doubling every 18 months\u2014are closely related. Both laws are all about the exponentially increasing power of big networks.\n\nWe can readily see that under Metcalfe\u2019s Law, as powered by the technology implicit in Moore\u2019s Law, the gains in knowledge come from adding to, not subtracting from, the network. That is, one might say, the moore the merrier.\n\nIndeed, when Moore\u2019s Law is combined with Metcalfe\u2019s Law, we see a profoundly powerful tool for expanding our collective brain power and problem-solving capacity. Indeed, because of the unfolding of Moore\u2019s Law over the last 50 years, a computer chip made this year will be 133 million times faster than it was in 1965. We might note that even the giddiest free-market economist would probably hesitate before claiming that any supply-side tax cut would increase economic growth 133 million-fold.\n\nAs we can see, there\u2019s little, if anything, more powerful than science, unleashed. Indeed, it\u2019s a profound libertarian point to think about how supremely powerful the human mind, freed of regulation and superstition\u2014free to pursue its dream to the utmost\u2014can truly be.\n\nAnd out of these big networks comes comes the true gold of the Internet era, namely, Big Data.\n\nWhy is Big Data so valuable? What makes it so important? It\u2019s because within Big Data are the secrets of solving vexatious and costly problems, including the problem of disease.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s paradoxical that the stuff of Big Data\u2014the electronic ones and zeros\u2014is so cheap. Just as ordinary sand is the key component of the silicon in computer chips, so the mere electron is the key component in data.\n\nPhilosophers and publicists have extolled on this paradox of simple elements creating data of great value. And yet for our purposes here, all we need to do is exult in the fabulous wealth that has resulted.\n\nV. Big Data Unlocks the Secrets of Health\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s only because of Big Data that we know the full health value, for example, of other simple products, such as aspirin and garlic. Yes, those simple, inexpensive, generic pills\u2014cheap as dirt\u2014have proven to decisive in reducing heart disease costs across America. Thanks to aspirin and garlic, a middle-aged American with, say, early symptoms of angina might need only to start popping dime-a-dozen pills to stave off more serious heart problems for a decade or more. If that sounds too good to be true, well, it\u2019s true.\n\nAs one cardiologist put it, taking garlic is a \u201clove letter to your heart.\u201d It\u2019s a lot cheaper to take a couple of simple pills than it is to have open-heart surgery or coronary bypass. Garlic and aspirin are even less expensive than statin drugs. And of course, garlic and aspirin are a lot less costly than having a heart attack. Or being incapacitated or dead\u2014that\u2019s costly, too.\n\nSome might be tempted to say, of course, that the deduction that aspirin and garlic help reduce heart attacks was more a case of good doctoring, and that the Big Data was the caboose on a medical train that was already rolling down the track to better health.\n\nAnd that could be the case, but Big Data has proven itself in many fields as a lifesaver. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has had a Big Data-sharing system in place for decades, and it has worked to cut passenger aviation fatalities by 99 percent in the last half century. That is, in a bit of enlightened policymaking that seems to have eluded healthcare policymakers, the FAA simply ordered the airlines to report all safety issues to the agency. The FAA anonymizes the data, so there\u2019s no legal liability, and then works out protocols for safety procedures that are resolutely enforced on all the airlines. And the result has been a spectacular success: Tens of thousands of Americans are alive today because of the FAA\u2019s data system.\n\nSo as we can see from the success of the FAA, if intelligence and compassion are designed into the architecture of a system, the results will be intelligent and compassionate.\n\nVI. Coumadin: Teachable Moment, or Trial-Lawyer Bonanza?\n\nAnd yet in healthcare, it\u2019s no certainty that this hard-earned FAA-type methodology will be applied. We might consider, for example, the question of blood thinners in nursing homes and hospitals. Earlier this month, in a big front-page story, The Washington Post chronicled the use and misuse of the blood thinner Coumadin, which is the trade-name for the generic drug warfarin. The Post, along with Pro Publica, got its hands on a trove of data from nursing homes in Iowa, to see where Coumadin is being used properly and where it isn\u2019t. We might note that Coumadin is a particularly tricky medicine to use: Use too much and the patient is at risk of bleeding too much, use too little and the patient is at risk of a blood clot\u2014and either can be fatal.\n\nAnd here we might pause to note a law that the FAA doesn\u2019t have to worry about: HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In a million ways, most of them Naderite and \u201cmickey mouse,\u201d HIPAA cuts against the usable accumulation of Big Data by the system.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where a new politics, taking advantage of these new political realities, can help. We might note that prior to Obamacare, the strongest argument in favor of HIPAA has been the protection of medical privacy as a way of protecting the issuance of health been insurance to the needy. But that sort of red-tapey privacy protection is much less critical if people can\u2019t have their health insurance taken away under any circumstances. Yes, medical privacy is still an important goal, but if medical data can\u2019t be used to make economic judgments about the selling and holding of health insurance\u2014the industry term was \u201cadverse selection\u201d\u2014then the stakes are thankfully lower.\n\nSo as of today, it\u2019s hard to know what will become of the Post article on Coumadin. Will it be be used to improve medical understanding? To help medical professionals learn better how to manage dosage levels and thus help their patients? Or will the information be used to launch a new wave of lawsuits?\n\nWe know that the Coumadin crisis could potentially make for a great \u201cteachable moment\u201d about the value of Big Data, but only if policymakers see it that way and act accordingly. If not, and the trial lawyers take over instead, that will be the detriment of our medical knowledge. A new wave of lawsuits will put medicine into a defensive crouch. If so, that will mean new cover-ups and new layers of fear and denial in American nursing homes, lots of money changing hands in courtrooms\u2014and it won\u2019t necessarily help patients\u2019 health one bit. No one ever got cured by a lawsuit.\n\nInstead, the real goal should be move to a data-rich system in which both the doctor, and the patient, have access to the best medical understanding.\n\nVII. Star Trek to the Rescue?\n\nYes, we desperately need a Big Data \u201cTricorder\u201d approach, making this information instantly available to us. A Tricorder? As in the TV show Star Trek? Yes. The layer of fiction aside, the idea of machine that channels algorithms from the cloud is well accepted; that\u2019s why the real-world libertarian-oriented X-Prize Foundation is offering a specific X-prize for the first such \u201cTricorder\u201d device. The idea is that each medical professional, and each patient, would have a state-of-the-art checklist, constantly updated with the speed and certainty of a computer, to work from and consult. With such a Big Data system, that there\u2019s much less chance of an oversight. There are plenty of recent sad medical cases\u2014of Andy Warhol in 1987, of the twin children of the actor Dennis Quaid in 2007, and of the late Joan Rivers in 2014\u2014which demonstrate that the affluence of the patient is no barrier to incompetence. So with the Tricorder, or something similar, the goal is simple: First, get the best possible information to all the players in a medical transaction. And second, replace the \u201cgotcha\u201d mentality of an ex-post-facto lawsuit with the real-time systemic benefits of machine learning.\n\nUnfortunately, in the absence of enlightened political leadership that would push, say, the Tricorder idea along, it is likely that the more-lawsuits scenario will win. So the tort lawyers will get richer, and, starved for optimum information, we will all get sicker.\n\nWhat we must do, instead, is envision a larger, smarter system. Indeed, as we think about what it might look like, our thoughts might drift back to the points made by the libertarian economist and computer visionary George Gilder in his 1980 best-seller, Wealth and Poverty. Gilder\u2019s argument, in that hugely influential book, is that capitalism is ultimately about generosity. And from there, we can see that a free and smart people would ultimately come up with a cohesive and inclusive system like\u2026 Big Data.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan, a Gilder fan, echoed the author in his 1980 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Detroit, \u201cOur message will be: we have to move ahead, but we\u2019re not going to leave anyone behind.\u201d And so Reagan brought the conservative movement to a new place\u2014what Jack Kemp called, \u201cThe Good Shepherd\u201d model. And it\u2019s amazing how well that sort of Judeo-Christian message plays in a Judeo-Chistian country; as a challenger in 1980, Reagan carried 44 states.\n\nVIII. The New Reality of Abundance: The Republican Opportunity\n\nAs American society makes the shift from a presumption of scarcity in healthcare to a presumption of abundance, many things will change. Indeed, both parties will be well-advised to adjust their thinking in light of the new techno-reality:\n\nRepublicans will have to get used to the idea that thanks to the miracles of technology, the marginal cost of more valuable information is virtually nothing\u2014so why not give it away?\n\nAnd yet the adjustment on the left will have to be even greater. That is, Democrats of the David Blumenthal stripe will have to unlearn their paternalist planning ways; bureaucrats who built their careers on the presumption of scarcity might have a hard time learning to be generous\u2014even if, as we have seen, generosity is cost-free. This shift in thinking might be particularly hard for Democrats, since most of them have been schooled in the Green-inflected \u201climits to growth\u201d argument that presumes that we must always have less. That limits-to-growth idea came along before Big Data, and the David Blumenthals of the world have yet to embrace that new thinking.\n\nAnd so here we come to the massive Republican political opportunity: to put forth a vision of effortlessly abundant and manifestly more effective health care, i.e., cures.\n\nCertainly the Koch Brothers seem attuned to new vistas for their effort. As that August 4 Washington Post article details, the Kochs are consciously trying to broaden their political outreach to reach \u201cthe middle third\u201d of the electorate that does not, as Charles Koch explained, identify with libertarian ideology. Indeed, as we saw earlier, the Kochs see themselves as leading something akin to a new civil rights movement. That\u2019s a stated ambition both inspiring and risky; if the Kochs can succeed, they have gained much, but if they fail, they will have opened themselves to accusations of hyperbole.\n\nIn particular, the Kochs might think closely about their optimum strategy in the near-term. Surely, for example, they don\u2019t want to lead into the 2016 elections with an explicit or implicit policy of taking away people\u2019s health insurance. Obamacare is far from technically effective in achieving its stated goals of universal coverage, but it has led to a dramatic cut in the number of Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance. So surely peeling that benefit away is not at the top of the Kochs\u2019 to-do list.\n\nAnd that\u2019s certainly that\u2019s the view of the new Republican majorities in Congress. As Politico noted recently in a piece headlined, \u201cSenate downplays Obamacare repeal,\u201d the new GOP contingent in the Senate is not rushing to repeal the popular parts of Obamacare.\n\nTo be sure, conservatives might be mistrustful of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but they might do well to note that the Republican \u201cpoint man\u201d on the Obamacare issue is Sen. John Barrasso. He\u2019s an MD, but more importantly in this case, he\u2019s a certified conservative. In 2014, Barrasso was one of just 21 Republicans in the Senate to win the \u201cACU Conservative Award,\u201d alongside such better-known right-wing stalwarts as Jim Inhofe, Rand Paul, and Pat Toomey. In other words, Barrasso is no \u201csquish.\u201d And so if he says that the GOP has not yet been able to come up with a satisfactory approach to \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d we must believe him\u2014it\u2019s hard to do.\n\nIndeed, if, as Charles Koch says, the goal is to create a \u201ctruly free society,\u201d as he said, \u201cIf we cannot unite the majority of Americans behind the vision, then we\u2019re done for.\u201d Well, if the goal is to unite a majority of Americans, then the place to start on healthcare is surely not taking away people\u2019s health insurance.\n\nThen they might ask, in the spirit of goal-oriented pragmatism, What\u2019s the best way to use healthcare to advance the cause of a free society? And the answer might be: Let\u2019s get every freedom-loving American to live productively and healthily for another couple of decades because of better medicine\u2014better than would otherwise be the case. Such a spurt in libertarian longevity would advance the cause of liberty, as well as Republican political fortunes.\n\nIt is has been widely reported that David Koch has been battling prostate cancer for the last few decades. Born in 1940, has said that his goal is to see cancer eliminated in his lifetime, and he has given generously to many different anti-cancer charities.\n\nWell, here\u2019s a chance for him to not only to achieve his goal but also to help every other American. Surely that counts as good politics. In fact, thanks in large measure to President Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cwar on cancer,\u201d launched in 1971, the cancer death rate for Americans fell 22 percent from 1991 to 2011. To put the data another way, in 1975, there were about 3.3. million cancer survivors in the US. Today, there are 14.5 million cancer survivors, four times as many as 40 years ago. So we can see, immediately, that part of the political effort would be to remind those 11.2 million Americans that they owe a debt to the selfless scientists of the anti-cancer effort.\n\nSome might maintain, of course, that Obamacare is an abridgment of freedom. And perhaps it is, but if it\u2019s a tax as the Supreme Court has said, it\u2019s surely no worse than any other tax. Indeed, the realities of modern medicine tend to cut against the virtues of individualism. The long-lived rugged individualist of the future is likely to be, even so, a highly connected individual. As noted, Big Data puts a premium on human interconnection; in the most literal sense, it\u2019s the staff of life for medicine. If, as 17th century English poet John Donne wrote, \u201cno man is an island,\u201d that truth is even more true now.\n\nIn the meantime, surely the right can appreciate the wisdom that a good way to see freedom prevail is for the Koch Brothers, now both in their late 70s, to live and stay active until they are, say, 100 or more. To a billionaire, the cost of covering everyone is a lot smaller than the cost of one of them dying. And in fact, it\u2019s not just billionaires who should feel this way on the strictest economic grounds; if you do the math, most Americans\u2014and so the country as a whole\u2014would gain economically from being alive and healthy and working longer. (Especially when everything is getting cheaper, e.g. using aspirin and garlic to fend off heart disease, thus staving off the expense of, say, open-heart surgery.)\n\nIX. Thomas Jefferson Called It, More Than Two Centuries Ago\n\nAs we have seen, the \u201csecret sauce\u201d of Metcalfe and Moore\u2019s Law is greater knowledge; in this Information Age, it\u2019s knowledge that\u2019s really valuable. And so gaining that knowledge is a stupendous achievement, but once it\u2019s gained, it might as well be shared. Indeed, the always sagacious Thomas Jefferson seems to have seen the genius of Big Data well in advance; as the former president wrote in 1813, \u201cThat ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,\u201d is, indeed, a wondrous thing. Indeed, he continued, the propagation of ideas \u201cseems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point.\u201d That is, with an idea, we can all have it, and all benefit from it, without taking anything away from the ides itself.\n\nAs we can see, the fusion Metcalfe\u2019s Law and Moore\u2019s Law, pragmatically applied, could be transformative to our politics. That is, the abundance of Metcalfe and Moore could make fools of those who wish only to traffic only in scarcity. The geniuses of the future will be those who have a plan for replacing the the old calls for stingy limits, to be replaced by new traffickers in near-unlimited open-source abundance.\n\nX. The Infinite Promise of Non-Rival Goods.\n\nWe might note that the economic term for such knowledge is \u201cnon-rival\u201d; economists make a distinction between rival and non-rival goods. A rival good is something that is inherently limited, like, say, 19th century French Impressionist paintings, or houses with a nice ocean view. By contrast, a non-rival good ha no such limitations. With non-rival goods, the scarcity strategy makes no more sense than rationing typewriters if the currency has shifted to the electronic ones and zeroes of computer programs.\n\nHealthcare may never be truly inexpensive. That is, even if, in the future, it is dispensed by robot doctors and apps\u2014and the the dirt-cheap fruits of mass- but personalized production\u2014such knowledge will still be expensive to acquire. And so there will always be a role for government in making it cheap\u2014or, if one prefers, a role for private charity.\n\nBut healthcare, as a non-rival good, will likely be less expensive than rival goods. A night in a hospital might never be truly cheap, but it\u2019s easy to see how it could be cheaper than a night at a five-star hotel.\n\nIndeed, new technology has a way of continuously flummoxing the old conventional wisdom. For example, the FDA has recently approved the first 3-D printed medicinal pill. Such 3-D printing, in conjunction with the personalized medicine made possible by Big Data, will allow for variable but ultra-precise dosing per pill, which is exactly what patients needing blood thinner, for example, will want and need.\n\nIndeed, despite the best efforts\u2014perhaps we should say, the worst efforts\u2014of the Naderites who wrote and rule over HIPAA, it\u2019s possible that visionaries will yet produce a Tricorder that will guide medicine.\n\nIndeed, even the rich will benefit from the ease and immediacy of the robot doctors of the future, which will some day perform diagnostics, and even surgery, with the same precision and immediacy as a cell phone today.\n\nAnd so yes, perhaps it\u2019s ironic that this new world of medical potential is possible because we\u2019re in a new era, because Obamacare is the law of the land. Indeed, as we consider the possibilities of Metcalfe, Moore, and Big Data then go on into further fields of personalized medicine and 3-D printing, we can see the value, however unintended, of settling the old disputes over insurance coverage.\n\nYes, as noted, the truth is that Metcalfe and Moore have taken us into a new ethical dominion of health, in which we all, in effect, be looking out for each other through the mechanism of our shared common data.\n\nThe challenge is to help everyone see this new dominion, this new paradigm, this larger vision of abundance in health and healthcare\u2014the sooner the better!", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Ethical Dominion for Healthcare, from Scarcity to Abundance: Metcalfe\u2019s Law + Moore\u2019s Law + Pragmatism = A New Cure Strategy for GOP", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A New Ethical Dominion for Healthcare, from Scarcity to Abundance: Metcalfe\u2019s Law + Moore\u2019s Law + Pragmatism = A New Cure Strategy for GOP", "title": "A New Ethical Dominion for Healthcare, from Scarcity to Abundance: Metcalfe\u2019s Law + Moore\u2019s Law + Pragmatism = A New Cure Strategy for GOP - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4488, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/AP_100104112089.jpg", "height": 2892}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/08/a-new-ethical-dominion-for-healthcare-from-scarcity-to-abundance-metcalfes-law-moores-law-pragmatism-a-new-cure-strategy-for-gop/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A New Ethical Dominion for Healthcare, from Scarcity to Abundance: Metcalfe\u2019s Law + Moore\u2019s Law + Pragmatism = A New Cure Strategy for GOP", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/AP_100104112089.jpg", "title": "A New Ethical Dominion for Healthcare, from Scarcity to Abundance: Metcalfe\u2019s Law + Moore\u2019s Law + Pragmatism = A New Cure Strategy for GOP - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Alzheimer's, Coumadin, David Blumenthal, healthcare, Healthcare Spending, HIPAA, John Barrasso,Big Government, Medicine, Tech,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "John Barrasso", "published_time": "2015-08-08T01:43:15-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Medicine,Tech"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe058d\"", "article_summary": "And for sure, good health is the true path to spending less, for the simple reason that good health is less expensive than sickness.\nThe Four Wins of the Cure StrategyToday, good health is not just a win, it\u2019s actually a win-win-win-win\u2014four wins.\nInstead, true political wisdom, true pragmatism, tells us that we should help Americans become healthier and thereby consume less from the healthcare system.\nWith such a Big Data system, that there\u2019s much less chance of an oversight.\nAnd out of these big networks comes comes the true gold of the Internet era, namely, Big Data."}
