Chris Christie called Obamacare a \"failed federal program\" during a heated exchange with a health policy advocate during a town hall meeting in South River today.\n\nChristie and Maura Collinsgru of New Jersey Citizen Action repeatedly spoke over one another as they went back and forth over healthcare in the state. At issue was the administration's efforts to connect residents to health insurance coverage.\n\nThe state did not submit a plan by deadline for spending $7.6 million in federal money to help explain the federal health insurance law to residents.\n\nCollinsgru said that was one example of how the Christie administration is not connecting people to the coverage they need.\n\nChristie batted down the criticism today, saying, \"we've expanded Medicaid. We're the second most generous Medicaid program in the United States of America.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Collinsgru said, \"but the marketplace people need to connect. And that's almost 400,000 of them who qualify for subsidies. We need to help them connect.\"\n\n\"You believe that Obamacare works and I believe it does not,\" Christie told .Collinsgru.\n\nCollisgru said insurers, hospital systems, advocates and even Christie's own Medicaid director all agree they must connect people to coverage. \"We're asking you to join that,\" she said.\n\n\"Two weeks ago I met with my Medicaid director, she had no complaints,\" Christie said. \"So I think that my access to my Medicaid director is significantly better than your opinion of it.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Chris Christie touts Sandy buyouts at South River town hall meeting\n\n\u2022 Chris Christie town hall disrupted by protesters again\n\n\u2022 More Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack-obama, chris-christie, health-news, obamacare, south-river, news", "title": "Christie calls Obamacare a 'failed federal program'", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "At issue was the administration's efforts to connect residents to health insurance coverage", "title": "Christie calls Obamacare a 'failed federal program'", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/chris_christie_gets_in_heated_exchange_over_medicaid_at_town_hall_meeting.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/23/260701695001/201403/668/260701695001_3357683430001_vs-53289389e4b050f742b7a360-1592194024001.jpg?pubId=260701695001", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At issue was the administration's efforts to connect residents to health insurance coverage", "creator": "@#!/ledgererin", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/23/260701695001/201403/668/260701695001_3357683430001_vs-53289389e4b050f742b7a360-1592194024001.jpg?pubId=260701695001", "title": "Christie calls Obamacare a 'failed federal program'", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, March 18, 2014,  3:21 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, March 18, 2014,  2:13 PM", "article_author": "Erin O'Neill | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "At issue was the administration's efforts to connect residents to health insurance coverage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccaaf\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Chris Christie touts Sandy buyouts at South River town hall meeting\u2022 Chris Christie town hall disrupted by protesters again\u2022 More Politics\nChris Christie called Obamacare a \"failed federal program\" during a heated exchange with a health policy advocate during a town hall meeting in South River today.\nThe state did not submit a plan by deadline for spending $7.6 million in federal money to help explain the federal health insurance law to residents.\n\"So I think that my access to my Medicaid director is significantly better than your opinion of it.\"\nSOUTH RIVER \u2014 Gov."}
