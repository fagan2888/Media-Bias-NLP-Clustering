After a two-year investigation into whether the IRS knowingly targeted conservative groups, the Justice Department will not bring charges against IRS official Lois Lerner and the larger agency. Although officials found rampant 'mismanagement' within the IRS, that does mean it is guilty of criminal activity, the DOJ concluded.

"We found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution," Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik said in the letter. "We also found no evidence that any official involved in the handling of tax-exempt applications or IRS leadership attempted to obstruct justice. Based on the evidence developed in this investigation and the recommendation of experienced career prosecutors and supervising attorneys at the department, we are closing our investigation and will not seek any criminal charges."
