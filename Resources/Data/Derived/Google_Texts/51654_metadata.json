Republican Robert Dold won the seat in 2010, lost it to Democrat Brad Schneider in 2012 and reclaimed it in 2014.\n\nSchneider, a Deerfield management consultant, hopes to wrest it back in November. But first, there's a primary showdown against Nancy Rotering, an attorney who is mayor of Highland Park.\n\nSchneider is a business-friendly moderate who won our endorsement in the 2012 primary over three others. He remains a fine candidate and we won't be disappointed if he wins this one. But Rotering, who says her No. 1 legislative priority would be combating gun violence, impressed us with the passion she would bring to that perennial lost cause. As mayor of the North Shore suburb, she passed an assault weapons ban meant to invite a lawsuit from the firearms lobby. The measure survived legal challenges all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and has become a model for other municipalities, she says. She's spoiling for a fight at the federal level.\n\nOn most matters, Schneider and Rotering agree more than they disagree. Their biggest difference is over whether Congress should have approved the nuclear deal negotiated between the White House and Iran. Rotering says she would have been a yes; Schneider was an early and loud no \u2014 he felt it didn't go far enough to constrain Iran \u2014 but says he's solidly committed to enforcing and strengthening it.\n\nBoth say changes are needed to preserve the Affordable Care Act, but Rotering \u2014 who has a master's degree in health services management, worked in benefits analysis for General Motors and has practiced health care law \u2014 would likely bring more to those discussions. Our endorsement goes to Rotering.\n\nDold, of Kenilworth, is unopposed in the Republican primary.\n\n7th District\n\nNonprofit consultant and former military journalist Thomas Day, of Chicago, wants to create an \"ecosystem for manufacturing jobs\" in the 7th District. He says the district is missing out on federal funding for training programs that would help \"upskill\" unemployed residents to fill jobs in the modern economy. He believes Rep. Danny K. Davis, also of Chicago, has ignored the local digital startup community. Maybe the congressman isn't a fixture at 1871, Chicago's entrepreneurial hub. But the district has benefited greatly from legislation Davis authored creating federal tax credits for developers who build in disadvantaged areas, and from his support for higher education grants for predominantly black colleges. He also sponsored the recently reauthorized Second Chance Act, which provides funding to help ex-offenders re-enter the community after completing their sentences. Davis is endorsed.\n\n11th District\n\nDuPage County Board member Tonia Khouri of Aurora has the backing of the Republican establishment in the 11th District primary, but why is a mystery. Her campaign website provides scant information that would be useful to voters; it's mostly a list of her supporters, with a photo gallery and a \"donate\" button. She didn't fill out our candidate survey and stonewalled our requests for an interview. (The Sun-Times reports that she skipped its endorsement process, too.) Two other strong candidates \u2014 Naperville physicist Herman B. White and Darien cardiologist Nick Stella \u2014 made their way onto the ballot without help from the political machinery. Neither has held elected office, but their backgrounds more than qualify them to represent the district. Both are well prepared to address the deficiencies of the Affordable Care Act, for example. Our choice is White. He's a longtime scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, where the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Bill Foster, also of Naperville, spent 22 years. White has served on research advisory panels to several federal agencies, is a trustee for North Central College, and served on the boards of Edward Hospital and the Teachers Academy for Mathematics and Science in Chicago. He says he would advocate for technological innovations that would drive economic growth. White is endorsed.\n\nFoster has no opponent in the Democratic primary.\n\n12th District\n\nPaula Bradshaw of Carbondale and Sadona M. Folkner of Fairview Heights are running for the Green Party nomination. No endorsement. Incumbent Rep. Michael Bost is unopposed in the Republican primary. Charles \"C.J.\" Baricevic is unopposed on the Democratic side.\n\n13th District\n\nRep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville has been a key player on legislation affecting farmers and veterans, two major constituencies in the 13th District. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he helped craft and pass a five-year highway bill, the first in nearly a decade. Carrollton pharmacist Ethan Vandersand says Davis has a \"terrible\" voting record and is particularly upset that Davis voted for the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill negotiated between GOP leaders and the White House. We agree with Davis that the measure contains significant wins for conservatives, including a modest stab at entitlement reform; Vandersand is stuck on all the things it didn't do, especially defunding Planned Parenthood. Vandersand says he was called by God to run for Congress and declined to be interviewed by the Tribune. Davis is endorsed.\n\nMark D. Wicklund of Decatur is unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\n14th District", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "More Chicago Tribune endorsements for the U.S. House", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The Tribune continues endorsements today in contested primaries for the U.S. House.", "title": "More Chicago Tribune endorsements for the U.S. House", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-congress-endorsements-davis-rotering-dold-edit-0226-jm-20160225-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56cf516a/turbine/ct-congress-endorsements-davis-rotering-dold-edit-0226-jm-20160225", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Chicago Tribune endorsements, Nancy Rotering, Danny Davis, Herman White, Bob Dold, Brad Schneider, Rodney Davis, John Shimkus, Jim Walz, Jack Boccarossa", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86019762", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-02-25", "Description": "This is the second installment of Chicago Tribune endorsements for Illinois seats in the U.S. House: Nancy Rotering, Danny Davis, Herman White, etc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Chicago Tribune endorsements, Nancy Rotering, Danny Davis, Herman White, Bob Dold, Brad Schneider, Rodney Davis, John Shimkus, Jim Walz, Jack Boccarossa"}, "article_summary": "The Tribune continues endorsements today in contested primaries for the U.S. House.\nTheir biggest difference is over whether Congress should have approved the nuclear deal negotiated between the White House and Iran.\nMark D.
