To help restore order, cable companies and professional organizers offer some suggestions.\n\n1. Find a container\n\nCaddies for remotes come in a huge range of prices and styles. There are clear Acrylic organizing cubes (US Acrylic), non-skid rubber with voluptuous curves in impossible-to-miss primary colors (J-Me Cozy Remote Control Tidy), faux-leather organizers in staid brown and black that rotate for convenience (Cosmos) and wooden organizing boxes with NFL team logos. For those loath to park one more thing on an overworked coffee table, some caddies hang saddle-bag style over a chair or sofa armrest (Ikea). \u201cDefinitely don\u2019t store it beside the TV,\u201d said Liz Jenkins, a professional organizer in Franklin, Tenn. \u201cAs with everything in your house, you should store it closest to where you\u2019ll be using it.\u201d Kevin Hall of Clutter No More, Inc. in San Diego says that keeping track of remotes is a chronic problem. \u201cOur top idea is putting a strip of Velcro on the back of a clipboard, then on the back of each remote, and keep the board by where you usually sit,\u201d he said.\n\n2. Streamline\n\nCan you retire some of these remotes? \u201cWhen it comes to organizing anything, whether it\u2019s shoes or china or remotes, you need to evaluate how many things you have and how many you really need,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\n3. Go universal\n\nUniversal remotes range in price from around $10 to several hundred dollars. \u201cWhen you have a big pile of remotes, my top advice is to get a universal remote and find a 12-year-old to program it,\u201d said Jenkins.\n\n4. Get smart(phone)\n\nApps can turn your smartphone into a remote. Popular apps include Dijit, Roomie, Re, iRule, Zsmart, Commandfusion and Openremote.\n\nIn addition, TV manufacturers and cable providers have their own apps, some voice-activated, to replace remotes.\n\n4. Buy a replacement\n\nIf you\u2019ve lost a remote, ask your cable provider to come to the rescue. Providers are accustomed to such requests; replacements are ubiquitous online and in stores.\n\n5. Back to the future\n\nTelevision existed years before remotes became commonplace. An old-fashioned TV with a channel button, if you\u2019re lucky enough to find one, requires you to get up and cross the room.\n\n6. Get radical.\n\nIf all else fails, there\u2019s always the option of going screen-free. Take a walk, read a book, have coffee with a friend.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Remote-control chaos: 7 ways to control the clutter of remotes", "title": "Remote-control chaos: 7 ways to control the clutter of remotes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/25/remote-control-chaos-7-ways-to-control-the-clutter-of-remotes/", "image": {"width": 490, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__20140726_C4_fe26ahhowtop1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__20140726_C4_fe26ahhowtop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T16:25:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:33:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd939c\"", "article_summary": "Go universalUniversal remotes range in price from around $10 to several hundred dollars.\nIn addition, TV manufacturers and cable providers have their own apps, some voice-activated, to replace remotes.\nThere are often separate remotes for the TV, DVD player, cable box and sound system, gaming consoles, light dimmers, air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, etc.\nRemote controls have become so numerous in many homes that keeping track of them is a challenge all its own.\nFind a containerCaddies for remotes come in a huge range of prices and styles."}
