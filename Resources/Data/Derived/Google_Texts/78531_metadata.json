While it is a dangerous disease that Washington needs to take seriously, America could face even an even greater medical threat in the future: the threat of bioterrorism.\n\nAccording to a recent article by Matt Mayer, chief operating officer of the Liberty Foundation of America and former Department of Homeland Security official, the U.S. has been fortunate no successful bioterrorist attacks have occurred on U.S. soil.\n\nBut terrorists\u2019 inability to successfully attack to U.S. is not due to their lack of trying. Mayer mentions a laptop that was found in a raid in the Middle East several months ago, containing details on the use of biological weapons.\n\n\u201cDespite spending billions in the interim, the federal government and our health-care system remain unprepared,\u201d writes Mayer. A successful bioterrorist attack could do more damage to the American populace than a virus that requires a lot of work to treat the infected and and to protect those with whom they have come into contact.\n\nThe threat of a bioterrorism attack is not a new concern for America \u2013 it was a high priority on past and present administrations\u2019 to do lists. Jim Carafano, vice president for the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation, has previously mentioned the need for the administration to focus more assistance on establishing a \u201cnational bioterrorism watch system\u201d and ensure the [U.S. military\u2019s] Northern Command is fully prepared for any such events.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation will host an event that provides more information on the Ebola virus on Monday, Oct. 17 entitled Ebola: U.S. Domestic and Foreign Policy Options.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You should be more worried about bioterrorism than ebola.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You should be more worried about bioterrorism than ebola.", "title": "Bioterrorism Should Be a Bigger Concern Than Ebola", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/518592637.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-24T11:59:46+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yqPRMC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You should be more worried about bioterrorism than ebola.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/518592637.jpg"}, "title": "Bioterrorism Should Be a Bigger Concern Than Ebola", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-10-24T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T11:59:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa40\"", "article_summary": "The Heritage Foundation will host an event that provides more information on the Ebola virus on Monday, Oct. 17 entitled Ebola: U.S.\nThe Ebola virus has been headline news in America as of late.\nThe threat of a bioterrorism attack is not a new concern for America \u2013 it was a high priority on past and present administrations\u2019 to do lists.\nWhile it is a dangerous disease that Washington needs to take seriously, America could face even an even greater medical threat in the future: the threat of bioterrorism.\n\u201cDespite spending billions in the interim, the federal government and our health-care system remain unprepared,\u201d writes Mayer."}
