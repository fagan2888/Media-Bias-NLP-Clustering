Let me rephrase that to include West Coast readers: Did you feel the ground shift a lot beneath your feet last week? Well, it did, at least in terms of Medicare benefits and how the agency goes about its core job of paying health care providers for the care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThese were really important changes, and while the Maven does admit a tendency to go overboard about tremors and such, you need to know this stuff.\n\nBeginning in 2016, doctors will get paid by Medicare for having voluntary consultations with patients and their families about end-of-life medical planning and needs. Early indications are that doctors will get paid $75 to $85 for initial and follow-up half-hour sessions. If it turns out that doctors aren\u2019t being paid enough to make them eager to offer these services to Medicare patients, this figure could go up over time. Whatever the price, it\u2019s a bargain in terms of the potential benefits it can bring patients and their families.\n\nAs noteworthy as the change was in its own right, there was nearly no backlash from the \u201cdeath panel\u201d crowd who had harped so much on that feature of Obamacare. Remember when vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin managed to cow the White House and caused it to back away from end-of-life counseling in the Affordable Care Act? What were we thinking? Don\u2019t answer that. Just be grateful the mood of America is changing, and perhaps this phony issue has, shall we say, met its own demise.\n\nBringing end-of-life discussions into the mainstream of medical care is long overdue. People are living longer, often much longer. This is mostly good news, but it does mean that record numbers of Americans are reaching their 80s and 90s. When they get there, the natural course of physical decline will render them less able to take care of themselves. Likewise, cognitive decline will make it very hard for them to navigate the very demanding sets of planning tasks surrounding end-of-life medical, estate and legacy issues. More likely than not, many of the family members who could help them will no longer live nearby as has been the case for earlier generations of aging Americans.\n\nLump all these factors together, and it\u2019s clear that building proactive health care plans for our later years is essential. Doing so can take enormous emotional and financial stress off seniors and their families and friends. Planning ahead is crucial. Coping with a parent or other loved one in decline is challenging in its own right, but much, much harder if it has to be done in a crisis environment. Making good decisions in a crisis is the exception, not the rule.\n\nMORE FROM MAKING SEN$E\n\nWhile it\u2019s terrific that doctors will now be able to have more of these conversations, getting Medicare beneficiaries and their families to participate in them is hardly a foregone conclusion. We don\u2019t like to talk about death and dying, even though such conversations can be immensely helpful and often create a sense of positive acceptance and closure for everyone involved.

Right now, Medicare pays these individual costs as they are incurred during the replacement process. The range of costs \u2014 for the surgery and related tests and procedures \u2014 is enormous, raising questions about whether many beneficiaries are receiving medical care that is unneeded and much more costly than need be.\n\nIn announcing the change, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that the average costs in some markets for just the hospital costs for such joint replacements are between $16,500 and $33,000. That\u2019s an enormous range. Officials want to bring down costs and standardize prices for procedures so they do not vary depending on where a person lives.\n\nBeginning next year, Medicare will set standard fees for all such expenses, bundling them together into a payment for all care provided within 90 days of the initial surgery. This bundled-care approach will be tried out in 75 metro areas. The amount of the fee is still to be determined.\n\n\u201cIncentives to coordinate the whole episode of care \u2014 from surgery to recovery \u2014 are not strong enough, and a patient\u2019s health may suffer as a result,\u201d the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announcement said. \u201cWhen approaching care without seeing the big picture, there is a risk of missing crucial information or not coordinating across different care settings. This approach leads to more post-surgery complications, high readmission rates, and inconsistent costs. These are not the health outcomes patients want.\u201d\n\nAll care providers in the test markets \u2014 hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and in-home care agencies \u2014 would be required to work together and build coordinated care plans for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing joint replacements. They also would be evaluated and compensated based on patient outcomes.\n\nCoordinating the care of Medicare beneficiaries and basing payments on the quality of that care represent an enormous shift for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services away from the traditional fee-for-service approach to Medicare. Today, most Medicare beneficiaries can select whatever doctors, hospitals and other care providers they wish. So long as the providers participate with Medicare and accept its fee schedules, they can provide a beneficiary\u2019s care. Often, however, there is little or no coordination among different health care providers.\n\nThe so-called \u201cdoc fix\u201d bill passed by Congress last April ended the system used to set the fees for doctors providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. The old system had called for annual cuts to doctors\u2019 Medicare fees for many years, leading to an annual fix by Congress to override the cuts. The new law junked that old formula and replaced it with a stable fee structure for participating physicians.\n\nBut the measure also launched far-reaching changes permitting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to create programs of care where payments to health care providers would be based on quality and patient outcomes and not just on providing medical services for a fee.\n\nThe new joint replacement test is a major step by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services toward quality-based pricing for health care services. The agency has announced a goal of basing half of all Medicare on such care by 2018. This is a big goal, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regularly cranks out significant changes to Medicare, and more are surely on the way.\n\nBasing Medicare payments on improved patient outcomes is a terrific goal. But there will be lots of speed bumps along the way. The big takeaway for people on Medicare is not to assume the future will be like the past. Your health plans will be changing. The rules under which your doctors and hospitals are compensated will be changing. The quality of your care may improve, and the cost of that care may decline. But turning \u201cmay\u201d into \u201cwill\u201d is, more than ever, up to you. I will, however, be here to answer your questions along the way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beginning in 2016, doctors will get paid by Medicare for having voluntary consultations with patients and their families about end-of-life medical planning and needs.
