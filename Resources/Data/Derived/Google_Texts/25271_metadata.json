But don\u2019t blame the kids. Parents are missing in action.\n\nExcept most Asian-American parents. They tend to oversee their children\u2019s homework, hold them accountable for grades, and demand hard work as the ticket to a better life. And it pays off. Their children are soaring academically.\n\nThe outrage is that instead of taking an example from these Asian families, school authorities and non-Asian parents want to rig the system to hold these strivers back. It\u2019s happening across the nation.\n\nAs a group, other Americans need to take a page from the Asian parents\u2019 playbook. American teens rank a dismal 28th in math and science knowledge, compared with teens in other countries, even poor countries. Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan are at the top.\n\nWe\u2019ve slumped. For the first time in 25 years U.S. scores on the main test for elementary and middle school education (NAEP test) fell. And SAT scores for college-bound students dropped significantly.\n\nCould changes in these tests be to blame for the alarming drops? That convenient excuse was blown out of the water by the stellar performances of Asian-American students. Even though many come from poor, or immigrant families, they outscore all other students by large margins on both tests, and their lead keeps widening.\n\nIn New York City, where Asian-Americans make up 13 percent of overall students, they win more than 50 percent of the coveted places each year at the city\u2019s selective public high schools, such as Bronx Science and Stuyvesant.\n\nWhat\u2019s at work here? It\u2019s not a difference in IQ. It\u2019s parenting. That\u2019s confirmed by sociologists from Queens College in New York and the University of Michigan. Their study showed that parental oversight enabled Asian-American students to far outperform the others.\n\nNo wonder many successful charter schools require parents to sign a contract that they will supervise their children\u2019s homework and inculcate a work ethic.\n\nThat formula is under fire at the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District in suburban New Jersey, where Asian-American immigrant families moved in recent years to secure the best education for their children. The school district, which is 65 percent Asian, routinely produces seniors with perfect SAT scores, admissions to M.I.T, and top prizes in international science competitions.\n\nBut many non-Asian parents are up in arms, claiming there is too much pressure and their kids can\u2019t compete. In response, this fall the school superintendent David Aderhold apologized that school had become a \u201cperpetual achievement machine.\u201d God forbid!\n\nAderhold canceled accelerated and enriched math courses for fourth and fifth grades, which were 90 percent Asian, and eliminated midterms and finals in high school.\n\nUsing a word that already strikes terror in the hearts of Asian parents, he said schools had to take a \u201cholistic\u201d approach. That\u2019s the same euphemism Harvard uses to limit the number of Asians accepted and favor non-Asians.\n\nAderhold even lowered standards for playing in school music programs. Students have a \u201cright to squeak,\u201d he insisted. Never mind whether they practice.\n\nNeither Aderhold nor parents in charge of sports are offering nonathletic kids a \u201cright to fumble\u201d and join an overwhelmingly non-Asian varsity football team.\n\nMeanwhile in New York City, Mayor De Blasio and the NAACP want to eliminate the competitive exam for the city\u2019s eight selective high schools and rig admissions with a \u201cholistic\u201d approach. That means robbing poor, largely immigrant and first-generation kids \u2014 nearly half the students get subsidized school lunches \u2014 of the chance to study hard and compete for a world-class education.\n\nAs Dennis Saffran explains in \u201cThe Plot Against Merit,\u201d some Asian-American eighth-graders practice for two years for the test, while their parents work in laundromats and restaurants to pay for exam prep classes.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping white, Hispanic and black parents from doing the same thing?\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research and author of \u201cGovernment by Choice: Inventing the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 CREATORS.COM\n\nNBPDiversity\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/02/war-on-asian-success/", "article_author_name": "Betsy McCaughey", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AdobeStock_52524410.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "achievement, asian, asian-americans, hard work, math, parents, school, students, success"}, "description": "For American public education, 2015 was a dismal year, at least by the numbers.
