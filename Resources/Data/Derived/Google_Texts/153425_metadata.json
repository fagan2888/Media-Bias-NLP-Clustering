Compared to the 51.6 million employees in the enterprise sector, these figures alone show how impactful small business employment is on our economy and people.\n\nAccording to ADP employment records, small businesses created 108,000 jobs in March 2015. As the year moves forward, so does small business hiring, albeit cautiously. As they look to slowly but surely add to their workforce, small businesses are tapping cloud-based tools to manage their staff and customer relationships.\n\nFrom a management perspective, the biggest concern small business owners are facing in the HR realm is the cost of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation.

Indeed, hiring plans for many owners (34%) are flat compared to last year.\n\nRelated: Small Business Funding in 2015\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data shows that startups now account for fewer jobs than in the past, which might surprise some given the current startup landscape.

But improved education around the issue doesn\u2019t change that they\u2019re concerned about costs and losing valuable employees due to their inability to provide competitive benefits.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study showed the connection between the size of a firm and whether it offers health insurance or not. Almost 50% of businesses with 3-9 workers offer health insurance benefits to their employees. The ratio grows to 71% for firms with 10-24 employees, to 85% for firms with 25-49 employees, and to 99% for firms with 200 employees or more.\n\nWhat Can I Do About It?\n\nStaying in the know and prepared will help you navigate hiring and employee management solutions in the upcoming year.
