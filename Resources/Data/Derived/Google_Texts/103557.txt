Meditation has been practiced, fine-tuned, and enhanced throughout human history. Archaeologists discovered wall art dating back approximately 5,000 to 3,500 BCE, with images depicting people sitting with hands rested on folded knees and eyes slighted narrowed yet not completely shut. As years gave way to centuries, different cultures throughout the world have adapted their own meditation practices with the common goal of mental, physical, and/or spiritual refinement.

With so many different versions, approaches, and postures, choosing which type of meditation is right for you can be overwhelming. Different techniques can fall under two main umbrellas: concentrative meditation and nondirective meditation. Concentrative meditation directs a person to focus primarily on their own breathing or specific thoughts, which in turn suppresses other thoughts, while nondirective meditation allows a person to focus effortlessly on their breathing or sound.
