But it's also worth noting that their impulse\u2014the body, made more powerful or more beautiful through technological augmentation\u2014is in some ways extremely un-prosthetic. These newest devices are less about technology filling in where nature has been limited and more about technology bettering nature itself. They're less about replication, and more about amelioration.\n\nThe prosthetic digit\u2014the oldest little piggy in the world\u2014is extraordinarily lifelike, its curved nail sunken into a similarly curved bed. Which is, in its way, remarkable. A toe! One that is several thousand years old! And it's not just a toe-sized peg\u2014a little device that would have made mobility more manageable for someone who was, by reasons of birth or amputation, missing her big toe. The prosthesis is, as much as it possibly could be, humanoid: maximally lifelike and maximally toe-like. The \"Cairo Toe,\" as it's been dubbed, is prosthetic and cosmetic at once\u2014evidence not just of ancient manufacturing stepping in where biology was limited, but of manufacturing engaging in an ancient form of biomimcry.\n\nThe earliest known prosthesis , dating possibly as far back as 950 B.C., was discovered in Cairo on the mummified body of an ancient Egyptian noblewoman. The prosthesis is made largely of wood, molded and stained, its components bound together with leather thread. It is, as prostheses go, tiny.\n\nWhich brings us back to that wooden toe from Cairo. The earliest prosthesis seemed to have no intention of bettering nature. Instead, it, and the devices that would soon follow, treated the body as a kind of platonic model, molding themselves according to the curves and planes of the human form. It wasn't until later\u2014much, much later\u2014that we began to think beyond the lifelike.\n\nThe Cairo Toe, 700-950 B.C.\n\nThe Cartonnage Toe, 600 B.C.\n\nThe Cartonnage Toe (The Lancet)\n\nThis toe, also Egyptian and dating a couple hundred years after the Cairo toe, is composed of cartonnage, a papier-mache-like substance made from linen, plaster, and glue. While the Cairo Toe was likely an ancient mobility aid, the cartonnage toe was likely used for cosmetic purposes. As the Wellcome Collection puts it, \"The fact that it does not bend seems to imply it was used for the sake of appearances only and did not help the wearer to walk correctly.\"\n\nRoman artificial leg, 300 B.C.\n\nThe Capua Leg (sciencemuseum.org)\n\nThe image above is a replica of an artificial leg found in a Roman grave in Capua, Italy. The leg, discovered in 1910, dates from 300 BC. (Why is the image a replica? The historical version of the limb, after its discovery, was kept at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, where it was destroyed in a World War II air raid.)\n\nWar Prostheses of the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nG\u00f6tz's artificial arm, 16th century (myarmoury.com)\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, wars were conducted using swords and other weapons that swiped and otherwise crushed limbs. This, combined with the fact that missing limbs were often considered to be shameful deformities, led to innovations in prosthetics. Artificial limbs, as extensions of knights' suits of armor, began to be constructed of iron.\n\nAnd yet they were still lifelike\u2014as in the prosthetic arm above and below, created for the Franconian Knight G\u00f6tz von Berlich after a cannonball took his left arm in 1504. Here's a closeup of the limb:\n\nG\u00f6tz's artificial arm, 16th century (myarmoury.com)\n\nNote, again, the nail beds. And the knuckle creases. This is a tool\u2014the fingers are curved to grip a sword\u2014that is also, in a meaningful if not fully literal way, a hand.\n\nThis also makes the tool, as a prosthesis, conscribed to its time. We have, with our creative adaptations of new technologies, moved beyond simple biomimicry. We have moved into a new realm of human augmentation. As Gear Patrol summed it up: \"The real question the world should be asking isn\u2019t 'will prosthetic science match what evolution spent 200,000 years perfecting?', but rather, 'when will it surpass it?'\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "While today&#39;s prosthetics strive to surpass human capabilities, the earliest versions sought to replicate them.", "author": "Megan Garber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "While today&#39;s prosthetics strive to surpass human capabilities, the earliest versions sought to replicate them.", "title": "The Perfect, 3,000-Year-Old Toe: A Brief History of Prosthetic Limbs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/cairo_toe/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-perfect-3-000-year-old-toe-a-brief-history-of-prosthetic-limbs/281653/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Cartonnage Toe (The Lancet)This toe, also Egyptian and dating a couple hundred years after the Cairo toe, is composed of cartonnage, a papier-mache-like substance made from linen, plaster, and glue.\nWhile the Cairo Toe was likely an ancient mobility aid, the cartonnage toe was likely used for cosmetic purposes.\nThe Capua Leg (sciencemuseum.org)The image above is a replica of an artificial leg found in a Roman grave in Capua, Italy.\nThe Cairo Toe, 700-950 B.C.\nThe Cartonnage Toe, 600 B.C."}
