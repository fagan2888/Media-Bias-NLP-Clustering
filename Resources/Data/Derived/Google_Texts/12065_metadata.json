Denver, like most teams this time of season, is battling injuries at critical positions.\n\nLinebacker Brandon Marshall (concussion) and cornerbacks Aqib Talib (hamstring) and Kayvon Webster (dislocated shoulder) did not practice during the period open to reporters on Wednesday. The Broncos remain optimistic that Marshall will pass the league-mandated concussion protocol and be available to start Sunday against the Chiefs. Talib participated in only 17 plays in the win over the Dolphins as he tried to work through the leg issue.\n\nHe is expected to update his condition Wednesday. Webster entered as his backup and was hurt in the fourth quarter. He is less likely to play, leaving Omar Bolden possibly seeing time in nickel packages. From a matchup standpoint, the Broncos could catch a break if compromised in the secondary. The Chiefs lean heavily on the run, and no Kansas City receiver owns a touchdown reception. Tight end Travis Kelce leads Kansas City with four receiving scores.\n\nJulius Thomas (left ankle) warmed up with the team on Wednesday, but spent time on the sideline working with the strength coach. He missed last week\u2019s game. He has said his ankle continues to improve, making it possible he will play this week.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Linebacker Brandon Marshall (concussion) and cornerbacks Aqib Talib (hamstring) and Kayvon Webster (dislocated shoulder) did not practice Wednesday.", "title": "Brandon Marshall, Aqib Talib, Kayvon Webster not practicing", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/26/injured-brandon-marshall-aqib-talib-kayvon-webster-practicing-julius-thomas-remains-limited/31090/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2013/12/kayvon-webster.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Linebacker Brandon Marshall (concussion) and cornerbacks Aqib Talib (hamstring) and Kayvon Webster (dislocated shoulder) did not practice Wednesday.", "creator": "@troyrenck", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/26/injured-brandon-marshall-aqib-talib-kayvon-webster-practicing-julius-thomas-remains-limited/31090/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2013/12/kayvon-webster.jpg", "title": "Injured Brandon Marshall, Aqib Talib, Kayvon Webster not practicing; Julius Thomas remains limited", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "Aqib Talib,Brandon Marshall,Dolphins,Hamstring,Injuries,Julius Thomas,Kayvon Webster,Omar Bolden,Travis Kelce", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Linebacker Brandon Marshall (concussion) and cornerbacks Aqib Talib (hamstring) and Kayvon Webster (dislocated shoulder) did not practice Wednesday."}, "article_summary": "Linebacker Brandon Marshall (concussion) and cornerbacks Aqib Talib (hamstring) and Kayvon Webster (dislocated shoulder) did not practice during the period open to reporters on Wednesday.\nThe Chiefs lean heavily on the run, and no Kansas City receiver owns a touchdown reception.\nTight end Travis Kelce leads Kansas City with four receiving scores.\nThe Broncos remain optimistic that Marshall will pass the league-mandated concussion protocol and be available to start Sunday against the Chiefs.\nTalib participated in only 17 plays in the win over the Dolphins as he tried to work through the leg issue."}
