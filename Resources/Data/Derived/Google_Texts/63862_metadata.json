More than 85,000 people enrolled in health insurance plans through the exchange in 2015, up from 76,000 people in 2014.\n\nStatewide, Blue Cross of Idaho Health Services reported paying $221 million in claims in 2014, while only getting $188.7 million in premium payments\u2014a $32 million loss.\n\nThe company fared better over the first four months of 2015, reporting $77 million in claims and $77.9 million in premium payments.\n\nBlue Cross of Idaho will increase the rate for an average individual plan covering a 40-year-old nonsmoker from $266.19 in 2015 to $299.12 next year.\n\nSelectHealth increased premiums for similar plans from $260.37 in 2015 to $296.74 in 2016, a 13.96 percent increase.\n\nThe cost of Regence Blue Shield plans slightly decreased or stayed the same. Individual plans were an average of $312.16 in 2015, and will dip slightly to $307.78 next year. Small group plans remained the same in this region, with an average price of $341.\n\nThese do not include employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\nInsurance companies work with the Department of Insurance in setting the rates. The department can\u2019t approve or establish rates, but it can find them unreasonable.\n\nAfter negotiating with carriers since May, the department did not determine the rates to be unreasonable.\n\n\u201cIn spite of our best efforts in working with carriers, health insurance rates will be increasing for some Idahoans in 2016,\u201d Director Dean Cameron said in a news release. \u201cWe will continue to explore more ways to minimize increases going forward. In the meantime, we urge consumers to review their plans and shop wisely.\u201d\n\nIn justifying the rate increase for next year, Blue Cross cited the ongoing market adjustments that insurance companies are grappling with under the Affordable Care Act. The law first took effect in 2013, and the company said it\u2019s needed some experience with the new market conditions to accurately adjust prices, according to comments it submitted to the Department of Insurance.\n\n\u201cWe based rates in 2014 and 2015 on Idaho\u2019s pre-Affordable Care Act individual market,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cAs a result, many insurance plans in the individual market were underpriced in 2014 and 2015.\u201d\n\nLower-income residents who buy health insurance plans through the exchange are eligible for subsidies.\n\nSelectHealth wrote that since the plans began in 2014, the average premium per member was $286 per month. The average amount of claims paid per member was $508 per month.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Idaho Mountain Express Newspaper", "description": "Health insurance premiums are on the rise throughout Idaho, including for companies insuring Blaine County residents.", "title": "Idaho insurance rates will rise next year", "url": "http://www.mtexpress.com/news/state_regional/idaho-insurance-rates-will-rise-next-year/article_e1401220-5100-11e5-ba20-f7ca7ecfa0ea.html", "image": "http://mtexpress.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IdahoMtExpress", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Health insurance premiums are on the rise throughout Idaho, including for companies insuring Blaine County residents.", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "state_regional,business", "news_keywords": "state_regional,business"}, "article_summary": "The rates cover plans offered through Your Health Idaho, the state-run exchange created under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\nMore than 85,000 people enrolled in health insurance plans through the exchange in 2015, up from 76,000 people in 2014.\n\u201cAs a result, many insurance plans in the individual market were underpriced in 2014 and 2015.\u201dLower-income residents who buy health insurance plans through the exchange are eligible for subsidies.\nHealth insurance premiums are on the rise throughout Idaho, including for companies insuring Blaine County residents.\nStatewide, Blue Cross of Idaho Health Services reported paying $221 million in claims in 2014, while only getting $188.7 million in premium payments\u2014a $32 million loss."}
