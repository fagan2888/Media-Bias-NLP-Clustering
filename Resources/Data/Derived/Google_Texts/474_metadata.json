Jeff Sessions, a conservative favorite.\n\nSessions, known for his outspoken opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s immigration policies, is currently the top Republican on the budget committee. It was assumed he would become chairman when Republicans take control of the Senate in January.\n\nBut in a move that has shocked Republicans on Capitol Hill, Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi is now making a play for the chairmanship, telling fellow lawmakers he has seniority over Sessions to take over the committee in January.\n\nDaniel Head, Enzi\u2019s spokesman, confirmed to The Daily Caller on Friday that Enzi is seeking the budget chairmanship.\n\n\u201cUnder the Republican conference rules, he has seniority for the post and it is Senator Sessions that is challenging him, not the other way around,\u201d Head said. \u201cSenator Sessions is currently the ranking member because Senator Enzi did not exert his seniority two years ago.\u201d\n\nSessions and Enzi both entered the U.S. Senate the same year, but under the complicated rules of the Senate, Enzi is considered more senior.\n\nIt likely won\u2019t be decided until January who gets the seat. The Republicans on the committee would vote a secret ballot for chairman.\n\nEnzi briefly faced a primary challenge in this year\u2019s election from Liz Cheney, who argued the senator wasn\u2019t aggressive enough in promoting his conservative views in the Senate. Sessions, meanwhile, is known as a reliable voice against the Obama administration\u2019s policies, logging more time as a speaker on the Senate floor than any other senator in 2013.\n\nTo reassure conservatives, the Enzi spokesman emphasized Friday the senator\u2019s conservative views, especially on immigration.\n\n\u201cSenator Enzi hopes to use his committee assignments next year to reduce the debt and balance the federal budget; repeal Obamacare; reverse the president\u2019s illegal executive amnesty; and reform our outdated tax code,\u201d Head said.\n\n\u201cSenator Enzi has long been an opponent of executive amnesty,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cHe is in favor of using any appropriate, viable and constitutional means to stop the president\u2019s overreach.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenge, the Enzi spokesman said the senators remain friendly. \u201cSenator Enzi and Senator Sessions were friends before this, are still friends, and will be after this,\u201d Head said. \u201cThey will work it out.\u201d\n\nBut conservative talk radio is fuming over Enzi\u2019s play for the seat.\n\n\u201cMike Enzi is a nice guy, but he\u2019s not a battler,\u201d Rush Limbaugh said this week. \u201cSo if the leadership wants to get Sessions out of the way\u2026 That alone tells you what the Republican leadership\u2019s mind-set is on this.\u201d\n\nA Sessions spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday afternoon. We\u2019ll update when we hear back.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Wyoming Sen.
