An autistic 14-year-old boy \u2013 thinking he\u2019s doing the ALS ice bucket challenge \u2013 instead gets drenched with feces, urine, and spit by classmates.\n\nBay Village Police say they\u2019ll send their findings to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s Office early next week. Charges against five of the victim\u2019s classmates will then be determined on the evidence gathered.\n\nMany people and groups want the act considered a hate crime, including the Autistic Self Advocacy Network based in the DC area. Julia Bascom is its Director of Programs.\n\n\u201cThe definition of a \u201chate crime\u201d is a crime that\u2019s motivated by prejudice against an individual in a marginalized category. This wouldn\u2019t have happened to an individual who didn\u2019t have a disability.\"\n\nBut Bascom says Ohio\u2019s hate crime law only covers race, ethnicity, and national origin.\n\nThat\u2019s something Democratic State Representative Nickie Antonio of Lakewood aims to fix, with House Bill 300. She says it would extend protection for other marginalized groups.\n\n\u201cDisability, gender identity, and sexual orientation,\" explains Antonio. \"I wanted to make sure that Ohio\u2019s law was more comprehensive. People who perpetrate these kinds of crimes, send a message that you -- and all the people in your category -- should be on high alert now.\u201d\n\nAntonio says the bill needs to move out of committee and presented to the state senate next. She\u2019s hopeful her legislation will pass in light of the uproar surrounding the Bay Village prank.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The investigation into the pranking of an autistic student in Bay Village is expected to wrap up today.
