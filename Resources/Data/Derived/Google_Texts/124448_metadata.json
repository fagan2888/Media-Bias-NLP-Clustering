View Larger View More \u00bb Football is more than a sport to the Jablonskis.\n\nThe Richmond Hill family wants to share their passion with as many as possible, but they want to make sure the athletes are safe when playing the physical game.\n\nThat\u2019s especially important given the growing popularity of South Bryan County Recreation Department football. Rec coaches estimate that 200 players are gearing up for the 2015 season.\n\nThe Jablonskis formed a nonprofit, Full Potential Football, out of a desire to make sure players are safely equipped.\n\nTheir drive to ensure athletes\u2019 safety began not long after they moved to Richmond Hill from Ohio five years ago. On arriving, they quickly plugged into South Bryan County Rec sports. Phil Jablonski began coaching, and his wife, Gina, served as team mom.\n\n\u201cKids were coming to practice with equipment that wasn\u2019t suitable, they were often hungry, and their shoulder pads were too small,\u201d said Gina Jablonski. \u201cThey had blisters on their feet, or they were wearing soccer cleats. It wasn\u2019t safe. Parents had come to us and verbalized their kids needed monetary help and help with the equipment. Phil and I decided we would start with our team, so we did that.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, we began realizing a bigger need for it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn 2013, we began stepping up and buying when we saw the need.\u201d\n\nPhil Jablonski coached the South Bryan County Recreation U12 football team to a state championship in 2013.\n\nLast year, he didn\u2019t coach, but began serving on the rec board. That gave the Jablonskis a bird\u2019s-eye view of the youth football players\u2019 equipment situation.\n\n\u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t just for kids on our team; it was universal,\u201d Gina Jablonski said. \u201cWe saw kids with the wrong equipment. We didn\u2019t just want to call that out. We wanted to help and provide them what they needed.\u201d\n\nSo they established Full Potential Football with the goal of making sure youth players are safe on the field.\n\n\u201cLast year was the lightbulb moment,\u201d Gina Jablonski said. \u201cThis goes beyond equipping kids. This isn\u2019t a low-income program; it is available for those in regards to safety.\u201d\n\nShe added that 20 families are using donated equipment with a value of more than $2,000.\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve been able to fulfill requests,\u201d Jablonski said. \u201cEighty percent of our items we have purchased on our own;\n\n20 percent have been donated.\u201d\n\nWith Full Potential Football, Phil Jablonski checks equipment, making sure it is in good condition and properly fits the athletes. Gina Jablonski keeps inventory and makes sure the right equipment is issued to those in need. Their younger son, 15-year-old Jake, a student athlete at Richmond Hill High School, also helps with computer work as well as seeking new items from friends and Wildcat teammates.\n\n\u201cI remember my parents having difficulties purchasing athletic gear for me,\u201d Phil Jablonski said. \u201cI can only imagine how tough it is today for families to purchase needed gear for their student athletes.\u201d\n\nThe Jablonskis have another son, Nick, 25, who is an officer with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department. Phil Jablonski is an executive with Johnson Controls, a Fortune 100 company.\n\nFull Potential Football needs previously used football equipment to build up a larger stock of inventory.\n\n\u201cEquipment is just showing up,\u201d Jablonski said. \u201cSo many people have responded to generously give us their used equipment. Our greatest blessing is that we have been able to give this equipment away.\u201d\n\nThe Jablonskis want local families and businesses to know that there are many ways to contribute.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar we get, we use to the max,\u201d Gina Jablonski said. \u201cIf businesses want to donate something, we will raffle it off to grow our funds for merchandise. We appreciate anything.\u201d\n\nThe Jablonskis\u2019 desire to help the growing athletes doesn\u2019t stop with meeting their physical needs.\n\n\u201cWe want to meet all their needs,\u201d Gina Jablonski said. \u201cOur relationships we have developed with these kids are a blessing. Tight bonds are formed. The bonds we are making make it all worth it. We want these kids to know we are faith, family and football \u2014 giving your all and glorifying God in all you do.\u201d\n\nPhil Jablonski added, \u201cI believe that the players will see the kindness of others and God\u2019s love for all through the love we have for the game, the players and our community.\u201d\n\nEventually, Jablonski said, he would like Full Potential Football to grow to the point that it would be able to provide the resources for anyone who would like to play football.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, I would like to see FPF grow into a program where athletes can receive individual one-on-one training to be the best players they can be,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see the program expand into coaching/leadership training for youth coaches.\u201d\n\nThat would include providing coaching seminars, training players and working with coaches at middle and high schools to create a reliable feeder program from rec football.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bryancountynews.com/archives/38680/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/bryancountynews/article/2015/08/13/Jake_Jablonski_Wildcat_football_player_and_USA_Footballs_National_Team_member_.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Football is more than a sport to the Jablonskis.", "title": "Playing the game right, and safe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Playing the game right, and safe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9acc\"", "article_summary": "Full Potential Football needs previously used football equipment to build up a larger stock of inventory.\nThe Jablonskis formed a nonprofit, Full Potential Football, out of a desire to make sure players are safely equipped.\n\u201cI remember my parents having difficulties purchasing athletic gear for me,\u201d Phil Jablonski said.\nPhoto provided/ Phil Jablonski has a word with a young athlete.\nThat gave the Jablonskis a bird\u2019s-eye view of the youth football players\u2019 equipment situation."}
