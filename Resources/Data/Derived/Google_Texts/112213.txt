The family of Cori Romero, the woman shot in the neck while driving on Interstate 25 near Fort Collins, says she is doing better after the terrifying incident.

Romero’s aunt, Lesley Quezada, told 7NEWS that the 20-year-old is recovering at Medical Center of the Rockies and shared a photo of her giving a thumbs up — to let everyone worried about her know she’s OK.

“That’s just the kind of person Cori is,” said Quezada. “She’s a kind caring person, and her faith, she said, is what has gotten her through this far.”
