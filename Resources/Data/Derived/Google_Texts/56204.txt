EVERETT, Pa. (AP) - State police say they’re investigating the death of a woman during treatment at a western Pennsylvania kidney dialysis clinic.

The (Johnstown) Tribune-Democrat (http://bit.ly/1TGSkOb ) reports 55-year-old Mary Elizabeth Goetz, of Hopewell, died Monday at the U.S. Renal Care clinic in Snake Spring Township, Bedford County. That’s about 100 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.

Police say the woman’s arterial blood line was disconnected from her heart catheter and wasn’t noticed by the staff for “an unspecified amount of time.” The woman lost a lot of blood and died a short time later at UPMC Bedford Memorial Hospital.

Police say autopsy results are pending.

U.S. Renal Care has more than 200 dialysis clinics or home programs in 19 states.

The company says it is “saddened” by Goetz’s death and is “continuing to gather information.”
