It will be only the third veto of his presidency but almost certainly not the last.\n\nOn Tuesday, without any fanfare or speech, President Obama will issue his first veto of 2015. By refusing to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline bill, Obama will usher in a new and contentious relationship with the Republican-controlled Congress that will likely result in many more vetoes before he leaves office.\n\n\u201cI would anticipate, as we\u2019ve been saying for years, that the president will veto that legislation, and he will, so I would not anticipate a lot of drama or fanfare around it,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday.\n\nIf anything, the White House has been surprised Obama hasn\u2019t been able to veto Keystone sooner, since Congress passed the contentious bill more than a week ago.\n\n\u201cI have been perplexed by this process and the way it\u2019s unfolded. Congress passed this bill like 10 days ago but it\u2019s just coming to the White House, apparently as early as tomorrow,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nRather than hold an event to publicize the rationale behind Obama\u2019s veto of Keystone XL, the White House will reportedly send out an email announcing it.\n\nBut in stopping the transit of petroleum from the forests of Alberta to the Gulf Coast, Obama will be opening the veto era of his presidency.\n\nThe expected Keystone veto, the third and most significant of Obama\u2019s six years in office, would likely be followed by presidential vetoes of bills that could emerge to make changes in the Affordable Care Act, impose new sanctions on Iran and roll back child nutrition standards, among others.\n\nFor Obama, his Cross Townsend black rollerball pen will become an extension of his second-term strategy to act alone in the face of Republican opposition and safeguard his legislative record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new period of his administration,\u201d said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. \u201cHe will use the veto to protect his past record and not allow things he disagrees with to go forward.\u201d\n\nRep. David Price, D-N.C., said Obama had little choice: \u201cI don\u2019t think, in this divided government, there\u2019s much doubt he will have to use it.\u201d\n\nBut to Republicans who want to use their congressional majority to reverse the president\u2019s regulatory agenda and block his executive actions, vetoes would be prime examples of what they see as Obama\u2019s arrogance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies don\u2019t like,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.\n\nIf Obama takes the veto path in his last two years in office, he could easily surpass the 12 vetoes of his immediate predecessor, President George W. Bush. He will not come close to the 635 vetoes President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued during his 12 years in office or the 414 by President Grover Cleveland during his first term. But Obama might match the 37 by President Clinton or the 44 by President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe statistics reflect how rare the veto has become in the modern presidency. Although the veto was once an accepted step in back-and-forth negotiations between presidents and lawmakers, historians say the increased partisanship and gridlock on Capitol Hill have made it more of a last-ditch measure.\n\nSome lawmakers say partisanship could in fact hold down Obama\u2019s veto count by preventing Republican-sponsored legislation from reaching the president\u2019s desk in the first place.\n\nRepublicans hold 54 seats in the Senate, and most legislation requires 60 votes to avoid a filibuster that would block passage. That means the Democratic minority led by Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada can still stop Republican efforts to pass legislation if Senate Democrats hold together.\n\nAs an example, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, noted that Senate Democrats were holding up Republican efforts to pass a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security because it includes provisions that would undermine Obama\u2019s executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. That has so far spared the president from having to veto the Republican legislation.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve seen so far, Democrats in the Senate are for the most part wanting to protect him on his priorities,\u201d Portman said.\n\nEarnest said presidents must always be mindful that Congress can override a president\u2019s veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. An overridden veto is an indication of weakness that presidents try to avoid, which gives Obama\u2019s Democratic allies in the Senate another incentive to block legislation before it gets to him.\n\nStill, members of both parties are bracing for a future in which Republicans muscle through legislation the president will reject. Lawmakers in both parties have proposed legislation to sanction Iran, despite warnings by Obama that such a move could harm ongoing nuclear negotiations. Senators have already drafted a bill to eliminate the medical-devices tax, a highly contested part of Obama\u2019s health law. Last year, House Republicans pushed to roll back child nutrition standards that were backed by first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nRepublicans could well start by pushing through budget measures, some of which require only 51 votes in the Senate and cannot be blocked by Democrats, then dare Obama to veto them.\n\nMcConnell has described another prospect in which Republicans would move to pass individual appropriations bills to provide funding for the different agencies of government, rather than passing one overall bill to fund the government. Republicans would attach to each of the bills \u201criders\u201d \u2014 contested provisions likely to be offensive to Obama \u2014 that would likely lead the president to veto the bill.\n\nSpecifically, McConnell has vowed to attach riders to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s annual budget bill that would stop the enactment of two major climate-change regulations.\n\nJody Freeman, director of Harvard\u2019s environmental-law program and a former senior counselor to the president, said there was no doubt Obama would veto such an effort if Republicans got it through Congress.\n\nThe Keystone bill, which White House officials have promised the president will veto, passed Feb. 11, but Republicans said they would not officially deliver it to Obama\u2019s desk until this week, when they were back from a break. Their strategy is to have Obama reject the bill when they are in session, giving them the opportunity to rally and denounce the president on the floors of the Senate and House.\n\nEnvironmentalists have spent years marching and protesting against the pipeline, and have long urged Obama to reject the permit application from TransCanada, the company hoping to build it. White House officials say, however, that the president will veto the bill because it would shift the authority to approve the pipeline from the White House to Congress \u2014 essentially reducing the president\u2019s power.\n\nA veto would not mean the end of the Keystone project; rather, it would allow Obama to retain the authority to make a final decision on whether to approve it.\n\nPrice said that even though Democrats had voted for the Keystone bill, they would rally behind Obama\u2019s veto to make sure Congress did not override it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the substance of the decision,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the blatant challenge of the president\u2019s authority. That\u2019s why the veto will be upheld.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and conservative advocacy groups said they intended to denounce the veto of the bill as a rejection of a project that has bipartisan support among most Americans.\n\nThe conservative super PAC Americans for Prosperity, partly funded by the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles and David Koch, has already launched a media campaign criticizing the expected veto.\n\nBill Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said both parties needed to work together to avoid repeated clashes that ended with a veto pen. A wave of vetoes, he said, serves no one.\n\n\u201cTo avoid just vetoing everything and becoming the president of no,\u201d Hoagland said, \u201che\u2019s going to have to work with Congress, and they are going to have to work with him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama plans to reject a Republican attempt to force construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.
