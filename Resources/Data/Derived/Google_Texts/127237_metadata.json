U.S. President Barack Obama's sweeping healthcare overhaul on Monday went before the U.S. Supreme Court where the nine justices began hearing arguments in a historic test of the law's validity under the U.S. Constitution. REUTERS/Jason Reed (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH CIVIL UNREST) - RTR2ZWK8\n\n4202593\n\nIt\u2019s no secret to anyone involved in health care today that a daunting challenge involves how to ensure appropriate use of new medicines that offer tremendous curative power at an inordinately high cost.\n\nThe best way has yet to be found. But two entirely wrong ways have emerged, and both involuntarily implicate treating physicians badly, one in an obvious and outrageous manner, the other in an opaque and devious one. As it happens, the American Medical Association\u2019s House of Delegates is meeting this weekend, affording the country\u2019s medical establishment the perfect opportunity to take a firm and forceful stand against both.\n\nThe obvious and outrageous \u201ccost control technique\u201d was announced last month by one of the country\u2019s largest managed care organizations, WellPoint, potentially impacting thousands of patients in New York City and across the state. The company stated simply that instead of continuing to have cancer-treating doctors (oncologists) select which drug on its formulary to use for a particular patient, it would start \u201cincentivizing\u201d doctors to use the one it favored (usually the cheapest). This \u201cincentive\u201d will take the form of a $350 monthly payment per patient.\n\nPolicymakers have another term for such \u201cincentives.\u201d Under the Federal anti-kickback statute, any person or entity who receives, pays, offers or solicits anything of value in order to induce or reward the ordering or referral of products and services covered by federal health care programs is guilty of a felony, and faces civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and may be the subject of a claim for treble damages under the False Claims Act.\n\nThe scope of the statute is limited to federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 so while this particular application may lie outside the law\u2019s reach, that doesn\u2019t change what it is. WellPoint would undoubtedly argue that its goals are altruistic \u2013 to reduce costs. Perhaps, but does that give Drug Company X the right to pay a physician a monthly stipend to prescribe its drug because it happens to be cheaper than Company Y\u2019s? This gambit could quickly become the rage unless patients who expect doctors to have their care foremost in mind (and doctors who agree) demand it be stopped.\n\nThe other \u201ccost control\u201d technique is much more opaque and devious. The objective is to keep information from the physician and the patient, leading to use of the less expensive medicine because actual \u201cselection\u201d of drug defaults to a third party (the payer). This applies to a particular category of medicines called \u201cbiologics\u201d \u2013 those made using living cells and very large and complex molecules \u2014 and comes into play when an original (or \u201cpioneer\u201d) biologic loses its patent exclusivity and other makers compete for market share by marketing similar ones (called \u201cbiosimilars\u201d).\n\nThose who would deny doctor and patient the right-of-selection have concocted a pretty easy way to do it \u2013 give the original, and every biosimilar to it, the same name. Strange as it may sound this is no frivolous proposal, in fact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission held a hearing on it earlier this year, where some suggested it was necessary in order to promote \u201ccompetition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Dr. Bert Petersen", "description": "Two new private-sector cost cutting measures pose a threat to independent diagnostics.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "It\u2019s no secret to anyone involved in health care today that a daunting challenge involves how to ensure appropriate use of new medicines that offer tremendous curative power at an inordinately high", "title": "Manipulating Physicians To Block Access Isn\u2019t The Way To Control Healthcare Costs", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/03/manipulating-physicians-to-block-access-isnt-the-way-to-control-healthcare-costs/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vivek.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two new private-sector cost cutting measures pose a threat to independent diagnostics.", "title": "Manipulating Physicians To Block Access Isn\u2019t The Way To Control Healthcare Costs Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/03/manipulating-physicians-to-block-access-isnt-the-way-to-control-healthcare-costs/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vivek.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-03 15:26:36", "sailthru.title": "Manipulating Physicians To Block Access Isn't The Way To Control Healthcare Costs", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "medicaid,medicare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "medicaid,medicare,wellpoint", "sailthru.description": "It\u2019s no secret to anyone involved in health care today that a daunting challenge involves how to ensure appropriate use of new medicines that offer tremendous curative power at an inordinately high", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vivek.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Perhaps, but does that give Drug Company X the right to pay a physician a monthly stipend to prescribe its drug because it happens to be cheaper than Company Y\u2019s?\nThe scope of the statute is limited to federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 so while this particular application may lie outside the law\u2019s reach, that doesn\u2019t change what it is.\nREUTERS/Jason Reed (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH CIVIL UNREST) - RTR2ZWK84202593It\u2019s no secret to anyone involved in health care today that a daunting challenge involves how to ensure appropriate use of new medicines that offer tremendous curative power at an inordinately high cost.\nThose who would deny doctor and patient the right-of-selection have concocted a pretty easy way to do it \u2013 give the original, and every biosimilar to it, the same name.\nWellPoint would undoubtedly argue that its goals are altruistic \u2013 to reduce costs."}
