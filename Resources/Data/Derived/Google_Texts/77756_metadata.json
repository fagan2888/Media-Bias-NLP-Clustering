While most of the deep web is not mired in criminality - resources such as academic databases and libraries are said to make up much of its content - darknets typically run on the fortress-like Tor network.\n\nTor, which stands for \u2018The onion router,\u2019 started out as a military project, but now functions largely as a highly clandestine civilian network.\n\n\u201cWhen you refer to the deep web that is used by criminals, it\u2019s the web that uses the encrypted Tor network,\u201d Matthew Green, assistant research professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, told FoxNews.com. \u201cEvery connection that you make with Tor is not only encrypted, but it\u2019s routed via three \u2018hops\u2019 around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a cloud that anonymizes your traffic,\u201d added Pierluigi Paganini, author of the book \u201cThe Deep Dark Web\u201d and founder of the Security Affairs blog. \u201cThe traffic is bounced among randomly proxy computers maintained by volunteers worldwide, before sending it on to final destination.\u201d\n\nUsers connect to the network by downloading a free Tor web browser, which can then be used to access myriad 'hidden' sites. \"There are specific repositories that are lists of what is available,\" said Paganini. \"You copy the addresses into the Tor web browser and then access the pages.\"\n\nThe Tor Metrics web site says that the network has just over 2.25 million users.\n\nPaganini explained that people communicating via Tor include the likes of whistleblowers and journalists. Activists and dissidents are also said to use the network, particularly in countries with repressive regimes. With Tor offering extremely high levels of anonymity, however, criminals have been quick to exploit it.\n\n\u201cToday, for a cybercriminal, it\u2019s quite easy,\u201d Paganini said, explaining that crooks can use Tor-based black markets for drugs, weapons, underage sex, and hacking services. Payments, he added, can be made using virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.\n\nThe best-known Tor-based black market was the notorious Silk Road, an underground marketplace for the likes of narcotics and weapons. The site, which generated an estimated $1.2 billion between 2011 and 2013, was seized by U.S. authorities last year.\n\nAccording to a court filing, the FBI exploited a software misconfiguration on the site\u2019s login page, which accidentally revealed the location of its server.\n\n\u201c[Silk Road] got busted because they made mistakes,\u201d said Green. \u201cThey made some mistakes in the way that they set up the server \u2013 that got them caught.\u201d\n\nWhile a technical error helped investigators bring down Silk Road, relatively little is known about law enforcement\u2019s tactics for infiltrating Tor-based darknets. The FBI, however, reportedly used a mass malware attack to target Tor servers as part a major child pornography investigation last year.\n\nThe FBI has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from FoxNews.com.\n\nNonetheless, Tor clearly remains a headache for the authorities. Documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden purportedly describe the intelligence agency\u2019s ongoing struggle with the clandestine network.\n\nEntitled \u2018Tor Stinks,\u2019 the June 2012 presentation, which was published in The Guardian last year, states that \u201cwe will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time.\u201d The document adds, however, that \u201cwith manual analysis\u201d the agency can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users.\n\nAccording to the document, the NSA has access to very few Tor \u201cnodes\u201d - computers which relay traffic across the Tor network. The document claims that the NSA\u2019s U.K. counterpart GCHQ runs Tor nodes under a project code-named \u2018Newton\u2019s Cradle.\u2019\n\nPotential tactics for tackling Tor are also discussed, such as setting up a large number of slow nodes to degrade the network\u2019s stability and using cookies to identify Tor users. Some cookies may \u201csurvive\u201d Tor use, depending on how \u201ctargets\u201d are using the network, according to the presentation.\n\nIn a statement emailed to FoxNews.com, the NSA said that it collects \"only those communications that it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes,\" noting that it has \"unmatched technical capabilities\" to accomplish its mission.\n\n\"As such, it should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract targets\u2019 use of technologies to hide their communications,\" it added. \"Throughout history, nations have used various methods to protect their secrets, and today terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers and others use technology to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.\"\n\nGCHQ declined to comment on this story, but noted, in an emailed statement, that all of its work \"is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework.\"\n\nPaganini told FoxNews.com that law enforcement and intelligence agencies across the globe are working hard to peel away the anonymity of Tor users. Confronted with the challenge of breaking the network\u2019s encryption or attacking flaws in its infrastructure, attackers are concentrating their efforts on the latter option, according to the security expert.\n\nStill, though, much of Tor remain clouded in secrecy.\n\nEven the number of sites running on the network is a mystery, although Green estimates that it may be a relatively modest number. \u201cThe number of sites is not enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably in the hundreds, I would guess.\u201d\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "article_metadata":
