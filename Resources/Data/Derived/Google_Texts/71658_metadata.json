The Nicholson Foundation has found that sponsoring out-of-state, or even out-of-country, learning trips is an especially effective way to spread knowledge and inspire new ways of thinking.\n\nThe Nicholson Foundation is dedicated to addressing the complex needs of vulnerable populations in New Jersey\u2019s urban and other underserved communities. Over the years, we have sponsored many trips that have sent hundreds of New Jersey health leaders beyond the Garden State to study approaches used and innovations practiced elsewhere. The knowledge these leaders have brought back has helped transform how care is delivered at home.\n\nHere are some of the beneficial outcomes we have seen from these learning trips:\n\nHelping participants gain perspective on how health care is financed and delivered elsewhere\n\nHealth care stakeholders often think that the way things are done in their state is the only way they can be done. This is understandable because the unique institutional and bureaucratic norms and expectations that have developed are frequently the only ones to which they have been exposed. In many instances, however, approaches outside of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d are worth learning about and considering.\n\nFor the past five years, The Nicholson Foundation has sponsored an annual out-of-state learning trip for members of the QI Collaborative, which consists of leaders of New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs are groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers who come together voluntarily to coordinate care for their Medicaid patients and share in any savings that may result. Several states have implemented Medicaid ACOs, but each state has unique legal structures governing them and financial means for supporting them.\n\nThe QI Collaborative\u2019s most recent learning trip was to Minnesota, a state whose experience with the Medicaid ACO model is more extensive than New Jersey\u2019s is. We wanted to expose New Jersey\u2019s ACO leaders to the challenges and successes their Minnesota counterparts are having. According to trip participant Greg Paulson, executive director of the Trenton Health Team, \u201cWhile each state has its own model, we\u2019re all trying to achieve the same results. Sharing the creative approaches implemented in other states is incredibly valuable.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey participants saw the critical role that state financial support in Minnesota has played in enhancing the chances that the Minnesota model would be successful. As a result, the participants increased their advocacy to urge New Jersey state government to do the same. This has already yielded a positive outcome\u2014Gov. Chris Christie (R) just announced in his \u201cState of the State\u201d address on January 12 his commitment to provide state funds to support the Medicaid ACOs.\n\nHelping participants learn best practices they can incorporate in clinics back in New Jersey\n\nFederally qualified health centers (FQHCs) serve the most vulnerable populations, and they are always seeking ways to improve care and reduce costs. We are funding a series of trips for the New Jersey Primary Care Association and its FQHC members to visit highly regarded FQHCs in other states, so they can learn about and implement clinical and business practices successfully being used in other areas of the country.\n\nIn October and December 2015, representatives from the majority of New Jersey\u2019s FQHCs traveled to Community Health Center in Middletown, Connecticut, and the Whitman-Walker Health in Washington, DC. According to trip participant Jillian Hudspeth, CEO of the New Jersey Primary Care Association, \u201cSome of the New Jersey FQHC leaders were so impressed by what they saw on these site visits that they have begun to make policy and program changes.\u201d Hudspeth, too, is incorporating many of the lessons learned from the trips into the association\u2019s plans for the future.\n\nIntroducing key decision makers to new models of care delivery\n\nHigh-level health care decision makers who have the authority to implement broad systems change are busy people. They generally do not have time to scope out the field for promising up-and-coming programs. This presents a window of opportunity for foundations to play the role of \u201cadvance scouts\u201d by learning about promising new approaches and bringing them to the attention of these decision makers.\n\nAn example of how foundations can play this advance-scout role is The Nicholson Foundation\u2019s sponsorship of trips to Project ECHO. ECHO is an innovative model of care that was pioneered by Sanjeev Arora at the University of New Mexico. ECHO helps primary care providers learn how to better treat patients with certain chronic complex conditions by using telecommunications technology and case-based learning to foster mentoring partnerships between specialists and primary care providers. We\u2019re currently working with partners to create a New Jersey Academic Medical Center ECHO Hub, which will expand the application of this model in the Garden State.\n\nTo bring the ECHO model to the attention of high-level decision makers at health plans, hospitals, and state agencies, we\u2019ve sponsored five group trips to Project ECHO\u2019s New Mexico headquarters. Through these trips, we\u2019ve been able to build consensus around the usefulness of the model and achieve a commitment to work together to help develop and sustain ECHO in New Jersey.\n\nInspiring participants to embrace radical new thinking\n\nPerhaps the most far-flung and adventurous learning trip that The Nicholson Foundation has sponsored was a trip to India for a dozen members of Cooper University Hospital\u2019s Advanced Care Center (a primary/specialty care clinic dedicated to serving safety-net patients in Camden, New Jersey). The group visited the pioneering Aravind Eye Care System. Aravind has developed a range of techniques to inexpensively treat cataracts and prevent blindness, including a method known as the \u201cfocused factory model.\u201d Our goal was to have the trip participants, who work in one of New Jersey\u2019s most challenging and underserved environments, look at how others are reengineering health care and to imagine their own radical solutions for the clinic in Camden.\n\nAs a result of the visit, the Cooper Advanced Care Center instituted group visits to treat several medical conditions using the focused factory model. To increase the efficiency and effectiveness of individual patient care visits, they also adapted another Aravind technique and are shifting some responsibilities for routine medical tasks from physicians to nurses and medical assistants.\n\nSpurring networking, friendships, and long-lasting collaborations among participants\n\nFinally, one of the best reasons to sponsor learning trips is that they catalyze genuine friendships and long-lasting collaborations among participants in ways that typical conferences and meetings may not. In our work lives, we are often siloed into competing institutions, or defined solely by our affiliation with government, the private sector, philanthropy, or a nonprofit. Yet, we all face the same challenges when trying to improve the health care system. By building a collaborative spirit in a new context, learning trips can break down those barriers and help us approach these challenges together.\n\nLinda Schwimmer, who as president and CEO of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute works to support the development of the state\u2019s Medicaid ACOs, says that she has witnessed firsthand how the learning trips have built a sense of community among ACO leaders. \u201cThere\u2019s something about stepping out of work responsibilities that allows people to build stronger personal connections and builds a sense of being members of a common group\u2026they feel more bonded,\u201d said Schwimmer. \u201cOnce participants are back from the trips, they\u2019re more willing to pick up the phone and talk with each other\u2026.These trips build the deeper relationships necessary to drive change.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note\n\nRelated reading:\n\nDavid Barash, \u201cProject ECHO: Force Multiplier For Community Health Centers,\u201d GrantWatch section, Health Affairs Blog, July 20, 2015.\n\nJoan Randell, \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s Approach To Medicaid ACOs Is An Experiment Worth Watching,\u201d Health Affairs Blog, August 25, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/01/21/using-travel-as-a-teaching-tool-and-a-lever-for-change/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog_Randell.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Using Travel As A Teaching Tool, And A Lever For Change"}, "description": "Using Travel As A Teaching Tool, And A Lever For Change | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Jan NicholsonJanuary 21, 2016Foundations seeking to drive systems change in health care have a powerful method they can use to educate health system leaders.\nIntroducing key decision makers to new models of care deliveryHigh-level health care decision makers who have the authority to implement broad systems change are busy people.\nBy building a collaborative spirit in a new context, learning trips can break down those barriers and help us approach these challenges together.\nYet, we all face the same challenges when trying to improve the health care system.\nThe Nicholson Foundation has found that sponsoring out-of-state, or even out-of-country, learning trips is an especially effective way to spread knowledge and inspire new ways of thinking."}
