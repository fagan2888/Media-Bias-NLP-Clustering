On May 4, 2011, the House passed HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, on a 251-175 vote with Republicans voting 235-0 for the bill and Democrats voting 175-16 against it.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice will hold a hearing on H.R. 7, the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d this week.\n\nCongressman Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is the lead sponsor of the bill, informed the House that a study by the Guttmacher Institute, the pro-abortion former research apparatus of Planned Parenthood, released a study noting that one-quarter of women who otherwise would have had abortions chose to give birth when taxpayer dollars were not available to pay for abortions of their children.\n\nThe Family Research Council is a strong supporter of the bill and FRC president Tony Perkins applauded Smith\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cChris Smith\u2019s leadership in the cause of life has been historic. Most Americans, regardless of their view on abortion, oppose government funding for abortion. The \u2018No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u2019 will make sure that the Hyde Amendment applies across the government, including fixing the abortion funding provisions in Obamacare. H.R. 7 will restore government neutrality on abortion,\u201d he told LifeNews.\n\n\u201cAbortion causes enduring pain to millions of American women, and the revelation that so many of them are so young is tragic. Bringing help and healing to America\u2019s young women and their families has to be coupled with public policies that will curtail this victimization,\u201d Perkins noted.\n\nSmith spoke on the House floor during debate over the last version of the bill about what he said was growing public opinion against abortion. He also praised women who regret having terminated their pregnancies and speak out against abortions.\n\n\u201cFor decades, a patchwork of short-term policies have prevented abortion funding in many programs authorized by Congress, but it is time for a single, government-wide permanent protection against taxpayer funding for elective abortion,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAbortion is lethal violence against children and exploitation of women. This legislation would establish a comprehensive policy prohibiting public funding for elective abortion in all federal programs.\u201d\n\nA majority of Americans object to the use of taxpayer money for funding abortion, according to numerous polls \u2014 including a survey CNN conducted in early April showing Americans oppose public funding of abortion by a margin of 61% to 35%.\n\nThe bill will also mitigate concerns about abortion funding in the various loopholes in the Obamacare national health care bill that various pro-life organizations warned about during debate on the law. The legislation did not contain language banning funding of abortions in its provisions and the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act would fix that problem.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee sent a letter to House members urging support for the legislation that explains how the bill will help:\n\n\u201cRegrettably, however, the 111th Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). During consideration of that legislation, language was proposed (the Stupak-Pitts Amendment) to apply the principles of the Hyde Amendment to the multitude of programs created by the bill, and the House initially approved that language \u2013 but no such provision was part of the enacted law, due to opposition from President Obama and the Senate majority. Consequently, the enacted PPACA contains multiple provisions authorizing funding of abortion and funding of health plans that cover abortion.\u201d\n\nThe National Right to Life letter also commented on another lesser-known provision of the tax-funded abortion ban \u2014 it\u2019s language to protect health care professionals who don\u2019t want to be involved in abortions.\n\n\u201cThe bill would codify the principles of the Hyde-Weldon Amendment, which has been appended to the original Hyde Amendment on every Health and Human Services appropriations bill since 2004. This provision would solidify important protections for health care providers who do not wish to participate in providing abortions \u2013 which is especially important in light of the Obama Administration\u2019s February 23, 2011 action rescinding the conscience protection regulation issued by the Bush Administration.\u201d\n\nAlso, before the vote in 2011, the White House said President Barack Obama would add to his lengthy pro-abortion record by vetoing the legislation. Obama would veto HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, with the White House saying the president opposes the bill because it would supposedly make it tougher for women to obtain abortion coverage from private insurance companies thereby expanding the current Hyde Amendment, which only limits tax-funded abortions under Medicaid, beyond its current reach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Committee Passes Bill to Completely Ban Taxpayer Funding of Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee today approved legislation that will put in place a complete ban on taxpayer funding of abortions that ensures abortions are not d", "title": "House Committee Passes Bill to Completely Ban Taxpayer Funding of Abortions", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/01/15/house-committee-passes-bill-to-completely-ban-taxpayer-funding-of-abortions/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/taxpayerfunding2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "house,bill,ban,taxpayer,funding,abortion,abortions", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffe7\"", "article_summary": "The \u2018No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u2019 will make sure that the Hyde Amendment applies across the government, including fixing the abortion funding provisions in Obamacare.\nThe legislation did not contain language banning funding of abortions in its provisions and the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act would fix that problem.\n7, the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d this week.\nThe House Judiciary Committee today approved legislation that will put in place a complete ban on taxpayer funding of abortions that ensures abortions are not directly funded in any federal governmental program or department.\n\u201cFor decades, a patchwork of short-term policies have prevented abortion funding in many programs authorized by Congress, but it is time for a single, government-wide permanent protection against taxpayer funding for elective abortion,\u201d Smith said."}
