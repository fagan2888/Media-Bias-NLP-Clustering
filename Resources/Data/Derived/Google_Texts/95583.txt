And slightly more than 40 percent of workers at large firms that give them the option are choosing the high-deductible option over a traditional health plan, according to the report issued Tuesday by Benefitfocus, a provider of benefits-management software.

Benefitfocus also found that younger workers were much more apt to choose the high-deductible option when given the choice. These plans tend to have lower monthly premium payments for their enrollees than traditional health plans.

But they also require enrollees to pay more in out-of-pocket charges when they obtain health services than what they are required to pay under traditional plans. The minimum deductible for a high-deductible plan is $1,300 for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for family coverage.



Benefitfocus' report was based on an analysis of actual 2015 enrollment data from about 500 employers with more than 1,000 workers apiece. In all, the report reflects enrollment choices of more than 700,000 workers.

High-deductible plans have become increasingly common in recent years as companies and insurers look for ways to control health spending. The plans are seen as encouraging more careful shopping for and consumption of health services, such as by opting for a generic drug as opposed to a brand-name prescription.
