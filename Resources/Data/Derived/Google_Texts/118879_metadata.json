Sweet 16!\" in the closing seconds.\n\nAngel Rodriguez led Miami with 28 points and five assists. Sheldon McClellan added 18 points.\n\nThere is some symmetry in the victory for Miami coach Jim Larranaga, who led George Mason to the Final Four a decade ago when he was the Patriots coach. He had to go through Wichita State in the Sweet 16 in Washington, D.C., to do it.\n\nIn just a few dizzying minutes, Wichita State has made it a ballgame.\n\nAfter trailing by as many 21 in the first half and 13 at halftime, Wichita State has fought back and trimmed Miami's lead to 48-45 with 7:43 to play in the game.\n\nThe Shockers came out of the half with a lot of pep and briefly took a 43-42 lead on a 3-pointer by Ron Baker at the 10:24 mark.\n\nWichita State has found its touch after shooting just 24 percent in the first half, The Shockers are 9 for 16 so far in the second.\n\nMiami had nine turnovers in the opening 20 minutes, but has already committed six in this half.\n\nMiami came out fast, then weathered a late surge by Wichita State to take a 32-19 lead into the half in the second round of South Region matchup.\n\nThe third-seeded Hurricanes led 27-6 early after connecting on 8 of its first 9 field goal attempts, before an 11-0 run by the No. 11 seed Shockers made things a little more interesting.\n\nThe Hurricanes got their footing and the momentum back, though, thanks to 16 first-half points for point guard Angel Rodriguez. He has been unflappable throughout and has connected on all seven of his field goal attempts.\n\nThe Shockers were a blur offensively in their first-round win over Arizona, but aside from their one spurt haven't been able to match Miami's quickness at the guard spot.\n\nWichita State had 10 turnovers and is shooting a paltry 24 percent (7 for 29).\n\nCoach Gregg Marshall is known for his halftime speeches. He will need a good one to help get his team back into the game.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes have almost completely silenced the electricity that the Wichita State brought to the Dunkin Donuts' Center this week.\n\nThe third-seeded Hurricanes lead the 11th seed Shockers 27-6 with 8:26 to go in the first half of their South Region second round matchup.\n\nMiami is shooting a blustery 80 percent from the field (12 of 15) and are much quicker to the attack so far against a Wichita State team that won a First Four game against Vanderbilt before upsetting sixth seed Arizona 65-55. The Shockers are just 1 for 14 from the field with nine turnovers.\n\nMiami was a slight underdog against the Shockers entering Saturday's matchup for a berth in the Sweet 16.\n\nMiami was a slight underdog against Wichita State entering the matchup for a berth in the Sweet 16.\n\nIn a game featuring two stellar backcourts, Miami's Angel Rodriguez has the edge.
