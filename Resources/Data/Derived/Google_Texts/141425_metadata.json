Year-over-year, wages are up about 2.2 percent. That's not great -- although, thanks to very low oil prices and low inflation, it's not terrible either. But it's worth asking why wage growth since 2010 hasn't been as robust as growth in previous recoveries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's economy is chugging along.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-03-05 10:10:42 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "America's economy is chugging along.", "title": "4 Things You Need To Know About The Latest Jobs Report", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jobs-report-february-2016_us_56d9830ce4b0ffe6f8e8f349", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56d99bbe1e0000c60070f472.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's economy is chugging along.", "creator": "@shaneferro", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56d99bbe1e0000c60070f472.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "4 Things You Need To Know About The Latest Jobs Report", "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-04 10:10:42 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56d9830ce4b0ffe6f8e8f349", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "economics, jobs,job growth,wage growth,wages", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "economics, jobs,job growth,wage growth,wages", "published_time": "2016-03-04 10:10:42 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-03-04 13:17:43 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/shane.ferro"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "The monthly jobs report came out on Friday, and things are pretty good overall.\nYear-over-year, wages are up about 2.2 percent.\nHere are four things we know about the economy from the details in this report:1) Wages aren't growing much, and it's hard to say why.\nBut it's worth asking why wage growth since 2010 hasn't been as robust as growth in previous recoveries.\nThat's not great -- although, thanks to very low oil prices and low inflation, it's not terrible either."}
