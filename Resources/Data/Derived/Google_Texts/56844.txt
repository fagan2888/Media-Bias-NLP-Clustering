RINO: Republican In Name Only.

With Republican intra-party bickering reaching inane levels and the cuckservative slur gaining popularity as the insult du jour, I guess being tarred as a RINO isn’t the worst thing that could happen to an incumbent House Republican — unless of course your Tea Party challenger cuts an ad declaring she’s “hunting RINOs” before she takes aim and fires off a shotgun.

Mother Jones’ Tim Murphy first uncovered this gem of a campaign ad by North Carolina conservative activist, Kay Daly, that aired in the Raleigh market during last week’s GOP debate.

The 30-second jampacked ad is a doozy, complete with gratuitous swipes at feminists, same-sex couples, and undocumented immigrants but it’s target is embattled North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers.

Elected to Congress during the 2010 Tea Party wave, Ellmers has been dogged by conservative furor since leading a group of mostly Republican women in blocking a 20-week abortion ban earlier this year. She also irked conservatives with her refusal to support a bill undoing President Obama’s executive actions on immigration.

Ellmers has faced tough primaries in the past, most recently in 2014, before going on to beat her conservative challenger and defeat “American Idol” winner Clay Aiken in the general election — but this time her challenger is swinging for the fences.
