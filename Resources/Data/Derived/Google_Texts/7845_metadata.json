The cuts to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will \u201cbegin to be fully realized in the next year,\u201d according to the subcommittee.\n\n\u201cThere was a promise made to seniors as well. The promise was that we\u2019re going to use your Medicare dollars as a piggy bank to fund the Affordable Care Act, and in doing that we\u2019ll improve Medicare and allow seniors to keep their doctors if they liked. So, do you have an opinion as to whether or not this is another broken promise?\u201d subcommittee vice chairman Rep. Michael Burgess said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThose most hurt by the cuts are low-income seniors in rural areas without other options for supplemental Medicare coverage. Additional scheduled cuts in the future will broaden the damage to Medicare Advantage,\u201d said American Action Forum president Doug Holtz-Eakin.\n\nTwenty-eight percent of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in 2013.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Seniors will feel the pain in 2014, according to a U.S. House subcommittee", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare \"raided\" $300 billion for Medicare Advantage and seniors will begin feeling the cuts next year, according to an analysis Tuesday by the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee.
