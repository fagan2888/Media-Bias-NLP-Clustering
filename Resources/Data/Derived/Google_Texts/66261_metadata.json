It has a lot of appeal, I think \u2026 certainly to the president and to other people in the administration.\u201d\n\nObama is proposing legislation that would spend $478 billion to boost the nation's infrastructure. The plan calls for spending $317 billion on U.S. roads and bridges over the next six years, including $94.7 billion during the 2016 fiscal year. The plan also includes $143 billion for federal transit projects and $18 billion on freight improvements.\n\nThe proposal would be paid for with the estimated $238 billion in revenue that would come from requiring companies to bring back earnings to the United States at a 14 percent tax rate.\n\nTransportation advocates have argued that raising the gas tax, which has not been increased since 1993, would be an easier way to pay for infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe gas tax, which predates the highway system by about 20 years, has struggled to keep pace with infrastructure expenses in recent years as cars have become more fuel efficient.\n\nThe tax at the pump brings in about $34 billion per year. The federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on road and transit projects, and transportation advocates have maintained that the larger figure is only enough to maintain the current state of U.S. infrastructure.\n\nEarnest noted Tuesday that Obama administration has put in place fuel efficiency requirements for U.S. automakers that will eventually result in cars that are sold domestically achieving 54.5 miles-per-gallon, which will further exacerbate problems with the gas tax in the future.\n\n\u201cI think the second thing is we also just need to be aware of the challenges associated with trying to fund infrastructure through the gas tax as, thanks in no small part to some of the initiatives that the president's put forward, we're finding that the fleet that's on the road right now is more fuel-efficient, which means that they're using less gas, which means that the gas tax is a less reliable source of that kind of funding,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nObama's infrastructure plan is included in Obama's $4 trillion 2016 budget, which was released on Monday.\n\nCritics have said the repatriation plan would cost the federal government more in the long run than it brings in for transportation projects.\n\n\u201cTax holiday proposals designed to pay for the transportation bill sound great until you look at the details,\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin HatchHatch reacts to Garland meeting before it happens Senate amendments could sink email privacy compromise Overnight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo MORE (R-Utah) said last week after Sen. Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Paul ties release of 9/11 docs to defense bill Will Ted Cruz let it go? MORE (R-Ky.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) released a plan that was similar to Obama's.\n\n\"After all, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has clearly detailed how a stand-alone temporary tax holiday would end up costing the government in the end,\" Hatch continued. \"Saying you're going to use something that loses money to pay for anything is just wrong.\"\n\nThe nonpartisan JCT has said that a tax holiday would generate about $20 billion in revenue initially. The analysis said the plan would ultimately cost the federal government about $96 billion, as companies would have more incentive to keep their profits abroad and wait for another tax holiday.\n\nSupporters of the repatriation-for-roads plan see it as more politically viable than increasing the gas tax.\n\n\"The interstate highway system is of vital importance to our economy,\" Paul, a likely 2016 GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement last week about his transportation plan. The repatriation in his plan would be optional, unlike Obama's.\n\n\"All across the country, bridges and roads are deficient and in need of replacement,\" Paul continued. \"We can help fund new construction and repair by lowering the repatriation rate and bringing money held by U.S. companies back home. This would mean no new taxes, but more revenue, and it is a solution that should win support from both political parties.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Advocates are pushing for a gas tax increase to pay for new infrastructure.", "description": "Advocates are pushing for a gas tax increase to pay for new infrastructure.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Advocates are pushing for a gas tax increase to pay for new infrastructure.", "title": "WH: Offshore taxes a 'better strategy' for funding roads", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/231632-wh-repatriation-more-reliable-than-gas-tax-for-road-funding", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/gasprices_0108getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-03T17:04:52-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-03T17:04-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/231632-wh-repatriation-more-reliable-than-gas-tax-for-road-funding", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-03T16:17-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Gas Tax, Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, Repatriation, MAP-21 Reauthorization,Josh Earnest, Barack Obama, Rand Paul, Orrin Hatch,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-03T16:17:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-03T17:04:52-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/231632-wh-repatriation-more-reliable-than-gas-tax-for-road-funding", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Advocates are pushing for a gas tax increase to pay for new infrastructure.", "card": "summary", "title": "WH: Offshore taxes a 'better strategy' for funding roads"}, "dcterms.title": "WH: Offshore taxes a 'better strategy' for funding roads"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22f0\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe believe that we just have a better strategy,\u201d Earnest said of Obama\u2019s repatriation plan.\nObama's infrastructure plan is included in Obama's $4 trillion 2016 budget, which was released on Monday.\nBut Earnest said President Obama\u2019s proposal to rely on \u201crepatriated\u201d corporate tax revenue would be a more predictable way to pay for infrastructure.\n\"The interstate highway system is of vital importance to our economy,\" Paul, a likely 2016 GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement last week about his transportation plan.\nSupporters of the repatriation-for-roads plan see it as more politically viable than increasing the gas tax."}
