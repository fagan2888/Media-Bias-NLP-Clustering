Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). His hiring is the latest in a flurry of recent moves to focus on communications.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week, the Clinton team hired Jesse Ferguson, the former communications director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for a top role in the future campaign's press shop. White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri will join the Clinton team in the same role beginning next week, the Post reports.\n\nThe Clinton team is also believed to be recruiting Josh Schwerin, a former DCCC national press secretary; Tyrone Gale, a former DCCC regional press secretary; Jesse Lehrich from the Democratic super-PAC American Bridge; and Ian Sams and Rebecca Chalif, who both work at the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe focus on communications hires come after a rough few weeks for Clinton, who has faced questions over her use of a private email server while at State. Republicans are seeking answers over Clinton\u2019s admission that she deleted thousands of personal emails, and are pressuring her to turn over her computer server to an independent investigator for review.\n\nClinton is also staffing up in early-voting South Carolina. Clay Middleton, a longtime adviser to Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), will run the campaign's day-to-day operations, while former Secretary of Education Richard Riley has been advising her nascent campaign and will likely serve as state chairman, according to the Post.\n\nCameron Joseph contributed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Brian Fallon will serve as lead press secretary for the Democrat's expected White House run.", "description": "Brian Fallon will serve as lead press secretary for the Democrat's expected White House run.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Brian Fallon will serve as lead press secretary for the Democrat's expected White House run.", "title": "Clinton adds DOJ spokesman to team", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/236012-clinton-adds-doj-spokesman-to-team", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-17T17:45:10-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-17T17:45-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/236012-clinton-adds-doj-spokesman-to-team", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-17T17:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Jessica Taylor", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-17T17:30:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T17:45:10-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/236012-clinton-adds-doj-spokesman-to-team", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Brian Fallon will serve as lead press secretary for the Democrat's expected White House run.", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinton adds DOJ spokesman to team"}, "dcterms.title": "Clinton adds DOJ spokesman to team"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0acb\"", "article_summary": "White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri will join the Clinton team in the same role beginning next week, the Post reports.\nADVERTISEMENTLast week, the Clinton team hired Jesse Ferguson, the former communications director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for a top role in the future campaign's press shop.\nThe Clinton team is also believed to be recruiting Josh Schwerin, a former DCCC national press secretary; Tyrone Gale, a former DCCC regional press secretary; Jesse Lehrich from the Democratic super-PAC American Bridge; and Ian Sams and Rebecca Chalif, who both work at the Democratic National Committee.\nThe focus on communications hires come after a rough few weeks for Clinton, who has faced questions over her use of a private email server while at State.\nFallon formerly served as a spokesman for Sen.
