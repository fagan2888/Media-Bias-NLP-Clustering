Local woman finds love with Trump\u2019s son.\n\nA member of the Trump empire calls Wilmington home. Local native Lara Yunaska Trump is married to Trump\u2019s son, Eric. The couple, who dated for six years, tied the knot last November in Palm Beach at the Mar-a-Lago club owned by Trump.\n\nIn true elegant high-fashion, the bride wore Vera Wang on her big day. The ring bearer for the occasion was the couple\u2019s miniature Beagle, Charlie. Yunaska is an associate producer with the CBS program \u201cInside Edition\u201d and sits on the Board of Trustees for her husband\u2019s foundation, The Eric Trump Foundation. Today, the couple lives in New York City, but her folks remain attached to the Carolina coast.\n\n2. Trump\u2019s ownership of the Miss USA pageant since 1996 has brought him in contact with several of the competition\u2019s local contestants.\n\nIn the last six years, four Wilmington women have held the title of Miss NC USA \u2014 including Kristen Dalton (2009), Brittany York (2011) and Sydney Perry (2012).\n\nMost recently, Julia Dalton, the reigning Miss North Carolina USA 2015, was part of the pageant \u2014 although Trump was absent from the competition after comments about the Hispanic community left him in hot water. Kristen went on to win the Miss USA title in 2009.\n\n3. Stephanie Castagnier Dunn, a lender with Live Oak Bank in Wilmington, appeared as a contestant on the 10th season of Trump\u2019s NBC reality competition series \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2010.\n\nDunn, who has lived in Wilmington for nearly two years, was one of 12 contestants chosen from a pool of 25,000 to compete for a position within one of Trump\u2019s organizations.\n\nThen living in Chicago, Dunn said it was the search for change and big opportunity that drew her to the watercooler show.\n\n\u201cI was ready for something new and different,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time, it was the hot thing on TV, so I applied. I never in a million years thought I would make it on.\u201d\n\nIn her time on the show, Dunn produced a Broadway show and a fashion show. She stuck it out until week ten, when she was \u201cfired\u201d for not creating an AT&T commercial that Trump\u2019s felt was suitable to air.\n\n\u201cI still disagree with his decision,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nBut hearing those dreaded words, \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d wasn\u2019t the end of her time in the Trump inner circle. For nearly a year after the show, she said she worked with the Trump organization.\n\nUltimately, Dunn said her reality TV stint was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cI wanted to spend time with Trump and see who he did business with,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was great to expand my Rolodex. A lot of the people I do business with today have connections to the people I met on the show.\u201d\n\nContact Hunter Ingram at 910-343-2327 or Hunter.Ingram@StarnewsOnline.com.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 124987614282599}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaedd\"", "article_summary": "WILMINGTON \u2014 More than a year remains before a single vote is cast in the 2016 presidential election, but GOP hopeful Donald Trump is already looming large over the campaign.\nLocal native Lara Yunaska Trump is married to Trump\u2019s son, Eric.\nA member of the Trump empire calls Wilmington home.\nKristen went on to win the Miss USA title in 2009.\nTrump\u2019s ownership of the Miss USA pageant since 1996 has brought him in contact with several of the competition\u2019s local contestants."}
