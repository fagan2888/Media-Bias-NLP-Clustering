Larry Hogan on Tuesday wrote that Senate Bill 416 and House Bill 838 may violate the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits health insurance plans covered within it from discriminating based on sexual orientation.\n\nFrosh noted to Hogan the measure altered the \u201crequirement that a spouse\u2019s sperm be used for the in vitro fertilization in situations involving women in same-sex couples.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this change was necessary to alleviate the discrimination against women in same-sex couples, it created an inequality between these same-sex couples, who can now qualify for the benefit if they meet the other requirements, and opposite sex couples in which the husband is unable to produce sperm, who cannot quality for the benefit,\u201d wrote Frosh. \u201cIn short, in fixing one source of differential treatment on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill inadvertently created another.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now the law in Maryland is being challenged because it is not available to same-sex couples with women because you have to use the husband\u2019s sperm,\u201d Frosh told the Washington Blade on Thursday during a telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make it available to women partners, but you\u2019ve created another issue with respect to heterosexual couples where the woman may need in vitro fertilization, but the husband\u2019s sperm is not mobile.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe highlighted it and said it should be addressed in future legislation,\u201d added Frosh, who stressed his letter does not say the bill is unconstitutional. \u201cIt\u2019s a legal issue.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers last month approved the bill that state Del. Terri Hill (D-Baltimore and Howard Counties) and state Sen. Cheryl Kagan (D-Montgomery County) introduced in their respective legislative chambers.\n\nFrosh told the Blade that Hogan has yet to respond to his letter.\n\nShareese DeLeaver-Churchill, a spokesperson for the governor, acknowledged to the Blade on Thursday that his office has received Frosh\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cThe governor is reviewing the legislation and will make a decision on it in the near future,\u201d said DeLeaver-Churchill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Maryland bill that seeks to ensure lesbian couples have equal access to fertility treatments could prove discriminatory to heterosexual couples.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "A Maryland bill that seeks to ensure lesbian couples have equal access to fertility treatments could prove discriminatory to heterosexual couples.", "title": "Straight couples face discrimination under Maryland bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/04/Brian_Frosh_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2015-04-17T08:13:49-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/04/17/maryland-fertility-bill-inadvertently-discriminates-against-straight-couples/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Maryland bill that seeks to ensure lesbian couples have equal access to fertility treatments could prove discriminatory to heterosexual couples.", "creator": "@mklavers81", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/04/Brian_Frosh_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "Straight couples face discrimination under Maryland bill", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Maryland", "published_time": "2015-04-17T08:00:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T08:13:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Brian Frosh, gay, heterosexual, Larry Hogan, lesbian, Maryland"}, "article_summary": "Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh this week said a bill that would ensure lesbian couples have equal access to fertility treatments may subject heterosexual couples to discrimination.\nShareese DeLeaver-Churchill, a spokesperson for the governor, acknowledged to the Blade on Thursday that his office has received Frosh\u2019s letter.\nLarry Hogan on Tuesday wrote that Senate Bill 416 and House Bill 838 may violate the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits health insurance plans covered within it from discriminating based on sexual orientation.\nFrosh told the Blade that Hogan has yet to respond to his letter.\n\u201cThe governor is reviewing the legislation and will make a decision on it in the near future,\u201d said DeLeaver-Churchill."}
