It\u2019s a pure fabrication of Democrats and their liberal media machine, goes the conservative line. In fact, conservatives constructed a defense against charges of racism modeled on the \u201che who smelt it, dealt it\u201d logic of third grade: To name racism is to\n\nDonald Trump finally came under some real fire at both Wednesday debates, with Gov. Bobby Jindal throwing hard, if distant, punches Trump\u2019s way in the minor league debate earlier in the evening and several candidates pouncing on the leader in the prime-time event. But Trump\u2019s bad week started with a potentially much more damaging attack from Glenn Beck, who went third-rail on Monday to accuse many of Trump\u2019s supporters of being racist. (This accusation would actually be corroborated later in the week.) The shots from fellow candidates on the debate stage still stayed within the parameters of primary propriety, sharp at times but ultimately safe, in accord with the rules of engagement. Only electoral flesh wounds were delivered. Glenn Beck\u2019s attack went to the heart of the Trump phenomenon, with the conservative talker naming the elephant in the room: Trump\u2019s Tea Party supporters are racist.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear: You\u2019re a racist liar if you consider yourself a Tea Partyer and you support Trump, says Beck. That should go ever well.\n\nBeck was speaking about the collective casualness with which Trump supporters blithely overlook vast swaths of Trump\u2019s ideological history after obsessing over every detail of candidate Obama\u2019s past. Every meeting, association and handshake of Obama\u2019s was probed to find the \u201creal Obama.\u201d Everything that Obama had ever written was gone through with a fine-tooth comb to find secret allegiances. Plumbing Obama\u2019s past not only included his adult and political life but considered his college years, his childhood in Indonesia, all the way back to his birth, which Donald Trump famously doubted to have occurred in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, anything Trump said before June of this year is considered irrelevant. His support for a range of liberal positions don\u2019t matter anymore. His years as a Democratic voter, his donations to Democratic candidates, his friendship with Hillary Clinton: all forgiven. Jeb Bush released a campaign video composed of Trump\u2019s most New-York-liberal moments a few weeks ago. Hitherto it would have been enough to sink virtually any candidate in the GOP primary contest, but Trump is, as Beck notes, seemingly impervious to such attacks. Since the video\u2019s release, Trump\u2019s poll numbers have continued to climb while Bush\u2019s follow their downward trajectory.\n\n\u201cI cannot understand the Trump thing, and it scares the hell out of me,\u201d admitted Beck. The Trump phenomenon has confounded pundits, commentators and liberals, but we\u2019re beginning to see how the candidate\u2019s seemingly bulletproof campaign is concerning those politically closest to Trump\u2019s supporters. Beck\u2019s fear and frustration even led him to enter into verboten territory and effectively confirm the racial basis of anti-Obama sentiment of the last eight years. The charge quickly spread on conservative media, and Beck was under fire within hours.\n\nBeck wasn\u2019t content with calling a great many of Trump\u2019s supporters racists, though. Beck reached into his quiver to pull out an old favorite, comparing the real-estate-mogul-cum- demagogue to Stalin and Lenin. The conversation turned to Trump\u2019s megalomania and his desire to have his proposed border wall emblazoned with his name after his death. \u201cThat\u2019s scary. That\u2019s what a dictator says,\u201d Beck charged. \u201cI mean, remember, it was Leningrad, and then it was Stalingrad. That\u2019s what dictators do. That\u2019s what dictators do.\u201d\n\nAgain, so we\u2019re clear. Beck is saying in no uncertain terms, \u201cHey, Tea Party supporters of Trump, you\u2019re racists following a proto-dictator.\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom still has Trump (somehow) falling away to allow for a proper candidate to rise to the nomination. But even in that eventuality, how does the Republican ship weather the storm? What was a simmering crisis for the GOP with the emergence of the Tea Party rebellion is now a circular firing squad. The rifts caused by Trump\u2019s venomous insurgency have dramatically widened the preexisting fault lines between the party establishment and a bulk of the conservative base, but new battle lines reveal themselves among the base itself. Where you expect alliances to develop, like between Beck and Trump, we find revelations of even more latent fissures in the Republican coalition. The divisions might be mended in a less combative environment, but Trump has also infected the infighting with rhetoric not easily forgotten or forgiven. It\u2019s a sort of rhetorical arms race, and the only way to fight trump is to ratchet up your attacks to his caliber. This is turning into a melee. The party is falling apart. The center cannot hold.
