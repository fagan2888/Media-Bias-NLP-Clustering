The timing of the buyout may not have been dictated solely by expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon start pulling back its support for the bond market, but the impending policy change clearly meant the companies had a limited window to get the deal done.\n\nIf interest rates were to climb higher in response to the Fed\u2019s policy change, Verizon\u2019s required financing could become expensive enough to scuttle the deal. Back in the spring, when interest rates were languishing near their lowest levels in decades, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) issued what was then a record $17 billion in bonds. Since then, bond markets have soured and interest rates have surged. It\u2019s not that debt financing has become pricey, merely that it is no longer nearly as cheap as it was only a few months ago.\n\nMeanwhile, pundits have cautioned investors that further upticks in rates could leave them with losses. (Bond yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.) And the uncertainty that goes along with the looming Fed policy change could make fixed-income investors skittish about snapping up new issues, much less the kind of massive bond sale that Verizon needed.\n\nRELATED: How Ben Bernanke Is Driving a Huge Corporate Deal\n\nVerizon and its underwriters \u2013 a consortium led by JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays \u2013 certainly felt a sense of urgency. They had planned to issue the bonds in a series of tranches over time, to minimize the impact on the market and ensure the deal could be completed as price-efficiently as possible. But underwriters are said to have received demand for as much as $100 billion in debt for what was expected to be a $49 billion issue, and that interest in the $14 billion of banks loans also was robust.\n\nClearly, Verizon has done the bond market and investment bankers a big service by timing its need for financing to coincide with this period of market uncertainty. That\u2019s not just because the banks underwriting this massive debt issue will collect enough in fees -- $500 million or more, according to reports \u2013 to ensure this is a blockbuster year for fixed income bonuses, but because the transaction already is delivering a clear message about supply and demand trends in the bond market.\n\nBond investors have been yield-hungry and yield-starved for years. And while spreads have remained narrow (yields on investment grade debt had been trading at about 120 basis points, or 1.2 percentage points, above those on comparable Treasury securities), Verizon and its underwriters paid anywhere from 165 basis points (on the three-year fixed rate notes) to 265 basis points (on the 30-year bonds). That premium, while not making the deal prohibitively expensive for Verizon, clearly was enough to whip investors into a frenzy of excitement.\n\nNow investors will be watching the bond market for any signs of buyers\u2019 remorse, or weakening as the issue trades in the secondary market. Any indication that investors regret being caught up in a feeding frenzy, or were simply looking to \u201cflip\u201d the bonds to those who didn\u2019t get the allocation they sought when the deal was distributed, might be seen as a sign of trouble in such a fragile and uncertain market environment.\n\nViewed in isolation, the Verizon debt issue looks like a win-win: The company gets the financing it needs on an affordable basis, while investors can finally lay hands on some investment-grade securities priced at more attractive levels than they have seen in years. It also may be viewed as a sign that the bond market, at this moment in time, is in Goldilocks territory: not too hot, not too cold, but just right. In other words, the backup in yields, however painful it has been for bond investors, has brought them to a point where new deals are seen as attractive and companies can still find it affordable.\n\nOf course, no transaction takes place in isolation, and the market isn\u2019t static. Is the Verizon deal the last big hurrah of an era of cheap debt \u2013 the end of the credit boom, as Forbes has opined? It certainly will reassure Fed policymakers that higher \u2013 or at least, slightly higher \u2013 interest rates won\u2019t cut off corporate access to capital markets. If investors were truly, deeply anxious about the economic outlook, or expecting that interest rates would be significantly higher in six months\u2019 time, they might well have been less eager than they were to try and snag as much of such a large transaction, even at a premium to current yields. They would have been more cautious, demanding higher yields or smaller issues, to gauge how well the market was digesting each transaction.\n\nThe window for such gargantuan transactions may well close in the coming days and weeks, as uncertainty increases. But then, the vast majority of bond market issues are much smaller. And unless the uncertainty causes a big spike in interest rates, rather than the kind of gradual upward drift that most economists currently expect, the success of the Verizon debt sale suggests that the hunger for higher yields and the ability of cash-rich corporations to offer small premiums may well offset the angst.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The massive $49 billion bond offering by Verizon Communications this week \u2013 far and away the largest of its kind ever seen \u2013 is serving as a great test of investor sentiment at a key turning point for monetary policy.", "title": "What Verizon\u2019s Huge Debt Deal Says About the Bond Market", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/09/13/What-Verizon%E2%80%99s-Huge-Debt-Deal-Says-About-Bond-Market", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01052012_Verizon_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/09/13/What-Verizon%E2%80%99s-Huge-Debt-Deal-Says-About-Bond-Market", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01052012_Verizon_article.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The massive $49 billion bond offering by Verizon Communications this week \u2013 far and away the largest of its kind ever seen \u2013 is serving as a great test of investor sentiment at a key turning point for monetary policy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd114\"", "article_summary": "(Bond yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.)\nNow investors will be watching the bond market for any signs of buyers\u2019 remorse, or weakening as the issue trades in the secondary market.\nBut then, the vast majority of bond market issues are much smaller.\nClearly, Verizon has done the bond market and investment bankers a big service by timing its need for financing to coincide with this period of market uncertainty.\nIt certainly will reassure Fed policymakers that higher \u2013 or at least, slightly higher \u2013 interest rates won\u2019t cut off corporate access to capital markets."}
