A plane that was 20 hours overdue at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh was found crashed in a grassy field in Kenosha County early Sunday afternoon.

Two men were found dead in the aircraft, according to a news release from the Kenosha County Sheriff's Department.

The Winnebago County sheriff's office contacted the Kenosha County department Sunday morning about a Zenith CH601, a kit plane, that had not made its scheduled Saturday landing in Oshkosh.

Kenosha County deputies and the Wisconsin Civil Air Patrol found the plane around midday Sunday, according to a release.

There were no injuries to anyone on the ground or damage to any building near the field, which was several hundred yards from a home in the 16800 block of 60th St.

The time and cause of the crash had not been determined.

The crash was at least the second related to the EAA AirVenture this year. A crash at the show on Wednesday injured five people.
