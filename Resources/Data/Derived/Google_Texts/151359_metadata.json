And I like Christmas trees and the happy spirit that usually pervades this season.\n\nBut the Mayor proposed, and most of Council voted, to change a key word in the name of the Borough\u2019s annual tree-lighting event from a neutral, inclusive term back to a religious one.\n\nThe name of the event was previously changed from \"Christmas\" to \"Annual\" in the mid-1990's following a court case surrounding a Jersey City holiday display that contained multiple religious symbols on municipal grounds.\n\nOn Thursday night, Roselle Park Mayor Carl Hokanson held a vote on flipping the event back to Christmas. Storey, who said she was unaware the vote had been on the agenda, decided to take a stand after her fellow legislators voted 4-2 in favor of the change.\n\nDespite criticism that she's taken her liberalism and political correctness too far, Storey maintains that neutral terminology is standard among municipalities in the area. Quoting U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Storey argues that the switch \u201csends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a minor matter of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d It is a fundamental issue of freedom of religion \u2013 one of the basic freedoms that tens of thousands of Americans, including my uncle, died to defend over the years.\n\nAccording to N.J.com, Mayor Hokanson, whom Storey praised as a promising leader for Roselle Park, remarked only that, \"Everybody's entitled to his beliefs.\"\n\nAsked about future plans, Storey told the Roselle Park News she hopes to find new wasy to serve the community.\n\n\u201cYou can represent people in different ways and, in some ways, you are free to speak more openly as a resident than you are as an elected official.\u201d\n\nStorey joined the six-member council in January 2013 and her term was scheduled to run until December 2017. Her resignation takes effect January 7.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/static/global/config/browserconfig.xml", "description": "As the holiday season gets into full swing, one New Jersey councilwoman has decided an \"exclusionary\" name change to an annual tree lighting ceremony is too much a matter of conscience for her to remain with the city council.", "p": {"domain_verify": "eecb67825f8dac79c48fd3fd2c5a2a10"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "Charlene Storey defends decision against those who say it's political correctness run amok", "title": "N.J. councilwoman resigns over 'exclusionary' Christmas tree lighting", "url": "http://www.phillyvoice.com/nj-councilwoman-resigns-over-exclusionary-christmas-tree-lighting/", "image": {"src": "http://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/Charlene_Storey.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.png"}, "site": "@thephillyvoice", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#603cba", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://www.phillyvoice.com/nj-councilwoman-resigns-over-exclusionary-christmas-tree-lighting/", "image": "http://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/Charlene_Storey.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.png", "site_name": "PhillyVoice", "description": "Charlene Storey defends decision against those who say it's political correctness run amok", "title": "N.J. councilwoman resigns over 'exclusionary' Christmas tree lighting"}, "msvalidate.01": "4D5580B7E87BE36A95828119B7AB1BE3", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/global/images/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "philadelphia, news, politics, religion, new jersey, christmas, holidays", "google-site-verification": "eWg_5HU7qyxLIjJ6ohS8pXIxrquJK4ZaWrLrk50o0Ss", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In Union County, Roselle Park Councilwoman-At-Large Charlene Storey officially submitted her resignation Saturday after her fellow council members held a vote to change the name of the event from \"Annual Holiday Tree Lighting\" to \"Annual Christmas Tree Lighting,\" according to the Roselle Park News.\nAsked about future plans, Storey told the Roselle Park News she hopes to find new wasy to serve the community.\nOn Thursday night, Roselle Park Mayor Carl Hokanson held a vote on flipping the event back to Christmas.\nAccording to N.J.com, Mayor Hokanson, whom Storey praised as a promising leader for Roselle Park, remarked only that, \"Everybody's entitled to his beliefs.\"\nYes, Christmas is a cultural holiday as well as a religious one."}
