Of the nine seats, four are vacant and five are filled with people whose terms expired years ago. According to the board\u2019s annual report, it met only once last year, for an hour.\n\nThe working group also found that most retention schedules, which detail which documents should be kept and for how long, haven\u2019t been updated in 30 years.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine these agencies are doing business the way they were in the 1980s,\u201d said Maine State Archives Director Tammy Marks, a member of the working group.\n\nSecretary of State Matthew Dunlap, whose office oversees the state archives, said he takes responsibility for many of the problems \u2014 particularly the lapsed advisory board \u2014 and he welcomes the report and its recommendations.\n\n\u201cSlogging through the changing nature of records and the changing nature of preserving records and accessing records, the Archives Advisory Board kind of got left on the sidelines. We should have been ramping up our use of it, not walking around it,\u201d Dunlap said.\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m responsible for that because I\u2019m responsible for all the processes of this department. The reason that I ran for this office in the first place is because I was interested in the archives. I have utterly no excuse.\u201d\n\nThe working group was convened last year at the request of the Legislature\u2019s Government Oversight Committee in the wake of a state CDC document-shredding probe. The group included Marks from the state archives and Brenda Kielty, the state\u2019s public-access ombudsman.\n\nThe group presented its 56-page report to the Government Oversight Committee on Friday.\n\nDuring the presentation, committee members were upset to learn that 60 percent of agencies and departments had no one assigned to serve as records officers, who are designated to handle records-retention issues within the office and to make sure co-workers know what should be kept or destroyed. Marks estimated that the state is missing 100 records officers, largely because workers left and no one else was ever assigned the duty in their place.\n\nState Sen. Christopher Johnson, D-Somerville, called that a \u201cfundamental failing\u201d for government accountability.\n\n\u201cThis is unfathomable to me. This is a key aspect of government transparency,\u201d he said.\n\nCommittee members were also surprised to learn that departments are using decades-old retention schedules, deciding which documents to keep or toss based on rules that haven\u2019t been updated since long before the advent of email and other digital records. Although retention schedules are supposed to be reviewed every year, the working group believes that has not happened.\n\nPart of the problem: The advisory board that helps deal with retention schedules is not functioning the way state law intended. The Maine State Archives alone has been handling schedules and retention issues.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long-standing problem. One advisory board seat has been vacant since 2004, while others have been empty since 2007 and 2009. Members fill five seats, but their terms expired as long ago as 2005.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are not currently on the board, who have applied to be on the board, who have the background to be appropriate to be appointed to the board. And nothing\u2019s been done with them,\u201d said board member Elaine Stanley, whose term expired in 2009.\n\nStanley began serving on the board as part of her work with the Maine State Library. She retired from the library over seven years ago, but before she left she encouraged someone there to take her place on the board. One person started the process, she said, but there was never an appointment and no one showed up to replace her.\n\n\u201cI stayed after I retired out of interest in what\u2019s being done and the sense of the value of the information that needs to be kept,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIn 50 years, we\u2019re going to look back and say, \u2018Well, where are those records?\u2019 And if somebody\u2019s not making sure that they\u2019re being kept available, they won\u2019t be available.\u201d\n\nMaine\u2019s governor appoints board members. The problem has persisted through at least two governors, Democrat John Baldacci and Republican Paul LePage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been a partisan issue,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not been given any kind of priority.\u201d\n\nThe working group issued a number of recommendations in its report, including changing and updating the advisory board, ensuring retention schedules are reviewed every year and insisting that agencies and departments name records officers. It also suggested that the State Archives refuse to release or accept records from any agency that does not have an officer.\n\nDunlap, who served as secretary of state between 2005 and 2011 before returning to the position in 2013, said he was happy to have the recommendations. He said the State Archives faced significant challenges in recent years, including staffing levels that dropped from 35 people to 11 due to budget cuts and nearly 100 percent turnover in staff as the employees who were left retired.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re desperately short-handed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives us the opportunity to take a deep breath and say the Legislature\u2019s giving us some direction.\u201d\n\nThe direction doesn\u2019t fall just to the Maine State Archives. It\u2019s been reminding agencies and departments since 2013 that they need to name records officers, but to no avail.\n\n\u201cWe know what to say,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cThe issue is, how do you get them to listen? And that\u2019s not because they don\u2019t take it seriously; it\u2019s because they\u2019re getting hauled in eight different directions. It\u2019s all so superfluous until you can\u2019t find evidence for a court case, you know? Or somebody dies and you can\u2019t find out anything about what they were working on.\u201d\n\nThe Government Oversight Committee will consider the working group\u2019s recommendations and decide whether it should take any action, including the introduction of legislation.\n\nThe committee is expected to take up the issue at its next meeting later this month.\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Sen.
