Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., a pair of promising, fresh-faced GOP challengers with no primary opposition.\n\nThen he broke his own rule, perhaps seeing an opportunity that could pay dividends down the road.\n\nThe Florida Republican senator got behind Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst on May 5, just days after a poll came out of the field showing Ernst with a double-digit lead for the first time in the five-way fight for the nomination.\n\n[Republican 2016ers Look to Pass the Hillary Clinton Test]\n\nHarper Polling, the GOP firm, finished its work in the field on a Friday; the Rubio endorsement leaked to the conservative Breitbart media outlet the following Monday. Ernst hasn\u2019t let go of her lead since.\n\nFor Rubio, whose status as a presidential contender has diminished in Iowa over the last year, picking a side makes sense.\n\nRubio needs the equivalent of jumper cables to get back in the mix of Iowa GOP primary voters. He registered just 4 percent there in the latest caucus poll. Ernst, an Iraqi veteran who is the establishment\u2019s pick for the seat, could be his vehicle to redemption.\n\nEleven days from the primary, Ernst is now the candidate to beat for the shot at the open Iowa Senate seat.\n\nSo Rubio doubled down on Friday, producing an ad for Ernst that will begin running in the state Saturday, according to The Des Moines Register.\n\nIt\u2019s a $121,000 statewide buy that hails Ernst as a \u201cmother, grandmother and Sunday school teacher\u201d and will help her offset the financial disparity she\u2019s confronting against businessman Mark Jacobs.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Marco Rubio's Iowa Redemption Begins With Joni Ernst", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "He tends to stay out of intraparty fights, but the caucus state is a glaring exception.", "title": "Rubio's Iowa Redemption Begins With Ernst", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/05/23/marco-rubios-iowa-redemption-begins-with-joni-ernst", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/24/c2/70fc5a324865a9a0b5fe944e6b4b/140523-rubio-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Marco Rubio's Iowa Redemption Begins With Joni Ernst", "description": "He tends to stay out of intraparty fights, but the caucus state is a glaring exception.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "May 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,2016 presidential election,Rubio, Marco,Iowa,Pulse,picks,The Run 2016 [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "He tends to stay out of intraparty fights, but the caucus state is a glaring exception."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceff8\"", "article_summary": "Eleven days from the primary, Ernst is now the candidate to beat for the shot at the open Iowa Senate seat.\nMarco Rubio\u2019s general rule of thumb has been to stay out of contested GOP Senate primaries.\nRubio needs the equivalent of jumper cables to get back in the mix of Iowa GOP primary voters.\nErnst, an Iraqi veteran who is the establishment\u2019s pick for the seat, could be his vehicle to redemption.\nThe Florida Republican senator got behind Iowa state Sen.
