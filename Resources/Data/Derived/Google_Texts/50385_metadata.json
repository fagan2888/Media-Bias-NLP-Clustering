About 20 percent planned to spend $10,000 to $20,000 on a long-term purchase, such as a kitchen remodel.\n\n\u201cOur exhibitors change every year, and we have about 120 vendors who are here for the first time,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut we also have a 70 percent renewal rate among vendors because it\u2019s such a key event for them. The leads and purchases they get here can sometimes lead them through the coming year.\u201d\n\nA walk through the winding corral of vendors also gives shoppers a glimpse at the year\u2019s most popular home improvement trends.\n\nAt the forefront? Tiny homes.\n\nRandy Woodman had been in the cabin-building business for 20 years before discovering the \u201ctiny home\u201d phenomenon. Just two years ago, he joined Escape Traveler, a home manufacturer that designs hand-crafted homes the size of an RV equipped with plumbing and electricity. \u201cThese are generally for people interested in down-sizing and who want to be able to afford to live where they live,\u201d Woodman said.\n\nCelebrity guests also made appearances. The \u201cFabulous Beekman Boys\u201d of Cooking Channel fame told crowds the \u201cseven things we learned from our goats.\u201d\n\nSelf-described as \u201ctwo NYC guys who bought a farm,\u201d Josh Kilmer-Purcell and his partner Brent Ridge told audiences about their experience working on a goat farm and launching a lifestyle brand.\n\nTheir brand, Beekman 1802, which sells home decor items, food and recipes, recently was named one of the fastest-growing lifestyle brands in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re two gay New York City goat farmers \u2014 we are the punchline,\u201d Kilmer-Purcell said. \u201cBut we work together in a community that\u2019s so different from us to make something really wonderful.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Home Show runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Discover the hottest trends at this weekend\u2019s Denver Home Show", "title": "Discover the hottest trends at this weekend\u2019s Denver Home Show", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/discover-the-hottest-trends-at-this-weekends-denver-home-show/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__homeshowp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__homeshowp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T15:18:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:20:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By no coincidence, the Denver Home Show made a guest appearance in Denver this weekend at the National Western Complex to the delight of metro-area homeowners.\nCristian Moore, manager of the Denver Home Show, said the event is the perfect \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for anything home-related, making it the ideal spot for vendors.\nFor more than 30 years, the Denver Home Show has brought vendors from across the state to satisfy the needs shoppers may not have known they had.\n\u201cOur exhibitors change every year, and we have about 120 vendors who are here for the first time,\u201d Moore said.\n\u201cBut we also have a 70 percent renewal rate among vendors because it\u2019s such a key event for them."}
