He can read in his strained expression the struggle that was going on in his mind as he tried to figure out how to answer a challenge put to the Republican contenders: \u201cBare your soul.\u201d\n\nThe shadow on Santorum\u2019s soul was the memory of a time when he hadn\u2019t loved his own child as a father should. Could there be a more grievous sin for a champion of the pro-life movement?\n\nWhen his turn came to speak, the former senator from Pennsylvania choked on tears and described the birth of his youngest, Isabella Maria Santorum. She has an extra 18th chromosome in every cell of her body, a condition deemed by doctors to be \u201cincompatible with life.\u201d\n\nUntil Bella was 5 months old and near death on a gurney in an emergency room, Santorum said, he had deluded himself into believing that \u201cthe best thing I could do was to treat her differently and not love her\u201d as he had his six older children.\n\nHe had put up his guard, convinced \u201cit wouldn\u2019t hurt as much if I lost her. I remember holding that finger, looking at her and realizing what I had done,\u201d he said. \u201cI had seen her as less of a person.\u201d\n\nKaren and Bella Santorum. (Santorum family)\n\nThe 2,500 religious and social conservatives who were in that Des Moines church three years ago sat in silence, captivated.\n\nWhich was not the reaction at his home in Virginia, where his wife was nursing Bella through another harrowing weekend.\n\nKaren Santorum was livid that Rick had violated their agreement to keep the details of their disabled daughter\u2019s condition out of the glare of his 2012 presidential campaign. Worse was the clumsiness with which he had done it.\n\n\u201cThat is what was so hurtful. He expressed it in a way that it could be misinterpreted as him not loving Bella, when in fact he did, but he was grieving in the way that he did because he was deflecting,\u201d Karen recalled in an interview alongside her husband.\n\nThe Santorums have written a raw and revealing book, \u201cBella\u2019s Gift,\u201d to be released on Tuesday. The couple say it was intended as a guide for other families in their situation, providing the type of support that they often found lacking.\n\n\u201cBy accident, it\u2019s almost a marriage book,\u201d Karen added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sugarcoat anything. We just said it the way it was.\u201d\n\nTheirs has been a shared journey, but one in which they initially found themselves on different paths.\n\nThe Santorums each started with a different interpretation of God\u2019s will. Hers was a conviction that providence had put a challenge before them, one that they should fight to overcome. His was an acceptance that it was out of their hands, and that they should come to terms with that.\n\nHe was out of step with others in his family as well. There was the time that Rick and his teen daughter, Elizabeth, were putting together a crib for newborn Bella. Rick told Elizabeth to save the box, in case they needed it to send the bed back to the store, because \u201cwe just don\u2019t know how long Bella is going to be here.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cI wish I could take those words back, because I\u2019ll never forget the way she looked at me, as though I had not only hurt her but condemned Bella myself. My feisty Lizzie grabbed the box and tore it up as she started to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBella\u2019s Gift\u201d is an un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox volume to put out as Santorum gears up for a second presidential bid.\n\nIt is not a campaign manifesto with 10-point policy proposals or grand visions for his party. And it is somewhat off-message, given Santorum\u2019s declaration that he will pivot from social issues to economic ones for 2016.\n\nThe book takes him back to old territory \u2014 the morality of abortion \u2014 which is an option chosen by many facing what their family did.\n\n\u201cBella gave me the ability to talk about the dignity of every human life without talking about abortion, because there is a bigger issue,\u201d Rick said.\n\nThe Santorums wrote their chapters separately, often late at night in their bedroom. Karen got the desktop, leaving Rick to work on the laptop.\n\nAs of last week, he still hadn\u2019t read some of the sections she wrote, not wanting to expose himself again to the feelings of that time. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard. It\u2019s tough to read sometimes. But I\u2019ve read most of it,\u201d he said.\n\nBella\u2019s disorder, Trisomy 18, is a rarer, more lethal cousin of Down syndrome. Only half of those born with it survive a week; fewer than 1 in 10 make it to their first birthday.\n\nBella\u2019s seventh birthday is three months away.\n\nShe will never walk on her own, or speak intelligibly, or dress and bathe herself. Yet Bella is a sunny child, a delight to her parents and doting siblings, Karen said. \u201cShe has a beautiful, joyful life. She is the happiest little girl I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nShe also has advantages that many disabled children do not, starting with the fact that her mother is a former neonatal intensive care nurse who comes from a family of doctors.\n\nHaving set out to learn all she could about her daughter\u2019s condition, \u201cKaren\u2019s more of an expert than 99.9 percent of physicians in this country when it comes to this issue,\u201d Rick said.\n\nThe Santorums also had significant financial resources, thanks to his consulting practice, speaking fees and television appearances. The most recent tax forms they made public report an annual household income that hovered around $1 million in 2009 and 2010. The medical expenses that their insurance did not cover were about $50,000 in each of those years.\n\nVictoria Miller, the founder of the Trisomy 18 Foundation, cautioned that there are limits to what even the most determined families can do for their children. Her son Isaac lived for 11 days in 2001.\n\n\u201cParents say, \u2018I did this one thing, it made all the difference,\u2019 [or] \u2018if doctors would just tell everyone this one thing,\u2019 but that just isn\u2019t true,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe reality is these are brief and fragile lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether to continue the pregnancy is one of many, many decisions parents have to make,\u201d Miller added. \u201cThese are heartbreaking choices. If they can make these decisions in a thoughtful way \u2014 do it out of love \u2014 they can live into the future and remember their child\u2019s life with few regrets.\u201d\n\nThe Santorums also remain staunch opponents of the Affordable Care Act, which they insist will ultimately lead to the rationing of health care and withholding it from the disabled.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t fully implemented yet,\u201d Rick said. \u201cThe impact of a more government-dictated budgetary system is a longer-term impact, not an immediate impact.\u201d\n\nOthers argue the ACA has and will continue to help families looking for help for their disabled children.\n\nThe law did away with insurance companies\u2019 ability to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, prevented them from imposing lifetime caps on what they will reimburse, and mandated them to pay for more services and therapies.\n\n\u201cCertainly many people who have benefited the most from this are families with development disabilities who could never get insurance before, or who had it so limited they missed key benefits. It\u2019s a boon for any family who has a child with serious health problems,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University Law School professor of health law and policy.\n\nKatherine Neas, spokeswoman for the disability services and advocacy organization Easter Seals, added: \u201cThe free market hasn\u2019t served our community very well.\u201d\n\n\u2018A painful paradox\u2019\n\nKaren was 48 years old when Bella was born. The pregnancy had been a surprise. And the Santorums already had a half-dozen children, aged 6 to 17.\n\n\u201cAll of us grew up when she was born,\u201d said Elizabeth, a co-author with her parents. \u201cI always say God knew my parents could never be empty-nesters.\u201d\n\nPrenatal tests had hinted at problems, and Karen\u2019s age was a risk factor. The couple also knew from experience they could not assume that things would turn out fine. In 1996, they lost a son named Gabriel Michael, who lived only two hours after being born prematurely.\n\nWhen their three-pound, curly haired girl arrived by Caesarean section on May 13, 2008, she appeared normal except for the fact that her pinkie and index fingers rested atop her middle ones. It was a subtle marker of the worst possibility that the Santorums had been told to brace for, and that they soon confirmed.\n\nAt 10 days old, Bella was sent home from the neonatal intensive care unit on hospice care.\n\n\u201cCare for the dying for our newborn baby \u2014 a painful paradox,\u201d Karen wrote.\n\nThey were given pamphlets about coffins and grave sites, useless adult-sized nasogastric tubes, doses of morphine for when she went into cardiac or respiratory arrest. Getting a prescription for oxygen, however, was a battle.\n\nFriends sent sympathy notes instead of congratulations. An icy doctor told them plainly: \u201cYou have to let her go. Statistically, there\u2019s no hope here.\u201d Karen noticed that he referred to \u201cthe baby,\u201d as if Bella had no name.\n\nThey had allies, too \u2014 one of whom was Bella\u2019s pediatrician, doctor James Baugh, whom Karen described as \u201ckind, thoughtful and compassionate.\u201d\n\nBaugh was authorized by the Santorums to speak to The Washington Post about Bella. He noted that doctors themselves have to take their lead from the families of seriously ill children.\n\n\u201cEvery family is different in how they handle such grim news,\u201d Baugh said, adding that most probably would not push for aggressive medical intervention in Bella\u2019s circumstances, given the low survival chances.\n\n\u201cThe Santorums\u2019 reaction was an unusual one, so the medical community was thrown back,\u201d Baugh said. \u201cThe [approach of the] original team involved would have been standard medical reaction across the country.\u201d\n\nRick acknowledged that, at first, he was among those more focused on the probabilities than the possibilities. He believed he had to be strong, to prepare for the inevitable.\n\nIn Bella\u2019s early months, her father \u201cwas at peace if Bella lived or died. And that broke my heart,\u201d Karen wrote.\n\nShe agreed that the moment when Bella almost slipped away in the emergency room, the one Rick recounted in Iowa, was an epiphany for her husband.\n\n\u201cHe saw that, although he had gone through the motions of fatherhood, he had hardened his heart out of fear,\u201d Karen wrote. \u201cEver since that day, Bella has had Rick wrapped around her little finger.\u201d\n\nHe has learned CPR, how to feed her with a pump and syringes, how to work the nebulizer that delivers drugs by mist to her lungs. She squeals when she sees her father arrive at home, and he tosses her into the air.\n\n\u201cBella is this little love sink,\u201d he said. \u201cShe loves to be loved, and it is so joyful when you give it to her, and she gives it right back, and that just turns me into mush.\u201d\n\nConspicuously missing from the book is much discussion of financial tension, or the vagaries of health insurance \u2014 though both Santorums vividly recall an argument over Karen\u2019s demand that a critically ill Bella be airlifted from a Virginia hospital to Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nHer husband initially overruled her. \u201cIt\u2019s a $25,000 helicopter ride which was probably not going to be covered by insurance,\u201d he explained in the interview. Ultimately, Karen secured a transfer.\n\nOf the money they spend on their daughter\u2019s care, Rick said: \u201cThis is Bella\u2019s college, and we just sort of look at it, this is Bella\u2019s wedding. All of these things, if you look at all of the expenses that come with raising a child, we just look at it as, this is a good investment, because we get another year with Bella.\u201d\n\nKaren added that a child with Bella\u2019s limitations could also qualify for Medicaid, though they have chosen not to take that option: \u201cIn fact, there were years when her doctors were really pushing me to put her on Medicaid, so she could get 24/7 nursing care.\u201d\n\nRick, anticipating a question about a program that Republicans so often attack, quickly added: \u201cLook, I\u2019m perfectly fine, and have been fine, with disabled children being on Medicaid.\u201d\n\nA fragile life\n\nKaren had initially resisted the idea of his long-shot 2012 candidacy, knowing how it would put the burden of Bella\u2019s care squarely on her shoulders.\n\n\u201cIt was the Affordable Care Act that put the fire in me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSqueezing his hand, I said, \u2018Let\u2019s give it everything we\u2019ve got.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSantorum\u2019s comments at that October 2011 forum in Des Moines got little attention outside the state \u2014 but he did begin to edge up in the Iowa polls around that time, and he narrowly won the caucuses the following January.\n\nBella and her condition did not become widely known until February, when she got pneumonia in both lungs and was once again in critical condition. Just before the Florida primary, trailing Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, Rick suspended his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even want to announce why we were going to the hospital and why we were suspending and then the politicos came in and said you can\u2019t just suspend the campaign. They\u2019ll think you are dropping out, you\u2019re losing in Florida,\u201d Rick said.\n\nThen his former chief of staff Mark Rodgers, Bella\u2019s godfather, asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you want the country to pray for her?\u201d\n\nWhat occurred was the opposite of what they had feared. The other candidates checked in with good wishes. And when Santorum returned to the campaign trail, he was met at almost every event by parents and their disabled children.\n\nMiller said her Trisomy 18 Foundation Web site had never seen so much traffic.\n\nSantorum never caught up with Romney. He dropped out of the race two days after Easter \u2014 following another weekend spent at the hospital with Bella.\n\nKaren said her family held up well during the gruels of the 2012 campaign. And if her husband runs again, as he shows every sign of doing, it will be easier because her children are older and Bella\u2019s condition is more stable.\n\nWhy Bella has survived remains a mystery.\n\nHer uncle, doctor Michael Lamb, is an internal medicine specialist who began looking into Trisomy 18 when she was born. He said he never accepted the grim prognosis, in part because his niece did not have a defect typical of the condition, and also because he believed she could be helped by treating her immune system.\n\n\u201cWhen Bella would get these respiratory infections, most doctors didn\u2019t want to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery child has to be assessed individually.\u201d\n\nHer parents say it has been more than three years since Bella had a crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are on cruise control\u201d with an intense medical regimen, Karen said.\n\nHer doctor cautions that Bella\u2019s airways remain abnormal, and that even a simple cold could still be disastrous. \u201cShe\u2019s done beautifully, but there is still a chance she may abruptly pass away,\u201d Baugh said.\n\nThat is something which Rick said he has learned to accept without closing his heart.\n\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to have Bella, we\u2019re blessed. We\u2019re just blessed every day. We don\u2019t live on the edge. But we realize what we\u2019re dealing with, and there\u2019s all sorts of things that can happen, and she\u2019s not \u2014 \u201d\n\nKaren interrupted: \u201cI don\u2019t think about it.\u201d\n\nRick continued, with tears in his eyes: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t think about it, and she doesn\u2019t like me to mention \u2014 \u201d\n\nTo which Karen insisted on having the final word: \u201cWe just live with her joy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In \u201cBella\u2019s Gift,\u201d the couple shares their early divide after having a daughter with a deadly disorder.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/colby.itkowitz", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In \u201cBella\u2019s Gift,\u201d the couple shares their early divide after having a daughter with a deadly disorder.", "title": "After birth of youngest, clashing views pulled at Rick Santorum, his wife", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/santorums-new-book-reveals-how-faith-and-love-are-tested-by-a-daughters-disability/2015/02/07/27a1728e-ac85-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/06/Others/Images/2015-02-06/Rick%20and%20Bella_06131423252994.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@colbyitkowitz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/santorums-new-book-reveals-how-faith-and-love-are-tested-by-a-daughters-disability/2015/02/07/27a1728e-ac85-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "rick santorum, karen santorum, bella santorum, bella's gift, trisomy 18, trisomy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/colby.itkowitz"}, "eomportal-uuid": "27a1728e-ac85-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "rick santorum, karen santorum, bella santorum, bella's gift, trisomy 18, trisomy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d2a\"", "article_summary": "Over and over, Rick Santorum has watched the old video of himself at a presidential candidate forum in Iowa.\n\u201cI had seen her as less of a person.\u201dKaren and Bella Santorum.\nOf the money they spend on their daughter\u2019s care, Rick said: \u201cThis is Bella\u2019s college, and we just sort of look at it, this is Bella\u2019s wedding.\nAnd if her husband runs again, as he shows every sign of doing, it will be easier because her children are older and Bella\u2019s condition is more stable.\nThe Santorums have written a raw and revealing book, \u201cBella\u2019s Gift,\u201d to be released on Tuesday."}
