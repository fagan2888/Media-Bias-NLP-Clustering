Open enrollment for the first yearly sign-up period closes at the end of Monday. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe non-partisan Urban Institute estimates that about 5 million Americans have become newly insured over the last year, an early indication that the Affordable Care Act has achieved one of its chief aims, reducing the number of Americans without health care coverage.\n\nThe Obama administration announced this week that about 7 million Americans enrolled in health care plans through the exchanges set up under the law, but that number includes some number of people who previously had insurance, so it\u2019s not clear if those people actually got insurance because of \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Urban Institute study looks more carefully at the question of who had been previously insured. They estimate that about 17.6 percent of Americans between ages 18 and 64 were uninsured in the early parts of 2013, compared to about 15.2 percent now. That would constitute about 5.4 million adults who have gained insurance.\n\nUnsurprisingly, states that have chosen to expand their Medicaid programs under the law have seen much larger increases than those who have not.\n\nTo be sure, this report is preliminary. The authors note it does not include data from the last week in March, when more than 1 million Americans enrolled. And it does not tell us if people are satisfied with their insurance and its costs or simply enrolled because the law requires them to do so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "theGRIO REPORT - The Obama administration announced this week that about 7 million Americans enrolled in health care plans through the exchanges set up under the law...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "theGrio", "description": "theGRIO REPORT - The Obama administration announced this week that about 7 million Americans enrolled in health care plans through the exchanges set up under the law...", "title": "Think tank estimates 5 million newly insured because of\u00a0Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3476, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obamacare-hits-target.jpg?fit=3476%2C1955", "height": 1955}, "url": "http://thegrio.com/2014/04/03/think-tank-estimates-5-million-newly-insured-because-of-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1699887390250781, "pages": 75928194876}, "google-site-verification": "nGSqmdocNPXRMLRT9q_QAemkqyzj9W5Vd4tzA7hsksg", "keywords": "politics, barack obama, health care, health care reform, health insurance, obamacare", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-03T20:54:31+00:00", "author": "http://thegrio.com/author/perrybaconjr/"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe36c2\"", "article_summary": "The authors note it does not include data from the last week in March, when more than 1 million Americans enrolled.\n(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The non-partisan Urban Institute estimates that about 5 million Americans have become newly insured over the last year, an early indication that the Affordable Care Act has achieved one of its chief aims, reducing the number of Americans without health care coverage.\nThat would constitute about 5.4 million adults who have gained insurance.\nAnd it does not tell us if people are satisfied with their insurance and its costs or simply enrolled because the law requires them to do so.\nUnsurprisingly, states that have chosen to expand their Medicaid programs under the law have seen much larger increases than those who have not."}
