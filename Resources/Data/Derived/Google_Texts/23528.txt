More jobs are coming to central Kentucky.

Scott County is thrilled about the expansion of the International Crankshift facility, located near Georgetown College's football stadium.

According to published reports, plans include a more than 10,000 square-foot building expansion and a new building, which is expected to include truck staging, parking and a detention pond.

It also means 36 new jobs.

This is great news for Georgetown, especially because business hasn't always been booming.

"At one time, we had several manufacturers like Johnson Control, electric parts all of two had gone and we were a depressed area and Toyota came and things are booming now," said George Lusby, Scott County Judge Executive.

Work is also underway next door at Vuteq USA Inc., which is expanding its operation as well.

Both expansions come after Toyota announced itâ€™s investing more than half a billion dollars in adding Lexus onto its manufacturing line.

The company also had to get city approval to build an access road to the site.
