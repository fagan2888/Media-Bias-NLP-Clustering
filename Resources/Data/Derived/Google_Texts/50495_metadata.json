REUTERS/Jason Reed (SOUTH AFRICA - Tags: POLITICS) - RTX11706\n\n4064596\n\nThe Obama administration gave the latest no-bid Obamacare website contract to a company whose former top analytic researcher developed the complex voter-tracking computer strategies that led Obama to victory in 2012.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Department of Health and Human Services, recently fired Obamacare website contractor CGI Federal after the botched website rollout that began in October \u2014 though CGI Federal still holds five major tech contracts with CMS that are valid for at least another year.\n\nCMS replaced CGI Federal \u2014 which employs Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate and White House Christmas dinner guest Toni Townes-Whitley as a top executive \u2014 with another firm that has close links to Obama-world.\n\nThe Chicago-based consulting firm Accenture received a $90 million noncompetitive contract to become the Obamacare website\u2019s new primary contractor. The no-bid deal puts the company that employed the man who developed the Obama campaign\u2019s personality-tracking programs in charge of a website that possesses massive amounts of personal information despite severe security risks.\n\nRayid Ghani, chief scientist of the Obama for America data analytics team, came to the Obama campaign in 2011 after a long stint directing the analytics research group at Accenture Technology Labs, where he engineered new ways for companies to track consumers\u2019 personal preferences.\n\nWhile at Accenture, Ghani \u201cspecialized in building algorithms from various data sets\u2014like consumer shopping habits\u2014to help businesses improve their bottom lines,\u201d according to a brief October 2012 profile in Mother Jones on the Obama re-election team\u2019s \u201cdigital gurus.\u201d He figured out shoppers\u2019 habits to a fine degree of detail, determining whether they\u2019re inclined to bargain-shop or to engage in \u201cpantry-loading.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn one of his more recent projects, Ghani developed a model to estimate, with 96 percent accuracy, the end price of an eBay auction\u2014information that could then be used to sell price insurance to queasy users worried about coming up short,\u201d Mother Jones reported. \u201cAt OFA, his skills have been put to use on Project Dreamcatcher, which uses text analytics to gauge voter sentiment.\u201d\n\nThe Obama re-election team\u2019s powerful voter database helped \u201calter the very nature of the electorate\u201d in 2012, according to The New York Times, \u201cmaking it younger and less white.\u201d\n\nKathleen Sebelius has failed to provide a \u201cprivacy and security plan\u201d to prevent fraud and abuse of the Obamacare website, according to Republican Rep. Diane Black.\n\nThe man formerly known as \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Wanted Hacker\u201d told Congress that the HealthCare.gov Obamacare enrollment website clearly \u201cdid not consider security as a priority\u201d and that \u201cIt would be a hacker\u2019s wet dream to break into healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter\n\nCorrection: Rayid Ghani was hired by the Obama campaign after his work with Accenture.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Rayid Ghani was hired by the Obama campaign after his work with Accenture", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration gave the latest no-bid Obamacare website contract to a company whose former top analytic researcher developed the complex voter-tracking computer strategies that led Obama to", "title": "After firing CGI, no-bid contract for Obamacare site goes to firm whose former top researcher developed Obama campaign voter tracking", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/20/after-firing-cgi-no-bid-contract-for-obamacare-site-goes-to-firm-that-ran-obama-campaign-tech/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/obamacomputer.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rayid Ghani was hired by the Obama campaign after his work with Accenture", "title": "After firing CGI, no-bid contract for Obamacare site goes to firm whose former top researcher developed Obama campaign voter tracking Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/20/after-firing-cgi-no-bid-contract-for-obamacare-site-goes-to-firm-that-ran-obama-campaign-tech/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/obamacomputer.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-20 12:18:57", "sailthru.title": "After firing CGI, no-bid contract for Obamacare site goes to firm whose former top researcher developed Obama campaign voter tracking", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "cgi federal,cms", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration gave the latest no-bid Obamacare website contract to a company whose former top analytic researcher developed the complex voter-tracking computer strategies that led Obama to", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/obamacomputer.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf81\"", "article_summary": "REUTERS/Jason Reed (SOUTH AFRICA - Tags: POLITICS) - RTX117064064596The Obama administration gave the latest no-bid Obamacare website contract to a company whose former top analytic researcher developed the complex voter-tracking computer strategies that led Obama to victory in 2012.\nThe Chicago-based consulting firm Accenture received a $90 million noncompetitive contract to become the Obamacare website\u2019s new primary contractor.\nCMS replaced CGI Federal \u2014 which employs Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate and White House Christmas dinner guest Toni Townes-Whitley as a top executive \u2014 with another firm that has close links to Obama-world.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Department of Health and Human Services, recently fired Obamacare website contractor CGI Federal after the botched website rollout that began in October \u2014 though CGI Federal still holds five major tech contracts with CMS that are valid for at least another year.\nThe no-bid deal puts the company that employed the man who developed the Obama campaign\u2019s personality-tracking programs in charge of a website that possesses massive amounts of personal information despite severe security risks."}
