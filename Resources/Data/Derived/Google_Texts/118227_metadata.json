She is also a frequent guest on both national radio and TV networks such as TheBlazeTV and Fox Business.\n\nLast year, Alaska Gov. Bill Walker unilaterally expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, despite a clear prohibition from the legislature.\n\nWalker and the legislature are currently embroiled in a heated legal battle over whether the expansion is authorized under Alaskan law. At the time, many worried that Walker\u2019s decision would put stress on the state budget and require cuts to other priorities and the most vulnerable. We have seen that elsewhere, and now Alaskans are seeing it first hand.\n\nAs Alaska\u2019s legislative session begins, Walker is proposing serious cuts to Medicaid.\n\nSignificant reductions in Medicaid are being made. Between reductions made by the Governor and the Legislature in the FY16 budget and the proposed reductions in the Governor\u2019s proposed FY17 budget we will reduce the Medicaid budget by over $90 million in general fund reductions. Medicaid expansion-related reductions in other state programs are bringing us another $10 million.\n\nThat\u2019s $100 million in budget cuts related to Medicaid. And remember: the Walker administration has already proposed slashing funding for children and adults with developmental disabilities.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only problem that Alaska\u2019s poor have to face. Walker is also proposing a 1.5 percent personal income tax for Alaskans \u2013 something the state has not had since 1980. The proposal could squeeze the taxpayers for $200 million each year.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, the governor is also proposing to \u201creduce the size of annual Permanent Fund dividend checks to an initial amount of about $1,000.\u201d In Alaska, the Permanent Fund pays each Alaskan who has lived in the state for a full calendar year. It\u2019s essentially a thank you for living in the largest, coldest state in the Union, but it\u2019s something that many Alaskans do rely on.\n\nWalker admits that \u201cThere\u2019s no one who isn\u2019t going to be impacted in some way, by what we\u2019re going to propose.\u201d\n\nHe is also proposing a tax increase on mining, fishing, tourism, and oil and gas \u2013 all industries that are critical to Alaska\u2019s economy; industries that may be forced to make job cuts to absorb higher taxes.\n\nAll of these changes are being made to fund the state\u2019s ballooning budget \u2013 a budget made larger by Walker\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\n\nIn fact, Medicaid is the second largest portion of Alaska\u2019s budget, just behind education costs. As the state\u2019s share of Medicaid expansion costs begin mounting in the next budget, Alaskans will undoubtedly see more cuts to Medicaid, education and other programs to compensate for the hit to the state\u2019s budget.\n\nDuring the expansion debate last year, Alaska State Sen. Mike Dunleavy noted \u201crecent well-publicized reports of several other states that grossly underestimated the numbers and cost involved\u201d should be studied.\n\nOne example of a state besieged by drastically increasing Medicaid costs is Kentucky \u2013 where they a saw much larger enrollment than expected.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report, Kentucky, for example, had almost 311,000 new Medicaid enrollees in fiscal year 2014. This figure is more than double what was projected for 2014, and more than they expected even through 2021. Kentucky was forced to revise its Medicaid cost estimate from $33 million to $74 million for fiscal year 2017, and the projection for 2021 is now a staggering $363 million.\n\nA Kentucky state senator told the AP that Medicaid expansion had \u201ccreated a \u2018monstrous hole\u2019 in their budget that they did not know how to fix.\u201d\n\nThose who Medicaid was originally created to support \u2013 poor seniors, children, families, and the disabled \u2013 are the ones that will feel these cuts the most. That\u2019s not a threat \u2013 it\u2019s a reality we\u2019re already seeing.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to look further than California to see the devastating impact Medicaid expansion is having on the developmentally disabled. Thanks to the expansion-amplified budget crisis, California may not be able to keep the needed money flowing into groups like the Arc, which provide critical services to the disabled.\n\nAnd in Alaska, instead of their vulnerable residents getting the help they need, they will face higher health bills, decreased access to care, and will continue to be targets of budget cuts as their state Medicaid costs balloon far beyond projections.\n\nThese budget cuts in order to afford Alaska\u2019s rising Medicaid costs are only the beginning. Legislators will face the same problem next year, and the year after that, and in perpetuity because of Walker\u2019s decision to embrace and expand Obamacare.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
