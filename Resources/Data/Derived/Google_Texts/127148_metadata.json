Note the steep drop-off from the last progressive reform (increase teacher pay) to the top conservative reform (test scores for teacher evaluations). [Emphasis in the original.]\n\nWhat an amazing coincidence! The public favors exactly what DFPE proposes!\n\nBut let\u2019s look at how they phrased the \u201cproposed reforms\u201d:\n\nNotice how all the so-called \u201cprogressive reforms\u201d sound positive (\u201cengaging curriculum\u201d \u201covercome challenges\u201d) and sometimes even explicitly connect the reform to some positive outcome (\u201chelp disadvantaged students\u201d). Are teachers\u2019 \u201cdue process rights\u201d (read: tenure) really about their ability to \u201cadvocate for the things that students need\u201d or more about protecting incompetent teachers from being fired?\n\nAnd of course voters favor increased spending and higher teacher pay in the abstract. That\u2019s consistent with the more credible polling from Education Next, but leaves out the key fact that Americans vastly underestimate how much we now spend on schools. As the EdNext polling shows, public support for increasing spending and teacher salaries drops precipitously when informed of how much is currently being spent.\n\nLikewise, the public supports \u201csmaller class sizes\u201d in the abstract, but in the real world there are tradeoffs and limited resources. The research on reducing class size is mixed, and hiring more inexperienced teachers to lower the class sizes can actually have a net negative effect. Indeed, the evidence suggests that having superior teachers with somewhat larger classes will produce better outcomes on average than having more mediocre teachers with slightly smaller classes.\n\nBy contrast, the poll describes so-called \u201cconservative reforms\u201d with negatively charged words like \u201celiminate\u201d and \u201cat taxpayer expense\u201d and omit any connection to the outcomes that \u201creducing costs\u201d or tenure reform seek to accomplish (never mind running schools \u201clike businesses\u201d). One could easily rewrite all of the polling questions and come up with entirely different results. As I noted in the wake of a similar, union-funded poll:\n\nFortunately, we don\u2019t have to imagine how the public would respond to fairly worded questions. Harvard University\u2019s Program on Education and Governance conducts an annual survey of the public\u2019s views on education policy that meets the highest standards for fairness and rigor. The survey eschews language designed to push respondents in a certain direction and often asks the same question with multiple wordings. According to the 2012 Harvard poll: 54% of parents favor giving all families a \u201cwider choice\u201d to \u201cenroll their children in private schools instead, with government helping to pay the tuition\u201d compared with 21% opposed.\n\n46% of parents favor giving low-income families a \u201cwider choice\u201d to \u201cenroll their children in private schools instead, with government helping to pay the tuition\u201d compared with 21% opposed.\n\nWhen not given a neutral option, 50% of parents favor giving low-income families a \u201cwider choice\u201d to \u201cenroll their children in private schools instead, with government helping to pay the tuition\u201d compared with 50% opposed.\n\nWhen the question omits the words \u201ca wider choice\u201d and only asks about using \u201cgovernment funds to pay the tuition of low-income students who choose to attend private schools,\u201d 44% of parents are in favor with 32% opposed. Note that while support fluctuates depending on the wording, no matter how Harvard asked the question there was still more support among parents for school choice than opposition. Moreover, when asking about scholarship tax credits instead of vouchers, the support was even higher: 57% of parents supported \u201ca tax credit for individual and corporate donations that pay for scholarships to help low-income parents send their children to private schools\u201d compared with 16% opposed.\n\nWhen not given a neutral option, 73% of parents supported \u201ca tax credit for individual and corporate donations that pay for scholarships to help low-income parents send their children to private schools\u201d compared with 27% opposed.\n\nAs with the earlier poll, the DFPE poll produced the results that its sponsors wanted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The results of Democrats for Public Education\u2019s poll are what the group wanted to hear.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The results of Democrats for Public Education's poll are what the group wanted to hear.", "title": "Junk Polling: Democrats for Public Education Edition", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/phony-poll-tells", "image": "http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/screen_shot_2014-10-03_at_12.31.17_pm.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/phony-poll-tells", "title": "Junk Polling: Democrats for Public Education Edition", "description": "The results of Democrats for Public Education's poll are what the group wanted to hear.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2014/10/3", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-03T16:45:09-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2014/10/3", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "democrats for public education, poll, survey, school choice, spending, tenure"}, "article_summary": "As the EdNext polling shows, public support for increasing spending and teacher salaries drops precipitously when informed of how much is currently being spent.\nLikewise, the public supports \u201csmaller class sizes\u201d in the abstract, but in the real world there are tradeoffs and limited resources.\nThat\u2019s consistent with the more credible polling from Education Next, but leaves out the key fact that Americans vastly underestimate how much we now spend on schools.\nAs with the earlier poll, the DFPE poll produced the results that its sponsors wanted.\n46% of parents favor giving low-income families a \u201cwider choice\u201d to \u201cenroll their children in private schools instead, with government helping to pay the tuition\u201d compared with 21% opposed."}
