The US economy is broken and, if we continue down this road, the US will experience subpar growth until, well, forever,\u201d wrote analyst John Crudele, who labeled the economy\u2019s third quarter \u201clousy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress is useless. And the president is hopeless,\u201d he said.\n\nOne writer compared what Obama promised and what he delivered.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cThe president probably earned a D for his economic performance,\u201d Michael Busler wrote on Communities Digital News. \u201cHad he taken absolutely no economic and regulatory policy actions, the economy would probably be better today than it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, then, the grade of D is a bit too generous,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAs for Clinton, her economic plan has something for everyone.\n\n\u201cTaken as a whole, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan is an eclectic grab-bag. It is as if her advisors brainstormed every possible policy to boost wages, and then kept them all\u2026Perhaps when Mr. Sanders exits the stage, some of the duds will be dropped,\u201d wrote The Economist.\n\nh/t: Fox News", "article_metadata": {"description": "D for deluded", "author": "Jack Davis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "D for deluded", "title": "Watch: Hillary Was Just Asked To Grade Obama.
