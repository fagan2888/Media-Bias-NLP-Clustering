Damning evidence that Obamacare is a drag on the U.S. job market has just entered a hallowed American industry: professional baseball.

The story begins Tuesday night at Wrigley Field, when the hapless Cubs (last in the NL Central) and Giants endured an epic, 41/2 hour rain delay, worsened immeasurably because the Second City grounds crew couldn’t cover the playing surface before the downpour.

(The game was then called by the crew chief, handing the Cubs a 2-0 victory, before the Giants protested and, making history, prevailed — and the game was resumed Thursday night.)

But back to our story, in which the stakes are much higher than regular-season baseball. Turns out, the damage done to the field wasn’t just the result of typical Cubby incompetence.

Earlier that night, Cubs management had sent home 10 workers, in part to keep them under 30 hours a week — and avoid paying health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.

Which is exactly what’s happening in business after business across America. According to new survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 18% of businesses in that metro area reported cutting back on jobs and employees as a result of the law — and just 3% report hiring more.

The New York Fed found similar results: Around a fifth of the state’s manufacturers and service firms said Obamacare was leading them to cut the number of workers they employ.

This is not to say that a baseball franchise worth more than $1 billion can’t afford to extend insurance to all its workers, just that a law intended to spread coverage to millions is, like an untested drug, having perverse side effects.
