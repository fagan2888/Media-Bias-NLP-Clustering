A full 30 percent of workers\u2014 and their families \u2014 in this border city come here when they have a cold or joint pain. But the most common ailments, says clinic director Alonso Perez, are related to diabetes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically one of the critical diseases we have here,\u201d Perez said. \u201cObesity and diabetes are rising, their complications are rising, and every day it\u2019s from younger patients.\u201d\n\nThirty percent of Mexico\u2019s schoolchildren and 70 percent of adults are overweight or obese. In recent years, the country has competed with the U.S. for the unflattering title of fattest country in the world.\n\nDiabetes in Mexico has increased along with its citizens\u2019 waistlines. Excess weight and lack of exercise fuel Type 2 diabetes, the most common kind of the disease.\n\nIn hopes of stemming what\u2019s become a public health crisis, Mexico slapped a one-peso-per-liter tax \u2014 about 7 cents \u2014 on sugary drinks. It also added an 8 percent tax to high-caloric food like potato chips and cookies.\n\nIn California, Berkeley passed its own sugary drink tax \u2014 1 cent per ounce \u2014 in November by a wide margin, becoming the first U.S. city to do so. Dozens of other U.S. cities have tried, and failed, to regulate sodas and other sugary drinks as a way to combat obesity and related health problems.\n\n\u201cTaxation, just like it did for tobacco, is the most effective way to get people to change their behavior,\u201d said Barry Popkin, an economist who teaches global nutrition at the University of North Carolina.\n\nPopkin is working with researchers from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Public Health to document the effects of that country\u2019s tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\nTheir preliminary results show that during the first three months of 2014, purchases of sodas and other taxed beverages declined by 10 percent compared to the same time period last year.\n\nMeanwhile purchases of untaxed drinks, like 100-percent fruit juice and milk, went up 7 percent, and purchases of bottled water went up 13 percent.\n\n\u201cEssentially people were substituting plain water, the healthiest beverage we could drink other than milk, for the sugary beverages,\u201d Popkin said.\n\nThe beverage industry in Mexico fought hard against the tax there and continues to criticize it.\n\nLorena Cerd\u00e1n, director of ConMexico, Mexico\u2019s major consumer product industry group, said the taxes were hitting poorer families especially hard.\n\n\u201cReally, what the consumer is doing is redistributing his money,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cAs a result, we see that he\u2019s consuming less of everything.\u201d\n\nSurveys have shown that the Mexican public largely supports the sugary-drink tax. But it\u2019s not hard to find people in Tijuana who think it\u2019s a bad idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think taxing a product is going to do a lot of educating the public,\u201d said Juan Valle, whose family owns a small market less than a mile from the U.S. border.\n\nValle said sales of Coke at his store were actually up, despite the tax.\n\nBut he also said his customers seemed to like a new product called Coca-Cola Life. It\u2019s sweetened with half sugar, half Stevia, a no-calorie substitute.\n\nPublic health advocates say if consumers start choosing lower-sugar sodas or smaller-sized sodas, that would be a victory.\n\nBack at Clinic 27, a nurse weighed Armando Huerta and checked his blood glucose level. Huerta found out he had diabetes two years ago.\n\n\u201cI used to eat a lot of fried stuff,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cChicharrones, a lot of tortillas, mole, and always with soda. We Mexicans say it helps you burp and feel better.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201cfeel good\u201d effect can mask long-term damage. According to Harvard researchers, drinking one to two sugary beverages per day can increase a person\u2019s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 26 percent.\n\nHuerta said he eats healthy food now, and he doesn\u2019t touch soda.\n\nRevenue from the soda tax is supposed to fund health education programs, like the one that\u2019s helped Huerta understand his disease and how to take care of himself. Revenue is also supposed to fund drinking fountains in public schools, though public health advocates complain that the program has been underfunded and slow to get off the ground.\n\nIn the border region, many Mexican consumers have a way of getting around the soda tax \u2014 they can just shop in the U.S.\n\nBerkeley shoppers hoping to avoid their new soda tax could do the same and shop outside of the city. And they wouldn\u2019t even need a passport.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mexico's soda tax took effect Jan. 1, and sales of sugar-sweetened drinks fell 10 percent in the next three months.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In Mexico, People Drinking Less Soda After New Tax\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/12\\/02\\/in-mexico-people-drinking-less-soda-after-new-tax\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-02 08:32:04\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-12-02 16:32:38\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22752,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Soda Tax\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/12\\/Armando-Huerta-e1417479874904.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Mexico's soda tax took effect Jan. 1, and sales of sugar-sweetened drinks fell 10 percent in the next three months.", "title": "In Mexico, People Drinking Less Soda After New Tax", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/12/02/in-mexico-people-drinking-less-soda-after-new-tax/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/12/Armando-Huerta-640x360.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "soda tax", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc000\"", "article_summary": "In the border region, many Mexican consumers have a way of getting around the soda tax \u2014 they can just shop in the U.S.Berkeley shoppers hoping to avoid their new soda tax could do the same and shop outside of the city.\nIn Mexico, People Drinking Less Soda After New TaxBy Jill ReplogleClinic number 27 in Tijuana is the biggest family medicine clinic in Mexico.\nIn hopes of stemming what\u2019s become a public health crisis, Mexico slapped a one-peso-per-liter tax \u2014 about 7 cents \u2014 on sugary drinks.\nRevenue is also supposed to fund drinking fountains in public schools, though public health advocates complain that the program has been underfunded and slow to get off the ground.\nRevenue from the soda tax is supposed to fund health education programs, like the one that\u2019s helped Huerta understand his disease and how to take care of himself."}
