They also voiced support for Burkina Faso's transition back to democracy at the Oct. 11 polls.\n\nA senior adviser to the head of the transitional parliament said that its members would march on the presidential palace to demand the release of the president and ministers.\n\n\"I call on all patriots to mobilize and defend the motherland,\" Sy said.\n\nDemonstrators who gathered on a main road leading to the presidential palace chanted \"Down with the RSP\" and \"We want elections\". Witnesses said soldiers outside the palace fired several warning shots, which prompted the crowds to retreat several hundred meters but not disperse.\n\nRADIO OFF-AIR\n\nA Reuters witness said members of the presidential guard beat back demonstrators with batons. Gunfire was also reported in the nearby Ouaga 2000 neighborhood.\n\n\"I am against this repression of our members of government just a month before the election,\" said protester Idrissa Pasoba, shouting above the crowd.\n\nLeaders of the Balai Citoyen, a citizens movement which was instrumental in organizing the protests against Compaore in October, called its supporters onto the streets in protest.\n\nPrivate station Radio Omega said on social media that presidential guard soldiers had fired warning shots outside the studio and forced journalists to shut down transmission. Several other Burkinabe radio stations also appeared to have stopped transmitting.\n\n\"They were ordered to cut off the antenna otherwise they would be killed,\" said Alpha Barry, president director general of Radio Omega said on France 24.\n\nA French security source said that around 20 soldiers from an intelligence gathering unit were being deployed to Ouagadougou to monitor the situation. France issued a travel warning to its citizens in the country to stay at home.\n\nThe RSP's repeated political meddling since Compaore's ousting has provoked street protests and prompted authorities to call for a review of the guard's role.\n\nMonday's report recommended that the regiment be broken up and its members redeployed within the framework of a broader reform of the military.\n\n(Additional reporting by Mathieu Bonkoungou in Ouagadougou, Emma Farge and Makini Brice in Dakar; Writing by Daniel Flynn; Editing by Alison Williams)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Soldiers fired warning shots to disperse hundreds of protester", "title": "Burkina Faso presidential guard seize president and PM", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/16/Burkina-Faso-presidential-guard-seize-president-and-PM", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/eu-africa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/16/Burkina-Faso-presidential-guard-seize-president-and-PM", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/eu-africa_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Soldiers fired warning shots to disperse hundreds of protester", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2ce6\"", "article_summary": "Moumina Cheriff Sy, the head of the transitional parliament, said the latest show of strength by the presidential guard was a danger to the Burkinabe nation itself.\nOUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Soldiers fired warning shots to disperse hundreds of protesters outside Burkina Faso's presidential palace on Wednesday after the presidential guard burst into a cabinet meeting and arrested the interim president, stirring fears of a military coup.\nPrivate station Radio Omega said on social media that presidential guard soldiers had fired warning shots outside the studio and forced journalists to shut down transmission.\nRADIO OFF-AIRA Reuters witness said members of the presidential guard beat back demonstrators with batons.\nDemonstrators who gathered on a main road leading to the presidential palace chanted \"Down with the RSP\" and \"We want elections\"."}
