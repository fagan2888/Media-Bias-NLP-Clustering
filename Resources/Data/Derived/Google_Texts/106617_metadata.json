What critical enthusiasm the music generated tended to come from rank poptimists, who are now on to the next new sound. Meanwhile, the backward-looking rockists haven\u2019t identified much for the ages in the welter of retro-disco, one-hit-wonder, Beyonc\u00e9-wannabes who wailed hopefully amid gloppy washes of overproduction.\n\nAll of which is a shame, because the R&B of the 2000s was a bizarre and wonderful thing, as \u201990s slow jams gave way to a bracingly slick stew of disco, funk, hip hop, and even some alternative and electronica snuck in there amidst the lacquered finish. Here\u2019s some of the best tracks of an undervalued era and genre.\n\nDestiny\u2019s Child, \u201cApple Pie A La Mode\u201d\n\nDestiny\u2019s Child\u2019s 2001 album \u201cSurvivor\u201d was a big step down from \u201cThe Writing\u2019s On the Wall,\u201d but it did have this marvelous ode to checking out guys. Beyonc\u00e9 and co-producer Rob Fusari find the common ground between Beach Boys\u2019 burping rhythmic vocals and Timbaland\u2019s burping rhythmic soundscape. Good to the last dollop of \u201cwah woh.\u201d\n\nKelly Rowland, \u201cStill In Love With My Ex\u201d\n\nKelly Rowland\u2019s post-Destiny\u2019s Child career hasn\u2019t been meteorically successful, but she\u2019s made some good music. This is probably my favorite of her songs, a lazy mid-tempo Soulshock and Karlin production, with Rowland projecting a vulnerability that Destiny\u2019s Child, and Beyonc\u00e9, rarely reached for. The repetitive \u201cex\u201d in the background has a hopeless, inescapable quality to it, and that line about how she loves his family, too, always gets me.\n\nNelly Furtado and Timbaland, \u201cPromiscuous\u201d\n\nCanadian singer songwriter Nelly Furtado sold all the way out on her 2006 album \u201cLoose,\u201d collaborating with Timbaland, sexing up, and making a (startlingly successful) bid for chart success. \u201cPromiscuous\u201d has the deliberately clumsy lasciviousness of a Loretta Lynn/Conway Twitty duet, with Furtado announcing, \u201cchivalry is dead/but you\u2019re still kind of cute,\u201d while Timbaland volleys back with endearingly klutzy Biz Markie singing: \u201cI want you on my team\u201d (\u201cso does everybody else!\u201d) Meanwhile the quasi-Bollywood beats slink and slither along, a sneakily sensual background for all the cheerful cheese. Eroticism doesn\u2019t get much more charming.\n\nToya, \u201cNo Matta What (Party All Night)\u201d\n\nToya put out one amazing self-titled album in 2001 and then disappeared. \u201cNo Matta What\u201d in particular is a stunning track, built around a glitchy, skipping beat that suggests Aphex Twin and layers of production that include (presumably synthesized) strings and classic rock guitar. Over it all, Toya and the multi-tracked chorus soar ecstatically, partying (as the video suggests) like it\u2019s way past 1999.\n\nIsyss, \u201cUh Uh Uh Uh\u201d\n\nOne of many girl groups that tried to imitate Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s success, Isyss was distinguished by lead singers Quierra Davis-Martin\u2019s nicely nasal burr and an unusually ardent embrace of retro-disco. \u201cUh Uh Uh Uh\u201d struts like no one told them the Bee Gees were out of style. Sadly, but inevitably, that obliviousness did not ensure them a long career; 2002\u2019s \u201cThe Way We Do\u201d was their only release.\n\nShareefa, \u201cNeed a Boss\u201d\n\nShareefa tried to walk the line between Mary J. Blige neo-soul and the new 2000s pop. She had her greatest success on \u201cNeed a Boss,\u201d where her vocals got run through Darkchild\u2019s echoey production, complete with bonus stuttering effects and Ludacris doing his thing with \u201cmore verses than the Bible.\u201d The lyric inveighing against \u201cfake thugs\u201d is nicely nonsensical; this isn\u2019t keeping it real by a long shot. But the ersatz sturm-und-drung keeps things from turning into neo-soul default emoting slog, and Shareefa has enough authority to make the result sound playfully-rather-than-haplessly-trying-to-be tough. \u201cHow Good Love Feels,\u201d also from her 2006 album \u201cPoint of No Return,\u201d is highly recommended as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Destiny's Child to Cassie to Mariah Carey, proof that nothing is better than R&B from the '00s VIDEO", "author": "Noah Berlatsky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Destiny's Child to Cassie to Mariah Carey, proof that nothing is better than R&B from the '00s VIDEO", "title": "Why 2000s R&B was the greatest music ever", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/24/why_2000s_rb_was_the_greatest_music_ever/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/destinys_child.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Destiny's Child to Cassie to Mariah Carey, proof that nothing is better than R&B from the '00s VIDEO", "creator": "@hoodedu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/destinys_child.jpg", "title": "Why 2000s R&B was the greatest music ever", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why 2000s R&B was the greatest music ever", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cassie, Destiny's child, kelly rowland, nelly furtado, R&B, shareefa, timabland, toya, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c2a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUh Uh Uh Uh\u201d struts like no one told them the Bee Gees were out of style.\nTopics: cassie, Destiny's child, kelly rowland, nelly furtado, R&B, shareefa, timabland, toya, Video, Entertainment NewsThere\u2019s not a ton of nostalgia for 2000s pop R&B.\nIsyss, \u201cUh Uh Uh Uh\u201dOne of many girl groups that tried to imitate Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s success, Isyss was distinguished by lead singers Quierra Davis-Martin\u2019s nicely nasal burr and an unusually ardent embrace of retro-disco.\nWhat critical enthusiasm the music generated tended to come from rank poptimists, who are now on to the next new sound.\nShareefa, \u201cNeed a Boss\u201dShareefa tried to walk the line between Mary J.
