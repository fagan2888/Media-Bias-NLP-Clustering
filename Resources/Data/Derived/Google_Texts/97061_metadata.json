Goal of the club in hosting the forum, she said, is to help inform voters.\n\nServing as moderator of the forum was Dan Corbin, former Killeen mayor and a CPA/ attorney.\n\nHe introduced the candidates for Senate District 24 who will be vying in the Republican primary. The winner will face Democrat candidate Jennie Lou Leeder in the November general election. State Senator Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay) is not running for re-election to the seat.\n\nIn making their brief opening statements, Dawn Buckingham of Lakeway said she desires to decrease the footprint of government and noted that \u201cObamacare\u201d healthcare legislation has been particularly onerous. Brent Mayes of Fredericksburg said he has had enough of \u201chope and change,\u201d and wants to fight for the rural interests of the district.\n\nReed Williams, who lives in Burnet County, said he is running because he is concerned about water and security issues, as well as public education. Ryan Downton of Salado termed himself an \u201cObamacare survivor.\u201d He said the federal legislation killed his first company. He is running to bring business experience to government.\n\nSusan King \u2013 who is a state representative from Abilene \u2013 said the military is a priority to her, and that she has hope for the outlook of Texas. And Jon Cobb of Bee Cave agreed Texas is in a good spot. He said he wants to make sure the state has good roads, water and schools.\n\nCandidates were given 30 seconds to respond about what makes them most qualified for the Texas Senate seat.\n\nMrs. Buckingham said she has long had a passion for education and believes \u201cGod\u2019s highest calling\u201d is educating students.\n\nMayes said he brings a wealth of life experiences to the race and described his lack of political history as \u201ca good thing.\u201d\n\nWilliams said as a former San Antonio City Council member, he went to the \u201cheart of the liberals and won\u201d against them. He believes the district needs somebody with experience fighting for its values.\n\nDownton, who served as general counsel for the Texas House during redistricting in 2012, said his experience defending the redistricting maps in court \u201cand beating Obama\u201d make him uniquely qualified.\n\nMrs. King cited her eight years on the Abilene school board and nursing background as important qualifications for the position.\n\nCobb, who said he was a product of a poor school district, said there is nothing government can do to improve education unless families get involved.\n\nCandidates then were asked to name their top two priorities if elected to office.\n\nMayes said protecting water interests and border security go together as his top priority, followed by education. \u201cWe must save it from Common Core, C-Scope, etc.\u201d he said of various controversial education programs.\n\nWilliams cited term limits as his top legislative objective. He said voters \u201ccan\u2019t get [bad] people out\u201d after they are elected. He also would seek to protect property rights, which he said includes both water rights and eminent domain rights.\n\nDownton said education and water are his top two issues. \u201cCommon Core is still in our schools,\u201d he said, despite some state regulations against it.\n\nMrs. King named military infrastructure and valuing veterans as her top priority. She also mentioned public education as a priority. \u201cWe must make kids workforce ready,\u201d she said.\n\nCobb said water rights are his top priority and said that goes along with border security. \u201cWe must build a wall on the border to protect Texas,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Buckingham said \u201cborder security is national security.\u201d She believes Texas should seal the borders and get rid of sanctuary cities. She added that governmentshouldbe\u201cgrassroots up,\u201d and she wants district voters to be in touch with her office.\n\nThe next question asked by the forum moderator related to the state budget. With the biennial budget based on oil selling for $63 per barrel, Corbin asked candidates to enumerate what they thought should be done to make up for the shortfall, given the drop in oil prices.\n\nWilliams, who noted that oil has fallen below $32 per barrel, said the state needs to cut back right now \u201con things we don\u2019t need.\u201d The situation won\u2019t get better and can\u2019t wait for a subsequent legislative session, he said.\n\nDownton said the state needs to move to zero-based budgeting and \u201cjustify every dollar,\u201d rather than to base the budget off previous spending levels. He also said Texas should get rid of obsolete state agencies.\n\nMrs. King said the state has a $9 billion Rainy Day Fund that can be utilized as an emergency cushion against declining revenues. And the state must \u201ckeep the budget tight,\u201d she added.\n\nCobb agreed the state probably would have to use some of what is set aside in the Rainy Day Fund, but Texas \u201cneeds to put a fear of losing their job in state employees\u201d as the state can\u2019t \u201cguarantee their employment forever.\u201d\n\nMrs. Buckingham said the answer is to reduce the size of government, while Mayes acknowledged that the Rainy Day Fund would have to be utilized because legislators \u201cwon\u2019t cut back\u201d on spending. \u201cWe need new folks there,\u201d he added.\n\nCandidates also were asked what they would do to strengthen education, and to comment on the role of public education, private schools, home schools and charter schools.\n\nDownton said the legislature must put some \u201cteeth\u201d into rules on Common Core and that the use of property taxes to support public education must be examined, as \u201cproperty taxes are too high.\u201d\n\nMrs. King acknowledged a need for home schools, private and public schools as well as charter schools, as \u201cno one type is best.\u201d But she believes public-funded vouchers to pay for education choice \u201chave lots of issues.\u201d\n\nCobb said Senate District 24 has good schools. He thinks there is a difference, however, between rural schools and urban schools. \u201cWe can\u2019t make kids attend failing schools,\u201d he said. Cobb also does not think state money should go toward home schooling.\n\nMrs. Buckingham said some students are forced to attend schools that are crumbling. Texas needs to \u201c empower parents\u201d to make education choices, she said.\n\nMayes reiterated his opposition to the infiltration of federal Common Core standards into Texas classrooms and said the \u201clegislature has given up on it.\u201d Parents should have the right to home school their students, he said.\n\nWilliams said the state needs to return authority to the local level and give school districts the power to make their own decisions.\n\nThe Republican state senatorial candidates all seemed to agree that border security is a problem in Texas and that the federal government is not doing enough to protect citizens.\n\nMrs. King said putting Border Patrol agents on the border is not enough, that Texas needs cooperation from the federal government.\n\nCobb said it is time for Texas to do something about a wall and that the state \u201cneeds men there\u201d on the ground to secure the border.\n\nMrs. Buckingham said \u201ca wall doesn\u2019t really stop them.\u201d The use of National Guard is crucial, she added.\n\nMayes and Downton both said the E-verify system should be made mandatory, and that the state should eliminate sanctuary cities. Mayes added that Texas should revoke in-state tuition for students who are here illegally.\n\nWilliams quipped that the way to handle border security is to elect a Republican president. He also said the use of technology is critical, as reliance on \u201chighway patrolmen is not working.\u201d\n\nCandidates finished their portion of the forum with brief closing statements for the audience.\n\nEarly voting begins Feb. 16 and runs through Feb. 26. The primary election is set for March 1.\n\n***\n\nThe forum also included Republican candidates for the Texas House District 54 seat, held by Jimmie Don Aycock (R-Killeen) who is not running for re-election; the Precinct 1 Lampasas County commissioner post held by Robert Vincent, who is not seeking re-election; and the Precinct 2&3 constable race.\n\nA story featuring the candidates\u2019 responses on issues pertinent to those elected positions will run in an upcoming edition of the Dispatch Record.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Lampasas Dispatch Record", "description": "The Lampasas County Republican Club hosted a candidate forum Monday night for contested races in the March 1 GOP primary.\nMarcia Wallace, president of the Republican Club, called the meeting to order with a standing room only crowd gathered at the Lampasas County Office Building conference room.
