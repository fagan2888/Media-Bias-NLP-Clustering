During his first press conference since exiting the 2016 race for the White House yesterday, Texas Senator Ted Cruz ruled out a run as a third party candidate Tuesday.

Earlier today, Cruz told a local radio show he is open to jumping back into the presidential race as a Republican candidate should a path to victory emerge while admitting the scenario was highly unlikely and that a loss in Nebraska tonight is inevitable. Many of his delegates remain bound ahead of the RNC Convention in July. It has been reported Cruz has an interest in shaping the Party platform.

Even with Cruz out of the running, a third party option is still on the table for disenfranchised conservatives and Republicans.
