Whether you opened your Christmas presents tonight or are waiting until tomorrow morning, recycling companies are asking you to give them a gift.

Each year at this time, they get lots of questions about what kind of wrapping paper is recyclable and what's not.

For some of us, a lot of thought goes into wrapping a Christmas present, but we sometimes don't think about how to correctly dispose of the wrapping paper after the gifts are opened.

"People actually generate about 25 percent more waste than they do any other time during the year, so we do see a lot," Marissa Gundrson of Millennium Recycling said.

Millennium Recycling in Sioux Falls recycles about 50,000 tons of waste per year. While you may think all of your wrapping paper is recyclable, it's not.

"People get confused about wrapping paper," Gunderson said.

To clear up the confusion, Gunderson says plain wrapping paper is fine; it's the fancy paper that makes it a recycling reject.

"So what we try to say is stay away from foil, or ribbons and glitter, a lot of wrapping paper has glitter," Gunderson said.

Another thing people don't think about is tape, they say a little tape on wrapping paper is fine, but they're asking you to remove as much of it as possible.

They also can't recycle Christmas bows, wreaths, ornaments or decorations. So in this season of giving, they're asking *you to give your trash a little thought before tossing it out.

"Anything that comes in that's not suppose to be on the line, we have to manually pick out, so anything people can leave out of the recycling bin, that really helps us out to make sure we are recycling correctly," Gunderson said.

One other note, old Christmas lights and electronics need to be dropped off at the city's Household Hazardous Material drop off site on North Cliff Avenue.
