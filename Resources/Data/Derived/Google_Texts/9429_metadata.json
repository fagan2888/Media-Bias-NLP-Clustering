Yet their status is uneasy after the killing of two Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIn Hebron, a sniper shot and killed a soldier in front of the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque, resulting in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s announcement to allow settlers to occupy another home in the city\u2019s renowned holy site.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAdditionally, five Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military forces since the start of the latest talks, one of whom was a U.N. employee.\n\nIt appears that neither the U.S. nor Israel expects any concrete results from the ongoing negotiations, which just months ago were praised by supporters for being the first in three years.\n\nOn top of that, Palestinian negotiators have repeatedly expressed pessimism. \u201cIsrael has not proposed anything so far, over a month and a half since peace talks have been resumed,\u201d senior Fatah official Nabil Shaath told Ma\u2019an News Agency earlier this month.\n\nAmong the issues that Israel has thus far refused to bend on are the exclusively Jewish character of the state of Israel and military control over the Jordan Valley region of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, considered vital to security.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli side does not recognize any of the agreements signed previously including Oslo and the Road Map plan which the Palestinian side has fully implemented,\u201d Shaath explained.\n\nYet despite its own misgivings towards the ongoing negotiations, the Palestinian government has simultaneously sought to crush dissent by executing a series of attacks and arrests across the West Bank.\n\n\u201cThis is how the Palestinian Authority deals with the opposition,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, director of independent human rights monitor Al-Haq. \u201cThey don\u2019t deal with politics in a very sophisticated way \u2026 because they know very well they cannot deliver any results to the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cA policy of violence\u201d\n\n37-year-old Ajmad Odeh was shot and killed by PA police forces on Wednesday, Aug. 27. Palestinian officials described the scene as \u201can exchange of fire between the security forces and a wanted man in Askar refugee camp,\u201d Ma\u2019an News Agency reported.\n\nAn independent investigation conducted by Al-Haq found that the \u201cwanted man\u201d was to be arrested \u201cfor allegedly distributing a statement criticizing the Palestinian Authority\u2019s decision to resume negotiations with Israel.\u201d\n\nThe report called on \u201cthe Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian Attorney General and security officers to abide by their obligation to conduct immediate, transparent and impartial investigations into this arrest operation.\u201d\n\nThe likelihood of the PA opening an investigation into its own abuses is slim.\n\nLess than a week later, on Sept. 2, PA police launched an arrest campaign in al-Fara refugee camp near Tubas, situated in the northwest region of the West Bank. According to Ma\u2019an, two people were injured and five more arrested after \u201cunknown gunmen opened fire at PA forces \u2026 as they raided the al-Fara refugee camp to make an arrest.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why the PA has amped up its attacks on Palestinian citizens, Al-Haq\u2019s Jabarin explained that \u201cthere is no accountability in the government or the security forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a policy of violence,\u201d he added. \u201cThat makes it easy for them to shoot on the people. If there were any political will to stop these violations, they would say clearly that anyone who shoots on people will be removed [from the security forces].\u201d\n\nWhen protesters assembled in Ramallah to denounce the negotiations in late July, PA forces beat and arrested several. \u201cThe police beat protesters and then arrested injured people, some even from the hospital,\u201d said Tom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe Palestinian Authority needs to make clear to the police that this is no way to handle a demonstration.\u201d\n\nIn January, three residents of Ramallah\u2019s al-Am\u2019ari refugee camp were hospitalized when PA police opened fire on a demonstration in solidarity with Palestinian political prisoners.\n\n\u201cThe way they attacked the camp \u2014 surrounding all of the entries and coming from behind the \u2026 school, blocking the exit. It felt just like when the Israelis attack us, putting us in a collective torture chamber,\u201d Ehab el-Shafie, a 21-year-old resident of al-Am\u2019ari, said in an interview with Mint Press News.\n\nAccusations of human rights violations are nothing new for the PA. Similar attacks on unarmed protesters occurred outside the presidential compound in Ramallah during the summer of 2012 as well.\n\nA 2008 report issued by Al-Haq found \u201crampant torture\u201d in PA prisons \u2014 the victims were generally Hamas affiliates or people originally from Gaza. The report detailed \u201can increase in psychological torture, an increase in arbitrary arrests, and arrests and detention carried out in violation of the Palestinian Basic Law and penal procedural laws.\u201d\n\nPA security forces and civilian police are trained by the U.S. and the European Union, as well as private security firms.\n\n\u201cLayers of occupation\u201d\n\nArguing that the two-state solution is presently unfeasible, Jabarin explained:\n\n\u201cThe PA has built its strategy on nothing. They continue to move in the same circular framework of the Oslo Accords, and they do not even approach the actual details. The best that Palestinian negotiators hope for is a situation in which they aren\u2019t the ones blamed by the Americans for the collapse of negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe historic negotiations between Israeli and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the mid-1990s, the Oslo Accords, led to the Declaration of Principles, which included the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO. As a result, the PA was established in 1994 and a negotiating process began.\n\nIsrael was meant to withdrawal throughout a five-year period from the Gaza Strip, Jericho and other unspecified parts of the Palestinian territories that it occupied during the June 1967 War. Only in 2005 were the settlers in the Gaza Strip evacuated. Eventually in November 2012, the United Nations General Assembly voiced a landslide approval by voting to recognize an independent Palestinian observer state in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.\n\nYet as this month marks the 20th anniversary of Oslo, Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is stronger than ever. According to the Israeli human rights organization B\u2019Tselem, over 515,000 settlers live in over 125 settlements spread across the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In the period since the agreements, over 12,000 Palestinian homes have been demolished by Israeli forces.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, belief in a viable two-state solution has plummeted. A July 2013 survey administered by the Hebrew University found that 51 percent of Israelis believe settlements have rendered such an outcome impossible, and 58 percent of Palestinians think it\u2019s \u201cno longer viable.\u201d Negotiations are largely seen as a smokescreen for Israel\u2019s efforts to expand settlements and further entrench its military presence.\n\n\u201cAsk the Palestinian people and they\u2019ll tell you that negotiations will lead to nothing,\u201d Jabarin explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Palestinians are necessarily against negotiations, but they\u2019re against these negotiations that never produce results. They have serious doubts and believe that the [Palestinian] Authority is incapable of negotiating and gaining anything.\u201d\n\nFatah, the ruling party in the West Bank, is the only major party to officially support negotiations, with most officially denouncing them. \u201cAll major political factions, with the exception of Fatah, have rallied against a return to negotiations,\u201d according to a recent Ma\u2019an report.\n\nOn Wednesday September 7, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) organized a 1000-strong march to the presidential compound. \u201cWe are against negotiations because they do not serve the interests of the Palestinian people,\u201d Abdulrahim Malouh, the leader of the PFLP, told Palestinian media.\n\nThough there were no clashes, PA police forces saturated the streets and watched closely.\n\nIn the besieged Gaza Strip, hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad supporters recently protested negotiations. \u201cAll the Palestinian factions say you don\u2019t have the right to relinquish any piece of our land, or to give up Palestinian rights,\u201d Ismail Ridwan, Hamas\u2019s religious affairs minister, publicly addressed PA president Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nAbbas has come under fire several times for ostensibly renouncing the right of return for Palestinian refugees.\n\nSome $500 million in aid from the U.S. government was released to the PA in March, and the Obama administration cleared another $148 million in late August. Jabarin concluded that as long as the money keeps pouring in, there will be no change in either the PA\u2019s policy of negotiations or its use of violence to crush dissent.\n\n\u201cBecause the political will doesn\u2019t exist, anytime there are problems or people protest against them, they will attack and shoot, they will injure and kill,\u201d Jabarin concluded.\n\nEl-Shafie concluded by describing the present situation living under the PA: \u201cHere we have layers of colonialism and occupation \u2014 the Palestinian government is just another layer because it is an Israeli client.\u201d\n\nPatrick O.
