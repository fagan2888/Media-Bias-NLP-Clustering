Federal jurors deliberating the fate of six members of an elite Philadelphia narcotics squad said Tuesday that they were at "an impasse on one or more counts."

The six-man, six-woman panel alerted U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno to their stalemate in a note just after 2:30 p.m. - about 20 hours into their discussions. The judge sent them back to the jury room with instructions to keep trying to reach a unanimous verdict.

"Although it may seem like an eternity, it has only been three and a half days of deliberations," Robreno told them.

The jury ended their deliberations for the day less than two hours later without a verdict. They are due back for more discussion Wednesday morning.

Officers Thomas Liciardello, Brian Reynolds, Michael Spicer, Perry Betts, Linwood Norman and John Speiser each face charges of racketeering conspiracy, civil rights violations, robbery and filing false reports.

Prosecutors say the officers - all members of the Police Department's Narcotics Field Unit - routinely roughed up drug suspects, pocketed seized money and lied on official police reports to cover up their crimes.

The officers have denied the charges.
