After decades heading an internal medicine practice, working at a charity clinic is a big change for Stuber. But it\u2019s not the only post-retirement shift for a doctor who voted Republican for most of his 75 years.\n\n\u201cI switched to the Democrat party six years ago when the Tea Party wackos made themselves known by acting so rudely in the town hall meetings when the Affordable Care Act first came out,\u201d Stuber says. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018If that\u2019s what being a Republican is, then I guess I\u2019m not a Republican.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince then, Stuber has made a reputation for himself in St. Joe, writing editorials and advocating on behalf of the poor, focusing particularly on raising the minimum wage. He decided to take the plunge and run for office this year out of frustration with the incumbent state senator, Dr. Rob Schaaf.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done some things I thought were very inappropriate and downright irresponsible,\u201d Stuber says.\n\nSchaaf, 57, got his start in Jefferson City 12 years ago as a state representative and was elected to the state senate in 2010. He says he\u2019s for \u201cfree-market change\u201d of health care by increasing price transparency and reducing government involvement. Schaaf says that he, too, got into politics out of frustration.\n\n\u201cI was having trouble dealing with Medicaid and insurance plans to get my patients the care they needed,\u201d he says.\n\nMany of the positions taken by Schaaf have troubled advocates of health reform, including Stuber. At the top of Stuber\u2019s list is the senator\u2019s resistance to creating a prescription drug monitoring program in Missouri, which pharmacists and law enforcement officials say is needed to curb drug abuse.\n\n\u201cI opposed the prescription drug monitoring program because it takes away our liberty,\u201d Schaaf says. \u201cAnd specifically our right to privacy of our medical information.\u201d\n\nSchaaf garnered national media attention for his stance, leaving Missouri as the only state that doesn\u2019t monitor narcotics. It\u2019s a position his challenger calls \u201carrogant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he set himself up as being superior in knowledge than all the other legislators in all the other 49 states who do have a central drug registry for narcotic medications,\u201d Stuber says.\n\nThe two physicians likewise stake out different positions on Medicaid expansion, part of the Affordable Care Act. Schaaf staunchly opposes the act, going so far as to quit the American Medical Association in 2009 when the organization came out in favor of the health reform law.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion would grow our state budget by hundreds of millions of dollars over the next five years,\u201d Schaaf says.\n\nStuber cites several studies that refute that argument, including one by the University of Missouri stating that expansion would give a major economic boost to the state, creating tens of thousands of jobs and increasing tax revenue. Stuber says he\u2019s suspicious of his opponent\u2019s hostility to expansion.\n\n\u201cBy and large, the Missouri state legislators, as well as many of the people in St. Joe., especially the Tea Party ilk, are resisting Medicaid expansion purely on ideological and political reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want this black president to fail, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\n\nBesides Schaaf and Stuber, no fewer than five other doctors will be on Missouri\u2019s General Assembly ballot in November. That\u2019s music to the ears of Jeff Howell, general counsel of the Missouri State Medical Association, which, along with the American Medical Association, would like to see even more physicians run for office.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very knowledgeable, as you can imagine,\u201d Howell says. \u201cThey have a skill set that not many other professionals have. They\u2019re very educated, and they\u2019re very smart. And they\u2019re underrepresented in state government, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nLike Stuber, the Missouri State Medical Association favors Medicaid expansion, but it\u2019s endorsing Schaaf. The association explains that Schaaf is a former board member who\u2019s had the association\u2019s support for all 12 of his years in office.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t see any reason to change tracks. You want to support the guys who have supported you, and that\u2019s what Dr. Schaaf is to us,\u201d Howell says.\n\nAt least one observer at the intersection of medicine and politics urges caution when it comes to endorsing doctors. Dr. Bob St. Peter, a pediatrician who heads the Kansas Health Institute in Topeka, a nonpartisan health policy and research organization, says many physicians have been drawn into politics because of their experience with health reform. But that experience doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a thoroughgoing understanding of the issues, he says.\n\n\u201cSomebody can be motivated or driven by their own personal experiences to a degree that overgeneralizes their particular experiences and maybe tries to apply that in ways that aren\u2019t necessarily broadly applicable,\u201d St. Peter says.\n\nSt. Peter says he understands the appeal physician-politicians might hold out as knowledgeable and authoritative leaders. But he says they still warrant careful scrutiny by voters.\n\n\u201cI think that people should kick the tires really well and check out a candidate more broadly and not just assume they\u2019ll be a good candidate because they\u2019re a good doctor,\u201d St. Peter says.\n\nVoters in Missouri\u2019s 34th District, which runs along the state line from St Joseph to Riverside, still have a week and a half to kick the tires of Dr. Schaaf and Dr. Stuber before sending one of them to Jefferson City on Nov. 4.\n\nWhoever\u2019s elected is likely to drive the health care conversation.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics/Elections", "description": "Sunrise is just starting to break over the skies of St. Joseph, but Dr. Bob Stuber is busy under fluorescent lights, examining a patient inside the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/missouri-s-state-senate-race-pits-doctor-versus-doctor", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201410/Stuber.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Sunrise is just starting to break over the skies of St. Joseph, but Dr. Bob Stuber is busy under fluorescent lights, examining a patient inside the", "title": "Missouri\u2019s State Senate Race Pits Doctor Versus Doctor"}, "story_id": 358245582, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Alex Smith", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Missouri\u2019s State Senate Race Pits Doctor Versus Doctor"}, "nid": 63667, "datePublished": "2014-10-23", "keywords": "Rob Schaaf, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 1033, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17d0\"", "article_summary": "You want to support the guys who have supported you, and that\u2019s what Dr. Schaaf is to us,\u201d Howell says.\nHe says he\u2019s for \u201cfree-market change\u201d of health care by increasing price transparency and reducing government involvement.\nAnd they\u2019re underrepresented in state government, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201dLike Stuber, the Missouri State Medical Association favors Medicaid expansion, but it\u2019s endorsing Schaaf.\nThat\u2019s music to the ears of Jeff Howell, general counsel of the Missouri State Medical Association, which, along with the American Medical Association, would like to see even more physicians run for office.\n\u201cBy and large, the Missouri state legislators, as well as many of the people in St."}
