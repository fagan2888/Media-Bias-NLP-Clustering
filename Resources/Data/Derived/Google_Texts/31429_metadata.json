But unless you went to an Eastern medicine doctor, you weren't going to hear about it from your MD. Then, along with the 21st century came a string of studies pointing to ginger's potential to combat nausea related to motion sickness, chemotherapy and pregnancy. \"Once the science was there, more doctors were willing to 'prescribe' it,\" says Patricia Raymond, MD, assistant professor of clinical internal medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Va. Try candied ginger, ginger tea or even ginger cookies the next time that you're feeling queasy. Scary Symptoms You Can Relax About\n\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By BenGay This pain-easing ointment was always a favorite with athletes but not so much with the average exerciser, mostly because of the medicinal scent. \"When I smell menthol, I'm like, 'Ugh,'\" says Renee Acosta, clinical associate professor of health outcomes and pharmacy practice at the University of Texas, Austin. \"You don't want to smell like that at work.\" Today, though, medical pros are touting BenGay even to weekend warriors, especially now that it comes in scentless and patch versions. \"People are trying to stay active longer, and we want to give them all their options,\" Acosta says.\n\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Prunes Back in the day, the answer to irregularity was prunes, possibly administered from your grandmother's stash and definitely embarrassing. That changed when, in 2000, the decidedly unsexy-sounding fruit was rebranded as \"dried plums.\" \"They became an easier sell,\" Dr. Raymond says, partly due to a growing interest in digestive health and food cures. Recent science has confirmed prunes' benefits: A 2011 study found that eating 12 a day relieves constipation better than the trendier psyllium supplements.\n\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Pepto-Bismol Pepto was originally invented to treat infants before it became the ultimate upset-stomach cure for adults. In recent years, however, studies have shown that it works particularly well to treat traveler's diarrhea\u2014and even to prevent it if taken before a trip. 14 Best and Worst Foods for Digestion\n\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Salt-water gargle This headache pill was elbowed out by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Advil. Then the Food and Drug Administration approved Excedrin as the first over-the-counter medicine for migraine symptoms, and it was newly marketed as Excedrin Migraine. \"That swayed doctors and pharmacists to look at it again,\" Acosta says.\n\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Petroleum jelly Back in the 1800s, Vaseline was a popular remedy for skin complaints. Though it fell out of vogue in favor of newfangled creams, doctors have a surprising modern-day use for it: applying it to wounds after surgery. \"Some patients have allergic reactions to antibiotic ointments, and petroleum jelly works just as well in the absence of infection,\" says Stephen Stone, MD, professor of dermatology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in Springfield, Ill. You can use it on minor cuts, too.\n\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Adhesive bandages Speaking of cuts, the pretty recent common wisdom was that they'd heal better if you exposed them to air. \"Turns out, we were right decades ago when we said to use adhesive bandages,\" Dr. Stone says. They help maintain a moist environment for faster healing.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "8 Old-Time Cures Doctors Swear By", "description": "Consider these golden oldies the next time you're feeling under the weather.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Consider these golden oldies the next time you're feeling under the weather.", "title": "8 Old-Time Cures Doctors Swear By", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/time-cures-doctors-swear/story?id=22521006", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/GTY_ginger_kab_140214_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2014-02-16", "twitter": {"description": "Consider these golden oldies the next time you're feeling under the weather.", "title": "8 Old-Time Cures Doctors Swear By", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/time-cures-doctors-swear/story?id=22521006", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,22521006", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,22521006", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/time-cures-doctors-swear/story?id=22521006"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "site": "@ABC", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/GTY_ginger_kab_140214_4x3t_240.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-16", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,22521006", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/time-cures-doctors-swear/story?id=22521006"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/time-cures-doctors-swear/story?id=22521006", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,22521006", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2014-02-16 06:54:29", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "cold remedies, flu remedies, cold flu, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, flu treatment, cold treatment, flu prevention, health news, medical news, medical articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "cold remedies, flu remedies, cold flu, cold symptoms, flu symptoms, flu treatment, cold treatment, flu prevention"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9ff\"", "article_summary": "Old-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Petroleum jelly Back in the 1800s, Vaseline was a popular remedy for skin complaints.\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Pepto-Bismol Pepto was originally invented to treat infants before it became the ultimate upset-stomach cure for adults.\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Ginger For thousands of years, this spice was used to knock out nausea.\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Prunes Back in the day, the answer to irregularity was prunes, possibly administered from your grandmother's stash and definitely embarrassing.\nOld-Time Cures Doctors Swear By Adhesive bandages Speaking of cuts, the pretty recent common wisdom was that they'd heal better if you exposed them to air."}
