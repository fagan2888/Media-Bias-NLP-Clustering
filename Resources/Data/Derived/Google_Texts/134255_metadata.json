Marsha Farney (R-Georgetown) said her bill \u201cwill ensure that insurance plans offered in Texas under the health benefit exchange would not cover elective abortions.\u201d\n\nOpponents, however, argued that Farney\u2019s House Bill 3130 would create yet another hurdle for women.\n\nHB 3130 \u201cis effectively a ban on abortion for anyone purchasing insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchange,\u201d said Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. \u201cIf you ban insurance coverage for abortion from the exchange, a pregnant person may not be able to access a licensed, quality health provider in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allows states to enact policies that specifically ban abortion coverage in health plans offered through the health insurance exchange. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a national research organization that tracks abortion and reproductive health policies, 25 states already prohibit abortion coverage in their exchanges. Some policies, including the Texas legislation considered by the House committee, include an exemption for life-endangering situations and when a \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Jessica Farrar (D-Houston) took issue with the bill\u2019s lack of exceptions for cases of rape, incest, fetal anomalies and ectopic pregnancies. Under Farney\u2019s plan, if a woman purchasing insurance in the exchange wants abortion coverage, she would be required to buy a supplemental plan, a provision that also concerned Farrar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the purpose of the bill, and I understand that you have a philosophical purpose, but I\u2019m just being pragmatic,\u201d Farrar told Farney during many exchanges between the two during the hearing. \u201cNo one anticipates having to have an abortion. \u2026 Unsuspecting women are not going to know to get that extra policy.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the bill, including Texas Alliance for Life, Texans for Life Coalition and the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops, argued that allowing insurers to include abortion coverage in the exchange\u2019s health plans is equivalent to taxpayer-subsidized abortions.\n\n\u201cIt forces taxpayers to contribute to ending unborn life,\u201d said Jennifer Allmon with the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops. \u201cThis bill protects the conscience of individuals who do not wish to contribute to premiums that cover abortion.\u201d\n\nFarrar pointed out multiples times during the discussion that the federal health law already addresses this concern. According to health care research group Kaiser Family Foundation, the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies that offer abortion coverage to \u201csegregate funds, assuring that no federal funds are used for abortion coverage.\u201d Allmon said clarity is needed on the separation of funds.\n\nAbortion rights organizations nationwide argue that bans on insurance coverage for abortion disproportionately affect poor women, who are five times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy. Poor women on Medicaid must pay out-of-pocket for their abortions. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which bars the public health insurance program from covering abortion. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that one in four women on Medicaid who want an abortion can\u2019t get one.\n\nAmanda Jean Stevenson, researcher with the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Texas Policy Evaluation Project, told the committee that a study her group conducted in 2013 found that 40 percent of women seeking abortions in Texas live at or below the federal poverty line, and women purchasing insurance in the health insurance exchange have lower median income than the rest of the population. Stevenson warned that Farney\u2019s ban may force women to wait to have their abortions until later in their pregnancies, or keep them from getting the procedure at all.\n\nDiscussion of Farney\u2019s bill Wednesday night also illuminated a divide between Texas Right to Life and Texas Alliance for Life, two major statewide pro-life groups. Texas Alliance for Life backs Farney\u2019s legislation. John Seago with Texas Right to Life, however, told the committee that he agrees with the goal of the bill, but suggested it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cThis bill only provides protections for those who do end up going to (the Affordable Care Act exchange)\u201d for insurance plans, Seago said. \u201cOur position is we need to cover the rest of the market.\u201d\n\nTexas Right to Life is supporting another bill by state Rep. John Smithee (R-Amarillo), but it hasn\u2019t been scheduled for a hearing.\n\nThe committee left Farney\u2019s proposal pending, though she told committee members to expect another version of the bill soon. She also said she\u2019d be willing to consider expanding the ban to include all private insurance plans offered in Texas, as well as language that includes exceptions for rape, incest and ectopic pregnancies.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The bill would ban coverage for abortion procedures in private insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Observer", "description": "The bill would ban coverage for abortion procedures in private insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "title": "Lege Considers Ban on Abortion Coverage in Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 483, "identifier": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Marsha-Farney-FB.jpg", "height": 604}, "updated_time": "2015-08-21T03:09:05-05:00", "url": "https://www.texasobserver.org/committee-considers-ban-on-abortion-coverage-in-obamacare-health-plans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The bill would ban coverage for abortion procedures in private insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchange.", "creator": "@agarciaditta", "image": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Marsha-Farney-FB.jpg", "title": "Lege Considers Ban on Abortion Coverage in Obamacare", "site": "@TexasObserver", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417283609", "fb": {"pages": 21002115613, "app_id": 902538479865047}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver", "published_time": "2015-04-09T10:32:07-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver", "section": "Blogs", "modified_time": "2015-08-21T03:09:05-05:00", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "private insurance, abortion, Obamacare, Texas Legislature, exchanges"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you ban insurance coverage for abortion from the exchange, a pregnant person may not be able to access a licensed, quality health provider in a timely manner.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act allows states to enact policies that specifically ban abortion coverage in health plans offered through the health insurance exchange.\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, a national research organization that tracks abortion and reproductive health policies, 25 states already prohibit abortion coverage in their exchanges.\nThe House State Affairs Committee considered a bill late Wednesday night that would ban coverage for abortion in health plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nAbortion rights organizations nationwide argue that bans on insurance coverage for abortion disproportionately affect poor women, who are five times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy.\nIn 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which bars the public health insurance program from covering abortion."}
