There was approval and there was disagreement in generally thoughtful prose. A number of viewpoints were expressed, rationally.\n\nBut it\u2019s also campaign season. And on the stump, with a chance to look presidential, some of the candidates came across as something, well, lacking -- at least to a number of Times readers.\n\n--Sara Lessley, Letters to the Editor department\n\nLorraine Knopf in Santa Monica observed:\n\nAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on same-sex marriage, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called for a constitutional amendment to allow voters to remove Supreme Court justices from office through \u201cperiodic judicial retention election.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be ironic if that went through, and the voters removed justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito?\n\nIn Encino, Stan Gordon was puzzled:\n\nI am having difficulty following the logic of Mike Huckabee and his ilk.\n\nAs Huckabee said recently: \"This case wasn't so much about a matter of marriage equality, it was marriage redefinition. And I think people have to say, 'If you're going to have a new celebration that we're not going to discriminate [against], may I ask, are we going to now discriminate against people of conscience, people of faith who may disagree with this ruling?'\"\n\nSo because others choose not to follow the dictates of Huckabee's belief system, their difference of theology is an attack on the governor's faith and he is being denied his own religious freedom. Huh?\n\nI also find it bizarre that they use the term \u201cconservative\u201d when they spend so much effort regulating other people's business.\n\nStephen Hogg in Simi Valley sent a wry prediction:\n\nI read that several of the Republican hopefuls are pledging to defy the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage.\n\nI expect that Mississippi will impose a 72- hour waiting period; Wisconsin will require an ultrasound; and Texas will require all ceremonies be at a hospital.\n\nLarry Selwitz in Newport Beach observed:\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage, Bobby Jindal, as well as many other conservatives, lost no time in responding that \u201cmarriage between a man and a woman was established by God and no earthly court can alter that.\u201d\n\nSomehow, Gov. Jindal failed to recognize the irony that an all-powerful God can change his mind if he so pleases -- as he did last week by decreeing that the Court should rule in favor of gay marriage.\n\nReacting to Donald Trump's recent comments about immigration, John T. Chiu in Newport Beach counseled patience:\n\nThe brouhaha over Donald Trump's comments on illegal immigrants from Mexico will do no more or less damage to the GOP than what Leland Yee and some of his errant Democrats in the state Senate have inflicted on the Democratic party.\n\nOver the years, many have regarded Trump as nothing more than an attention-getter and rarely taken him seriously. On the other hand, his demand on collecting data on crimes committed by illegal immigrants should not be ignored simply because this would violate \u201cPolitical Correctness.\u201d A well-done study on this subject will either confirm or debunk such assertions.\n\nTrump should be seen as a modern-day court jester, who does, however, sometimes utter the unpalatable truth.\n\nIn San Bernardino, Thomas McGovern is waiting \u2026:\n\nTrump is offering the GOP presidential candidates an opportunity to demonstrate leadership. At this point, they have all failed.\n\nBeing president requires a lot of tough decisions.\n\nDucking such an easy call on Trump's racist rant shows that none of them have what it takes.\n\nDan Aaron in Fountain Valley commented:\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s recent pronouncements have made it clear that the largest state in the country is Trump's ego.\n\nAnd in Newbury Park, Matt Singerman is watching...:\n\nWhy should we be surprised about Trump's recent hateful statements about Latino immigrants? It certainly wasn't his first foray into hate speech. It wasn't that long ago that Trump was an ardent supporter of the \"birthers,\" in demanding that President Obama's produce his birth certificate.\n\nUnless the GOP is more forceful in denouncing Trump, he could turn out to be the biggest land mine stepped on by the Republican party since the Watergate break-in.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Don't forget about the candidates; 2016 is coming on fast", "Description": "Los Angeles Times, letters to the editor, same-sex marriage, 2016 elections", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The last few weeks have seen momentous decisions in America \u2013 especially the Supreme Court 's decisions on same-sex marriage and Obamacare.", "title": "Don't forget about the candidates; 2016 is coming on fast", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-le-0706-readers-react-20150706-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-559ac87f/turbine/la-le-0706-readers-react-20150706", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83936594", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-06", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Dan Aaron in Fountain Valley commented:Donald Trump\u2019s recent pronouncements have made it clear that the largest state in the country is Trump's ego.\nThe last few weeks have seen momentous decisions in America \u2013 especially the Supreme Court's decisions on same-sex marriage and Obamacare.\nAnd in Newbury Park, Matt Singerman is watching...:Why should we be surprised about Trump's recent hateful statements about Latino immigrants?\nStephen Hogg in Simi Valley sent a wry prediction:I read that several of the Republican hopefuls are pledging to defy the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage.\nIn San Bernardino, Thomas McGovern is waiting \u2026:Trump is offering the GOP presidential candidates an opportunity to demonstrate leadership."}
