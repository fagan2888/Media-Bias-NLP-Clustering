Her abdomen hung almost a half-foot below her waist; so much so that she tucked napkins into her excessive skin folds to avoid infection. Health insurance would cover some of the costs, but Keenan needed much more than a tummy tuck.\n\nThe California resident\u2019s decision to bypass Palo Alto Medical Foundation and take the last of the money she inherited from her father to travel to Mexico for cosmetic surgery continues to turn a few heads in more ways than her newly transformed shape.\n\n\u201cI paid $16,000, and that includes 10 days in a private recovery hospital,\u201d said Keenan, who shared the news about her medical tourism surgery at Cosmed, in Tijuana, with the Santa Cruz Sentinel. \u201cIt would have cost me $45,000 or $50,000 at PAMF and I would have had to go home the next day.\u201d\n\nCertainly, some Americans \u2013 especially the uninsured or those with limited coverage \u2014 have been exposed to medical tourism and taken advantage of the bargain prices often discovered abroad for elective procedures and treatments. Considering Lowe\u2019s allows employees and dependents from across the United States access to Cleveland Clinic, where they receive domestic medical tourism procedures; and Walmart contracts for healthcare coverage with \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d across the country that perform heart, spine and transplant surgeries, medical tourism \u2013 at least on the domestic front \u2013 is as American as apple pie.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has enabled some Americans to purchase health insurance for the first time, but providing fair-priced employee benefits remains a challenging prospect for U.S. employers,\u201d said Jonathan Edelheit, CEO of the Medical Tourism Association\u00ae. \u201cEven though the increased cost for insurance has been shifted on the shoulders of working Americans, U.S. employers are beginning to identify self-funding strategies \u2013 like medical tourism \u2014 that reconcile healthcare offerings with financial goals of the business \u2013 attracting and retaining healthy employees while maintaining the bottom line.\u201d\n\nU.S. employers and the insurers that provide benefit plans to them are turning to medical tourism strategies to confront challenges from Obamacare.\n\nBut, not until recently \u2014 in part due to cost challenges stemming from the Affordable Care Act \u2014 have insurance companies devoted to American healthcare consumers begun to catch on to medical tourism.\n\nEven though healthcare spending for American consumers dropped in May 2014 \u2014 the first time in almost four decades \u2014 Obamacare hasn\u2019t necessarily lowered costs for U.S. employers and the insurers that provide benefit plans to them, many of whom don\u2019t predict the inflationary dip to continue very long anyway.\n\nIn the meantime, some insurance companies have cut staff, tightened salaries or shifted the way in which they design healthcare benefit plans. UnitedHealth Group, WellPoint and Humana are examining cross-border plans aimed exclusively at reducing expenses by encouraging U.S. patients to seek medical tourism procedures abroad. Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina already offers access to overseas procedures through a subsidiary, Companion Global Healthcare, Inc., which has medical tourism contracts with hospitals in Singapore, Thailand, Ireland, Turkey, and Costa Rica.\n\nA few years ago, Aetna beat most everyone to the game by introducing a benefits plan that allows for members and their eligible dependents to access healthcare in the Mexican cities of Mexicali, Tecate, and Tijuana. Dubbed Vitalidad Plus, the benefit option offers 100 percent coverage for qualified preventative care including immunizations and child and adult wellness exams.\n\nAetna has introduced a medical tourism option that allows for members and their eligible dependents to cross the border for healthcare in the Mexican cities of Mexicali, Tecate, and Tijuana.\n\nExpect cost to continue to drive healthcare, putting patients at the wheel to find alternatives abroad that compensate for the elevated high deductible plans that more businesses intend to offer employees \u2013 23 percent according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.\n\nWhile it won\u2019t take much for Americans to jump at the chance to save on insurance premiums and reduce their out-of-pocket costs \u2013 certainly lower wage earners \u2014 insurers can move beyond price to add incentives by contracting with only the best accredited international providers.\n\nMediExcel, a small startup H.M.O, offers member Southern California employers access to routine doctor visits on a 24/7 basis. The Mexican-based company, licensed by California regulators to offer group healthcare coverage to U.S. employers in the San Diego area, enables Cesar Flores, a 40 year-old retail chain employee, to cross the border by car to Tijuana and undergo lab tests at a local hospital. By 7 a.m., after blood has been drawn \u2013 a routine follow-up to a kidney stone procedure \u2014 Flores is in his car, where he will soon be at his home in Chula Vista by 10 a.m.\n\nFor patients shopping for cross-border or cross-country healthcare, pursuing quality and understanding the costs involved can be an arduous task. If nothing else except for expanding coverage to those previously uninsured, the Affordable Care Act has brought attention to the disparity among what different providers can charge for the same procedure based on factors such as geographic location, types of coverage and who performs the care. That should be transparent to all \u2013 Obamacare or not.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a dip in healthcare spending, U.S. employers and the companies that insure them are turning to medical tourism to confront Obamcare challenges.", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Tourism Magazine | Blog", "description": "Sarah Keenan (Santa Cruz Sentinel Photo) dropped 170 pou ...", "title": "Health Insurers Turn to Medical Tourism Strategies to Bypass Obamacare", "url": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/blog/2014/07/health-insurers-look-medical-tourism-transparent-strategy-face-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite a dip in healthcare spending, U.S. employers and the companies that insure them are turning to medical tourism to confront Obamcare challenges.", "title": "Health Insurers Turn to Medical Tourism Strategies to Bypass Obamacare", "image": "http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/obama.jpg", "creator": "@MedTourMagazine", "site": "@MedTourMagazine", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 578485882245508}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f0c\"", "article_summary": "Author: Medical Tourism MagazineSarah Keenan (Santa Cruz Sentinel Photo) dropped 170 pounds and then saved more than $30,000 when she underwent a medical tourism procedure in Mexico.\nUnitedHealth Group, WellPoint and Humana are examining cross-border plans aimed exclusively at reducing expenses by encouraging U.S. patients to seek medical tourism procedures abroad.\nAetna has introduced a medical tourism option that allows for members and their eligible dependents to cross the border for healthcare in the Mexican cities of Mexicali, Tecate, and Tijuana.\n\u201cI paid $16,000, and that includes 10 days in a private recovery hospital,\u201d said Keenan, who shared the news about her medical tourism surgery at Cosmed, in Tijuana, with the Santa Cruz Sentinel.\nHealth insurance would cover some of the costs, but Keenan needed much more than a tummy tuck."}
