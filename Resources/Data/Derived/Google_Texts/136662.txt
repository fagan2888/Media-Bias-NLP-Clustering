Verizon said it is correcting an error that caused an Oregon man to almost lose his home over a $2 million cellphone bill.

Ken Slusher and his girlfriend bought two phones last November and used the Verizon service for just one month before canceling due to numerous billing errors, Fox News reported.

“Yeah, it’s been very stressful to say the least,” Mr. Slusher told a local Fox affiliate. “The number of errors and the comedy of which they happened is astounding to me.”

They thought the issue had been resolved until they started getting notices from collection agencies. Mr. Slusher checked his Verizon account balance again on Monday to see the shocking figure: $2,156,593.64.

Mr. Slusher is scheduled to close on his new house next week, but says his mortgage company won’t sign off on a loan because of the issue, Fox reported.

“If I don’t get this straightened out in the next 24 hours, I can almost guarantee I’ll lose my house,” he said.

Verizon said the error has been resolved.

“We have apologized to an Oregon customer for a programming error in an automated voice response system,” Verizon said in a statement. “The error caused him to receive an incorrect voice message that he owed $2 million on his bill. We are correcting the error now and have resolved the issue to his satisfaction.”
