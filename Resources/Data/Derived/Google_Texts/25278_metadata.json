Well, it\u2019s what we know. Maybe it\u2019ll change. It would be hard to leave.\n\nConsider these symptoms. In most local markets, private hospital providers are able to act as a quasi-monopoly. Absent real market forces, pricing becomes arbitrary, capricious and even whimsical. The uninsured hospital patient is confronted with a bloated sticker price. No visibility. No effective patient bargaining advocate. No explanation. Visa or Master Card?\n\nPrivate insurance companies then feed from their own monopolistic trough. They price to their own captive market. Their power to negotiate a pricing discount benefits their own bottom line, not the patient. There is zero incentive by them to hold down costs as they are paid on a fixed percentage of the claims they administer.\n\nUnitedHealthcare CEO Stephen Hemsley took home over $62 million in 2014 alone. Shame. That\u2019s far more than friction in the system. That\u2019s strip-mining it.\n\nNo wonder many Colorado patients are left naked in the wind. Don\u2019t confuse coverage availability with affordability. Many so-called policies won\u2019t even kick in before a $6,000 deductible. That number might as well be infinity for many patients.\n\nColorado residents often follow that familiar national pattern: Pray that no medical emergency befalls them, hope to navigate their way through the system, then wait until they finally achieve the eureka moment with the arrival of that Medicare card on their 65th birthday. Facts are facts, and the sad fact is 62 percent of personal bankruptcies are the result of medical expenses. Even more alarming, 78 percent of those had some form of health insurance.\n\nThe current health care system is a creature of, by and for the various monied interests. Check it out. Track how the private insurance lobbies worked the Colorado legislature to torpedo a low-cost universal plan. Of course they did. Their very territory was threatened. No lobby for us patients, though. As George Carlin would have said, \u201cIt\u2019s a big club and you ain\u2019t in it.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to start a new club. Federal law invites that. Each state is given the opportunity to opt out of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) if it can innovate its own plan that surpasses the goals of the federal system. ColoradoCare aims to do just that. It would establish a true nonprofit co-op to provide a top-grade no-deductible universal healthcare plan for every Colorado resident.\n\nThe premium level would be set as a percentage of income. In very general terms that would be 3.33 percent of salary for employees, 6.67 percent salary for the employers, and 10 percent of certain non-exempt income for the self-employed (and non-wage earnings). Weigh that in the context of eliminating your own current all-in (i.e. employer/employee premium, deductible, co-pay) annual cost. As one data point just the premium portion of an average 2015 employer-sponsored PPO plan for an American family of four was $24,671.\n\nLet us welcome a clean debate \u2014 clean in the sense it is centered around the interests of the public. Opposition to Amendment 69, which would enable ColoradoCare, will be well-funded, intense and vicious. Consider why. Their special interests \u2014 the very ones representing such crushing overhead in today\u2019s system \u2014 are threatened.\n\nThe referendum this November shall awaken the Beast. The matter goes directly to the people. That\u2019s good. The public would be well served by the ensuing debate. Priorities will be evaluated. Past inertia will be challenged. Truths will be flushed out.\n\nThat truth might even lead to Colorado becoming the very model for a bottoms-up national healthcare transformation.\n\nSteve Smith is a Colorado resident on Medicare.\n\nThis opinion column does not necessarily reflect the views of Boulder Weekly.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Boulder Weekly", "description": "The current healthcare system has all the hallmarks of an abusive relationship.
