Howard has earned 101 caps for the U.S. national team. He has made nearly 350 appearances in the English Premier League for Everton and Manchester United. Even Klinsmann lauds Howard as one of the five best keepers in the world.\n\nThe fearless nature of the U.S. squad begins with Howard.\n\nLIVE BLOG: U.S. vs. Portugal\n\n\u201cWe have always been a good team who rally around each other and who is not afraid to go toe to toe with a giant,\u201d Howard said in a recent interview with CBS News.\n\nAlthough Ronaldo is suffering from knee tendinitis, if the two-time world player of the year can stay on the pitch for 90 minutes, he is fully capable of scoring all the goals Portugal needs to beat the USA by himself.\n\nWhile the snub of Donovan got all the attention heading into the World Cup, he was never going to be the key to the Yanks advancing past pool play. For this U.S. team, it\u2019s all about the back line. Here\u2019s all the technical soccer knowledge you need to have about America\u2019s defense: It stinks.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely why Howard is so essential for the USA. Against Portugal, Howard can erase teammates\u2019 mistakes, be as big as \u201cMemo\u201d Ochoa was in goal for Mexico against Brazil and make room on the soccer bandwagon for millions of Americans.\n\nThe Group of Death was exactly what a team that plays better as an underdog needed. Nobody has less to lose and more to gain than Howard.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Goalkeeper Tim Howard the key to keeping U.S. competitive", "title": "Kiszla: Goalkeeper Tim Howard the key to keeping U.S. competitive", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/21/kiszla-goalkeeper-tim-howard-the-key-to-keeping-u-s-competitive/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__20140622_C2_SP22KISZLAp1.jpg", "height": 416}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621__20140622_C2_SP22KISZLAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-21T19:06:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:10:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Goalkeeper Tim Howard stands tall for the USA.\nWith nothing but love for Landon Donovan, Marcelo Balboa and all the U.S. stalwarts through the years, Howard is the greatest soccer player ever to wear a red, white and blue kit.\nAgainst Portugal, Howard can erase teammates\u2019 mistakes, be as big as \u201cMemo\u201d Ochoa was in goal for Mexico against Brazil and make room on the soccer bandwagon for millions of Americans.\nEven Klinsmann lauds Howard as one of the five best keepers in the world.\n1 reason the Yanks have a chance to stone Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, survive the Group of Death and make noise in the World Cup."}
