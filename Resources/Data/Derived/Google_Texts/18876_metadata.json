Quelch, the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and Professor in Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make some humble suggestions. I\u2019m not a doctor and I don\u2019t play one on TV either. I have very little credibility here,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut I do know something about consumers and consumer behavior.\u201d\n\nQuelch recalled how different grocery shopping was in the 1950s when he was a child tagging along with his mother at Sainsbury\u2019s in England. Back then, shoppers visited different counters to request various foods, paying for cheese at the cheese counter, fruit at the fruit counter, and so on.\n\nYears later, self-service became the norm, with consumers pushing their own carts around the supermarket, stopping to linger as long as they wanted or moving as quickly as they wished.\n\n\u201cThere is more choice available to the consumer than ever before, and choices are within an arm\u2019s reach of desire,\u201d Quelch said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through an intermediary to access these choices. Some people would contend that the consumer has more control.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, consumers can have a greater say over how their financial assets are managed\u2014from opting for a low-cost system of self-management with a company like Vanguard to spending more money to hire a firm like Merrill Lynch that has people actively managing their stock portfolios.\n\n\u201cNeither one of these approaches is better or worse than the other,\u201d Quelch said. \u201cThey cater to two different types of consumers.\u201d\n\nThe Varying Needs Of Health Care Consumers\n\nSo what do groceries and stocks have to do with public health?\n\nQuelch believes, for one thing, the market for public health could learn an important lesson from these other markets: There\u2019s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution, largely because different consumer segments have different preferences.\n\nThe problem in the health care industry comes partly from a clash of interests. Doctors are passionate about addressing the individual needs of each patient, while regulators and policy makers are intent on having one piece of legislation that covers everyone.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have, Quelch said, is a middle ground of different strokes for different folks. \u201cDifferent segments of consumers need to be dealt with in different ways to achieve improved outcomes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, health care consumers want different combinations of what Quelch calls the \u201cfive Es:\u201d expertise, empathy, efficiency, economy, and empowerment. The preference for the precise mix of these elements differs from consumer to consumer, depending on patients\u2019 individual needs.\n\n\u201cIt probably also differs according to the situation, if it\u2019s an emergency or it\u2019s discretionary,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m convinced every consumer has a different profile and a profile that varies by situation and according to the patient\u2019s life stage.\u201d\n\nPatient Empowerment Taken Too Far?\n\nAs an example of patient empowerment\u2014and a glimpse at its potential problems\u2014Quelch talked about taking the 23andMe test, a saliva-based direct-to-consumer personal genome test that reveals a person\u2019s genetically based health risk across dozens of disease categories.\n\n23andMe test results showed one patient at higher risk of liver and bowel cancer\u2014and that made sense, given family history. The patient discussed the test results when he next visited his doctor, who pointed out that he had had two negative colonoscopies, so the risk suggested by the genetic analysis was mitigated substantially by the reality of those two tests with healthy outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe question is always and legitimately raised by health care professionals: When is empowerment too much? When are you engaging the patient to the point that she may take action that is not in her best interest?\u201d (The American Cancer Society in October pushed back its age for recommended mammograms in part because they can lead to false positives and unneeded treatments.)\n\nAnd what would consumer empowerment do to health care costs? Quelch noted that in the cases of the grocery retail market and the financial services market, higher empowerment typically leads to lower costs because more of the work is shifted to the consumer. He said there\u2019s a pressing need for more research to find out whether higher health care empowerment would lead to better outcomes and lower costs.\n\n\u201cIn the world of health care, maybe the curve goes in the other direction, as I suggested in the 23andMe example,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you empower consumers, they start asking a lot of questions that eat up a lot of time from providers who are already stressed in the health care system.\u201d\n\nQuelch argued, on the other hand, that it was fun to get those test results, and he hadn\u2019t heard of anyone who took the test and immediately sought major unnecessary medical interventions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming at this from a consumer point of view. Nine times out of 10, I trust the consumer to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) if you\u2019re a regulator, and the consumer does the wrong thing one out of 10 times, that\u2019s 10 percent, and that\u2019s too much for a regulator to tolerate. There\u2019s a disconnect between the regulatory standard and the market standard in terms of the way these two groups think about how much empowerment is safe to have in our system.\u201d\n\nYet Quelch believes consumer empowerment has the potential to save the system money, deliver greater consumer satisfaction, and ultimately lead to better outcomes.\n\n\u201cNo one knows more about her health or the way she feels than the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile not every consumer is able or willing to take on responsibility for their health, most are.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, some patients already have a great deal of decision-making power\u2014choosing, for example, which insurance plans they buy, when and where to seek treatment, whether to stick with medications, and whether to change their lifestyles according to doctors\u2019 recommendations.\n\nBut patients vary tremendously in their desire and ability to be empowered. Quelch said health care consumers fall into four different segments:\n\nThe \u201cFitbitables\u201d: These are the \u201cworried well,\u201d he said, who are involved in their own health care, are staying healthy, and are taking preventative action.\n\nThe Invincibles: These are the folks the Affordable Care Act had trouble pulling into the health insurance system. They are mostly young and healthy and not especially interested in health issues or paying for medical insurance.\n\nThe Improvables: These are people who have become sick. They may not have been involved in their own health care earlier in their lives, but they are now committed to improving their health.\n\nThe Incapables: These folks are chronic sufferers and tend to eat up a large share of the health care budget; while they may represent only 20 percent of the patient population, they account for 80 percent of the total cost.\n\nThe Incapables represent an especially big challenge. Effective patient empowerment requires three things, Quelch said: the patient has to desire empowerment, the patient has to have the ability to take on the responsibility of empowerment, and the patient needs a support mechanism, such as family members or providers to help. Incapables may fall short on one or more of those counts.\n\n\u201cNot everybody has these three things,\u201d Quelch said. \u201cWe have to take care of the people who don\u2019t have these three things as well as the people who do. We don\u2019t have to worry much about the incapables in financial services, but in health care, we do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"PageBuildDateTime": "2016-05-27 05:52:26Z on 192.168.3.172", "og": {"site_name": "HBS Working Knowledge", "description": "Some consumers want more control over their health care, while others are happy to leave the \"experts\" in charge.
