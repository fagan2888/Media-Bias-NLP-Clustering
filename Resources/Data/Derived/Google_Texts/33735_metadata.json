Davis says in the future, hospitals will become their own insurance companies.\n\nFirst Med was the largest EMS service in Ohio, where at least 1,500 paramedics and other medical workers were left jobless in Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo, Cincinnati, Youngstown, and numerous smaller towns.\n\nFirst Med also provided services in Richmond, Norfolk and Newport News in Virginia, as well as Wilmington, N.C.\n\n\n\nMuch of First Med's business was \"non-emergent\" transportation \u2014 such as taking dialysis patients to their weekly treatments and shuttling nursing home patients to doctors' appointments \u2014 and officials in some cities said there should be little impact on patient treatment.\n\n\n\n\"The unfortunate thing was lack of notice,\" Larry Stephens, ambulance service director for Camden Clark Medical Center in Parkersburg, W.Va., told NBC station WTAP. \"They closed up shop on Friday, and people were scrambling to get to their appointments all weekend, plus early this week.\"\n\n\n\n(Read more: Beware: Holidays may be hazardous to your health)\n\nMany of the company's approximately 2,300 employees learned about the shutdown from colleagues. When they tried to show up for work Saturday, they found locked doors.\n\n\"I found out on Facebook and from a co-worker that I no longer had a job,\" Stacey Carpenter, a First Med dispatcher in Wilmington, told NBC station WECT. \"I am absolutely devastated. I don't know what I am going to do.\"\n\n\n\nDispatch services in several cities reported that First Med called them Friday night and Saturday to stop all requests for emergency runs. Workers who were in the middle of their shifts were told to turn around and go home.\n\n\n\n\"We didn't know what to do,\" Derek Griffin, an emergency medical technician in Hopewell, Va., told NBC station WWBT of Richmond.\n\n\n\n\"They told us to turn our truck in, to turn our equipment in. That was it,\" he said. \"It was done so shadily and so behind closed doors.\"\n\n\n\nMedical facilities said the shutdown took them by surprise, too, and at least one county \u2014 Bertie County, N.C. \u2014 declared a state of emergency at noon Monday. The county board of commissioners said in a statement that it would pursue legal claims against First Med.\n\n\n\n\u2014By M.
