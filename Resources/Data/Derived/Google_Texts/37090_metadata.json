Carolyn McCarthy Carolyn McCarthyLobbying world House Dem says leaders must know when to move on Franchise owners flock to DC in defense of McDonald\u2019s MORE\u2019s (D-N.Y.) seat on Thursday.\n\nHis entry into the race gives Republicans a prominent self-funder to compete for the seat, which leans Democratic but became an opportunity for Republicans with McCarthy\u2019s retirement announcement earlier this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlakeman\n\nis also planning a trip to Washington, D.C., over the next two weeks and hopes to sit down with the National Republican Congressional Committee to discuss his candidacy.\n\nBlakeman is already drawing establishment support \u2014 Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) is expected to join him at his kickoff event on Thursday \u2014 but he's facing a primary fight with New Hyde Park attorney Frank Scaturro.Blakeman said he\u2019s running for Congress because he believes \u201cthe country is on the wrong track,\u201d citing ObamaCare in particular.\u201cWhat does it say about ObamaCare if millions of people would rather quit work than pay for healthcare?\u201d he said of the law, a reference to a recent Congressional Budget Office report that the economy will lose millions of workers by 2021 as a result of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans say is evidence the law amounts to another entitlement program.\u201cIf [Democrats] can\u2019t even solve the rollout, if they can\u2019t even do that right, how are they going to provide healthcare to people? It\u2019s a disaster that should be changed immediately,\u201d Blakeman said.Blakeman previously served on the Port Authority Board of Commissioners and the Hempstead Town Board, and has been majority leader of the Nassau County Legislature.He\u2019s had numerous unsuccessful statewide bids, for comptroller in 1998 and for the GOP nomination for Senate in 2010. But Blakeman said those previous bids shouldn\u2019t be read as an indication of his current potential, and that he saw the 4th District as a \u201cfair fight seat.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been very successful in this county. When you run for statewide office in a blue state, a very, very blue state, probably one of the most blue states in the nation, it\u2019s very difficult for a Republican to win,\u201d he said.He said he\u2019ll invest some of his own money into the race, but wouldn\u2019t indicate how much.\n\nBlakeman said many of his friends and business associates had reached out to offer support, financial or otherwise, and that he expects to have all the resources he needs to run a strong race.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a seasoned campaigner, a hard worker. I\u2019m well-financed, and I have a network of volunteers that I think approach the size of a small army,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHis brother could come to his aid as well.\n\nBrad Blakeman formerly served on former President George W. Bush\u2019s senior staff and helped launch the conservative advocacy group Freedom\u2019s Watch. On Wednesday, he sent out an email to associates and friends letting them know his brother's running.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are expected to nominate nationally known District Attorney Kathleen Rice for the seat, a top contender who will make it a tough seat for Republicans to win.\n\n\n\nNassau County Legislative Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams is also exploring a bid.\n\n\n\nBut Blakeman said his argument against either Democrat would be the same, citing the potential support they\u2019d give to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for Speaker if Democrats win back the House, an unlikely prospect this cycle.\n\n\n\n\u201cBoth Democrats support ObamaCare and both Democrats\u2019 first vote when they get to Congress will be for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
