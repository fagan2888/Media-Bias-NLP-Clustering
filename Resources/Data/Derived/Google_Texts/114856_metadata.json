The name \u201cchikungunya\u201d is derived from a word in the Kimakonde language meaning \u201cto become contorted.\u201d It describes the stooped appearance of sufferers wracked with joint pain. It is rarely fatal but is an extremely painful and fast developing disease.\n\nThe CDC reports that there is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat chikungunya. Once you get it, it just has to run its course.\n\nAuthorities say that the only way to prevent outbreaks of the fast-moving disease is to eliminate standing water and continue to engage in mosquito abatement programs.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "An African virus has been spreading inside the USA via Central America and the Caribbean, and according to authorities it appears that this invader isn't going away any time soon.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "An African virus has been spreading inside the USA via Central America and the Caribbean, and according to authorities it appears that this invader isn't going away any time soon.", "title": "Painful African Virus Hitting USA Through Central America", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/mosquito-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/02/painful-african-virus-hitting-usa-through-central-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An African virus has been spreading inside the USA via Central America and the Caribbean, and according to authorities it appears that this invader isn't going away any time soon.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/mosquito-AP.jpg", "title": "Painful African Virus Hitting USA Through Central America", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, National Security,Virus", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-01-02T05:33:11-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11e3\"", "article_summary": "The chikungunya virus (pronounced \u201cchicken-goon-ya\u201d) causes severe joint and muscle pains that is so bad sufferers can\u2019t even stand up after contracting the sickness.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn African virus has been spreading inside the USA via Central America and the Caribbean, and according to authorities it appears that this invader isn\u2019t going away any time soon.\nAuthorities say that the only way to prevent outbreaks of the fast-moving disease is to eliminate standing water and continue to engage in mosquito abatement programs.\nIt is rarely fatal but is an extremely painful and fast developing disease.\nThe CDC reports that there is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat chikungunya."}
