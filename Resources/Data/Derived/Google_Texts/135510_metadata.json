An advance copy was provided to The New York Times.\n\nThe appeal comes as the White House continues to wrestle with how much of a 480-page executive summary of the report should be declassified, an issue that pits the C.I.A. against the mostly Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe primary remaining obstacle in the negotiations is the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s insistence that pseudonyms of intelligence officers mentioned in the report be blacked out.\u201cThe question is whether the key facts are redacted,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the committee, said last week. \u201cI\u2019m not giving in on this question.\u201d\n\nDean Boyd, a C.I.A. spokesman, said that the agency believes that showing that particular officers were associated with multiple events, along with dates and locations, could help identify them and put them in danger.\n\nBernadette Meehan, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said Mr. Obama agrees that the C.I.A.\u2019s rendition, detention and interrogation program of the George W. Bush era \u201cwas inconsistent with our values as a nation, and that public scrutiny, debate and transparency will help to inform the public\u2019s understanding of the program to ensure that such a program will never be used again.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel laureates\u2019 letter also urges Mr. Obama to adopt \u201cfirm policy and oversight restating and upholding international law related to conflict, including the Geneva Convention and the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\u201d The administration is debating whether to embrace or reject a Bush-era interpretation that a provision in the torture treaty banning cruel treatment does not apply abroad.\n\nAfter the Bush administration revealed its narrow interpretation of the treaty in 2005, Congress enacted a statute banning cruel treatment anywhere. Mr. Obama ordered strict compliance with the statute when he took office in 2009.\n\nBut the Obama administration has never taken an official stance on the whether the treaty separately imposes legal obligations abroad. It must do so in a presentation before the U.N. next month. State Department officials are pushing to abandon the Bush-era interpretation, but military and intelligence lawyers are objecting, arguing that doing so could have operational impacts and that more study is required.\n\nThe officials opposed to accepting the cruelty provision as applying abroad insist they do not want to resume abusive interrogations, which are barred by the 2005 statute anyway, but worry that accepting the treaty provision as applying abroad could have unintended consequences on other operations, such as by suggesting that other treaties with similar jurisdictional language also apply everywhere.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Tutu said the letter was inspired by news of the administration debate over the torture treaty, saying it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that the Obama team was even thinking of embracing the \u201cfoul thinking\u201d that \u201cghastly things\u201d that are crimes on domestic soil are permitted abroad. That dovetailed with other matters, like the continued use of indefinite detention without trial at the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, as contributing to \u201ca grave sense of sadness and of being let down\u201d by Mr. Obama, he said.\n\nOther laureates who signed the letter include Mohammad ElBaradei of Egypt, who was awarded the Peace Prize in 2005; Leymah Gbowee, Liberia, 2011; Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh, 2006; \u00d3scar Arias Sanchez, Costa Rica, 1987; John Hume, Northern Ireland, 1998; F.
