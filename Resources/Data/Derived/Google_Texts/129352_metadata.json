Each homeless person will be assigned a case worker, who will try to get medical help and permanent housing for their clients, many of whom suffer from mental illness and drug addiction.\n\nAs part of the plan, the city will hire 137 new fulltime staff and train 100 police officers to handle incidents that involve the homeless.\n\nA new telephone reporting system will enable New Yorkers to report people living on the street, with the aim that an outreach worker addresses the issue within an hour.\n\nThere are about 58,000 homeless people, almost half of them children, sleeping in shelters and several thousand more on the streets on any given night, according to city figures.\n\nDe Blasio has struggled to bring down the city's homeless population, which has risen for decades but reached record highs during his tenure.\n\nEarlier this week, he announced the resignation of Gilbert Taylor, who led the city's Department of Homeless Services, and said administration officials would consider reorganizing the department.\n\nSome critics have blamed the continued rise in homelessness on the mayor's left-leaning politics and what they call his anti-police sentiment.\n\nBut advocates applauded the HOME-STAT program and de Blasio's broader homelessness plan, including the creation of thousands of affordable housing units and an increase in shelter beds.\n\n\"We believe Mayor de Blasio's (plan) will, at long last, bring thousands of homeless New Yorkers in off the streets and into permanent housing,\" advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement.\n\n(Editing by Frances Kerry)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mayor Bill de Blasio launched a new program on Thursday to reduce", "title": "NYC's mayor launches new program to help quell tide of homelessness", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/17/NYCs-mayor-launches-new-program-help-quell-tide-homelessness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/new-york-homelessness_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/17/NYCs-mayor-launches-new-program-help-quell-tide-homelessness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/new-york-homelessness_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mayor Bill de Blasio launched a new program on Thursday to reduce", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The NYC Homeless Outreach and Mobile Engagement S\u200etreet Action Team, or HOME-STAT, which aims to be fully operational by March, is part of a $2.6 billion plan by the mayor to address homelessness.\nBut advocates applauded the HOME-STAT program and de Blasio's broader homelessness plan, including the creation of thousands of affordable housing units and an increase in shelter beds.\nSome critics have blamed the continued rise in homelessness on the mayor's left-leaning politics and what they call his anti-police sentiment.\n\"This is a fundamental change in how our city contends with a situation that has been intractable for so many years,\" de Blasio said.\nAs part of the plan, the city will hire 137 new fulltime staff and train 100 police officers to handle incidents that involve the homeless."}
