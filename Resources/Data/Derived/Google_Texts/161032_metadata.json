Then, in a follow-up undercover phone call to the abortion center where the staffer was employed, Planned Parenthood officials set up an appointment with investigators to meet with the staffer, making it appear the staffer was still employed.\n\nNow, in a new interview, Planned Parenthood representatives claim they knew the phone call was fake and admit they lied to the Live Action undercover agent. As USA Today reports:\n\nA day after Planned Parenthood officials said an employee at the Indianapolis-Midtown Clinic \u2014 who was captured in video offering the controversial advice \u2014 no longer worked for the organization, Live Action claimed they were lying. The allegation that Planned Parenthood was lying was based on a phone call Thursday, in which a Live Action worker posed as the 15-year-old girl shown in the surreptitiously captured video. This time she was seeking another appointment. She specifically asked for the counselor who Planned Parenthood said no longer worked for the agency. A recording of the conversation was later posted online. A Planned Parenthood official acknowledged the staff member who took the call Thursday set up an appointment for the woman posing as the teen, even though she knew it was a Live Action operative. Planned Parenthood staff went along with the caller\u2019s request to meet with the specific counselor only because the agency would never tell a client about confidential personnel or employee issues, said spokeswoman Tammy Lieber. \u201cWe knew it was a fake,\u201d she said. Live Action CEO Lila Rose, 25, defended her group\u2019s undercover tactics \u2014 including the phone call she made Thursday to the Indianapolis clinic \u2014 as necessary to fight what she believes is Planned Parenthood\u2019s promotion of misinformation and dangerous sexual activities among teenagers. \u201cThis organization regularly hides the truth from the public, misinforms women, misleads people about their services and outright lies, so posing undercover was important to really get to the bottom of how they engage with teens about sexual issues,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat is not fake is the fact that a Planned Parenthood staffer encouraged an underage teen to engage in BDSM sex.\n\nIn the first video released in its new expose\u2019 of the Planned Parenthood abortion business, Live Action has caught a counselor for the abortion giant urging a 15-year-old to have BDSM sex and to engage in sexual relations as a dominatrix.\n\nThe entire video series catches the Planned Parenthood abortion business teaching teenagers about S&M-based sexual relationships and concepts such as gagging, whipping and asphyxiation. In a series of undercover audits, Live Action investigators documented Planned Parenthood counselors and nurses advising our investigators, who the Planned Parenthood staffers thought were minors, on how to practice torture sex.\n\nIn this and forthcoming videos, Planned Parenthood counselors encourage undercover investigators posting as 15 and 16-year-old teens, to engage in the sadomasochistic practices, telling the underage teens \u201cif it\u2019s consensual, it\u2019s OK\u2026 it\u2019s totally OK.\u201d\n\nIn its response to the video to the Star newspaper, Planned Parenthood claimed that it does not represent how its staff would normally handle a discussion with a teenager and it claims the staffer in question has been fired. From the report:\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky says an undercover video released Wednesday by a pro-life group doesn\u2019t reflect the agency\u2019s training or standards and that the employee advising the fake client no longer works at the Indianapolis Midtown center. Planned Parenthood president and CEO Betty Cockrum doesn\u2019t dispute the authenticity of the tape, but also said it is not indicative of the type of counseling and information clients are provided. \u201cWhile the heavy editing of this video makes it impossible to know the full exchange that took place, this video clearly does not reflect our professional standards or training protocols, and this staff member is no longer employed at PPINK,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cThis video does not reflect the work our dedicated employees do every day, nor the experience shared by parents and teens who participate in our programs,\u201d Cockrum added. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Tammy Lieber said Cockrum was not available Wednesday night to answer questions. Lieber also would not reveal whether the employee was fired or left voluntarily, or when that occurred, due to privacy policies.\n\nIn this first expose\u2019 footage, the Planned Parenthood employee explains to the Live Action investigator, posing as a fifteen-year-old girl, several sexually deviant concepts, such as role-play and the use of whips and handcuffs to inflict pain on a sexual partner. \u201cYou could be a dominatrix-type of person,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere you dress in all leather, with the whips and the handcuffs.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt just depends what type of pain you can take.\u201d\n\nLiveAction complains that the video comes in the wake of news that through ObamaCare, an additional $75 million in taxpayer funding will be allocated by the Department of Health and Human Services for sex education. Planned Parenthood, which has received hundreds of millions already to be an ObamaCare \u201cnavigator,\u201d is poised to receive a significant amount of this funding.\n\nLila Rose, Live Action\u2019s president, roundly condemned the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cunbelievable mismanagement\u201d of public funds. \u201cNo matter your interpretation of the government\u2019s taxing power, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to justify forcing Americans to give money to an organization that counsels a fifteen-year-old girl to look up porn sites to get \u2018ideas\u2019 on BDSM sex, and to get someone over 18 to go into a sex shop to buy whips and handcuffs for her.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nPlanned Parenthood, which casts itself as a leading sex educator, regularly implements sexually explicit advertising campaigns and seminars, including a series of metro ads reading, \u201cWe\u2019re your one-night stand,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re your friend with benefits,\u201d etc., and a seminar for teenagers on \u201chow a BDSM relationship is successfully navigated between sexual partners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese tapes are so outrageous,\u201d Rose said, \u201cthat they are hard to believe \u2013 so-called \u2018health\u2019 counselors promoting dangerous and violent practices to young girls, recommending porn sites, sex shops, and how to hide these activities from parents.\u201d\n\nLive Action is providing uncensored investigative footage by request but has declined to make it available for public consumption. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty that this is even happening,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe are calling on proper authorities to see this footage as an incentive to hold Planned Parenthood accountable for the dangerous practices this abortion corporation is promoting to our teens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood: We Lied About Not Firing Firing Staffer Who Told 15-Year-Old to Engage in S&M Sex", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The Planned Parenthood abortion business is having a hard time keeping its story straight after it was exposed over a staffer who told a 15-year-old in an under", "title": "Planned Parenthood: We Lied About Not Firing Staffer Who Told 15-Year-Old to Engage in S&M Sex", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/06/13/planned-parenthood-we-lied-about-not-firing-firing-staffer-who-told-15-year-old-to-engage-in-sm-sex/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/plannedparenthood30b-190x102.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "planned parenthood: we lied about not firing staffer who told 15-year-old to engage in s&m sex,planned parenthood: we lied about not firing staffer who told 15-year-old to engage in s&m sex", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9be6\"", "article_summary": "What is not fake is the fact that a Planned Parenthood staffer encouraged an underage teen to engage in BDSM sex.\nNow, in a new interview, Planned Parenthood representatives claim they knew the phone call was fake and admit they lied to the Live Action undercover agent.\nShe specifically asked for the counselor who Planned Parenthood said no longer worked for the agency.\nPlanned Parenthood spokeswoman Tammy Lieber said Cockrum was not available Wednesday night to answer questions.\nPlanned Parenthood, which has received hundreds of millions already to be an ObamaCare \u201cnavigator,\u201d is poised to receive a significant amount of this funding."}
