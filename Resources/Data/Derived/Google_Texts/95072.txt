Unsanitary conditions have pushed the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety to close the Driver License Exam site in Yukon.

The location will close effective Monday, September 9, and remain closed indefinitely. DPS blames the closure on a lack of working bathrooms.

"Due to the lack of restroom facilities, and the unsanitary conditions for the public and department employees, we have few options other than to close the Yukon location and look for a more suitable facility to serve the public," DPS Commissioner Michael C. Thompson said.

The examiners are being temporarily relocated to the sites at 28 E. Main in Edmond, and at 728 East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City.
