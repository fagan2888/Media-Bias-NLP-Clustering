It's the ObamaCare fine if you listen to Obama Inc. But considering how much of ObamaCare has been taken apart, it's not clear to them if anyone will actually have to pay it.\n\nWhite House spokesperson David Simas declined to say if anyone will be subjected to Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate tax in 2014 Friday on MSNBC. Host Chuck Todd put the question to Simas directly, asking if \u201ca single person\u201d will end up paying the tax in 2014. HHS announced yesterday they are suspending the mandate for consumers who had policies cancelled this year,\n\nWe're already in a strange zone because so many ObamaCare regs have been modified, suspended or given a pass on to various peoples and groups. It's silly to call this universal health care because none of it applies universally.\n\nWhat began as special favors and exemptions snowballed with the backlash against ObamaCare into widespread fixes and exemptions. Suspending the fine for people who have had their policies cancelled this year will leave far fewer people subject to the ObamaCare tax/penalty, while once again punishing the uninsured.\n\nFor a law justified by the needs of the uninsured, they've taken some of the worst beatings from it.\n\nTo Obama Inc, all these moves are like Lenin's New Economic Program, a few steps back and then more steps forward plan, for surviving the 2014 elections and then embedding ObamaCare as a permanent entitlement that Republicans will be too afraid of the backlash to touch.\n\nBut considering how many of their own regs and measures they've rendered null and void, the legal challenges are becoming easier.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "It's the ObamaCare fine if you listen to Obama Inc.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "It's the ObamaCare fine if you listen to Obama Inc.", "title": "Obama Inc: No Idea if Anyone Will Have to Pay the ObamaCare Tax", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/213866/obama-inc-no-idea-if-anyone-will-have-pay-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:47:56-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/213866/obama-inc-no-idea-if-anyone-will-have-pay-daniel-greenfield", "description": "It's the ObamaCare fine if you listen to Obama Inc.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Inc: No Idea if Anyone Will Have to Pay the ObamaCare Tax"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-25T07:39:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:47:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3f2\"", "article_summary": "That's the ObamaCare tax if you listen to the Supreme Court.\nFor a law justified by the needs of the uninsured, they've taken some of the worst beatings from it.\nBut considering how much of ObamaCare has been taken apart, it's not clear to them if anyone will actually have to pay it.\nIt's the ObamaCare fine if you listen to Obama Inc.\nHost Chuck Todd put the question to Simas directly, asking if \u201ca single person\u201d will end up paying the tax in 2014."}
