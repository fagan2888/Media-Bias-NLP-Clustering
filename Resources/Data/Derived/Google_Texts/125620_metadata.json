We think it\u2019s a good opportunity for a lot of folks.\u201d\n\nBut the work isn\u2019t necessarily for everybody.\n\nInside the plant are three separate and distinct zones. One is the bakery, where three super-sized industrial ovens bake up to 700,000 bread rolls a week. The other is the deep freezer, kept at a bone-chilling 10 below zero. The sandwich-making and wrapping area is right in the middle, at 38 degrees.\n\n\u201cFolks who stick it out for a week or two usually stick around,\u201d Amigh said.\n\nMaking it fresh\n\nRaybern\u2019s sandwich-making operation is mostly done by hand, complemented by state-of-the-art equipment\n\nFor example, Raybern uses proprietary technology to slice and place the cheese on its sandwiches. Even the way it wraps them is proprietary, all in the name of efficiency.\n\nWith 35 million sandwiches to make yearly, there\u2019s almost an art \u2013 along with a science \u2013 that Raybern understandably keeps close to the vest. After all, the privately held company isn\u2019t the only sandwich-maker in the business.\n\nBut a competitive advantage Raybern says it has is that its sandwich-making process is all done under one roof.\n\nThe company mixes its own dough, bakes it, makes the sandwiches, packages the sandwiches and sends them out, all in the same place.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making it fresh here. We\u2019re buying all the components to make our bread, we\u2019re mixing it, proofing it, baking it on site,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing fresh meat in, we season it and mix it, cook it up and slice it ourselves. It\u2019s all done here.\u201d\n\nRaybern also makes its own sauces for the sandwiches, and they, too, are made at the Shannon plant.\n\nWhile the Philly is the most popular-selling sandwich Raybern sells to its customers, next is roast beef chedder, followed by roast beef bacon cheddar, chicken bacon ranch and pastrami.\n\nRaybern Foods was founded in 1978 in Hayward, California. The company invented the frozen deli sandwich, and it\u2019s managed to find its way onto the shelves of some of America\u2019s largest retailers.\n\nAnd Raybern is also growing its market share with their help.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re expanding the number of distribution points they\u2019ve given us, expanding the spots on the shelves they\u2019re giving us,\u201d Amigh said. \u201cAlso, we\u2019re gaining new accounts. We\u2019re taking existing items and getting it to retailers we haven\u2019t had before. It\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nAmigh also said the company has more new products that will be rolled out this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a different flavor of a sandwich \u2013 it\u2019s other forms of hand-held meals,\u201d he hinted.\n\nRaybern moved to Mississippi because it needed room to meet its growing needs. The company\u2019s California operations were spread over three campuses and it had no room left to grow.\n\nWith plans to get more sandwiches in more stores across the country, Raybern needed the flexibility.\n\nRaybern hasn\u2019t filled the 146,000-square-foot building that used to crank out Bryan cocktail sausages up until four years ago.\n\nThere is room to expand, and Raybern can add at least double its three production lines it\u2019s currently running.\n\n\u201cThis was bigger than what we needed, but we knew with our aggressive growth plan and our strategic direction, we would need this space,\u201d Amigh said. \u201cWe can easily double production here.\n\n\u201cWe set this facility to drive the business forward in the years to come. We\u2019re sitting on close to 50 acres, we have room to expand. \u2026 it\u2019s all about bringing more products to more locations in the U.S.\u201d\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal SHANNON \u2013 Most of the Philly cheese steaks sandwiches sold in America aren\u2019t made in its namesake city.
