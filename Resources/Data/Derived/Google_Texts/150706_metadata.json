He says there is \u201ca considerable amount of damage.\u201d\n\nHe says homes have been lost and authorities are going house to house to try to get a better handle on the situation.\n\nHe can\u2019t immediately confirm any injuries or fatalities.\n\nFields says the tornado Saturday afternoon did not strike any heavily populated area.\n\nA 50-county area of North Texas has been under a tornado watch until 9 p.m.\n\nUpdate at 6:38 p.m.: At least two tornadoes touched down Saturday in North Texas, as forecasters elevated the risk of severe storms for a large area including Dallas while downgrading it for much of the Great Plains.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed one tornado was on the ground late Saturday afternoon near Cisco, about 100 miles west of Fort Worth. Josh Wasson, with the Cisco Fire Department, says at least one home has been damaged but isn\u2019t immediately certain of the extent of the damage.\n\nAuthorities said one person was killed in Cisco as a result of the severe weather, KXAS-TV (NBC5) said.\n\nAnother twister touched down in the town of Burkburnett, Texas, about 15 miles north of Wichita Falls, according to a police dispatcher who declined to give her name due to department policy. She said the town set off its tornado siren just before 6 p.m.\n\nThe weather service on Saturday afternoon elevated to \u201cmoderate\u201d the risk of tornadoes in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and elsewhere across North Texas. Eastland County, which was part of the enhanced zone, was pelted with 3-inch hail as the storm rumbled through.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the environment in North Texas is particularly favorable (for tornadoes),\u201d said Bill Bunting, the chief of operations at the Norman, Oklahoma-based Storm Prediction Center.\n\nStorms also brought heavy rain and quarter-sized hail to parts of southwest Oklahoma on Saturday afternoon, but meteorologists said there was so much rain \u2014 and so little sun \u2014 that the tornado threat there lessened throughout the day. Parts of western Kansas also were bracing for severe storms.\n\nBut the threatening skies stretched beyond the Plains states, as twin weather systems stretching from the Carolinas to California produced an unseasonably early tropical storm in the Atlantic and a late-season snowstorm in the Rocky Mountains. Tropical Storm Ana\u2019s forecast track is expected to go near the coasts of North and South Carolina on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, up to 5 inches of snow was possible in the Nebraska Panhandle this weekend, and parts of South Dakota could receive between 12 to 24 inches of snow, according to the weather service.\n\nUpdate at 5:54 p.m.: Forecasters have boosted the possibility of tornadoes for North Texas as a tornado watch was issued into Saturday evening for nearly 50 counties, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nA tornado warning was issued late Saturday afternoon for Eastland County, where the area about 100 miles west of Fort Worth was pelted with storms and 3-inch hail.\n\nJosh Wasson, with the Cisco Fire Department in Eastland County says at least one home has been damaged but isn\u2019t immediately certain of the extent of the damage.\n\nThe Norman, Oklahoma-based Storm Prediction Center upgraded parts of the watch area to a moderate risk of severe weather. It\u2019s the fourth-highest risk of a five-level prediction range. Other counties are considered in the \u201cenhanced\u201d area, one risk lower. The watch is effective until 9 p.m.\n\nEarlier Saturday afternoon, the Dallas-Fort Worth area\u2019s risk of severe weather has been upgraded to Category 4, on a five-point scale, for moderate risk of large hail and strong winds, according to the National Weather Service\u2019s Fort Worth office.\n\nTornadoes could develop in a few places, but meteorologist Lamont Bain said he doesn\u2019t expect severe weather to sweep through all of North Texas.\n\n\u201cSome areas won\u2019t even see a thunderstorm,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026We definitely want people to be alert.\u201d\n\nOriginal post:\n\nThe National Weather Service in Fort Worth is warning of a potential for severe thunderstorms in North Texas this afternoon.\n\nThat could mean hail, damaging winds, possibly tornadoes and a \u201cbig threat\u201d for flash flooding, said Jennifer Dunn, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.\n\nMost of North Texas \u2014 including Dallas and Tarrant counties \u2014 is under a tornado watch that is set to expire at 9 p.m.\n\nBut NBC 5 Meteorologist David Finfrock says he\u2019s most worried about the flash flood watch that is in effect through Monday morning.\n\nRainfall in the last six weeks, and especially this week, may put an end to the drought area lakes have experienced in the last four years, Finfrock said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really had a change in our luck. \u2026 It takes a flood to end a drought \u2014 that\u2019s what appears to be what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d he said.\n\nExpect more rain tomorrow \u2014 sorry, mom \u2014 and early next week.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA1L3Rvcm5hZG8tZmxhc2gtZmxvb2Qtd2F0Y2gtaXNzdWVkLWZvci1kYWxsYXMtZm9ydC13b3J0aC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "\u200b Update at 8:39 p.m.: Parts of Tarrant, Johnson, Parker and Hood counties are under a severe thunderstorm warning until 9:45 p.m., KXAS-TV (NBC5) reported.
