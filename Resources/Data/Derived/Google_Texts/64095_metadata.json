Some lawmakers are trying to revive the New Deal program, established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as part of the highway bill this month.\n\nNot all of the $46.9 million went to stave off Ex-Im\u2019s expiration, but their collective firepower vaulted them to the front of the pack among spenders in the second quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s list of the top 10 spenders, according to Politico Influence (Ex-Im supporters in bold):\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, $17.9 million American Medical Association, $12.4 million Boeing Co., $9.3 million General Electric Co., $8.5 million National Association of Realtors, $8.2 million Business Roundtable, $6.4 million U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, $5.1 million National Association of Manufacturers, $4.8 million PhRMA, $4.8 million American Hospital Association, $4.7 million\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce maintained its top spot on the list, boosting its spending by more than $4 million from the first quarter, when it spent $13.8 million.\n\nThe Chamber is currently running TV ads to drum up support for the bank. According to a video posted on its website, the Chamber claims that the bank \u201csupported 1.3 million American jobs over the past six years\u201d\u2014a claim supporters haven\u2019t been able to back up with empirical evidence.\n\nEx-Im is sometimes mockingly called \u201cBoeing\u2019s Bank\u201d for the financial support the airline manufacturer has received in subsidies. During the second quarter, Boeing\u2019s lobbying spending skyrocketed, nearly tripling from the previous quarter.\n\nAnother big spender, General Electric, dispatched Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt to Washington, D.C., last month to speak in favor of the bank. He claimed that the bank\u2019s expiration would result in an \u201ceconomic catastrophe.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Business Roundtable wrote to congressional leaders to support the bank\u2019s reauthorization. The National Association of Manufacturers followed suit last month with another plea to Congress, joined by 1,053 organizations who added their names to a June 3 letter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's a list of the top 10 spenders on lobbying, five of which are advocating for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Here's a list of the top 10 spenders on lobbying, five of which are advocating for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "Export-Import Bank Supporters Spend Big on Lobbying", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150723_ExImLobby.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T16:26:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CX3zxC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Here's a list of the top 10 spenders on lobbying, five of which are advocating for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "Export-Import Bank Supporters Spend Big on Lobbying", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150723_ExImLobby.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-07-23T11:48:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T16:26:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Boeing, GE, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, Congress, Ex-Im, lobbying"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea2d\"", "article_summary": "Ex-Im supporter Boeing\u2019s lobbying spending skyrocketed, nearly tripling from the previous quarter.\nThe Export-Import Bank\u2019s most vocal supporters were among the biggest spenders on lobbying in the second quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, Boeing\u2019s lobbying spending skyrocketed, nearly tripling from the previous quarter.\nThe National Association of Manufacturers followed suit last month with another plea to Congress, joined by 1,053 organizations who added their names to a June 3 letter.\nDespite their attempts to save the Export-Import Bank, its charter expired on June 30 after more than 81 years of existence."}
