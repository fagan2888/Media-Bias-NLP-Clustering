The proposal would also require drug and alcohol tests for doctors.\n\nThe initiative, if successful, would strike a blow against California\u2019s 1975 landmark malpractice tort liability law known as the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act. Trial lawyers and consumer groups have tried repeatedly in the courts and the legislature to overturn the law.\n\nWhile the measure would lift the pain and suffering cap, proponents say their primary goal is to improve patient safety. They say physicians and hospitals aren\u2019t doing enough to curb prescription drug abuse or to police doctors.\n\nThe proposal would also require doctors to consult a statewide prescription drug database prior to placing a patients on medication.\n\nThe measure is named the Troy and Alana Pack Patient Safety Act after two young siblings who were run down and killed in 2003 by a woman who was drunk and high on prescription drugs.\n\nPhysicians and insurance companies are fighting the initiative, saying the drug abuse provisions were added by trial lawyers simply to entice voters to approve a measure whose real purpose is to fatten payouts in lawsuits.\n\nThe proposal, which would also call on doctors to report peers suspected of drug or alcohol impairment or medical negligence, requires at least 504,760 signatures that are due today, according to the California Secretary of State.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael B.
