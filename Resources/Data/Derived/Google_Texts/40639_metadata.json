Aides say his speech will explain why, if Republicans want to win the presidential election in 2016, they must shun candidates from the establishment and moderate sides of the Republican Party.\n\nWhen Trump arrived at the Myrtle Beach airport on his private 757 jet\u2014emblazoned with his name on the side and the Trump logo\u2014reporters from Breitbart News and several other media outlets met him aboard the plane. Trump\u2019s plane has a bedroom, several side rooms with couches, and many luxury white leather seats. There\u2019s a golden sink, and full staff, along with mini-kitchen and well-kept bathroom. On a tour of the plane, Trump\u2019s pilot, John Duncan, told Breitbart News what it\u2019s like flying the magnate: \u201cIt\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters that he thinks establishment Republicans including Mitt Romney \u2014 the 2012 GOP presidential nominee\u2014and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush should not be nominated \u2014 if Republicans want to win the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI was right in 2012. I said we don\u2019t have a strong candidate, but we had Mitt Romney,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe went with Mitt Romney and he failed. He let us all down, to be honest with you. For him to be running again is outrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe failed,\u201d Trump repeated. \u201cHe should have won. It [the Obama administration] is a failed presidency. It is a failed president [Obama], and he should have won, but he lost.\u201d\n\nAs for Jeb Bush, who has, like Romney, announced he is considering a run for the presidency, Trump didn\u2019t hold back either:\n\nThe last thing this country needs is another Bush. We\u2019ve had it with the Bushes, and the last Bush did not do a great job. He gave us Obama, he gave us\u2014as you know\u2014Justice [John] Roberts [of the Supreme Court] who approved Obamacare. He\u2019s got a second shot at it but who knows what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s not as good as the first one. But he [George W. Bush] gave us Justice Roberts who approved Obamacare. We\u2019re all saddled with Obamacare, the country is saddled with it. And it really kicks in in 2016. It\u2019s going to be a disaster for the country.\n\nTrump also spoke highly of the Tea Party movement. \u201cI think we have values that are very similar,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a friend of the Tea Party for some time. I think they\u2019ve been treated very, very unfairly. What they are really is great American people who love this country and work. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina \u2014 Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump spoke to Breitbart News aboard his private jet on Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina \u2014 Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump spoke to Breitbart News aboard his private jet on Monday.", "title": "Trump: Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush Can't Beat The Democrats", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Trump-plane.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/19/air-force-trump-ahead-of-2016-the-donald-slams-romney-bush-in-south-carolina/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina \u2014 Real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump spoke to Breitbart News aboard his private jet on Monday.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Trump-plane.jpg", "title": "Trump: Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush Can't Beat The Democrats", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, South Carolina Tea Party Coalition, South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention", "published_time": "2015-01-19T12:11:57-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I said we don\u2019t have a strong candidate, but we had Mitt Romney,\u201d Trump said.\nFor him to be running again is outrageous.\u201d\u201cHe failed,\u201d Trump repeated.\nJeb Bush should not be nominated \u2014 if Republicans want to win the 2016 election.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cMake America great again\u2014it\u2019s very simple\u2014make America great again,\u201d Trump said when asked what his overarching campaign theme would be.\nWe\u2019ve had it with the Bushes, and the last Bush did not do a great job."}
