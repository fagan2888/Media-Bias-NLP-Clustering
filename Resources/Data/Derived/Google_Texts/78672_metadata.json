We\u2019ve seen debates on how to stop the spread of inversions and arguments that they aren\u2019t a problem at all. Some call for the abolition of the corporate tax rate as a whole and others completely reject such suggestions. I find these discussions of tax reform and its effects on the economy informative yet simultaneously slightly disappointing.\n\nWhat bothers me about how tax reform debates shake out is how absent they can become of socio-political realities, particularly the reality of race.\n\nOne line of progressive argumentation follows simply: If everyone pays their fair share of taxes, we can support public spending and job growth, and we\u2019ll all do better. The argument firmly stands, but there is an important caveat.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to harken back to the 1950s when tax rates were high, social services were relatively steady and economic security stretched across economic strata. But who was really secure then? Even the high points of job security for the American economy still left African Americans (and other racially marginalized groups) behind. This a structural phenomenon, instituted by socially racist institutions and a deep history of systemically harming the Black community.\n\nWe can\u2019t take race out of conversations around economic inequality. The reality of race is that even fixes to the broader federal revenue landscape don\u2019t always address the structural barriers of racism. A rising tide can\u2019t lift all boats, if some boats are bolted to the seafloor.\n\nBlack unemployment consistently exceeds that of whites, both post-Recession and since such data has been available. Gaps between white unemployment and black unemployment shrank in 2009. This was not due to falling black unemployment but instead due to skyrocketing white unemployment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tax reforms, however necessary, can't solve America's institutional racism and its resulting income inequality", "author": "Joelle Gamble", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tax reforms, however necessary, can't solve America's institutional racism and its resulting income inequality", "title": "Tax policy is more about race than you think", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/tax_policy_is_more_about_race_than_you_think_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/tax_forms_square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tax reforms, however necessary, can't solve America's institutional racism and its resulting income inequality", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/tax_forms_square.jpg", "title": "Tax policy is more about race than you think", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Tax policy is more about race than you think", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, class, Next New Deal, Race, tax policy, Tax reform", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3ff\"", "article_summary": "Topics: class, Next New Deal, Race, tax policy, Tax reform, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Next New DealThe threat of corporate inversions to the American tax base sprung an interesting political dialogue around tax reform in the United States.\nI find these discussions of tax reform and its effects on the economy informative yet simultaneously slightly disappointing.\nWhat bothers me about how tax reform debates shake out is how absent they can become of socio-political realities, particularly the reality of race.\nGaps between white unemployment and black unemployment shrank in 2009.\nThis was not due to falling black unemployment but instead due to skyrocketing white unemployment."}
