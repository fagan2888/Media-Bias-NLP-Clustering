ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - The interim leader of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis celebrated his first public mass since taking over the organization last month.

Minnesota Public Radio News reports (http://bit.ly/1eU0qU8 ) Archbishop Bernard Hebda received a warm welcome Sunday at the Cathedral of Saint Paul.

Hebda, of Newark, New Jersey, is overseeing the archdiocese until Pope Francis appoints a replacement for John Nienstedt, who resigned last month.

He arrives as the archdiocese faces bankruptcy and criminal charges related to clergy sex abuse.

In his homily, Hebda said the church will not be judged in the long term on how it handles court cases and finances, but on how it adheres to its primary mission.

Afterward, he said he didnâ€™t know how long he would remain in the Twin Cities.
