Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) said Thursday night it is "cool" David Letterman announced he would retire sometime next year.

Palin, who had a dustup with the late-night host while running for vice president in 2008, said maybe he would be starting a trend that extended into the political arena.

"Well it's cool, you know, out with the old, in with the new," she said on Fox News. "Maybe he'll start a trend when we talk about politics too â€” politicians who have maybe been in Washington, D.C., a bit too long, allow some new blood in there."

Letterman announced during a taping of "Late Show With David Letterman" Thursday that he would step down in 2015 after more than 20 years on the show. He is the longest running late-night host.

In 2009, Letterman apologized multiple times for a joke about Palin's teen daughter, which sparked outrage while she was running on the GOP ticket with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).

At the time, Letterman said he mixed up Palin's two daughters when he joked that one of them was "knocked up" by Alex Rodriguez while attending a Yankee game. The joke was meant to be directed at Palin's older daughter; however, her 14-year-old daughter at the time was the one who attended the game.
