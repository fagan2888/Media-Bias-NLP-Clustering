Doing so would allow their release within the terms of the same statute that supposedly renders closure impossible.\n\nThe president could also defeat the ban on transfers by doing what the article notes Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, sensibly suggested years ago: negotiating guilty pleas with some of the remaining detainees in federal court. Guilty pleas would present an opportunity for the courts to rule that the existing transfer restrictions were not intended by Congress to apply to such cases.\n\nSHAYANA KADIDAL\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is senior managing attorney of the Guant\u00e1namo project at the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s much-publicized agonizing over whether to \u201cshutter\u201d Guant\u00e1namo is a smokescreen. At best, he plans to close the physical facility and transfer its prisoners elsewhere. That will not fulfill his promise to restore the rule of law.\n\nGuant\u00e1namo will not be closed in any meaningful sense until the president repudiates his assertion of the unconstitutional power to detain forever without trial prisoners whom the executive does not find convenient to release.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nERIC M.
