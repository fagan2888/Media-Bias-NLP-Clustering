I\u2019m going to have to come in as a guest.\u201d\n\nBennett is handing in his badge after exactly 30 years with the Tampa Police department.\n\nThey were a busy three decades. He worked his way up from a street cop \u2014 doing stints on homicide and as a field training officer \u2014 to supervisor of the SWAT team, the chief\u2019s executive officer and major overseeing District II. In 2009, when Jane Castor became the police chief, she appointed Bennett as her second-in-command.\n\nHe is credited with changing the way the department handles security at large events like Gasparilla and Super Bowl games, and he was praised nationally for his efforts in keeping the peace during the Republican National Convention in 2012, during which there were only a handful of convention-related arrests.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably not a job in the department that he hasn\u2019t done and done superbly well,\u201d Mayor Bob Buckhorn said. \u201cHe looks at policing in a non-traditional way. He has helped modernize the Tampa Police Department in a way nobody else could.\u201d\n\nBennett never campaigned for a promotion or praise, he said. Just like he always told the people he worked with, he tried to keep his \u201ceye on the ball\u201d and do the best he could for crime victims and the community. Focusing on a rank, he said, would have been a distraction.\n\n\u201cI understand that in anything you do, you want to achieve more opportunity, and that\u2019s reasonable,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cBut I never really believed in the campaign. Just do your job well and if the department wants to give you more responsibility, they will. I never dreamed that I would be assistant chief. Never. I came in and I would have been excited to be here 30 years as an officer.\u201d\n\nCastor, who is also retiring later this year, called Bennett one of the kindest, smartest and most ethical people she has ever met.\n\n\u201cThose are some big shoes to fill,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I believe the community can take comfort in the fact that a lot of his strategies and initiatives will continue.\u201d\n\nPolice work is his passion, although Bennett said he didn\u2019t know it at first.\n\nHe was playing baseball and pursuing a degree in architecture when he realized he needed a way to make some more money. Bennett worked three jobs, one of them as a park ranger in Pinellas County during summer breaks. Eventually, that became a full-time gig.\n\nWhile attending night school at the University of South Florida, he met a Tampa Police Department recruiter.\n\n\u201cHe was the epitome of a police officer,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe had that stoic physique and everything. I said, \u2018This is me. This is what I need to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn November 1985, when Bennett was 21, he enrolled in the police academy.\n\n\u201cI was in love with this place from day one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was me. They couldn\u2019t even get me to go home at night when I started riding the street.\u201d\n\nSeveral years later, he tried out for the SWAT team. He later wound up commanding it. He was named executive officer to the chief and served in the homicide division. In 2005, he was named major overseeing District II, which spans north Tampa. Under his leadership, crime in that area declined by about 34 percent in 2009, according to the department.\n\nAfter the events of 9/11, Castor, who was a captain at the time, asked Bennett to help the department find a new balance between daily police work and the new demands of homeland security, he said. He started the Special Incident Management Unit in 2002 and re-tooled how the department handles big special events.\n\nBennett said his strategy was to figure out a way \u2014 using technology and smarter officer deployments \u2014 to make security efforts and crime fighting more efficient. In 2009, when Tampa hosted the Super Bowl, the police department spent 88 percent less than the two cities that hosted the event before, he said.\n\nHe turned that same strategy to Tampa\u2019s crime around that same time, he said. Under his leadership, officers identified 133 \u201ccrime hotspots\u201d on a grid of the city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re down to seven now,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe Sulphur Springs neighborhood, once a haven of crime, was taken off the grid shortly after the department opened the RICH House, which provides a safe place for the neighborhood kids to go after school, get a snack and work on their homework.\n\nBennett encouraged the department to open another RICH House in Robles Park \u2014 another particularly troubled area \u2014 a little more than a year ago. It has been a great success, he said, and Robles Park was recently taken off the hot list.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of my going-away present,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nHis methods were also praised after the RNC two years ago, when he was seen kneeling in the streets negotiating with protesters who were blocking the roads. The department took some criticism for the number of police officers that were seen during the convention, but Bennett said he is proud of his plan, which kept everyone \u2014 protesters, delegates and police officers \u2014 hydrated, safe and calm.\n\nHe was prepared for the worst if a protest or rally got out of control, but he figured it would be worthwhile to try to address potential problems beforehand, he said.\n\n\u201cI think all the front-end work everybody did allowed the back end to go as well as it did,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThirty years after he first put on a uniform, Bennett still loves the job, he said. He has no immediate plans for what he\u2019ll do in his retirement, although he hopes to continue working in the criminal justice field.\n\n\u201cI plan on being a part of the department for as long as I can because it\u2019s done well for me and my family,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThis is my love.\u201d\n\nBennett will collect about $8,200 a month on his pension, city records show.\n\nHe\u2019ll spend a little bit more time with his four children and his wife of almost 20 years. He doesn\u2019t think his morning schedule \u2014 up around 4 to be at the gym by 5, drop the kids off at school and then church by 7:30 \u2014 will change all that much. He\u2019ll continue to coach his kids\u2019 football and baseball teams.\n\nBut not showing up at work every day will be a strange sensation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just weird,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to explain it.\u201d\n\nBennett is one of several high-level police officials retiring this year, \u201cpassing the torch\u201d onto the next generation of police officers, the mayor said.\n\nIt\u2019s almost poetic that a new batch of officers will be sworn in on the same day he is retiring, Bennett said.\n\n\u201cMaybe somebody will get my badge number,\u201d he said.\n\nEbehrman@Tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7691\n\nTwitter: @LizBehrmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 01 Feb 2015 13:12:01 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Even though Tuesday is his last day on the job, Assistant Police Chief John Bennett has barely had time to think about what he\u2019ll do next.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Even though Tuesday is his last day on the job, Assistant Police Chief John Bennett has barely had time to think about what he\u2019ll do next.", "title": "Tampa\u2019s assistant police chief retiring after 30 years", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/tampas-assistant-police-chief-retiring-after-30-years-20150201/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150201/ARTICLE/150209951/EP/1/1/EP-150209951.jpg", "height": 2754}, "updated_time": "2015-02-01T15:18:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Even though Tuesday is his last day on the job, Assistant Police Chief John Bennett has barely had time to think about what he\u2019ll do next.", "title": "Tampa\u2019s assistant police chief retiring after 30 years", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150201/ARTICLE/150209951/AR/0/AR-150209951.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-01T13:12:01Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-01T15:18:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf22d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe was the epitome of a police officer,\u201d Bennett said.\nEven though Tuesday is his last day on the job, Assistant Police Chief John Bennett has barely had time to think about what he\u2019ll do next.\nI\u2019m going to have to come in as a guest.\u201dBennett is handing in his badge after exactly 30 years with the Tampa Police department.\nIt\u2019s almost poetic that a new batch of officers will be sworn in on the same day he is retiring, Bennett said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably not a job in the department that he hasn\u2019t done and done superbly well,\u201d Mayor Bob Buckhorn said."}
