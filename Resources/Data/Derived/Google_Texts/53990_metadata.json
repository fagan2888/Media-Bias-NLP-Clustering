Two scientists from Rutgers University confirmed the invasion of a Japanese species in the Journal of Economic Entomology. Metropolis spoke with Jessica Ware, one of the paper\u2019s three authors, herself an evolutionary biologist with a specialty in roaches and termites, which she calls \u201cfancy cockroaches.\u201d\n\nWSJ: Is this the beginning of the end? Is this the Godzilla of roaches? The snakehead fish of roaches?\n\nMs. Ware: This was bound to happen. Humans are very good at moving insects around the world. None of the species in the city today are native. Some people think many came over from Africa on slave ships. This is going to happen anywhere you have foreign plants and food carts and human traffic and wilderness.\n\nWSJ: Is that whole shaggy, let-it-grow-wild aesthetic of High Line partly to blame?\n\nMs. Ware: Absolutely not. This could have happened just as easily in a manicured lawn.\n\nWSJ: What many people are focusing on is that this Japanese species is capable of surviving in extreme cold \u2014 in ice, in snow, outside \u2014 whereas the roaches we know need warmth and tend to stay indoors. It\u2019s bad enough people talk about how roaches will always survive any nuclear war. Now they\u2019re great at New York winters, too? In our dirty snow?\n\nMs. Ware: Roaches have been doing what they\u2019ve been doing for 50 million years. That\u2019s a lot of time to get really good at it. They will survive long after we\u2019re gone. What this will do is make us rethink our pest control strategies.\n\nWSJ: How?\n\nMs. Ware: What tends to happen is you spray an apartment at a time, so the roaches just move around the building. Now they\u2019ll also be able to just wait outside, even if you spray the whole building at once.\n\nWSJ: Your report makes roaches sound pretty horrible. It notes that 13 species of fungus were found on American cockroaches at a single hospital in Brazil. They add to asthma, to allergies, to pneumonia. Is there anything good that they do? Y\u2019know, like spiders eat flies.\n\nMs. Ware: They scavenge. They help things decompose. A lot of what makes them carriers of all these bad things is because of the way we deal with them, with sprays that force them into pipes or dark places, where they might get molds or sewage or pathogens on them.\n\nWSJ: You sound almost sympathetic. I get that you\u2019re a scientist and this is exciting for you, but do normal people have anything to fear? The High Line snakes awfully close to people\u2019s apartments.\n\nMs. Ware: Just do what you already do. Vacuum often. Use a dehumidifier, which damages their eggs. But mostly all this means is that you might see some roaches in the winter, whereas you mostly used to see them in the summer.\n\nWSJ: And, I mean, who\u2019s really on the High Line in January, anyway?\n\nMs. Ware: Exactly.\n\nWSJ: Your report also says \u201cecological dynamics between [this species] and other cockroach species already present in dwellings are unknown\u201d but also that your guess is that the genitalia between species are \u201cincompatible.\u201d Sometimes species hybridize and we get, say, a horse and a donkey making a mule, which can\u2019t reproduce. But sometimes we get scary things like ligers, which are bigger than either lions or tigers. So it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess?\n\nMs. Ware: It\u2019s not like roaches are terrible. There are 4,500 species and only 2% are what we\u2019d call nuisances or pests. We\u2019ve seen some, in Guyana, Ecuador, Peru, Namibia, that are gorgeous: turquoise, pink, just beautiful.\n\nWSJ: Ugh, why couldn\u2019t we get one of those awesome species invading? I mean, that\u2019d be great with all the art galleries there.\n\nMs. Ware: I know, right?", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A new species of roach has been discovered in High Line Park.
