Trump pointed out how Perry and Graham have seen low poll numbers after speaking against him, and said that Paul is heading in the same direction.\n\nFrom there, Trump attacked Paul for \u201cusing the people of Kentucky\u201d by standing against him and running for president while he is still serving as one of the state\u2019s senators.\n\n\u201cEither run for Senate and do a good job or run for president. You don\u2019t run for president and say if I don\u2019t make it, I will become your senator reluctantly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf I were a good, strong Republican from Kentucky, I would run against him in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nTrump wondered aloud whether Paul\u2019s constituents would be so willing to take Paul back in the event that his presidential bid fails.\n\n\u201cThe people of Kentucky should get a senator that wants to represent them, not a senator where it\u2019s a backup plan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf I was in Kentucky, I would run against him, and believe me, I would win.\u201d\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[image via screengrab]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump attacked Rand Paul at his New Hampshire press event, saying that the senator was \"using\" his Kentucky constituents to make up his base while", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PicMonkey-Collage-Trump7.jpg", "title": "Trump: Someone in GOP Should Run for Senator Against Rand Paul"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump attacked Rand Paul at his New Hampshire press event, saying that the senator was \"using\" his Kentucky constituents to make up his base while considering his position as a backup plan.", "title": "Trump: Someone in GOP Should Run for Senator Against Rand Paul", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PicMonkey-Collage-Trump7.jpg", "creator": "@KenMeyer91", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-08-14T21:07:14+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda159\"", "article_summary": "You don\u2019t run for president and say if I don\u2019t make it, I will become your senator reluctantly,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cThe people of Kentucky should get a senator that wants to represent them, not a senator where it\u2019s a backup plan,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cEither run for Senate and do a good job or run for president.\nTrump pointed out how Perry and Graham have seen low poll numbers after speaking against him, and said that Paul is heading in the same direction.\n\u201cIf I was in Kentucky, I would run against him, and believe me, I would win.\u201dPlease enable Javascript to watch."}
