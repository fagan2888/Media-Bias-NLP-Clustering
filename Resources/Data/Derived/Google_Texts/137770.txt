Vice President Joe Biden surprised talk show host Ellen DeGeneres on her birthday, giving her a bathrobe with the White House Seal on it.

"A gift to Ellen from Joe, so you’re comfortable," Biden said on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."

Biden appeared on the show to talk about the Affordable Care Act, saying he wants "every mom out there to tell their adult child between the ages of 26 and 35 sign up, for no other reason than give mom peace of mind."

"It’s easy, it’s finally working, the website," Biden said.

Biden also discussed President Barack Obama's State of the Union address with DeGeneres, but he played coy when asked about his Valentine's Day plans, saying he and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, are doing "a lot and I’m not gonna tell you."

Biden, disappointingly, did not dance with DeGeneres.

"Can't dance, don't make me," he said to DeGeneres after coming out for his interview.

Biden's appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" airs Monday.
