Tyler Ulis and Alex Poythress pulled Kentucky within 69-67 on free throws, but Bryant hit two from the line with 10 seconds to go to seal the win.\n\nUlis scored 27 points for Kentucky (27-9), which suffered its earliest NCAA Tournament exit since 2008 \u2014 when it lost to a Marquette team then led by current Indiana coach Tom Crean.\n\nFreshman Jamal Murray added 16 for the Wildcats, but he was just 1 of 9 on 3s. Fellow freshman Skal Labissiere was 2 of 6 shooting with five boards, and Isaiah Briscoe had seven points with three turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best, but maybe it\u2019s because of them that we didn\u2019t play our best. We missed a ton of open shots we normally don\u2019t miss,\u201d Kentucky coach John Calipari said.\n\nIndiana went on a 9-2 run with Ferrell on the bench after he picked up his third foul. Ferrell quickly went back in, and the Hoosiers pushed their lead to 62-52 on a Bryant dunk.\n\nAn O.G. Anunoby block and another Bryant dunk proved huge for the Hoosiers \u2014 especially after Troy Williams fouled Ulis from 3-point range to give Kentucky life.\n\n\u201cThese kids aren\u2019t machines. They\u2019re no computers. Stuff happens and you try to figure it out,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is take away from what Indiana did. Indiana \u2014 they played every kid on that court, gave everything they had and they deserved to win this game.\u201d\n\nIt had been four years since these once-longtime rivals had faced each other; a Sweet 16 game that Kentucky won 102-90 on its way to a national title.\n\nThis one had the feel of an Elite Eight-type matchup from the opening basket.\n\nStill, Kentcuky somehow let Indiana go into halftime with a 33-32 lead.\n\nJohnson went to the locker room with five minutes left after hitting a pair of early 3s, and Ferrell took 12 minutes to knock down a bucket.\n\nKentucky looked set to run away with it too, especially after Murray followed a Ulis 3 from the \u201cMarch Madness\u201d logo with a dunk. But the Wildcats went nearly five minutes without a basket to close the first, allowing the Hoosiers to inch out in front.\n\nIndiana pushed it to six before Murray and Ulis 3s pulled Kentucky even at 38-all. But that would prove to be Murray\u2019s last made 3, and an Anunoby 3 with 6:53 left put the Hoosiers back on top, 56-50.\n\n\u201cWe broke down on those plays and those are plays that we\u2019re usually able to come back to,\u201d Kentucky\u2019s Marcus Lee said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to get back from them.\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats committed 16 turnovers with just eight assists\u2026 Kentucky went just 4 of 16 on 3s\u2026 Ulis and Murray were the only Wildcats in double figures.\n\nIndiana: Ferrell became Indiana\u2019s leader in games played with 136\u2026 Reserve freshman forward Juwan Morgan injured his left shoulder early in the second half. After a trip to the locker room, Morgan returned in a sling.\n\nSTAR POWER:\n\nUlis did everything he could to will Kentucky to victory. He was 10 of 20 shooting, hitting three 3s and calmly knocking down all of his free throws after the Williams foul. Murray, on the other hand, was just 7 of 18 shooting \u2014 and only four other Wildcats hit baskets.\n\nQUOTABLE:\n\n\u201cThe big picture of this is we\u2019re all right. Now I\u2019m going to have a brand new team again next year, surprise!\u201d Calipari said.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nIndiana will play either North Carolina or Providence Friday in Philadelphia.\n\nKentucky\u2019s season is finished.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Indiana tops Kentucky 73-67 for Sweet 16 berth", "title": "Indiana tops Kentucky 73-67 for Sweet 16 berth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/indiana-tops-kentucky-73-67-for-sweet-16-berth/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516569510p1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516569510p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T17:56:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:27:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Indiana went on a 9-2 run with Ferrell on the bench after he picked up his third foul.\nIndiana took control with a 17-4 run to go up 10 with four minutes left.\nTIP-INS:Kentucky: The Wildcats committed 16 turnovers with just eight assists\u2026 Kentucky went just 4 of 16 on 3s\u2026 Ulis and Murray were the only Wildcats in double figures.\nIndiana: Ferrell became Indiana\u2019s leader in games played with 136\u2026 Reserve freshman forward Juwan Morgan injured his left shoulder early in the second half.\nIndiana pushed it to six before Murray and Ulis 3s pulled Kentucky even at 38-all."}
