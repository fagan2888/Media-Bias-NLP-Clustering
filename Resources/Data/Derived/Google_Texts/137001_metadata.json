Those polled indicated by a 53- to 32-percent margin that the process demanded by the government\u2019s \u201caccommodation\u201d is \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmandate\u201d in question is a regulation adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2014 popularly called ObamaCare \u2014 that requires non-church employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees. While churches are exempt from the mandate, faith-based organizations such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Roman Catholic religious order engaged in caring for impoverished elderly people, did not automatically qualify for such an exemption.\n\nIn order to be exempted, the order would have had to file an EBSA Form 700, but the sisters objected to filing the form because they believed that doing so would make the order complicit in providing medical contraception, a practice regarded as sinful by Catholic doctrine.\n\nOn December 31, 2013, the day before the filing requirement was to come into effect, Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor granted them a temporary injunction, allowing them to simply inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services of their objections, pending resolution of the legal case they are party to.\n\nThe case currently before the Supreme Court is Zubik v. Burwell. (The full name of the case is David A. Zubik et al. v. Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al. Zubik is the bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.) Last November, the Supreme Court decided it would review the case combined with six other similar challenges to the contraceptive mandate. Along with Zubik v. Burwell, the six other cases include Priests for Life v. Burwell, Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell, Geneva College v. Burwell, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Burwell, East Texas Baptist University v. Burwell, and Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell.\n\nOn March 29, the Supreme Court directed the parties to the case \u201cto file supplemental briefs that address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners' employees through petitioners' insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees.\u201d\n\nThe Court suggested a possible scheme where petitioners would obtain insurance without contraceptive coverage and \u201cpetitioners' insurance company, aware that petitioners are not providing certain contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, would separately notify petitioners' employees that the insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners' health plan.\u201d\n\nCarl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, which sponsored the Marist poll, made the following statement about the case on April 18:\n\nIt is not reasonable for the government to demand that some \u2014 and only some \u2014 religious employers engage in activity that is totally unnecessary to the government\u2019s stated purpose of providing elective and morally problematic drugs to employees.\n\nSuch action doesn\u2019t just violate the rights of employers like the Little Sisters, it is also at odds with the American people\u2019s understanding of basic fairness, and our long-standing commitment to protecting the deeply-held beliefs of every American \u2014 especially when those beliefs are the minority view.\n\nBack in 2014, in a 5-4 decision the Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that some for-profit companies are exempt from the contraceptive mandate, if they object on religious grounds, because the accommodation offered to objecting non-profits would be a less restrictive way to achieve the ACA\u2019s interest.\n\nAs was noted in an article posted here in March, however:\n\nThough the Hobby Lobby ruling last year determined that family-owned businesses run on religious principles should be permitted to opt out of the contraceptive mandate for religious reasons, the case currently before the court [Zubik v. Burwell] concerns whether religious nonprofits should be granted exemptions from the controversial mandate.\n\nThat article continued:\n\nThe court ruled 5-4 in favor of the religious companies in the Hobby Lobby ruling. But without Justice Scalia, the count in this case is very likely to be 4-4. A split decision on the court would allow the lower court rulings to stand.\n\nEight appeals courts have upheld the ACA mandate for non-church religious institutions, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled the other way, supporting the challenge by religious non-profit institutions.\n\nIt is very likely, therefore, that this matter will not be settled until a ninth justice is added to the Supreme Court and the new court decides a follow-up case by a majority vote.\n\nPhoto of Little Sisters of the Poor protesting the HHS mandate outside the U.S. Supreme Court: AP Images\n\nRelated articles:\n\nReligious Nonprofits Take ObamaCare Contraceptive Mandate to Supreme Court\n\nLittle Sisters of the Poor Fighting for Religious Liberty\n\nWhite House May Compromise on Contraception Mandate\n\nNOW Puts Little Sisters of the Poor on \"Dirty Hundred\" List\n\nSupreme Court Sides With College Against Contraception Mandate\n\nSupreme Court Rules for Religious Liberty in Hobby Lobby Case\n\nCourt Delays ObamaCare Mandate for Two Christian Colleges\n\nObama Meets Pope Amid Catholic Lawsuits Against ObamaCare\n\nSupreme Court to Hear Hobby Lobby Contraception Mandate Case\n\nCourt Rules Against Notre Dame on Contraception Mandate\n\nLittle Sisters Win Another Round Against Contraception Mandate\n\nWill ObamaCare Drive the Little Sisters of the Poor Out of the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Marist poll, most, surveyed, Obama administration, federal, contraception mandate, unfair, Little Sisters of the Poor, religious groups, Supreme Court, Zubik v.
