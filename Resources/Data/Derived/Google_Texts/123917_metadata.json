The contract runs until Dec. 2018 and includes some innovative provisions.\n\n\u201cThis contract agreement proves that collective bargaining results in creative solutions to complex problems,\u201d said Mayor Lester E. Taylor III. \u201cCWA brings fresh ideas to the table as alternatives to cost-shifting and I am anxious to see what we will be able to do together.\u201d\n\nThe contract includes the creation of an innovative Labor-Management Committee to explore how provisions in the Affordable Care Act can reduce overall healthcare costs, such as developing robust primary care using Direct Primary Care Medical Homes.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the results,\u201d said Bennie Brantley, President of Local 1077. \u201cWhen we were deadlocked, the Mayor came to the table himself and helped to move everyone closer to settlement.\u201d\n\nThe agreement provides for flat across the board increases the first two years, of $500 and $750 respectively, and then 2%, 2.25% and 2.5%. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rich deal, but it\u2019s a fair deal,\u201d added Brantley.\n\n\u201cOne of the best features of this agreement,\u201d added Hetty Rosenstein, NJ CWA Director, \u201cis the provision that phases in a minimum wage of $15 an hour by the end of the contract. There aren\u2019t a lot of workers who fall into this category, but for those who do, this provides them with a living wage. CWA applauds the Mayor for his foresight in making sure that people who live and work in East Orange are paid a living wage.\u201d\n\nThe new CWA contract puts East Orange in the forefront of a labor movement that is progressively gaining momentum locally, statewide and throughout the nation,\u201d said Mayor Taylor, referring to Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto\u2019s (D-32) and Assemblyman John Wisniewski\u2019s (D-19) introduction of legislation that calls for increasing New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour. \u201cEast Orange has already demonstrated support for this increase and we will continue to support smart legislation that provides long-term benefits to strengthen working families in our communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "East Orange Ratifies New Contract With CWA Increasing Wages To $15/Hour", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "East Orange Ratifies New Contract With CWA Increasing Wages To $15/Hour", "title": "East Orange Ratifies New Contract With CWA Increasing Wages To $15/Hour", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2016/02/east-orange-ratifies-new-contract-with-cwa-increasing-wages-to-15hour/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-04 12:09:51", "sailthru.title": "East Orange Ratifies New Contract With CWA Increasing Wages To $15/Hour", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "east orange", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2016-02-04T17:09:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T17:09:51+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/connie-jackson"}, "sailthru.description": "East Orange Ratifies New Contract With CWA Increasing Wages To $15/Hour", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "East Orange"}, "article_summary": "East Orange, NJ, February 4, 2016 \u2013 The Communications Workers of America, Local 1077 and the City of East Orange announced completion of a ratified Contract Agreement that will benefit East Orange municipal workers and the residents of East Orange.\n\u201cThis contract agreement proves that collective bargaining results in creative solutions to complex problems,\u201d said Mayor Lester E.
