Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe move comes just four days before the April 18 deadline to file individual tax returns. That timing was intentional, Jordan said. His group designed the move to spotlight issue during a week when \u201cAmerican are dealing with the IRS in an up close and personal way.\u201d\n\nAlready written up, the impeachment articles remain mired in committee. And while conservatives can exert political pressure by rallying public opinion, they can\u2019t technically advance the process.\n\nOnly Goodlatte can do that.\n\nLast October, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, delivered impeachment articles to the Judiciary Committee for consideration. Since then, Goodlatte hasn\u2019t brought it up for a vote.\n\nThat delay has sparked considerable frustration among conservatives, said Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., one of the architects of the Freedom Caucus push.\n\n\u201cObviously we haven\u2019t had the success that we hoped for getting leadership to move forward with this,\u201d DeSantis told The Daily Signal. \u201cAnytime we flex our muscle, I think that they feel we\u2019ll get criticized by the press and it\u2019ll backfire on us somehow and they\u2019re very hesitant to make any waves.\u201d\n\nIf impeached by the House, Koskinen would face a trial in the Senate. He would become just the 20th federal official to be put on congressional trial in American history.\n\nDeSantis and Jordan stressed that the case against the tax collector is meant as a political check against the IRS and not a criminal prosecution. The two point to Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, who wrote that impeachment was warranted for dereliction of duty in 1883.\n\nDeSantis, a former federal prosecutor, argues that Koskinen flouted congressional authority when he didn\u2019t comply with a congressional investigation, allowed subpoenaed emails to be destroyed, and misled the public during his testimony.\n\n\u201cThis has been a total obstruction of justice. And the question is, will Congress do anything when an agency like that walks all over us? Or are we just going to let it happen?\u201d DeSantis asked.\n\nLast July, when there were calls for Koskinen to be removed, White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz called him \u201ca man of the highest integrity,\u201d according to the Washington Times, and the Treasury Department similarly defended him, saying in a statement that \u201cCommissioner Koskinen is a man of the highest integrity with a steadfast commitment to public service during difficult times,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\nBut GOP leadership isn\u2019t likely to provide an answer to DeSantis\u2019 question until after the November election.\n\nAt a Thursday press conference, Ryan said that the IRS \u201cneeds to be cleaned up,\u201d but stopped short of calling for Koskinen\u2019s impeachment. \u201cWhat I think we need to do is win an election, get better people in these agencies, and reform the tax code,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nIn 2010, the IRS began flagging applications from conservatives groups applying for non-profit tax status. Specifically, IRS agents targeted applications that included terms such as \u201ctea party,\u201d \u201cpatriot,\u201d and \u201cgovernment-spending.\u201d\n\nWhen the scandal came to light, Lois Lerner, director of the IRS Exempt Organization Unit, stepped down from her position in Sept. 2013. And in May of 2014, the House voted to hold her in contempt of congress for refusing to testify.\n\nConservatives want to tap into taxpayer frustration to make their argument that Koskinen must go.\n\n\u201cAt tax time, people are going to say, \u2018gee, if the IRS asks for document from me and I destroy them, I wouldn\u2019t get away with that,\u2019\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cBut that\u2019s effectively what Commissioner Koskinen has been able to get away with.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While most members are headed home to their districts, conservatives are re-launching a campaign to can the IRS commissioner.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "While most members are headed home to their districts, conservatives are re-launching a campaign to can the IRS commissioner.", "title": "Conservatives Say IRS Commissioner Needs to Go", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160414_IRS2.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-14T23:22:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QaDGdo"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "While most members are headed home to their districts, conservatives are re-launching a campaign to can the IRS commissioner.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160414_IRS2.png"}, "title": "Conservatives Say IRS Commissioner Needs to Go", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2016-04-14T18:49:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:22:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "IRS, Impeachment, House Freedom Caucus, John Koskinen, Jason Chaffetz, Filing Deadline, Tax season"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut that\u2019s effectively what Commissioner Koskinen has been able to get away with.\u201dGoodlatte\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nAt a Thursday press conference, Ryan said that the IRS \u201cneeds to be cleaned up,\u201d but stopped short of calling for Koskinen\u2019s impeachment.\nIn 2010, the IRS began flagging applications from conservatives groups applying for non-profit tax status.\n\u201cAt tax time, people are going to say, \u2018gee, if the IRS asks for document from me and I destroy them, I wouldn\u2019t get away with that,\u2019\u201d DeSantis said.\nThat delay has sparked considerable frustration among conservatives, said Rep.
