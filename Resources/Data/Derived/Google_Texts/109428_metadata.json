You and I have discussed this many times, and I don\u2019t see any results yet.\u201d\n\nThat was at an April committee hearing on Obamacare implementation. Here are two bits of irony:\n\nIn September, Baucus had himself a little chuckle as he conceded that he no longer predicted trains flying off the tracks. He said what he said for effect, out of genuine concern that the rollout was in jeopardy. Less than a month before the Oct. 1 launch, he was satisfied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Oct. 1, but I think they are doing a pretty good job,\u201d Baucus said in an interview with Fox Business Network. \u201cI think the train is going to keep running, maybe not totally on time, but it\u2019s going to be pretty efficient.\u201d\n\nAs we know in the clarity of hindsight, Baucus was right the first time. Or, at least, if this rollout isn\u2019t a train wreck, it\u2019s a 16-car pileup at the entrance to the train station.\n\nThe other irony is from Baucus\u2019 original quote. The someone he was addressing \u2014 \u201cYou and I have discussed this many times \u2026\u201d \u2014 was Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the Obama administration official whose primary responsibility for the last three-plus years has been on display since Oct. 1.\n\nToday, Sebelius is dodging further congressional scrutiny, although her office says she fully intends to testify \u201cnext week,\u201d after she clears more important items from her calendar. So a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing into her No. 1 project apparently will go forward Thursday without her perspective and expertise.\n\nHer boss, meanwhile, was left to tout a 1-800 number in the White House Rose Garden yesterday like some cleaned-up but angry Vince Offer, while she sat quietly in the audience.\n\nFollow @MikeHashimoto\n\n", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2RhbGxhc21vcm5pbmd2aWV3c2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC9pcy10aGlzLW1heC1iYXVjdXMtb2JhbWFjYXJlLXRyYWluLXdyZWNrLW9yLWp1c3QtY2xvc2UuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Mike Hashimoto", "og": {"site_name": "Opinion Blog", "description": "Irony, meet Max Baucus Baucus, chair of the\u00a0powerful Senate Finance Committee and a key architect of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, announced last spring that he was hanging\u2026", "title": "Is this Max Baucus\u2019 Obamacare train wreck or just close?", "url": "http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/2013/10/is-this-max-baucus-obamacare-train-wreck-or-just-close.html/", "image": "http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-10-22T09:35:04Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "jTekCA_uXnGm9Z2Lrjq_KcgQ6RoxQOg9cAyQxnvyx-Y", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2751\"", "article_summary": "Or, at least, if this rollout isn\u2019t a train wreck, it\u2019s a 16-car pileup at the entrance to the train station.\nBefore he left, though, he famously offered the quote that would launch a thousand dire warnings about the Affordable Care Act: \u201cI just see a huge train wreck coming down.\nYou and I have discussed this many times, and I don\u2019t see any results yet.\u201dThat was at an April committee hearing on Obamacare implementation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Oct. 1, but I think they are doing a pretty good job,\u201d Baucus said in an interview with Fox Business Network.\nThe other irony is from Baucus\u2019 original quote."}
