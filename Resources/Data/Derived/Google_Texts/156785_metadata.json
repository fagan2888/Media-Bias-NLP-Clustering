Employers added only 74,000 jobs in December, the smallest job increase in three years and far below the 200,000 expected. The new number was well below the 182,000 average for all of 2012 and 2013 through November and less than the approximately 150,000 needed for population growth and replacing retirees.\n\nThe dismal number of new jobs was blamed in part on severe weather and increased retirements from an aging population, but too much importance should not be assigned to these factors. The really severe, record-breaking weather so far this winter occurred in early January so would not be reflected in the December figures. And the loss of jobs among prime-age workers was far larger than for older ones. Among workers ages 45 to 54, the labor participation rate dropped 0.4% to 79.2%, the lowest since 1988. For workers 55 and older, the rate was only down 0.1 percent.\n\nThe jobless rate fell to 6.7% from 7%, but most of the people responsible for the decline simply dropped out of the labor force. Less than one-third of them found a job; the rest just quit looking for one, perhaps too discouraged to continue. In December, 2.6 million workers were looking for a job for more than a year. The most significant job gains (55,000) were in low paying jobs, and 40,000 others were for temporary help. Those aren\u2019t signs of a healthy economy.\n\nTotal employment is still about 2 million less than when the recession started. That is a shocking figure, but perhaps the most shocking statistic of all is that the labor participation rate is the lowest in 35 years, going all the way back to 1978.\n\nThe graph shows that the poor performance during Obama\u2019s presidency essentially took place after the end of the recession. He took office on January 20, 2009, and the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. (The graph ends with a slight uptick as of Q3 2013, but the 1.8% gain was lost in the fourth quarter of 2013.)\n\nScarcely three weeks after Obama\u2019s inauguration, Congress on February 14 passed his $787 billion stimulus bill (later adjusted to $812 billion.) When Obama took office, the unemployment rate was 7.4%. The Obama administration promised that if the stimulus bill was passed, the rate would not exceed 8%, and Obama himself stated it would decline to 5.6% by July 2012. Instead the rate rose to 10% and remained above 9% for more than forty months.\n\nThe argument that Obama inherited a severe recession that requires a longer recovery time is without merit, says John B. Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford University. He cites the research of Michael Bordo and Joseph Haubrich of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank as having \u201cblown holes in that argument.\u201d He writes:\n\nRecoveries from deep recessions with financial crises have been stronger, not weaker, than recoveries following shallower recessions. These strong recoveries average about 6% real GDP growth per year, compared to only 2% per year in this recovery.\n\nWith holes blown in this possible defense of Obama\u2019s record, it is clear that the blame for the poor economy from 2009 to today in 2014 rests entirely on the misguided policies of Obama.\n\nThe administration said the stimulus spending would create three to four million new jobs. Of course, the unemployment figures alone tell you that never happened. And the jobs that were created were incredibly costly and wasteful. According to the Congressional Budget Office, every job created by the stimulus program cost the taxpayers between $500,000 and $4 million.\n\nThe idea that government spending would stimulate the economy can be traced to John Maynard Keynes. He claimed government spending produced a multiplier effect through a chain reaction of additional spending in the economy. The gigantic spending of the stimulus program was sold to Congress on the basis of a Keynesian multiplier of 1.5, meaning the GDP will increase by $1.50 for every dollar of government spending.\n\nBut in my new book, The Impending Monetary Revolution, the Dollar and Gold, I point out that extensive research has shown the Keynesian multiplier is always less than 1.0. That means the money that is spent over and over again in the private sector from the government spending is always less than the cost of the programs. If it weren\u2019t, the U.S., Greece, and other spendthrift countries wouldn\u2019t be going broke\u2014they\u2019d be getting richer the more they spent!\n\nMy book quotes Brian Westbury, former chief economist for the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, who wrote \u201cthe larger the government share of GDP, the higher the unemployment rate. In other words, when it comes to jobs, government spending has a multiplier of less than one\u2014government spending destroys jobs.\u201d Also, Harvard Professor Robert Barro, who has studied Keynesian multipliers as thoroughly as anyone, concludes, \u201cThere is no meaningful theoretical or empirical support for the Keynesian position.\u201d\n\nFranklin Roosevelt adopted Keynes\u2019 economic ideas to try to pull the country out of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but extensive research has shown the opposite effect: they prolonged the depression. It should not be a surprise that similar policies by Obama produced similar effects regardless of promises of \u201chope and change\u201d and exclamations of \u201cYes we can!\u201d\n\nThe futility of the Keynesian approach was explained to the House Ways and Means committee late in FDR\u2019s second term by his treasury secretary and good friend Henry Morgenthau Jr. On May 9, 1939, he testified: \u201cWe have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work\u2026.After eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started\u2026.And an enormous debt to boot.\u201d In May 1939 the unemployment rate edged above 20%.\n\nHunter Lewis, author of the book Where Keynes Went Wrong, says, \u201cThere is no evidence\u201d that spending ever cured a recession, and Keynes \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly interested in evidence.\u201d Keynes believed spending\u2014for anything\u2014was the driver of the economy. He even endorsed printing money with expiration dates so people would be forced to spend it. That, of course, would destroy savings, leaving the people unable to provide for their future (and dependent on the government), and eliminate investments needed for economic growth. Lewis says Keynes:\n\nsuggested that the government could print new money. That money would flow into the economy in the form of debt, and that would take the place of savings, but there is just no evidence for that at all, there is no logic behind that. In fact, if you want a good economy, what you need is savings, and you need then to invest those savings, and you need to invest those savings in a wise way. . . . Of course, Keynes completely ignores the issue of how you are investing. For him, not only is any investment equivalent to any other investment, but spending is equivalent to investment. (Emphasis added.)\n\nOf course, if that is the case then it is unimportant that every new job from the stimulus program costs $500,000 to $4 million. That investment is as good as any other. If that doesn\u2019t work, print more money. The important thing is the spending. In an article in Redbook magazine in 1934, in answer to the question \u201cCan America spend its way into recovery,\u201d Keynes answered, \u201cWhy, obviously, the very behavior that would make a man poor, could make a nation wealthy.\u201d\n\nKeynes intent was \u201cpositive social improvements,\u201d namely, the redistribution of wealth. In his 1940 book, How to Pay for the War, Keynes wrote, \u201cI have endeavored to snatch from the exigency of war positive social improvements. The complete scheme now proposed\u2026embodies an advance toward economic equality greater than any which we have made.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nYou can see why Keynes\u2019 ideas are so appealing to Obama, who in December 2013 declared economic inequality is the \u201cDefining challenge of our time. . . . That\u2019s why I ran for president. . . . It drives everything I do in this office.\u201d\n\nOn the floor of the Constitutional Convention on June 26, 1787, Alexander Hamilton declared, \u201cInequality will exist as long as liberty exists. It unavoidably results from that very liberty itself.\u201d Our Founding Fathers chose liberty; Obama has chosen economic equality\u2014necessarily at the expense of liberty. When he told \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d during the presidential campaign in 2008 , \u201cI think when you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d he was advocating the redistribution of wealth at the expense of not only Joe\u2019s liberty and property but of his inalienable right to use his own money for the pursuit of his own happiness. The Founders expected property rights to be the principal means for exercising that right. The distribution of wealth was to be determined not by force but by freedom, not by government but left to the people to determine for themselves by exercising their rights. It would be whatever distribution results from the labor of free men and their free (voluntary) exchanges with each other. A free-market economy is the only one appropriate for a free people.\n\nThe word \u201cliberty\u201d is mentioned in both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The former says it is an \u201cunalienable right\u201d in the famous phrase that links it to the rights to life and the pursuit of happiness. The Premable of the Constitution gives \u201cto secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity\u201d as a reason to \u201cestablish this Constitution.\u201d Nowhere do either of these two founding documents of our government mention economic equality or redistribution of wealth. The \u201cdefining challenge\u201d of our time is not economic inequality. It is preventing people such as Obama from perverting his office and our Constitution and making the U.S. more representative of Karl Marx\u2019s class warfare and his dictum \u201cFrom each according to his ability; to each according to his need\u201d than to the ideas of our Founding Fathers.\n\nThe \u201ctransformational change\u201d Obama promised has been very expensive. Regulations have proliferated. On August 1, 2013, Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the American Action Forum, testified before a congressional subcommittee that \u201cmajor\u201d regulations (those costing $100 million or more) and the amount of federal paperwork \u201chave increased significantly over the last five years.\u201d He also said that delays are often the result of \u201chundreds of new requirements from Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act [Obamacare].\u201d He noted, too, that there are more than 9,100 different collections of information for managing the regulatory programs.\n\nIn 2010 Congress passed 129 private-sector mandates, the highest ever recorded. In addition to recording the sheer number of mandates, the Congressional Budget Office records whether mandates exceed the statutory threshold (currently $150 million) under the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. In 2010, Congress passed 25 mandates that would likely exceed the statutory threshold, easily the highest figure on record and more than triple the yearly average from 2002 to 2008. In 2011 more than 340 regulations (\u201cmajor\u201d as well as lesser ones) were proposed, and the Federal Register noted that more than 4,200 others were in the pipeline.\n\nThe CBO also tracks the unfunded mandates on states and local entities. In 2009 and 2010 there were 116 of these unfunded mandates.\n\nBatkins noted, \u201cIt is clear that current regulatory burdens have legislative roots of historic proportions. These figures on mandates are important because they eventually become federal regulations and translate into real costs for private entities and states.\u201d\n\nIn addition to tracking mandates and rulemakings, the American Action Forum tracks the paperwork burden imposed by federal agencies. \u201cBased on our current data for 2013, the federal government has imposed 85 million paperwork burden hours\u2026[and] Americans spend more than 10.34 billion hours annually completing federal paperwork. The supposed cost for this paperwork is $72.8 billion, or $7.04 per hour, less than the federal minimum wage. There are two other measures to monetize the nation\u2019s 10.34 billion hour burden: the median wage of a \u2018compliance officer\u2019 ($31.23) or the real Gross Domestic Product per hour worked ($60.59). Using these two figures, the monetized burden of federal paperwork ranges from $322 to $626 billion annually. These figures include only the paperwork costs of regulation, not deadweight losses or other capital costs.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that federal red tape is growing, and will likely continue to trend upwards with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank. Based on the most recent Information Collection Budget of the U.S., the federal government added 355 million hours in the last fiscal year. To put this figure in perspective, assuming a 2,000-hour work year, it would take 177,500 employees to comply with the new paperwork. Added regulatory burdens, however, should not be thought of as a jobs program.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reported that 2012 was the costliest year on record, at $29.5 billion (in 2001 dollars) and surpassed the second highest total by 57%.\n\nDuplication resulted in huge costs. Based on 17 areas of duplication, the AAF \u201cfound 642 million paperwork hours, $46 billion in costs, and 990 forms of federal overlap. For example, ten different agencies are involved in renewable energy programs and produce 96 related forms.\u201d There were more than 600 different forms relating to veterans\u2019 claims, \u201cimposing millions of paperwork burden hours.\u201d\n\nAll of these regulatory measures cost a great deal of money. They impose enormous costs on the private sector, making it increasing difficult for the economy to grow. But the largest and most dangerous cost is the one that will be paid by everyone for the destruction of the dollar through Keynesian spending by the government and Keynesian printing of money by the Federal Reserve. In his first term of office, Obama added as much to the national debt as all the presidents from George Washington through George W. Bush combined. In the 15 months following collapse of the housing/mortgage bubble in 2008, the Fed created more money than in all the years combined since 1913 when it was founded.\n\nThe recent 19-day partial shutdown of the federal government over raising the national debt ceiling shows it is politically impossible to avert the coming disaster. The fight over the debt ceiling was not about actually cutting government spending\u2014making government live within its means\u2014but about raising the debt ceiling so spending could be increased.\n\nObama had previously appointed a bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, headed by Erskine Bowles and Allan Simpson, both highly respected. This sounded good. It allowed the president to pretend he was serious about the problem. He even promised, \u201cOnce The Bipartisan Fiscal Commission Finishes its work, I will spend the next year making the tough choices necessary to further reduce our deficit and lower our debt.\u201d\n\nThat promise was worth as much as his promise that people could keep their health insurance. That he was insincere about promising to reduce the debt was evident when it came time for dealing with the budget deficit and the national debt ceiling. He totally ignored his NCFRR commission\u2019s calls for immediate and steep cuts and instead insisted on further increases in spending. Finally, the Republicans, anxious to avoid another government shutdown, agreed to a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would pile another $45 billion onto the $17 trillion national debt. The agreed compromise does nothing to reduce government spending, merely kicks the can a little further down the road.\n\nContinuing to increase federal spending is far more serious than might appear. More is at stake here than simply passing a huge cost onto our children and grandchildren\u2014which would be bad enough in itself, and immoral as well\u2014but the problem is worldwide. Every central bank in the world is following the same Keynesian policies, which aren\u2019t working, but they keep doing them anyway. The Fed, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Japan, Switzerland and China have printed an astounding $10 trillion since 2007, tripling the size of their combined balance sheets. To expect governments to repair the economy is to expect the cause to be the cure.\n\nThe U.S. has not\u2014yet\u2014suffered the same results for its extravagant spending as, for example, Greece because of the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency dating from the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. The dollar became the basis of international trade, but that status is being threatened by a loss of confidence because of our debt. Countries are starting to abandon the dollar as an intermediary in foreign trade, turning instead to other currencies and gold. China and Japan, the world\u2019s second and third largest economies, have agreed to bilateral trade in their own currencies, the yuan and the yen, instead of using the dollar as an intermediary. Russia and China trade is in rubles and yuan. India no longer buys Iranian oil in dollars but in rupees. India and Japan have signed a new $15 billion currency swap. Brazil became the first South American country to sign a currency swap agreement with China. Reuters has reported, \u201cFrance intends to set up a currency swap line with China to make Paris a major offshore yuan trading hub in Europe, competing against London.\u201d South Africa, Venezuela, Germany, Cuba, Pakistan, Argentina and others are said to be set to join currency arrangements for trading without the dollar.\n\nThe BRICs (the large developing nations Brazil, Russia, India and China) are said to have agreed to trade in other currencies and periodically settle differences in gold. You can hear this and other interesting comments by Karen Hughes at \u201cKaren Hudes Predicts \u201cPermanent Gold Backwardation\u2019.\u201d She is a woman with 20 years experience at the World Bank, where she was general counsel. She is no longer at the bank, having departed after being a whistleblower on corruption at the bank.\n\nIn my book I noted that the argument put forth that 85% of foreign exchange transactions being denominated in dollars means the dollar won\u2019t be displaced for a very long time. But that 85% figure developed from the dollar\u2019s relative stability and safety over many decades. I wrote that the 85% would erode as people lost confidence in the dollar and that people will likely be surprised by the suddenness of its ultimate collapse. Now the movement away from the dollar is already underway and proceeding faster than I expected.\n\nI shall close with mentioning an article on the problems facing the Federal Reserve, by Phil Gramm and Thomas R. Saving. Gramm, a Ph.D. and former U.S. senator, was a university professor of economics before turning to politics. Thomas Saving, Ph.D., is a professor of economics at Texas A&M university. Their article is quite technical so I won\u2019t discuss it here. If interested, you may find it at the Wall Street Journal. I shall only quote their ending:\n\nThe full bill for this failed policy has yet to arrive. No such explosion of debt has ever escaped a day of reckoning and no such monetary surge has ever had a happy ending.\n\n[First published at American Liberty.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/where-the-u-s-economy-is-going-and-why/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/463694551.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Where the U.S. Economy Is Going, and Why"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He claimed government spending produced a multiplier effect through a chain reaction of additional spending in the economy.\nIf it weren\u2019t, the U.S., Greece, and other spendthrift countries wouldn\u2019t be going broke\u2014they\u2019d be getting richer the more they spent!\nThe idea that government spending would stimulate the economy can be traced to John Maynard Keynes.\nThey impose enormous costs on the private sector, making it increasing difficult for the economy to grow.\nContinuing to increase federal spending is far more serious than might appear."}
