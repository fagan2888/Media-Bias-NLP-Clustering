Deciding which foods are considered \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cunhealthy\u201d gets a little more complicated with the variety of labels found on supermarket shelves, including \u201cgluten-free,\u201d \u201cno sugar added,\u201d \u201c7-Grain, \u201dand \u201cwhole wheat.\u201d Health care triage host and pediatrician Dr. Aaron Carroll has offered up some of his very own healthy eating tips and, unsurprisingly, unprocessed food is the enemy.\n\n\u201cThese are general rules that I live by,\u201d Carroll explains. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones I share with patients, with friends, and with my family. They\u2019re the ones I support as a pediatrician and health services researcher. But let\u2019s acknowledge upfront that these may only apply to healthy people without metabolic disorders.\u201d\n\n1a. Get As Much Of Your Nutrition As Possible From A Variety Of Completely Unprocessed Foods.\n\n1b. Eat Lightly Processed Foods Less Often And With, Unprocessed Foods.\n\n1c. Eat Heavily Processed Foods Even Less Often.\n\n2. Eat As Much Home-Cooked Food As Possible, Which Should Be Prepared According To Rule 1.\n\n3. Use Salt And Fats, Including Butter And Oil, As Needed In Food Preparation.\n\n4. When You Do Eat Out, Try To Eat At Restaurants That Follow The Same Rules.\n\n5. Drink Mostly Water, But Some Alcohol, Coffee And Other Beverages Are Fine.\n\n6. Treat All Beverages With Calories In Them As You Would Alcohol.\n\n7. Eat With Other People, Especially People You Care About, As Often As Possible.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pediatrician, dr, aaron, carroll, tells, us, what, we, should, be, eating, based, what, he, eats", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Health care triage host and pediatrician Dr. Aaron Carroll offers up some of his very own healthy eating habits.", "title": "Doctor Tells Us What We Should Be Eating, Based On What He Eats [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pediatrician-dr-aaron-carroll-tells-us-what-we-should-be-eating-based-what-he-eats-334264", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/20/pediatrician-dr-aaron-carroll-tells-us-what-we-should-be-eating-based-what-he-eats.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health care triage host and pediatrician Dr. Aaron Carroll offers up some of his very own healthy eating habits.", "title": "Doctor Tells Us What We Should Be Eating, Based On What He Eats [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pediatrician-dr-aaron-carroll-tells-us-what-we-should-be-eating-based-what-he-eats-334264", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/20/pediatrician-dr-aaron-carroll-tells-us-what-we-should-be-eating-based-what-he-eats.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/20/pediatrician-dr-aaron-carroll-tells-us-what-we-should-be-eating-based-what-he-eats.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-20T13:40:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T13:40:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health care triage host and pediatrician Dr. Aaron Carroll offers up some of his very own healthy eating habits."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd448c\"", "article_summary": "Eat Lightly Processed Foods Less Often And With, Unprocessed Foods.\nGet As Much Of Your Nutrition As Possible From A Variety Of Completely Unprocessed Foods.\nEat Heavily Processed Foods Even Less Often.\nEat As Much Home-Cooked Food As Possible, Which Should Be Prepared According To Rule 1.\nThey\u2019re the ones I support as a pediatrician and health services researcher."}
