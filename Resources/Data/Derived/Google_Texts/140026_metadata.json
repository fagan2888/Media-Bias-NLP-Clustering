The third, Megan Duncan, 30, of Howell, quickly found a new job and declined to join the suit.\n\nSchorr said the suit marks the first broad legal challenge to a vaccine-or-mask policy outside of a healthcare setting in New Jersey. The mandatory policies have become increasingly common in hospitals across the country in recent years, in part because the Affordable Care Act of 2010 ties some Medicare funding to employee vaccination rates.\n\nLutheran Social Ministries of New Jersey adopted the policy earlier this year and began enforcing it in October, the traditional start of flu season. The agency employs about 630 people statewide at its various facilities, including two nursing homes, a day treatment center for the homeless, an immigration center and shelters for battered women and at-risk children.\n\nWatson, a billing specialist, and Mercurius, an accountant, say they are healthy women and are deeply opposed to the flu shot, which can have serious side effects, including paralysis, in very rare cases.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the women were first assured by a manager they would not have to wear a mask unless they visited clients at the agency's nursing homes or other facilities. Later, the suit states, the company changed its policy to require the mask for unvaccinated workers at its Burlington Township headquarters, where about 30 people work.\n\nIn a Nov. 5 story about the issue, Lutheran Social Ministries' president, Colleen Frankenfield, told NJ Advance Media that clients occasionally visit the headquarters and that the mask could help prevent cross-contamination of workers who regularly travel to other facilities. The company declined comment Monday.\n\nIn the suit, Schorr characterized the agency's policy as nonsensical given the vaccine's hit-or-miss effectiveness.\n\nCiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said the flu vaccine in the 2014-15 flu season was just 23 percent effective on average and just 10 percent effective for those ages 18 to 49.\n\n\"If the defendants were actually interested in preventing the spread of dangerous viruses and if the employer actually believed that masking was an effective method of preventing the spread of dangerous viruses, then the defendants could have and should have required all employees to wear masks at all times regardless of whether they received the flu vaccination,\" he wrote.\n\nIn addition, the suit states, the agency does not require proof of vaccinations for outside vendors who regularly visit the building.\n\nThe suit contends Lutheran violated the whistleblower law after Watson and Mercurius spoke out by suspending them without pay, firing them and challenging their application for unemployment, maintaining they engaged in misconduct.\n\nMark Mueller may be reached at mmueller@njadvancemedia.com.
