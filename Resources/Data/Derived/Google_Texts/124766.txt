Editor's Note: Headline has been cleaned up a bit.

Idiocy has been running through America’s college campuses like a brush fire. From students triggered by pro-Trump slogans written in chalk to physical altercations about cultural appropriation and hairstyle, political correctness is the destructive and contagious Black Death infesting the progressive left. So, it should come to no one’s surprise that it’s struck Harvard.

Fox News’ Megyn Kelly had on Rachel Huebner, staff writer for The Harvard Crimson, who detailed how the PC police are destroying these institutions of learning because the latest batch of college students are coddled, soft, and downright incorrigible. One would think that the faculty or the administration would be the point of the lance in this war of free speech, but it’s not; it’s the students.

Huebner described an incident where a student felt she could not learn, let alone be in the same room, if she knew a classmate was pro-life. Having a view that’s different from your own is very, very offensive in delicate snowflake land. More disconcerting is a separate incident involving Huebner’s friend trying to put an American flag on the wall of his dorm room. He’s a freshman who was unpacking his things, when his roommate stopped him from displaying the flag, considering it an intolerable political statement that “he was unwilling to make.” This story drew laughter from Kelly’s crew–and rightfully so.
