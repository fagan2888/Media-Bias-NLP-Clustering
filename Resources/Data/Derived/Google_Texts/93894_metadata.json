His favorite expression \u201cWHAT A HOOT\u201d certainly sums up his outlook on his life and work which are inexorably entwined. Mike\u2019s warm, easygoing and zany demeanor is evidence that his personality matches his creative talents. As so eloquently phrased by a colleague \u2014 \u201cMike is the Peter Pan of the cartooning world; he\u2019s boyishly charming, good with a rapier and doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time on the ground. And he doesn\u2019t seem to want to grow up\u201d.\n\nThe Comic Strip Mother Goose & Grimm appears in over 800 newspapers worldwide and consistently places in the top 10 most popular ratings. Licensees distribute Grimmy products all over the world, and the Grimmy TV show continues to air in several countries. Mother Goose & Grimm is included in the Toon Lagoon theme park at Universal Studios that opened in July 1999.\n\nThis copyrighted cartoon is licensed to be run on TMV and is from his website.
