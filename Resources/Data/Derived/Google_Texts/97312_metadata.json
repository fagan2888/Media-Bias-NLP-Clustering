Respect in both word and deed is a necessary skill I know will serve my boys well in their lives. And lately, with the excitement in politics and lively disagreements between parties and people, it\u2019s clear to me how far we\u2019ve fallen as a society in disregarding this crucial behavior.\n\nHaving been in the public eye, I understand that negativity is \u201cpart of the gig.\u201d There will always be harsh voices, and most of the time, those voices are loud.\n\nI know there are some who would argue that it\u2019s their \u201cright\u201d to post whatever they\u2019re feeling online. But somewhere along the way, freedom of speech got twisted into \u201cfreedom to hate,\u201d and I believe social media is largely to blame.\n\nHidden behind computer screens or smartphones, with fake names and an agenda, people have given themselves the green light to be as nasty and cruel as they want. I have been genuinely appalled at comments I\u2019ve read targeted toward me and my family.\n\nIs there a way to disagree respectfully? Absolutely. Take a page out of the book of my father-in-law, Gov. Gary Herbert, for example.\n\nTradition holds that the chairman of the National Governors Association give a toast to the president of the United States at the association's meeting. It should come as no surprise that the governor and President Barack Obama can be described as political polar opposites, and therefore tend to disagree on pretty much every major issue. So you can imagine how difficult it must have been for Herbert to raise a glass to the man who gave us the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNevertheless, my father-in-law was able to give an honorable toast to the nation's commander in chief at the meeting held in Washington in February. He was dignified, diplomatic and, above all, respectful. Herbert spoke of the toll it can take on a person and his family to hold public office, particularly the president of the United States, and thanked the Obamas for their service. So while there is much disagreement, there is mutual respect.\n\nWe are in the thick of election season. With county and state conventions, as well as presidential primaries, our neighborhood has been abuzz with talk of politics. At the state convention recently, I read some statistics that said 93 percent of Republican delegates are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nAs an LDS Church member myself, I know that we believe in treating others as children of God, with love and respect. But I was genuinely appalled at the lack of respect and decency with which my family and I were treated, both face to face and through online comments. I get that we are not going to agree 100 percent on every issue all the time. But that shouldn\u2019t be an excuse to promote violence, hate or cruelty simply because you want your opinion heard.\n\nWhen I was in Nashville, I was surprised that simple phrases such as \u201cyes, ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cno, ma\u2019am\u201d were commonplace. It is almost unheard of to hear a child say that here. Along with teaching our young ones the ABCs, perhaps we should spend equal time on the letters R-E-S-P-E-C-T.\n\nCarmen Rasmusen Herbert is a former \"American Idol\" contestant who writes about entertainment and family for the Deseret News.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Phrases such as \u201cyes, ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cno, ma\u2019am\u201d are almost unheard of here.
