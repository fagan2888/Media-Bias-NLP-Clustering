That might explain how Jack Black was able to get around the four stages of the Festival Supreme like magic.\n\nWearing in a dark sequined jacket over an oversized T-shirt emblazoned with a cat that nicely complemented his belly, Black popped up everywhere throughout the comedy and music festival Saturday. He capped the night by playing guitar with rap-rave headliners Die Antwoord after a day of introducing or collaborating with nearly everyone.\n\nOf course, Black\u2019s own group was a popular draw, but no one had ever seen Tenacious D perform like this. The act, described as \u201c29 minutes of nonstop jazz,\u201d was an extremely humorous, enjoyable performance, with Black scatting and improvising lines such as, \u201cThere are no wrong notes in jazz \u2026 just like in life.\u201d Very meta.\n\nThe set included jazz standards such as \u201cOn Broadway\u201d and \u201cMoondance,\u201d as well as a reinterpretation of the group\u2019s own hit, \u201cTribute.\u201d TV host Craig Ferguson joined them to perform the Proclaimers\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles).\u201d It was the perfect amount of strangeness for a crowd that included people dressed as yetis, superheroes and a crucified Jesus Christ.\n\nOne of Black\u2019s earlier collaborations was also the most memorable. Amy Poehler walked onto the stage looking like Mitch Hedberg at his peak and told the audience she was burned out on Hollywood. Behind dark sunglasses, she deadpanned that she hadn\u2019t prepared anything, saying, \u201cCould I have written something? Sure. Could I have rehearsed? Fine. But that\u2019s not what life is.\u201d\n\nBlack and Poehler sang a duet of Bette Midler\u2019s \u201cThe Rose\u201d to a broken-hearted young audience member. It was the kind of \u201claugh at the pain\u201d act that must be over the top to work, by two professionals who are examples of what\u2019s going right in American comedy.\n\nActs like Reggie Watts and Puddles Pity Party relied on quirkiness over tradition to carry the punchlines. Puddles the Clown, with his terrifying imagery and phenomenal voice, was a crowd favorite. It was a delight to see him lurk around the Shrine throughout the evening.\n\nNostalgic quirkiness was on tap, too. Sketch comedy forebears Kids in the Hall performed an hour of new material, such as two guys arguing over an imaginary girlfriend. Members of \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000\u201d delivered their famously corny jokes over a viewing of Godzilla vs. Mothra. Both acts were appreciated most by those already familiar with the shows, and likely over the heads of the Reggie Watts-crowd.\n\nPunk legend and columnist Henry Rollins hit the stage ranting, hilariously recounting his cameo in the decidedly un-punk Michael Keaton film \u201cJack Frost.\u201d Unfortunately, as with Andrew W.K.\u2019s performance on the same Komodo Dragon stage later in the night, the audio would have been difficult to hear at a backyard barbecue, let alone a large festival.\n\nThe stand-up acts that did approach \u201ctraditional,\u201d including Tig Notaro, Bill Burr and Kristen Schaal, were among the best. The reaction of Burr\u2019s crowd reinforced that he\u2019s a true comedy rock star, and his irreverent take on obesity, plane crashes, Kanye West and (possibly) Peter Dinklage were uproarious. Kristen Schaal\u2019s inimitable voice is a perfect match for her charmingly dark, awkward brand of comedy. She\u2019s an expert at mixing laughter with cringes, describing her recent marriage as \u201cone step closer to the real goal of being a widow.\u201d\n\nAfter sundown, the main stage featured two acts known for blurring the lines between surrealist humor and edgy musicianship, starting with the Darkness. A decade later, songs like \u201cLove Is Only a Feeling\u201d still pack a lot of punch. Their cover of Radiohead\u2019s \u201cStreet Spirit (Fade Out)\u201d is heavy, and Justin Hawkins\u2019 handstands and acrobatics are still impressive, but the act is about as subtle as a Stone Temple Pilots single. They\u2019ve long abandoned any notion of being a \u201chumor rock\u201d act.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Die Antwoord is similarly difficult to pin down on a humor front. The rap-rave trio makes tremendously loud, hyped-up bangers, and their imagery flashes between horrific violence and genuine beauty with zero segue. Songs like \u201cUgly Boy\u201d and \u201cEnter the Ninja\u201d are refreshing, offensive, humorous and disturbing, often simultaneously.", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "entertainment", "description": "Entertainment: Music and humor a good fit at Festival Supreme | black, comedy, humor, act, festival, acts, stage, crowd, jazz, dark", "author": "WILL THEISEN", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "With all its mysterious iconography, the Shrine Auditorium seems like a place that could have a network of underground passages and secret shortcuts.
