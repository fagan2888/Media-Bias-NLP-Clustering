We all know that an Internet comments sections can be one of saddest, vilest and most confusing forums for opinion known to man. If you ever feel like you need your faith in humanity destroyed, bring up any YouTube video with an exorbitant number of views and scroll down for a while and I guarantee you won’t be disappointed. This is a 100% fail safe way to realize the planet is doomed. It might be a heated argument about the merits of atheism below a clip from The Office, it might be a lone voice finding a link between a corgi compilation and Obamacare, but you are sure to find at least one profoundly discouraging nugget a human being took the time to think about, lick Cooler Ranch dust from their fingers, type and press enter.

Some YouTube videos propagate insanity more readily than others. Anything political? Of course. An instructional video for applying makeup? You’d be surprised. A One Direction music video? Yeah, that sounds like it could get ugly fast. The good people at the Dead Parrot comedy group thought so, too, and below a video for “What Makes You Beautiful” they found a few 1D fans going back in forth in what is the Internet equivalent of two middle school girls trying to pull each other’s hair out while vomiting all over everyone around them at the same time. The comedy group decided to get two old British dudes to sit in some sort of parlour and dramatize the entire battle in black and white, but unfortunately not even Caine and McKellan would have the chops to turn this argument into anything coherent…At least when it’s acted out you can’t see the typos and grammatical errors…
