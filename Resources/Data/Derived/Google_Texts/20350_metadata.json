Similarly, while Deputy VA Secretary Sloan Gibson argues that higher salaries are needed to attract the most qualified candidates, Barbara Temeck, director of the Cincinnati VA, commands a $400,000 salary even amid poor outcomes. Temeck was suspended in February pending a possible criminal probe after an investigation into misconduct regarding prescriptions and other care she provided, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nLast week, members of the Senate Appropriations Committee told VA leaders their continual requests for increased funds had not solved the department's problems, according to GovExec.com. \"This subcommittee and this Congress has given you everything you wanted and more,\" said Committee Chair Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). \"The answer to every VA problem is not 'give us more money and give us more flexibility.'\"\n\nThe VA unveiled the proposal in February, vowing to assign the new pay band only to \"the most compelx executive leadership roles,\" according to a separate GovExec article. More than half of current VA staff are currently classified under Title 38.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Daily Caller article\n\n- read the first GovExec article\n\n- here's the second GovExec article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVA scandal: Internal investigations neglected whistleblower concerns\n\nVA scandal: Excess wait times persist at Phoenix facility\n\nVA scandal: No end in sight for patient satisfaction, whistleblower woes\n\nGroup proposes major VA healthcare overhaul\n\nVA scandal: Audit reveals 57,000 vets awaiting medical appointments\n\nVA settles with more whistleblowers as investigators promise better training\n\nVA whistleblowers push for system-wide changes to improve patient care\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid an ongoing scandal over care delays, a new Department of Veterans Affairs proposal would double top administrators' compensation and shift their employment classification, but the evidence doesn't support their claim this would solve the VA's problems,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Daily Caller.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Amid an ongoing scandal over care delays, a new Department of Veterans Affairs proposal would double top administrators' compensation and shift their employment classification, but the evidence doesn't support their claim this would solve the VA's problems,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Daily Caller.", "title": "VA scandal: Claims that higher pay would improve care may not hold water", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/va-scandal-claims-higher-pay-would-improve-care-may-not-hold-water/2016-03-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Executive Compensation,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Sloan Gibson,VA scandal,Veterans Affairs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca932\"", "article_summary": "The VA unveiled the proposal in February, vowing to assign the new pay band only to \"the most compelx executive leadership roles,\" according to a separate GovExec article.\nMore than half of current VA staff are currently classified under Title 38.\n\"The answer to every VA problem is not 'give us more money and give us more flexibility.'\"\nTemeck was suspended in February pending a possible criminal probe after an investigation into misconduct regarding prescriptions and other care she provided, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nVA executives argue that moving them to the Title 38 classification would make it easier to remove poorly performing employees, but that claim is dubious at best, according to the article."}
