So, Donald Trump\u2019s appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is raising some ire with his fellow candidates who want their shot to be funny too. According to the FEC \u201c\u2026qualified candidates are entitled to the same quantity, day, part and price as their opponents\u2019 for television broadcasts.\u201d No word yet on what exactly a \u201cqualified candidate\u201d is in the GOP field.\n\nOn Friday night\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d notorious campaign finance nerd Stephen Colbert said, \u201cinvoking this law is pretty rare because it makes you seem petty and desperate for attention. So, five candidates have invoked it: John Kasich, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Mike Huckabee and Jim Gilmore.\u201d\n\nColbert said that these five men are desperately trying to force Americans to look at them. \u201cThey\u2019re like subway panhandlers. \u2018Excuse me for bothering you. Ladies and gentleman, I am not a drug addict, however, I am running for president. If you can find it in your hearts to spare a small donation of the legal limit of $2,700 I promise I\u2019ll use it to find a good job in Washington, D.C. Thank you. God bless. And now\u2026 doo-wop.'\u201d\n\nAccording to the demands, these five candidates are asking for 12 minutes and 5 seconds of airtime, which is what Trump got on \u201cSNL.\u201d While it might seem crazy, there\u2019s actually precedence for this. Back in 2004, Rev. Al Sharpton hosted \u201cSNL,\u201d \u201cso rival candidate Joe Lieberman got NBC to cough up 28 minutes which he used to broadcast reruns of a Lieberman town hall meeting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"They're like subway panhandlers.
