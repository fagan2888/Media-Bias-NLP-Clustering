We’re about a month away from finding out if the Klyde Warren Park is this year’s recipient of the Urban Land Institute’s Urban Open Space Award. The honor, now in its fifth year, will be doled out at the ULI’s annual fall meeting in New York, where Dallas’ deck park is vying for the prize along with Columbus Commons and Scioto Mile in Columbus, Ohio; Tulsa’s Guthrie Green; The Railyard Park and Plaza in Santa Fe; and Cincinnati’s Washington Park. If the downtown deck park wins, it’ll be Dallas’ first nod since the award’s inception.

To commemorate the occasion of the nomination, CBRE executive vice president Phil Puckett had SkyLVL bust out the drone to film this sky-high look-see at the deck park. Says W. Ross Cromartie via email it was shot on August 23 and five nights later, during the monthly Decks in the Park dance party.

“This video was a gift from [Puckett] to the park, with the intent to show off our city’s great new asset for all,” says Cromartie via email. “The project was definitely pushed forward by the ULI nomination, and we are all rooting for Klyde Warren to win the award.”
