Those whose most frequent sedentary behavior was watching TV were 13 percent more likely to be depressed, while those who spent their sedentary time using the computer or Internet, had a 22 percent higher depression risk.\n\nThe analysis didn\u2019t look at the reasons behind the links. And, the study team points out, most of the included studies accounted for other factors, like illnesses, that might explain the sedentary behavior, the depression, or both, but those studies may not have taken every possible factor into account.\n\nThe research team also notes that they cannot rule out the possibility that depression leads to sedentary behaviors rather than the other way around.\n\nNonetheless, that the two go hand in hand is enough to suggest that more activity might be the antidote, they conclude.\n\nTeychenne also said that even though the study results are inconclusive regarding the connection between sedentary behavior and mental health, researchers do know that being sedentary is linked to other poor health outcomes like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the message we really need to get out to the public is \u2018Move more and sit less,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think it's certainly an important study, and it shows that there are links but it does point out some issues that we need to think about,\" Jennifer Brunet told Reuters Health.\n\nBrunet is a researcher with the School of Human Kinetics at the University of Ottawa in Ontario Canada, who was not involved with the study.\n\nShe added that she doesn\u2019t think all sedentary behavior is a bad thing, and it could provide some escape from the stress of a hard day.\n\n\u201cSometimes people read; people go on the Internet, and unfortunately, the measures that were used in the reviewed studies didn't always differentiate what we can call healthier sedentary behaviors versus unhealthy sedentary behaviors,\u201d Brunet pointed out.\n\nStill, she said, there's clear evidence that physical activity is good for the management of depression symptoms as well as clinical levels of depression.\n\nThere\u2019s not enough good evidence to suggest that any one specific form of physical activity is best, she added, but research indicates that moderate exercise is most effective.\n\n\u201cI often tell people to pick activities that are enjoyable, and that\u2019s the key to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pressure people to do physical activity, we want them to choose it and one way of choosing it is if they feel it\u2019s an enjoyable activity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/MENTAL HEALTH/Depression", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-01 07:14:06 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A new analysis of previous studies ties too much sitting at the computer or lying around watching TV to a greater risk of depression.", "twitter": {"description": "A new analysis of previous studies ties too much sitting at the computer or lying around watching TV to a greater risk of depression.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422792848897.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Sedentary lifestyle linked to depression", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/MENTAL HEALTH/Depression\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"Sedentary lifestyle linked to depression\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422792848897.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-19T11:26:56Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"af7cd707-657b-4c3d-8519-1da558c5bcb8\",\"section\":\"health\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A new analysis of previous studies ties too much sitting at the computer or lying around watching TV to a greater risk of depression.", "dc.identifier": "af7cd707-657b-4c3d-8519-1da558c5bcb8", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "depression", "description": "A new analysis of previous studies ties too much sitting at the computer or lying around watching TV to a greater risk of depression.", "prism.section": "health", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Reuters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Sedentary Lifestyle Linked To Depression", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-01 07:14:06 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A new analysis of previous studies ties too much sitting at the computer or lying around watching TV to a greater risk of depression.", "title": "Sedentary lifestyle linked to depression | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422792848897.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-09-19", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/MENTAL HEALTH/Depression\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"Sedentary lifestyle linked to depression\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422792848897.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-19T11:26:56Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/09/19/sedentary-lifestyle-linked-to-depression.html\",\"post_id\":\"af7cd707-657b-4c3d-8519-1da558c5bcb8\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"health\"}"}, "article_summary": "Across continents, the researchers found that people with the most sedentary behavior were 25 percent more likely to be depressed overall compared to those who were the least sedentary.\nStill, she said, there's clear evidence that physical activity is good for the management of depression symptoms as well as clinical levels of depression.\n\u201cSometimes people read;
