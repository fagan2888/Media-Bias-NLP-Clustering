Tyler was Gingrich's spokesman and ran a super-PAC backing the former House Speaker at different points during the 2012 presidential campaign.

"I am honored to come on board with Sen. Cruz and join the effort to make D.C. listen to the American people," Tyler said in a statement to the Houston Chronicle, which first reported his hiring. "I believe he will emerge as the conservative leader of the next generation because he understands that it is not 'we the bureaucrats,' but 'we the people' who make this nation exceptional."

Tyler joins a growing Cruz team that has also added Missouri-based strategist Jeff Roe, who's expected to become campaign manager, if Cruz officially launches a presidential campaign, as well as communications adviser Jason Miller and fundraising consultant Laura Lofstrom.
