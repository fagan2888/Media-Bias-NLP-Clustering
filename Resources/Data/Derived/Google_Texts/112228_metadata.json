Five years after the Birmingham church bombing, King himself met a savage death.\n\nIn the days after King\u2019s assassination, Americans considered many of the same questions that we are asking today: Was this the work of one lunatic, or of a larger racial ideology? How should lawmakers respond? Would the violent tragedy lead to gun control legislation? White Southerners even debated whether to lower the flag in King\u2019s honor. In the end, many ministers and leaders cautioned that King would have died in vain if the country did not act boldly to root out racial injustice. The fact that we are having similar conversations, almost 50 years later, seems a mark of our collective failure.\n\nAs word of King\u2019s assassination traveled around the country on the night of April 4, 1968, two of America\u2019s leading journalists sat down at their typewriters: Mike Royko in Chicago and Ralph McGill in Atlanta. They reached the same conclusion \u2013 that an entire society had murdered King, regardless of which individual pulled the trigger.\n\nAt that point, the assassin remained at large and his identity was unknown. There were no social media profiles to parse, no manifestoes to read. That kind of information was unnecessary. Both McGill and Royko knew that a sick and racist nation was to blame.\n\nIn the spring of 1968, King was far from a sanitized national hero. Many white Americans detested his activism and begrudged his fame. In 1967, King had delivered a forceful speech opposing the Vietnam War. Other civil rights leaders turned against him, and he faced a round of criticism in the nation\u2019s newspapers and magazines. His relationship with President Lyndon Johnson, already frayed, fractured completely. King then announced plans for the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, in which droves of the nation\u2019s poor would set up tent encampments on the Washington Mall in a show of nonviolent civil disobedience. King was attacking capitalism and imperialism, and calling for a \u201crevolution of values.\u201d\n\nIn early 1968, he traveled to Memphis, where 1,300 black sanitation workers were waging a strike. King led a protest march through downtown Memphis on March 28. Some demonstrators behind him resorted to violence; as chaos took hold, King was whisked away from the scene. The national press intensified its criticism of King. On Capitol Hill, elected officials denounced him as a lawless radical. He had become the target of deepening hatred.\n\nTo Mike Royko, a popular columnist for the Chicago Daily News, it was this scorn and revulsion that ultimately killed King. Royko published a column on April 5 titled \u201cMillions in His Firing Squad.\u201d Royko expressed confidence that the authorities would soon arrest the assassin.\n\nBut \u201cthey can\u2019t catch everybody,\u201d Royko wrote, \u201cand Martin Luther King was executed by a firing squad that numbered in the millions.\u201d From many corners of the nation, white Americans fed \u201cwords of hate into the ear of the assassin.\u201d The killer was simply following orders. \u201cThe man with the gun did what he was told. Millions of bigots, subtle and obvious, put it in his hand and assured him he was doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nRoyko blamed white Northerners: the anti-busing leaders, the law-and-order demagogues, all of those Chicago residents who stood against King\u2019s open-housing programs and pelted him with rocks in Marquette Park. He also indicted the FBI for its propaganda campaign against King, and proceeded to condemn every white American who nodded at racist jokes.\n\n\u201cIt was almost ludicrous,\u201d Royko wrote of the hostility directed at King. \u201cThe man came on the American scene preaching nonviolence \u2026 He preached it in the North and was hit with rocks. He talked it the day he was murdered.\u201d But Americans refused to hear his calls for peace and freedom. \u201cHypocrites all over this country would kneel every Sunday morning and mouth messages to Jesus Christ. Then they would come out and tell each other, after reading the papers, that somebody should string up King, who was living Christianity like few Americans ever have.\u201d In a legendary career, this was one of Royko\u2019s finest moments \u2013 and one of his angriest.\n\nRalph McGill targeted the Southern bigots. McGill, the publisher of the Atlanta Constitution and a leading Southern liberal, chose a title for his editorial that was sure to aggravate the haters: \u201cA Free Man Killed by White Slaves.\u201d He wrote, \u201cWhite slaves killed Martin Luther King in Memphis. At the moment the triggerman fired, Martin Luther King was the free man. The white killer, (or killers), was a slave to fear.\u201d\n\nIn McGill\u2019s formulation, millions of white Americans stood captive to racial fear. McGill located many such \u201cslaves\u201d in Memphis, which was \u201cbound by such terrible chains\u201d of enmity. Hatred at the sanitation workers, and at King himself, had swirled around the Delta city. McGill beseeched white Americans to strike at racial prejudice and injustice. \u201cThe white South \u2013 the white population in all the country \u2013 must now give answer.\u201d\n\nTo two of the nation\u2019s most perceptive observers, the important issue was not the assassin\u2019s mental state. The crucial fact was that a climate existed in the country that sanctioned racial hatred.\n\nOf course, others rejected this logic. The Chicago Tribune bristled at Mike Royko\u2019s indictment. \u201cThe murder of Dr. King was a crime and the sin of an individual,\u201d the Tribune\u2019s editors asserted on April 9 \u2013 the morning of King\u2019s funeral. The \u201crest of us\u201d were \u201cnot contributory to this particular crime.\u201d The Memphis Commercial Appeal also dismissed the notion of collective guilt. \u201cIt was the work of an individual, a warped, mixed-up, emotional mind,\u201d the Commercial Appeal editorialized on April 6. In reality, the Commercial Appeal itself had helped to whip white Memphis into a feverish state. The newspaper had criticized the sanitation strike for the better part of two months, and deplored King\u2019s decision to assist the strikers. The newspaper\u2019s \u201cHambone\u201d cartoon \u2013 which had appeared six days a week since the 1910s \u2013 continued to trade in crass racial stereotypes. In 1968, the Commercial Appeal focused on one person\u2019s \u201cwarped, mixed-up, emotional mind\u201d instead of the racism and racial inequality that so shaped the city and the nation.\n\n* * *\n\nThen as now, it was easier to blame a deranged individual than to craft a response that might address racial inequality or gun violence. Hours before King\u2019s death, the Senate Judiciary Committee finally voted on a gun-control bill that had been pending before it for three years. The bill was initially proposed by Sen. Thomas Dodd of Connecticut, and supported by Lyndon Johnson. James Eastland, the longtime segregationist from Mississippi, chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee defeated a proposal to ban interstate gun sales. The committee then considered a proposal to combine gun control legislation with a safe streets bill. It failed to approve this measure, then adjourned for the evening. An hour later, James Earl Ray aimed his rifle at the balcony of the Lorraine Motel and murdered Martin Luther King Jr.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's harness the sadness, outrage and feelings of unity, and use that energy to force more than symbolic action", "title": "Charleston exposes ugliest truth of our time: Our society places little value on black life", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Let's harness the sadness, outrage and feelings of unity, and use that energy to force more than symbolic action", "title": "Charleston exposes ugliest truth of our time: Our society places little value on black life", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/charleston_exposes_ugliest_truth_of_our_time_our_society_places_little_value_on_black_life/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/confederate_flag_sc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let's harness the sadness, outrage and feelings of unity, and use that energy to force more than symbolic action", "title": "Charleston exposes ugliest truth of our time: Our society places little value on black life", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/confederate_flag_sc.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jason Sokol", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Charleston, confederate flag, Dylann Roof, Dylann Storm Roof, Editor's Picks, Martin Luther King, Mike Royko, Race, Ralph McGill", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c3e\"", "article_summary": "An hour later, James Earl Ray aimed his rifle at the balcony of the Lorraine Motel and murdered Martin Luther King Jr.\nAt the moment the triggerman fired, Martin Luther King was the free man.\nIn reality, the Commercial Appeal itself had helped to whip white Memphis into a feverish state.\nThe white killer, (or killers), was a slave to fear.\u201dIn McGill\u2019s formulation, millions of white Americans stood captive to racial fear.\nMany white Americans detested his activism and begrudged his fame."}
