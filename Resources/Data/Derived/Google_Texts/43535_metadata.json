Bush, Iraq war, kelsey grammer, Mark Wahlberg, michael bay, Movies, Shia LaBeouf, Stanley Tucci, Summer movies, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, Transformers, Transformers: Age of Extinction, War on Terror, Entertainment News, Politics News\n\nThere\u2019s a general feeling of distress and bewilderment to \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction,\u201d Michael Bay\u2019s latest inflated, interminable and incoherent 3-D saga of robot warfare. At least some of that distress is political: The \u201cTransformers\u201d franchise has gradually become alienated from its Bush-era roots in gung-ho, pro-military, \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d jingoism. It now partakes of a free-floating, ill-defined, Ted Cruz-style paranoia that is both psychically dispirited and distressingly low in testosterone. (There are nearly no gratuitous shots of female pulchritude in this movie, and the only suggestion of actual sexuality is a disturbing interspecies attempted rape.) I\u2019m halfway surprised that the script for \u201cAge of Extinction\u201d didn\u2019t drag in a Benghazi reference somehow. Maybe it did and I missed it; you can\u2019t sit through a 166-minute robot-warfare movie without occasionally slipping into a fugue state. I\u2019m going to say that again: ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX MINUTES. That\u2019s exactly one minute longer than the re-edited version of Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s medieval odyssey \u201cAndrei Rublev,\u201d perhaps the most legendarily arduous art film of all time. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nIf it sounds dumb to describe \u201cAge of Extinction\u201d as bewildering and pointless, given that it\u2019s the fourth installment in a franchise that has concocted an arcane mythological back-story out of a line of toys popular with 10-year-old boys in the 1980s, all I can say is welcome to the world Bay has made, where we are all measurably stupider than we were before. Also revealed on our show today: The sky is blue (unless it\u2019s raining) and the Catholic Church may have issues with human sexuality! There are many reasons that \u201cAge of Extinction\u201d is a total mess, even when we move past the fact that it\u2019s a mess because it\u2019s a Michael Bay movie. And although it has become patently obvious that Bay is kind of a right-winger, his movies are more about servicing the stunted psychologies of teenage boys than about any coherent ideology. Believing that military hardware is awesome, and blowing stuff up is even better, does not really qualify as a political position.\n\nThis time around, Hollywood\u2019s master of excess finally seems exhausted, in both formal and narrative terms, by the stupefying idiocy of this franchise. If you haven\u2019t been paying attention, that\u2019s actually a new state of affairs: You can accuse Bay of many things, but never before of being bored with his own work. When you reach the decadent phase of the \u201cTransformers\u201d series, which was designed in the first place as the epitome of id-fueled overkill \u2014 my friends, that is some serious decadence. That\u2019s Louis XIV in the recliner with a pile of thong-clad honeys and five boxes of donut holes from Dunkin, watching a highlight reel of Best Reality Show Catfights. There\u2019s an entire scene in this movie in which the protagonists hide out from evil government forces and evil Decepticons and evil whoever-else by sleeping in an abandoned mid-century passenger train. During that scene I woke up enough to think: Wait, what? Where are these people, and why are they doing this, and what relevance or resonance does this have to the so-called plot? No answers.\n\nThere\u2019s an earlier scene when one shot shows us the setting sun, a melting glob of orange sherbet descending behind a flat Texas landscape \u2013 one of about five \u201cmagic moment\u201d sunset shots milked for nebulous non-meaning in this movie \u2014 and then in the next shot (and for the rest of the scene) it\u2019s clearly the middle of the afternoon. One of the things that\u2019s impossible to decipher about Bay is whether or not he\u2019s basically been punking us the whole time. He clearly possesses some awareness of his own tics and tricks and obsessions, some meta-consciousness about the manipulative character of his work and his relationship to the audience, but not enough to simply throw it all away and go study the Hindu scriptures or something. (He may make movies aimed at notional heartland teens, but in real life Bay was an English major at Wesleyan, and a favored student of film historian Jeanine Basinger.) So I partly suspect that he\u2019s pulling our leg in making a $165 million action spectacle that features elementary continuity errors, product placement for Chinese soft drinks and a running time \u2013 did I tell you this already? \u2013 of 166 minutes, at least 40 or 50 or 60 of which are not strictly necessary. OK, duh, I get it: None of it is necessary, and Bay is playing out some kind of sadomasochistic power exercise.\n\nThing is, sadomasochistic power exercises can be fun, and this one is often painfully dull along the long road to the admittedly magnificent action climax, when Dinobots get hatched out of the earth (don\u2019t ask) and a giant magnetized spaceship starts sucking the ships out of Hong Kong\u2019s harbor and raining them down on the city. If you want to belabor the question of Bay\u2019s self-awareness some more, I refer you to \u201cPain & Gain,\u201d his idiot-genius version of a postmodern social satire. Except, wait, no: The last \u201cTransformers\u201d movie, the massive international hit \u201cDark of the Moon,\u201d was Bay\u2019s version of a postmodern art film, and carries the mark of his studies with Basinger. I\u2019m not actually kidding. To amplify critic David Ehrlich\u2019s description, \u201cDark of the Moon\u201d was the meth-baby offspring of Stan Brakhage and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, except with giant robots and a shot of a Victoria\u2019s Secret model\u2019s bum as she ascends the stairs.\n\nThe unhinged political paranoia I mentioned above was already present in \u201cDark of the Moon,\u201d which featured a conspiracy-theory take on the Soviet and American space programs and indeed the entire Cold War. But that film\u2019s madness was thoroughgoing and enthusiastic; it was inarguably a much better movie than \u201cRevenge of the Fallen\u201d (No. 2 in the series) and it made oodles of money. It should have concluded the trilogy and provided Bay with a measure of semi-demi-vindication (which is the only kind you can get when you\u2019re him). It was the nightmarish, Nietzschean fulfillment of the summer-movie aesthetic, a movie that seemingly had eaten all of pop culture and vomited it back up again as shards of metal. One example: It featured the real Leonard Nimoy as a robot god and also a clip from a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode and hidden snippets of sampled Nimoy dialogue from a \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie. It was an exercise in ultimate sensual gratification that ended in the nuclear annihilation of all pleasure. It embodied every genre of film at once, each contaminated by its opposite: In retrospect, its dopey domestic-comedy scenes showed us the twitchy spectacle of Shia LaBeouf descending into madness. He was far more disturbing in that movie than in Lars von Trier\u2019s \u201cNymphomaniac.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once a defense of the war on terror, Michael Bay's robot franchise mirrors the GOP's decline into paranoid whining", "title": "\u201cTransformers\u201d: Robot warriors of the Tea Party attack", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Once a defense of the war on terror, Michael Bay's robot franchise mirrors the GOP's decline into paranoid whining", "title": "\u201cTransformers\u201d: Robot warriors of the Tea Party attack", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/transformers_robot_warriors_of_the_tea_party_attack/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ted_cruz_transformers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Once a defense of the war on terror, Michael Bay's robot franchise mirrors the GOP's decline into paranoid whining", "title": "\u201cTransformers\u201d: Robot warriors of the Tea Party attack", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ted_cruz_transformers.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Action movies, Barack Obama, Editor's Picks, George W.
