Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is investing $50 million in BuzzFeed Inc., a New York-based viral content company that has been at the forefront of shifting trends in media consumption.

The profitable company, which started in 2006, grew quickly with its focus on lightweight, easily shareable content like lists, Internet memes and funny photos. More recently it has put resources into more traditional news coverage.

Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Chris Dixon, who was an early investor in BuzzFeed when he was with New York seed-stage venture firm Founder Collective, joins BuzzFeed’s board.

The New York Times, which earlier reported the funding, said valuation was about $850 million and that the financing would go toward a major expansion.

Dixon said in a blog post announcing the funding that media consumption trends favor BuzzFeed:

We’re presently in the midst of a major technological shift in which, increasingly, news and entertainment are being distributed on social networks and consumed on mobile devices. We believe BuzzFeed will emerge from this period as a preeminent media company.

BuzzFeed reaches more than 150 million people per month and will generate triple-digit-millions in revenue this year, Dixon wrote.

The company previously raised more than $46 million in four rounds of venture funding. Previous investors besides Founders Collective include Hearst, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, RRE Ventures, SoftBank Capital and SV Angel.

Jonah Peretti, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, previously co-founded the Huffington Post, as did Ken Lerer, manager of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, who is BuzzFeed’s chairman.
