It\u2019s cranky, it doesn\u2019t remember details well, and you\u2019re more likely to make poor decisions.\n\nLast year the CDC called insufficient sleep \u201ca public health epidemic,\u201d one that\u2019s affecting about 50 to 70 million Americans a year. The global sleep aid market totaled $54.9 billion in 2013.\n\nSleep deficiency and deprivation can put us at increased risk of accidental injuries, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, and obesity. Because the same neurotransmitters\u2014epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin\u2014are used to regulate both mood and sleep, long-term sleep deprivation can result in anxiety, mood disorders, depression, panic attacks and at the extreme, psychotic breaks.\n\nRelated: How a Bad Night\u2019s Sleep Can Derail Your Career\n\nPeople who get too little sleep can feel the effects after just one night. Didn\u2019t sleep well last night? Here\u2019s what one night of tossing and turning can cost you.\n\nYou can suffer mild cognitive impairment. Missing even 90 minutes of sleep for one night can reduce your daytime alertness by as much as 32 percent.\n\nYou may feel a short burst of energy, and then crash. With too little sleep, the brain\u2019s reward circuits get a boost and become more active. Those feel-good neurons can make it likelier for you indulge in risky or irresponsible behavior.\n\nYour body burns an extra 161 calories, but it will be harder to get anything done the day after. Your body tries to make up for a sleep deficit by saving more energy the next day and night, causing you to feel even groggier.\n\nYou read people\u2019s faces less accurately, and are more likely to perceive hostility or social threat. Skipping deep sleep, the REM kind, can make us less effective at reading people\u2019s facial expressions, especially the complex kind. It also can make us more inclined to see and perceive social threats, and treat friends as foes. So if you\u2019re feeling a little testy or paranoid, take a nap or get more sleep.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Sleep Is Now Big Business\n\nYou may increase your risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. Did you know that while you\u2019re sleeping, your brain is clearing out waste? At the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference last week, researchers reported that the build-up of toxic proteins or gunky beta-amyloids in the brain can keep you from getting the deep sleep you need, resulting in mild cognitive impairment and memory problems that can sometimes lead to Alzheimer\u2019s. (Sleep apnea resulted in a nearly two-fold risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.)\n\nYour circadian rhythms can change. The regulation and activity of clock genes are altered after just one night of sleep loss, according to Swedish researchers at Uppsala University and the Karolinska Institute. Clock genes control our circadian rhythms. (You\u2019ll notice them when you\u2019re experiencing jet lag.) The results of this study will appear in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to trick you into believing false memories. Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function, making it easier to implant false memories. One study found that under certain conditions, 24 hours of sleep deprivation can increase the risk of developing false memories. That\u2019s one reason sleep deprivation is considered a form of torture.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This is what your brain is like on too little sleep.", "title": "7 Risky Results from Getting Too Little Sleep", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/7-Risky-Results-Getting-Too-Little-Sleep", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122012_sleep_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/7-Risky-Results-Getting-Too-Little-Sleep", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122012_sleep_money_article.jpg", "creator": "@SuelainMoy", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This is what your brain is like on too little sleep.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How a Bad Night\u2019s Sleep Can Derail Your CareerPeople who get too little sleep can feel the effects after just one night.\nWith too little sleep, the brain\u2019s reward circuits get a boost and become more active.\nBecause the same neurotransmitters\u2014epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin\u2014are used to regulate both mood and sleep, long-term sleep deprivation can result in anxiety, mood disorders, depression, panic attacks and at the extreme, psychotic breaks.\nThis is what your brain is like on too little sleep.\nOne study found that under certain conditions, 24 hours of sleep deprivation can increase the risk of developing false memories."}
