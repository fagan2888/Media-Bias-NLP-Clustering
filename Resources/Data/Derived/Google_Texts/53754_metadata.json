No American had won a gold medal in cross country. Randall was the favorite and reigning world champion.\n\nIt was a lot of weight to carry for the slender 5-foot-4 Alaskan, an inspiration to fans of the sport.\n\n\u201cFirst, I was excited by it,\u201d Randall said earlier this month after speaking at a meeting of U.S. Ski Team trustees in Vail, where she solicited greater financial support for cross country. \u201cI was so excited to be able to put cross country on the map, get people excited. We got a little extra media attention going into the Games. I tried to embrace that spotlight and use it as fuel and motivation, but it was new territory, and a lot of nerves going into the race.\u201d\n\nRandall didn\u2019t win that day, didn\u2019t even get out of the qualifying rounds. Bill Koch is still the only American to medal in cross country at the Olympics, earning a silver in 1976.\n\n\u201cIt was a heavy blow for her, getting knocked out in the quarterfinals,\u201d said Luke Bodensteiner, USSA\u2019s vice president for athletics. \u201cYou could (visualize) the celebration, you could see what it was going to do for the sport, and it was shocking for everybody. It was hard on her, for a long time.\u201d\n\nRandall, 32, is taking this season off because it\u2019s the one year out of four that has no Olympics or world championships, and she wasn\u2019t willing to put off starting a family until after the 2018 Olympics. She is 22 weeks pregnant and plans to return next season.\n\nIn the meantime, she is campaigning for something that could be a boon for U.S. cross country, and she made her pitch to the trustees during the Beaver Creek World Cup.\n\nIn cross country, the art and science of ski preparation is crucial. Different temperatures and snow conditions require different waxes, and getting it right often determines results.\n\nIn recent years, cross country superpowers such as Norway \u2014 with 14 times the budget of the U.S. cross country program and three or four times as many wax technicians\u2014 have built elaborate mobile waxing facilities in semitrucks. The U.S. transports hundreds of skis in a cargo van.\n\nRandall is promoting an effort to get a waxing truck for the U.S. for next season, which will cost more than $500,000. The effort already has more than $300,000 in pledges.\n\n\u201cThe Norwegian truck is two stories and has pullouts on both sides,\u201d Randall said. \u201cInside, they have waxing stations, state-of-the-art ventilation systems. They can store all the skis, all of the wax inside the truck. The advantage these trucks give you is that when you show up at a venue, you pop out the sides and you\u2019re ready to go. They also provide ventilation that keeps the wax technicians much healthier.\n\n\u201cOur guys have to unload everything. Then they\u2019re waxing in small trailers with no ventilation.\u201d\n\nIn Sochi, Randall and her coaches didn\u2019t time her physical peak right, which is critical in endurance sports at major events. She was the best sprinter in the weeks before and after the Olympics \u2014 she won the World Cup season title that season \u2014 but when she tried to kick to the finish at Sochi, her legs didn\u2019t respond.\n\nBut her skis weren\u2019t right that day, either, and that was part of the problem.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the only reason, but it certainly played a major part,\u201d Randall said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about medals at Olympics, where you get one day, one shot, skis have got to be as good as possible. They\u2019ve got to be competitive, because it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of shape we\u2019re in \u2014 if the skis aren\u2019t there, we can\u2019t win medals.\u201d\n\nAnd winning medals can help a sport that promotes wellness and fitness.\n\n\u201cHealth is such a big topic with our obesity problem, and cross country skiing is such a great fitness activity the whole family can enjoy,\u201d Randall said. \u201cWe actually finally have heroes to follow. When we\u2019re having success on the World Cup, that gets people excited and gives kids something to dream about. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to really grow the sport right now.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nU.S. cross country waxing truck campaign\n\nDonors interested in contributing to the U.S. Ski Team\u2019s campaign to raise funds for a waxing truck for the cross country World Cup can donate or get info at: foundation@ussa.org", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Skier Kikkan Randall wants waxing truck for U.S. team", "title": "Skier Kikkan Randall wants waxing truck for U.S. team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/19/skier-kikkan-randall-wants-waxing-truck-for-u-s-team/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219__BN20151220_CC3_BNSP20LYSKIp2.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219__BN20151220_CC3_BNSP20LYSKIp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T22:22:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:21:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ski Team\u2019s campaign to raise funds for a waxing truck for the cross country World Cup can donate or get info at: foundation@ussa.org\nIt\u2019s the perfect opportunity to really grow the sport right now.\u201dJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyerU.S. cross country waxing truck campaignDonors interested in contributing to the U.S.\nSki Team trustees in Vail, where she solicited greater financial support for cross country.\n\u201cI was so excited to be able to put cross country on the map, get people excited.\nRandall is promoting an effort to get a waxing truck for the U.S. for next season, which will cost more than $500,000."}
