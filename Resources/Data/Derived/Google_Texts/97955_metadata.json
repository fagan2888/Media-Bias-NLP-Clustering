Johnson fled in a vehicle but crashed it about a quarter-mile away behind The Factory entertainment complex, police said.\n\nPolice said Johnson refused to comply with repeated demands to drop a handgun, prompting Cohen and Ragland to shoot him. He died several hours later at WakeMed in Raleigh.\n\nBoth officers spent several weeks on paid administrative leave while the SBI investigated the shooting but have since returned to normal duty.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-08-25 13:31:00", "description": "Two Wake Forest police officers have been cleared in a May shooting that left a Raleigh man dead.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-25 13:31:00", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14853536|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two Wake Forest police officers have been cleared in a May shooting that left a Raleigh man dead.", "title": "Wake Forest officers cleared in fatal shooting :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/wake-forest-officers-cleared-in-fatal-shooting/14853536/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/05/07/14629944/14629944-1459199631-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-25T13:31:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Two Wake Forest police officers have been cleared in a May shooting that left a Raleigh man dead.", "title": "Wake Forest officers cleared in fatal shooting :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/wake-forest-officers-cleared-in-fatal-shooting/14853536/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2015/05/07/14629944/14629944-1459199631-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bad\"", "article_summary": "Raleigh police requested assistance regarding the discharge of a stolen firearm, and Wake Forest police officers David Cohen and Darryl Ragland confronted Johnson, 18, on Stone Monument Drive, off South Main Street.\nBoth officers spent several weeks on paid administrative leave while the SBI investigated the shooting but have since returned to normal duty.\nYou must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other charactersMessage: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wral.com/14853536\u2014 Two Wake Forest police officers have been cleared in a May shooting that left a Raleigh man dead.\nPolice said Johnson refused to comply with repeated demands to drop a handgun, prompting Cohen and Ragland to shoot him.\nJohnson fled in a vehicle but crashed it about a quarter-mile away behind The Factory entertainment complex, police said."}
