Marco Rubio outlined the economic policies he would enact if elected president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president not because I think America\u2019s doomed,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe America is doomed. I\u2019m running for president because I believe that we are leaving on the table unfulfilled potential. That today we are settling for less than what we fully can be.\u201d\n\nRubio spoke on how his policies would embrace globalization and technology so that the U.S. can compete globally in the 21st century.\n\nRubio says that as the world has changed, America has not changed with it; policies need to reflect the \u201cnew reality.\u201d\n\nIncreased access to training and education for lower and middle-income Americans would help boost growth, he said. Speaking on higher education, Rubio stated that sometimes four-year degrees lead to jobs that can be done without an education.\n\nTo combat that trend, Rubio said that America needs to embrace vocational programs to allow Americans to get technical or trade jobs.\n\n\u201cGlobalization is real,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe cannot be satisfied with a country that\u2019s diminished in its prestige and its influence on the global stage.\u201d\n\nRubio also said he would allows veterans looking to enter the workforce the opportunity to be able to get college credit for what they already know if they choose to go back to school and get a degree.\n\nAs another economic remedy, Rubio would plan \u201cto have a tax code that allows us to compete again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will have a tax code that says to businesses, \u2018The more money you invest back in your business, the more people you hire, the more you pay them, the less you will owe the government in taxes,\u2019\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio says he would reduce the corporate tax rates to 25 percent and permit companies to bring overseas revenue back to the U.S. without additional taxation.\n\nRubio has authored a \u201cpro-growth\u201d and \u201cpro-family\u201d tax plan with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that would keep the top individual tax rate at 35 percent and eliminate the estate tax, among other things.\n\nIf a tax code is put in place that makes the U.S. globally competitive, restrictions are put on regulations that \u201cstrangle our economy\u201d and the national debt gets under control, Rubio said, \u201cThe United States of America in the 21st century will be the single greatest place in the history of mankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a potential not just to be as good as we\u2019ve even been,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe have a potential to be greater than we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio spoke in Iowa on his economic plan to make America 'greater than we\u2019ve ever been.'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Marco Rubio spoke in Iowa on his economic plan to make America 'greater than we\u2019ve ever been.'", "title": "Marco Rubio's Economic Plan to Make America Greater", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150708_Rubio.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-08T12:47:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1G6TcSB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Marco Rubio spoke in Iowa on his economic plan to make America 'greater than we\u2019ve ever been.'", "title": "Marco Rubio's Economic Plan to Make America Greater", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150708_Rubio.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-07-08T10:25:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T12:47:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Marco Rubio, election, 2016, Iowa, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e67\"", "article_summary": "WINDSOR HEIGHTS, Iowa\u2014At a summer cookout here Tuesday evening, Florida Sen.
