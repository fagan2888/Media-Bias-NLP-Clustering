The backlash has been vociferous, both from the right and from many liberals. To take extreme examples, the Federalist declared that the protests show \u201cthat it\u2019s time to burn the universities to the ground,\u201d and RedState called the Mizzou football strikers \u201cCowardly Liberal Lazy Douchebags.\u201d At its core, the \u201cPC culture\u201d backlash is driven by fear of young people, particularly young women and young people of color, challenging unjust institutions. But the hand-wringing also illustrates a key divide between the left and right: how they treat activists.\n\nOne leading liberal writer declared that the campus protests represent something deeper, and more sinister, than anti-racism activism: \u201cAmerican political correctness has obviously never perpetrated the brutality of a communist government, but it has also never acquired the powers that come with full control of the machinery of the state.\u201d The event that led to the protestors being unfavorably compared to past Marxist governments. The event may be distasteful, but it takes quite an imagination to conjure up a scenario in which it is evidence of creeping Stalinism.\n\nHowever, there are indeed movements in the United States that consider violence or threat of it a legitimate means to political change, that frequently harass reporters, that silence academics and researchers. The problem is you find them on the right. There are the conservative activists who brandish fully-automatic weapons in public spaces. There are the pro-life activists who harass, both verbally and physically, women obtaining abortions \u2014 on a wide scale and in an organized manner. One in five abortion clinics reported \u201csevere violence\u201d in the past year (blockades, clinic invasions, bombing, arson, chemical attacks, stalking, physical violence, gunfire, bomb threats, arson threats, and death threats), and other forms of harassment have increased dramatically in the past four years (see chart).\n\nThe gun rights movement has muzzled research about gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control. Recently a conservative billionaire sued Mother Jones in an effort to tie up funds and destroy the magazine. The Koch brothers have succeeded in funding hundreds of university departments and have attempted to use their clout to determine curriculum. Republican governors have used their political power to cut funding to university centers that they find ideologically inconvenient. Though the real police have killed nearly 1,000 people this year, many elite columnists are more concerned about the \u201cPC police\u201d who have merely called for more inclusive universities.\n\nWhen David Simon called the Mizzou protesters \u201cfascists,\u201d Tressie McMillan Cottom noted correctly:\n\n\u201cWhat we saw at that student rally was democracy in action, not fascism. Fascism means something more than a thing one does not like. Fascism means a system of social organization that concentrates power and doesn\u2019t just discourage dissent but organizes the State against it.\u201d\n\nThere are many things in the world today, and even in America, that resemble actual fascism or creeping fascism. Student activism is not one of those things.\n\nThe liberal reaction to many recent events points to an asymmetry in how party elites treat their activist bases. Consider the Keystone XL protestors, who recently won a key victory in the fight against climate change. Though Jonathan Chait considers climate change \u201cthe most dire threat to humanity,\u201d he condemned the Keystone XL fight as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d (and even compared the protestors to Republicans trying to shut down the government). Similarly, though liberals are deeply concerned about rising inequality and stagnant wages, the Fight For $15 was widely denounced by elite liberals as either a \u201chopeless waste of time\u201d or \u201cworrisome.\u201d This disdain of activism also applies to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which has been vociferously criticized for shaking up various Democratic presidential campaigns this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all the handwringing about \"p.c. run amok,\" the truth is that there are far more pernicious forces at work", "author": "Sean McElwee", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For all the handwringing about \"p.c. run amok,\" the truth is that there are far more pernicious forces at work", "title": "The truth about the P.C. wars: Radicalized wingnuts & disdainful liberal elites are the real problem", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/14/the_truth_about_the_p_c_wars_radicalized_wing_nuts_disdainful_liberal_elites_are_the_real_problem/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/Mizzou_Protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all the handwringing about \"p.c. run amok,\" the truth is that there are far more pernicious forces at work", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/Mizzou_Protest.jpg", "title": "The truth about the P.C. wars: Radicalized wingnuts & disdainful liberal elites are the real problem", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The truth about the P.C. wars: Radicalized wingnuts & disdainful liberal elites are the real problem", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, mizzou, political correctness, Yale", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, mizzou, political correctness, Yale, News, Politics NewsOver the last week, students protesting racism at Yale and Mizzou (and other campuses) became national news.\nFascism means something more than a thing one does not like.\nThe liberal reaction to many recent events points to an asymmetry in how party elites treat their activist bases.\nBut the hand-wringing also illustrates a key divide between the left and right: how they treat activists.\nFascism means a system of social organization that concentrates power and doesn\u2019t just discourage dissent but organizes the State against it.\u201dThere are many things in the world today, and even in America, that resemble actual fascism or creeping fascism."}
