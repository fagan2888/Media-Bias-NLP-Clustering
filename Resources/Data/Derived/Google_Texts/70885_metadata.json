Too few Alabamians have medical insurance. Too few can afford treatments. Too few can get to doctors\u2019 offices because they lack transportation, and too few primary care physicians are available in some counties.\n\nThose massive, even catastrophic, problems don\u2019t admit of quick solutions.\n\nBut why not start with the elephant in the room: State leaders\u2019 shameless refusal to look seriously at ways to expand Medicaid coverage to more working poor under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOther red states have worked with federal officials to fashion block-grant programs or other means of accepting the ACA funding to get their residents insured.\n\nAnd save their lives. A White House study released this month projects expansion of Medicaid in Alabama in 2016 would prevent 210 deaths that would otherwise result from lack of health care.\n\nMortality rates are indeed dropping in states that embraced the expansion, making Alabama\u2019s refusal to do so morally reprehensible.\n\nThe second greatest health concern in Alabama, according to the ADPH assessment, is mental health care, including substance abuse. Again, the state has a severe shortage of mental health providers, particularly in rural areas. Suicide and drug-related mortality numbers have increased in recent years.\n\nAlabama\u2019s prisons are stuffed with inmates with substance-abuse issues who get next to nothing in terms of programs to help them kick the habit and stay out of trouble after release.\n\nYet the state Legislature, under a no-new-revenues budget vetoed by Gov. Robert Bentley, would slash funds for corrections and community mental health services.\n\nOther top concerns cited include pregnancy outcomes. Alabama has high infant mortality rates, and too many pregnant women lack adequate prenatal care, particularly black and younger mothers.\n\nThe list goes on. Child abuse and neglect, sexually transmitted disease rates, access to dental care, obesity -- all are significant problems across the state.\n\nThey won\u2019t go away on their own and require a strong public health safety net if improvements are to be made.\n\nThe dismal report underscores the imperative that state lawmakers find ways to shore up -- not gut -- agencies that provide public health protections when they meet in special session this summer.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1N5KQQp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Alabama must improve access to basic health care", "og": {"site_name": "The Montgomery Advertiser", "description": "Alabama must improve access to basic health care", "title": "Alabama must improve access to basic health care", "url": "http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/06/23/alabama-must-improve-access-basic-health-care/29158957/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/montgomeryadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alabama must improve access to basic health care", "title": "Alabama must improve access to basic health care", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/23/Montgomery/B9317790642Z.1_20150623115511_000_G29B5KPJO.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@mgmadvertiser", "site": "@mgmadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=790279910", "fb": {"app_id": 163677993677689}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The second greatest health concern in Alabama, according to the ADPH assessment, is mental health care, including substance abuse.\nThe greatest problem singled out is lack of access to basic health care.\nThey won\u2019t go away on their own and require a strong public health safety net if improvements are to be made.\nThe report highlights the depressingly familiar list of health problems afflicting the state\u2019s regions and residents, identified through surveys of consumers, hundreds of health care and other organizations, large employers, nonprofits and special interest groups.\nA White House study released this month projects expansion of Medicaid in Alabama in 2016 would prevent 210 deaths that would otherwise result from lack of health care."}
