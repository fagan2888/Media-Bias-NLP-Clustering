Now, under the stewardship of Jeb Bush\u2019s former sidekick, tenured faculty are being laid off in droves. The response has been student sit-ins, faculty mobilization and investigations of Enron-style accounting. It\u2019s a real-time, rolling image of higher education shock therapy \u2014 and a threatening signal to public universities nationwide.\n\nSubject A: Edinboro University.\n\nEdinboro, an 8,000-student campus in northwestern Pennsylvania, is one of 14 schools in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, or PASSHE. Last September, in the name of \u201cstrategic investment for the future vitality of the University,\u201d president Julie Wollman announced that 42 teaching staff, including 18 tenured faculty, would be laid off, or \u201cretrenched.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first, the students were outraged,\u201d says Crystal Folmar, a senior communications major \u2014 especially, she says, over the wholesale elimination of the school\u2019s music program. One hundred and fifty students, faculty and staff rallied outside Cole Auditorium. Later, students delivered a 1,200 signature petition to the president\u2019s office.\n\nPresident Wollman wasn\u2019t available, so they sat in. After a little over an hour, she emerged.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the reputation of Edinboro has to be damaged,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it will be damaged if the word goes out that this is a negative thing.\u201d Because of state cuts, enrollment declines and hiring costs, she added, \u201cwe don\u2019t need all the faculty members that we have.\u201d\n\nA student replied, \u201cWe have freshmen that are calling us, and on the 2018 Facebook that are asking, should we even come to Edinboro?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the answer should be yes!\u201d\n\nAnother asked, \u201cWhy are we spending so much money on buildings when we can\u2019t pay the faculty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe money has not come out of the general budget,\u201d she said, echoing a common belief. \u201cI think I\u2019ve explained this a number of times. That\u2019s incorrect. It\u2019s true that in many states, there are two separate pots of money.\u201d\n\nThe situation at Edinboro \u2014 layoffs, uproar, blithe financial entreaties \u2014 repeated itself at four other PASSHE schools. By the deadline for retrenchment notices, Clarion posted nine tenured layoffs, East Stroudsburg seven, Slippery Rock one, and Mansfield 22. Edinboro\u2019s figure dropped to six, after the school decided to keep its music program. \u201cIt felt like a very political play the entire time,\u201d Folmar says. \u201cIt was just a bait-and-switch.\u201d After Mansfield pulled several names off its list, the total is now down to 34.\n\nStill, as the plan stands, says Jean Jones, a professor of political science at Edinboro, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to impact enrollment. It\u2019s all over the press here.\u201d Moreover, \u201cExciting new young scholars would think twice about coming here to work. I think that applies to administrators as well.\u201d Overall, she says, \u201cMorale is terrible. People are depressed. The thing that worries me in the long term is that this is the new normal. It\u2019s really just destroying the academic community. A number of faculty have told me that they\u2019re just going to punch the clock.\u201d\n\nWhy put all this \u2014 not just the promise of tenure, but the system\u2019s culture and reputation \u2014 on the chopping block?\n\nPart of it is the recession, which governments and universities have parlayed into austerity and privatization. Nationwide, state funding for higher education dropped 28 percent, or $2,353 per student, between 2008 and 2013, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. All but two states have cut spending during that time, and some, like California, Arizona and Louisiana, have seen hundreds of program and staff cuts. Some universities have merged; others have pursued taylorist schemes like shared services to attempt to reduce operational costs. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Corbett, a sort of stealth Tea Partyer who rarely lets his persona overshadow his politics, proposed a 53 percent cut to higher education in 2011-2012 \u2014 which the Republican state Legislature whittled to a still-whopping 18 percent.\n\nThe academic slant of PASSHE\u2019s cuts also falls in line with national trends \u2014 and Corbett\u2019s own K-12 fiddling. In a system that began as a network of teacher training schools in the 1800s, arts, humanities and social sciences have given way to vocational training. The PASSHE retrenchment plans rolled out this fall ax not only professors in non-applied fields, but the majors, minors and certificates that they oversee. Over the last five years, the system phased out 158 academic programs while introducing 56 new ones in fields like software engineering, applied science and allied health. Likewise, the state\u2019s 2012 Higher Education Modernization Act, unanimously backed by the Legislature and signed by the governor, supports programs in workforce-need areas like nursing and finance.\n\nThese trends are, in part, a function of tuition hikes \u2014 23 percent in PASSHE schools since 2008-2009 \u2014 which disincentivize students from paying for non-applied coursework. With the additional influence of general enrollment declines, traditional programs are threatened with low demand. Those that remain face a vicious spiral: fewer course options, ballooning class sizes and, in turn, pedagogy that\u2019s less personalized and degrees that are harder to obtain. And, of course, humanistic education is a right-wing bugaboo. As North Carolina\u2019s conservative Pope Center put it, \u201cOne standard to use is whether a center, program, or institute serves and advocates for a political agenda. This is often the case in diversity or multicultural offices, women\u2019s and ethnic studies centers and programs, and environmental programs.\u201d\n\nRetrenchment is another ballgame. Tenured faculty layoffs are rare, says Howard Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University and collective bargaining chairman of the American Association of University Professionals. \u201cMost [faculty contracts] have protections that say, before you lay off someone in this department, you have to make sure there\u2019s no other work you can do.\u201d And then, \u201cBefore layoffs happen, there has to be a declaration of financial exigency.\u201d In the past few years, retrenchment has cropped up at the University of Louisiana and, in smaller quantities, within PASSHE. In 1977, the City University of New York, in addition to instituting tuition for the first time, went through a severe bout of retrenchment.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, administrators warn, it could become more common. \u201cOne of our concerns is that we might see this continue in the future,\u201d says Lauren Gutshall, a spokesperson for the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties, or APSCUF. \u201cLooking towards next year and the next two, three or five years, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019re going to see this battle come up again and again.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, shedding faculty is simply a waiting game. Faculty may retire, or find jobs elsewhere, prompting nonrenewal of their tenure lines or replacement with adjuncts. Under these trends, the tenured or tenure-track professoriate plummeted from 57 percent of all college professors in 1975 to 31 percent in 2007. Retrenchment is a blunter device \u2014 a quick fix for universities crying exigency. On the flip side, it rolls back job security already in place, and an age-old academic tradition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Gov.
