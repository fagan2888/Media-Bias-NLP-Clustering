The Russian nuclear submarine Alexander Nevsky test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to carry nuclear warheads.

A statement released by Russia’s defense ministry confirmed the launch of the Bulava missile while the Alexander Nevsky was in the Barents Sea.

The missile landed on a training ground in Russia’s eastern peninsula of Kamchatka, Reuters reported Friday.

The Yuri Dolgoruky nuclear submarine also test-fired a Bulava missile from an underwater position in the Barents Sea on Oct. 29.

Russia plans to significantly improve its naval readiness over the next six years, and the Bulava missile is anticipated to be a key part of its nuclear arsenal.
