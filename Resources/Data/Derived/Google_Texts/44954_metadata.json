As the results show, a number of these patients experienced grade 3 diarrhea associated with PB272: 29% of patients not taking any therapy meant to curb neratinib-related diarrhea, and 21% of patients given a low-dose loperamide to counter neratinib-related diarrhea. Perhaps more damaging was that despite the data being described as \"positive\" by Puma, only three of 40 patients had a partial response, while four demonstrated prolonged stable disease (more than six months), and 12 experienced stable disease equating to six months or less. Median progression-free survival was 1.9 months, while median overall survival was 8.7 months. Clearly, investors were expected partial response figures to be more robust.\n\nIn addition, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) reported the failure of its metastatic breast cancer therapy, Tykerb, to meet its primay endpoint of improved disease-free survival in a phase 3 study in combination with Herceptin for HER2-positve early stage breast cancer. The thought here from investors is that if Glaxo's Tykerb is having difficulty in the neoadjuvant setting for metastatic breast cancer, then PB272 may have just as difficult a time.\n\nNow what: Today is certainly a batten down the hatches kind of day if you're a Puma Biotechnology shareholder \u2013 but it's also not the end of the world, either. Keep in mind that Puma is actually running three mid-stage studies on PB272 and only had data at ASCO to present on one, so there's still plenty of time left for it to potentially demonstrate that PB272 is better than existing therapies on the market. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed with the low partial response rate in its 40-patient study, but brain metastases are inherently difficult to fight to begin with. The factor I would watch more would be those grade 3 diarrhea-related events. Safety is paramount to the Food and Drug Administration, and a considerably higher degree of adverse events could knock PB272 down the totem the pole. Moving forward I'd suggest keeping Puma on your watchlist but sticking the sidelines for the time being.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:07", "date": "2014-06-02T18:07:00Z", "description": "Puma Biotechnology shares face a double whammy following the annual ASCO conferences.
