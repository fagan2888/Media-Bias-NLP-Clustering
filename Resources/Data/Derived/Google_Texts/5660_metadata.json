Bill Haslam's college plan. (Photo: Submitted / TSU) Story Highlights TSU leader Glenda Glover addresses concerns she has and responds to column by Frank Daniels.\n\nReorganization would strengthen University of Tennessee system while weakening state universities.\n\nThose state schools include TSU, Middle Tennessee State and Austin Peay State universities.\n\nRe: \"TSU should focus on promise of independence,\" by Frank Daniels III, March 11.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s Tennessean, a column was written questioning Tennessee State University\u2019s reaction to the FOCUS (Focus on College and University Success) Act, and the need for TSU to focus its efforts elsewhere.\n\nI believe it is important to communicate and clarify TSU\u2019s position on the FOCUS Act, and dispel any misconceptions regarding our position.\n\nAs president of TSU, I am a proud supporter of Gov. Haslam\u2019s initiatives, including Drive to 55 and Tennessee Promise. I do not oppose the FOCUS Act. That allegation is simply not true. However, we have raised some legitimate concerns regarding certain provisions in the act and the unintended effects on TSU, including faculty, students and community members. This is part of my responsibility as president of TSU.\n\nOur primary concern, as conveyed to the governor\u2019s office and to the legislature, centers on the power and structure of the University of Tennessee system, which will remain intact under FOCUS, while six universities in the Tennessee Board of Regents system will be removed from TBR governance, and individual boards will be created.\n\nThe unintended consequence will be further strengthening of the UT system (which includes four comprehensive institutions) and the weakening of the six universities as a systemic unit. Allowing the UT universities to remain intact with no disassembling, and diminishing the strength of the six combined universities, invariably adds to the controlling strength of the UT system.\n\nThis is a legitimate concern at a time of limited state resources.\n\nIn addition, those familiar with the history between the UT system and TSU will understand the TSU family\u2019s sensitivity and trepidation to structural changes that appear to strengthen the UT system.\n\nGlenda Glover (Photo: Submitted)\n\nFor more than 20 years, UT and TSU were embroiled in litigation following UT\u2019s creation of a campus in Nashville in the late 1960s. That litigation led to the court-ordered merger of the UT-Nashville campus with TSU in 1977 (now known as TSU\u2019s Avon Williams campus).\n\nThen, in 2015, we learned about UT\u2019s potential plan to operate a Professional MBA program in the Nashville area, thus opening old wounds. UT was well aware of TSU\u2019s Executive MBA program, which starts next year and would be a duplication of academic programs. This remains very unsettling to the TSU community.\n\nWith the enactment of FOCUS, some fear that TSU will be left in a more vulnerable position related to funding and its ability to defend against what many in the TSU community view as UT\u2019s latest effort to assert its power.\n\nTSU has also relayed its concerns regarding funding under the Act. Last week\u2019s column noted that a funding formula already exists that determines appropriations for the universities. This was partially correct. However, this formula determines base operational funding for higher education institutions, but does not determine critically important capital project funding, including much needed academic buildings and residence halls.\n\nThe strength and political power of a system or an institution play a significant role in the capital funding process.\n\nMoreover, with respect to the funding formula, under FOCUS, a new committee will be assembled to develop the funding formula that will include the University of Tennessee president, Tennessee Board of Regents chancellor, Tennessee Higher Education Commission executive director and only one of the six presidents of the independent Tennessee Board of Regents universities \u2014 rather than all six. This is also troublesome.\n\nIn our meetings with the governor\u2019s office, I believe that we have made progress on possible amendments to FOCUS to strengthen the intent of the law, and ensure equity and fundamental fairness for TSU. I commend the governor\u2019s office for its cooperation and willingness to hear our concerns.\n\nFinally, we continue to focus on the future, while also taking reasonable measures to strengthen the FOCUS Act for the benefit of the university, its faculty, staff, students and community stakeholders.\n\nGlenda Glover is president of Tennessee State University.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1phxQRQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "TSU leader Glenda Glover addresses concerns she has about the bill and responds to Frank Daniels' column.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "TSU leader Glenda Glover addresses concerns she has about the bill and responds to Frank Daniels' column.", "title": "Tennessee State president: I do not oppose FOCUS Act", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/03/13/tennessee-state-president-do-not-oppose-focus-act/81685946/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TSU leader Glenda Glover addresses concerns she has about the bill and responds to Frank Daniels' column.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce9441e96e61c051ed8d11d88d64782f086b680f/c=144-0-1008-864&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg", "title": "Tennessee State president: I do not oppose FOCUS Act", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Tennessee", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Tennessee", "title": "Tennessee State president: I do not oppose FOCUS Act", "author": "Glenda Glover", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/373594928d1db65b7fe076e72b04bf2784197faf/c=325-0-973-864/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14ddd9cdeafcf59fba1b38cb9b4029793e2b923d/c=144-0-1008-864/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8488d6f4bfc92376e574c2bc63d808cb98ffbece/c=1-0-1150-864/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b236887c426937c22417f37f9d085031dbd4cca6/c=0-107-1152-758&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-13T15:44:12.947000-05:00", "shorthed": "TSU president: I do not oppose FOCUS Act", "articleid": 81685946, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2186464ba84bfb3799ab6c8c3f4838528973d0a/c=0-107-1152-758/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1285a584ab3f1f1d0794dcf9c02d075cbb9d4c6/c=431-0-915-864/local/-/media/2016/03/01/Nashville/Nashville/635924416686706421-IMG-2261.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Glenda Glover, Tennessee State University, Frank Daniels, FOCUS Act, Governor Bill Haslam, Tennessee news, Nashville news"}, "article_summary": "In Friday\u2019s Tennessean, a column was written questioning Tennessee State University\u2019s reaction to the FOCUS (Focus on College and University Success) Act, and the need for TSU to focus its efforts elsewhere.\nI do not oppose the FOCUS Act.\nI believe it is important to communicate and clarify TSU\u2019s position on the FOCUS Act, and dispel any misconceptions regarding our position.\nFinally, we continue to focus on the future, while also taking reasonable measures to strengthen the FOCUS Act for the benefit of the university, its faculty, staff, students and community stakeholders.\nThose state schools include TSU, Middle Tennessee State and Austin Peay State universities."}
