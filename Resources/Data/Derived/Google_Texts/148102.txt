Via the Twitter feed of Chad Pecknold comes the sort of story that is truly and hilariously sads-making:

"One person shows up to O'Malley event in Iowa, remains uncommitted" Amid a vicious winter storm on Monday that forced some presidential campaigns to cancel their scheduled stops in Iowa, only Martin O'Malley decided to press on. And one man at his last event, the only person to show up, in fact, "was glad to see me," the former Maryland governor said. But he still would not commit to caucus for O'Malley.

The man's name is only known as "Kenneth" and was immortalized in a tweet from ABC News' Sarah Beckman.
