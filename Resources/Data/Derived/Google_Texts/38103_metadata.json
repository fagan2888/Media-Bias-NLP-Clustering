When Obamacare ads targeting millennials flopped, it opened up a wider cultural debate about what works when selling to millennials. The lessons learned can help all service providers better connect with their newest customer base.\n\nWhat millennials seek from service providers\n\nHaving grown up in the age of the Internet, millennial shoppers know how to comparison shop. Millenials are much more immune to print, television and radio ads than service buyers of previous generations and tend toward a self-serve approach toward what they need. When looking for a new auto body shop or a quote for insurance, they\u2019re likely to head online and check general-review sites like Yelp. They may ask friends for referrals, as millennials place a high value on social sharing. Like their Gen-X cohorts, millennials place a high value on individuality. Strategies that you developed to reach out to gen X-ers may need subtle tweaks to appeal to millennials, but the two share a similar mindset.\n\nDo\u2019s and Dont\u2019s of selling to millennials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO keep it short and sweet. In the era of tweets, millennials prefer their info in quick bites. While some have criticized their short attention span, it\u2019s no use fighting it when trying to market your services. A long advertisement will lose their attention.\n\nDO maintain a comprehensive online presence and use this as your base camp. If your ads discuss ways to buy insurance leads, a millennial will find the QuoteWizard website and begin reviewing the information presented there. If your website\u2019s not ready, don\u2019t launch your campaign. If the website states something very different from the advertisement, millennials will become suspicious.\n\nDO cultivate a laid back presence. If you\u2019re launching a new service, take a laid back attitude. In Forbes, Micah Solomon recommends underpromising rather than overstating your services. Steer clear of declarative, overhyped statements like \u201cthe best ever,\u201d \u201cincredible\u201d or \u201c10-minute oil change.\u201d Instead, use more laid-back language like \u201cgreat\u201d, \u201cpretty quick\u201d or \u201cfast oil changes, free Wi-Fi.\u201d Study examples of service providers around you to identify a balance that expresses what you do well. Then make sure you don\u2019t overhype it like you\u2019re writing copy for BuzzFeed or Upworthy. This can feel weird to marketers, because it\u2019s not a hard sell. Millennials are naturally skeptical and react negatively toward a hard sell.\n\nDON\u2019T try to be someone or something you aren\u2019t. The Obamacare ads captured negative attention because they tried too hard to appeal to millennials in ways that were young, fresh and hipster-y. However, most millennials aren\u2019t hipsters and they didn\u2019t appreciate being babied.\n\nDON\u2019T play the know it all. Many millennials are looking for service providers for the first time. Positioning yourself as the only expert will backfire. If you offer online resources millennials can use \u2014 via blog, Facebook page, YouTube channel or other social forum \u2014 millennials will use these resources to become informed consumers and will trust you. If you hoard information for yourself and avoid transparency, you\u2019ll instantly alienate these potential customers.\n\nRyan comes from an ad and marketing background, and is now focused on the healthcare niche.
