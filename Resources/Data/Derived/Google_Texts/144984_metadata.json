Jay Nixon by name, the implication was that Nixon \u2013 a Democrat \u2013 has been too eager to go along with whatever President Barack Obama\u2019s administration wanted.\n\nAmong other things, Hanaway made clear that she opposed any expansion of Medicaid as sought under the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nMedicaid provides coverage for low-income and disabled people. Missouri currently has one of the strictest eligibility rates in the nation. Most adults can earn no more than 19 percent of the federal poverty level -- or $2,217 a year -- to qualify for coverage.\n\n\u201cI do not think the way to solve our health-care problems in Missouri is to expand the entitlements,\u201d Hanaway said. During her time in the Missouri House, Hanaway added that she observed the last federal expansion of Medicaid during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration \u2013 the federal program broadening coverage for children.\n\n\u201cIt got to the point that it was breaking the state\u2019s budget in the early 2000s,\u2019\u2019 she said. Hanaway served as speaker in 2003- 2004; she had left office when the General Assembly cut or curbed benefits for 300,000 low-income Missourians in 2005.\n\nHanaway said that she recognized that Missouri hospitals were hurting because they were losing the federal aid that used to cover the costs of treating uninsured people. That aid is being phased out because the Medicaid expansion is designed to provide coverage for those people.\n\nHanaway said she was willing to discuss the general issue with hospitals, but she emphasized, \u201cI think we should find a Missouri solution that doesn\u2019t expand entitlement rolls.\u201d\n\nPromises to be pro-business\n\nHanaway contended that the best way to improve health-care access in the state was to attract more businesses, thus creating more jobs.\n\nTo that end, she promised \u201cto go out and create and find and develop quality jobs for Missourians.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still down 58,000 jobs\u2019\u2019 from late 2008, when the economic downturn began, she said.\n\nTo be successful, she said that the state needs to cut back regulations and suggested she would support \u201crealignment of some labor policies.\u201d She previously has said she would back a \u201cright to work\u2019\u2019 law to bar employers and unions from requiring all workers to pay dues if a majority votes to join a union.\n\n\"Anything that is a barrier to either business growing here or coming here, I'm going to be an enemy to that barrier,'' she said.\n\nA lawyer, Hanaway also called for \u201creal tort reform\u2019\u2019 aimed at curbing lawsuits against businesses.\n\nTo that end, Hanaway made clear that she will be more assertive than Nixon in dealing with the General Assembly. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to have the legislature doing one thing and the governor doing another,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re spending too much time in the legislature playing \u2018small ball.\u2019 \"\n\nHanaway does appear to approve Nixon\u2019s efforts to curb state tax credit programs. She indicated that she would try to trim historic tax credits, which have been used extensively in St. Louis to rebuild downtown and some neighborhoods.\n\nHanaway said that the state\u2019s return is roughly 60 cents on every $1 in tax credits, implying that the gain doesn't justify the cost.\n\nBlames Koster for early start on campaign\n\nHanaway currently works for the St. Louis law firm of Husch Blackwell, which also employs state Rep. John Diehl, R-Town and Country and the likely next state House speaker in 2015. State Sen. Scott Sifton, D-Affton, also works at the same firm.\n\nHanaway blamed Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster for her decision to announce her bid for governor months ago. Koster, a Democrat (and former Republican), made clear in early 2013 that he planned to run for governor in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think Republicans have lost elections for governor recently because we started too late,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nState Auditor Tom Schweich, a Republican seeking re-election in November, has indicated that he may announce for governor soon after the election. His campaign has been sharply critical of the $750,000 donation that Hanaway recently received from wealthy financier Rex Sinquefield, the state\u2019s top political donor.\n\nHanaway didn\u2019t mention Sinquefield by name but told chamber members that his generous donation would be overshadowed by the $15 million or more than she will need to raise for her campaign.\n\nShe acknowledged that it has been a challenge to raise money, particularly since she no longer holds public office. Schweich so far has outraised Hanaway.\n\nHanaway quipped that when it comes to campaign donations, \u201cI have a completely different perspective now on the power of incumbency at this point.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Former Missouri House Speaker Catherine Hanaway says she\u2019ll freeze most state regulations, and block implementation of many federal ones, if she\u2019s elected", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/hanaway-promises-be-more-assertive-legislators-and-washington", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201402/hanaway_catherine.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Former Missouri House Speaker Catherine Hanaway says she\u2019ll freeze most state regulations, and block implementation of many federal ones, if she\u2019s elected", "title": "Hanaway Promises To Be More Assertive With Legislators And Washington"}, "story_id": 357900366, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Hanaway Promises To Be More Assertive With Legislators And Washington"}, "nid": 40480, "datePublished": "2014-10-21", "keywords": "Catherine Hanaway, Strictly Politics", "wordCount": 919, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "To that end, Hanaway made clear that she will be more assertive than Nixon in dealing with the General Assembly.\n\u201cWe need not automatically adopt every executive order and have our state departments carry it out.\u201dAlthough Hanaway didn\u2019t mention Gov.\nHanaway blamed Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster for her decision to announce her bid for governor months ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re spending too much time in the legislature playing \u2018small ball.\u2019 \"Hanaway does appear to approve Nixon\u2019s efforts to curb state tax credit programs.\n\u201cI do not think the way to solve our health-care problems in Missouri is to expand the entitlements,\u201d Hanaway said."}
