U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., who successfully defended President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law in 2012, is among the possible candidates to succeed Attorney General Eric Holder, who is expected to announce Thursday that he will step down.

Mr. Verrilli, 57 years old, is a veteran appellate lawyer who in private and government practice has argued numerous high-profile Supreme Court cases. In addition to defending the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Verrilli has represented the U.S. government in major cases before the high court on same-sex marriage, voting rights and this year’s challenge to contraception-coverage requirements under the health law.

He was confirmed by the Senate as solicitor general, the chief advocate for the government before the high court, in June 2011 to succeed Elena Kagan after she was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.

Perhaps Mr. Verrilli’s most famous argument came in the main challenge to the health-care law before the high court in March 2012. It began awkwardly as he coughed and stuttered. But he was prepared when the justices asked him whether the law’s requirement to buy health insurance could open the door for the federal government to mandate that people buy broccoli.

“A car or broccoli aren’t purchased for their own sake,” Chief Justice John Roberts said to Mr. Verrilli. “They’re purchased for the sake of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for food.”

Mr. Verrilli replied, “The difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that health insurance is the means of payment for health care, and broccoli is … not the means of payment for anything else.”

Despite his early stumbles in the arguments, Mr. Verrilli was redeemed when the Supreme Court ruled in the administration’s favor and largely upheld the law.
