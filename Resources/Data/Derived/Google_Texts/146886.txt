Workers in the finance industry — among the highest paid employees in the country — will be taking home a little less this year.

Year-end bonuses on Wall Street are expected to be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than last year, according to a new analysis by New York-based compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.

The shift toward smaller bonuses marks the end of a three-year run of steadily rising payouts. “Given the up and down year Wall Street is experiencing this year, smaller year-end incentives across the industry should come as no surprise,” Johnson Associates managing director Alan Johnson said in a statement.

Of course, even with the decline, bonus payments will amount to several times more than most Americans’ annual salary. Last year, the average bonus in the New York Securities Industry was more than $170,000, according to the New York State Comptroller.

Fixed-income traders will take the biggest bonus hit, with their year-end income falling up to 20 percent, according to Johnson Associates. Bonuses will fall an average 15 percent for hedge fund workers and investment banking underwriters.

Not every sector will see the decline. Investment bankers working in mergers and acquisitions will see an average bonus increase of more than 15 percent, and bonuses in private equity could go up 10 percent.

The report projects that compensation for 2016 will remain flat or slightly down, due to interest rate uncertainty and an increased focus in the banking industry on cost cutting.
