The annual event brought roughly 15,000 people to the fields at Stenger Soccer Complex.\n\nAs eager children and their families ran in circles fighting with the wind and struggling to get their kites in the air, Ridha\u2019s soared. He stood completely still, smiling up at the Spiderman kite he purchased for his son as it sailed over his head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an art,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so good at it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since the Arvada resident last flew a kite. He worked as a translator in Iraq before fleeing his home 2\u00bd years ago and settling down with his family in the United States.\n\n\u201cI had to leave everything behind,\u201d he said.\n\nThat included his collection of hand-crafted kites.\n\nWhile he threaded the kite string through his fingers on Sunday, Ridha\u2019s mind traveled back to a time when he would craft simple kites from balsa wood, tape and bags and sell them to his friends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of myself at 7 or 8 years old, flying kites on the roof of my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to make so many kinds of kites.\u201d\n\nAli studied his dad\u2019s hands as he attempted to lift a kite of his own into the mild wind. To his frustration, the diamond-shaped flier dived into the grass.\n\n\u201cWhy is yours flying?\u201d he said. \u201cMine keeps crashing.\u201d\n\nDespite his frustration, Ali was impressed.\n\nWhen Ridha\u2019s string intertwined with a Disney princess-themed kite, he deftly unsnarled the tangle using some of the skills he picked up in Iraq.\n\n\u201cI would fly mine. My neighbor would fly his,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d try to tie them around one another. Then we would pull. It was a competition.\u201d\n\nOther parents at the festival wanted to pass on the childhood tradition to their children. Chris Ketter and his 10-year-old daughter Mia attached their kite string to a screwdriver to keep the line taut.\n\nThe idea was inspired by a trick Ketter learned as a kid.\n\n\u201cWe used to fly kites a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI would take my fishing pole and tie a kite to it. Then I could reel it in.\u201d\n\nBut for Ridha, flying kites was more than a childhood pastime. \u201cWe used to have kites all through the year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many flew kites. Here, it\u2019s maybe only one day a year.\u201d\n\nThough he left the craft of building the high-flying toys in Iraq, Ridha said he hopes his son develops a love for flying kites. Some of his favorite memories are times he spent staring up at the sky.\n\n\u201cI remember one time at night, and I attached my kite to my bed on the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to sleep, and when I woke up, it was still flying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arvada Kite Festival attracts about 15,000 people", "title": "Arvada Kite Festival attracts about 15,000 people", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/03/arvada-kite-festival-attracts-about-15000-people/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160403__cd04KITEFESTIVAL_HHR3953Bp1.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160403__cd04KITEFESTIVAL_HHR3953Bp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-03T16:40:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:52:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chris Ketter and his 10-year-old daughter Mia attached their kite string to a screwdriver to keep the line taut.\nThen I could reel it in.\u201dBut for Ridha, flying kites was more than a childhood pastime.\nOn Sunday, he watched proudly as his 9-year-old son Ali did the same thing at the Arvada Kite Festival.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of myself at 7 or 8 years old, flying kites on the roof of my house,\u201d he said.\nWhen Ridha\u2019s string intertwined with a Disney princess-themed kite, he deftly unsnarled the tangle using some of the skills he picked up in Iraq."}
