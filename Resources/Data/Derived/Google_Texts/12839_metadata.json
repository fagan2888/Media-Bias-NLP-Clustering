She may need it. Astonishingly, her \u201cfavorability\u201d ratings as tracked by CNN are worse today than they have ever been \u2013 worse than at any time in 2008 when she last ran for office. To counter her plunge in the polls, Clinton is counting on raising obscene amounts of money. How? By crafting a platform pleasing to billionaires.\n\nHillary Clinton has come out with few policy pronouncements in her carefully constructed micro-campaign. She hasn\u2019t leaked her views on the Trans Pacific Trade Partnership, despite pressure from progressives like Elizabeth Warren opposed to the broad trade pact, and she\u2019s mum on the Iran nuke deal. She isn\u2019t talking about NSA snooping \u2013 in fact, she isn\u2019t talking much at all, to the annoyance of the press corps.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Vows to Overturn the Law that\u2019s Raising Big Bucks for Her Campaign\n\nSo, it was refreshing when she recently made a stirring speech at Texas Southern University on the subject of voter rights. In it, she called for automatic registration of all people turning 18 years of age, and suggested that criminals should be able to win back their voting rights, championing \u201cthe father who\u2019s done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn\u2019t gotten his rights back.\u201d She attacked Republicans for supposedly working to \u201cdisempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people and young people\u201d \u2013 that is, the central building blocks of the coalition that twice elected president Obama.\n\nAs so often with the Clintons, it\u2019s all about the money. Her speech was not only geared to attract blacks, Hispanics and the young. It was also an appeal to billionaire George Soros, who is spending millions to overturn voting laws he considers restrictive. Mr. Soros, according to The New York Times, has not yet jumped aboard the Clinton campaign. But, the lawyer leading his legal assault is also working with the Clinton campaign. That seems convenient and helpful to the former Secretary of State. If she can just pull the right levers, like signaling her intense concern for voter rights, it is expected that Mr. Soros will soon throw his weight and his millions behind Priorities USA, the Clinton Super PAC -- even as she continues to pound billionaires, Wall Street and Big Money in politics.\n\nWhy does Mrs. Clinton need Mr. Soros? Because despite a full-court press from long-time Clinton operative Harold M. Ickes, according to some reports, Democrat big wigs are not ponying up. Priorities USA has only raised about $15 million, to the disappointment of those concerned about sizeable commitments which have flowed to GOP campaigns. Notable Democrat donors like Fred Eychaner, Tom Steyer, and Jeffrey Katzenberg have so far failed to fund the Super Pac, and the Clinton team is anxious. Part of the problem could be that some donors have made sizeable contributors to the Clinton Foundation; Mr. Eychaner, for instance, has given more than $25 million to the \u201cnon-profit.\u201d They may feel they\u2019ve done their bit.\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2019s Fuzzy Position on Immigration Worries Activists\n\nHence, the push to woo Mr. Soros, and the \u201cfollow the money\u201d rationale for Hillary\u2019s new-found outrage over voter IDs. Fighting what he considers voter suppression is an important quest for Mr. Soros, but isn\u2019t the top concern for most Americans. In fact, in a recent Gallup poll, respondents listed \u201cElections/election reform\u201d as our 17th most pressing \u201cnon-economic\u201d problem, right ahead of \u2018unifying the country.\u201d Keep in mind -- that includes people worried about voter fraud, as well as voter suppression.\n\nWhere else will Hillary\u2019s quest for billionaire donors lead her? For sure, she will come out swinging on gender rights \u2013 and especially endorsing the LGBT agenda. Why? Because that\u2019s where Mr. Eychaner would like her to go. Eychaner, who made a fortune in the broadcasting industry, is a reclusive figure \u2013 rarely photographed or interviewed. Nonetheless, he is a formidable donor to progressive causes, and especially those involving gay rights.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, he was the largest Democrat funder to liberal SuperPacs, giving a total of $14.1 million. He has given massively to AIDS programs and for gay rights advocacy. He backed Hillary in 2008, because he thought \u201cClinton would be stronger on LGBT issues,\u201d according to an interview in National Journal. My guess? She\u2019ll aim to please.\n\nRelated: 14 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Hillary Clinton\n\nThen there\u2019s the environment. For more than a year, green advocates have fumed about Hillary\u2019s ambivalence on the Keystone XL Pipeline. Mrs. Clinton walked a tightrope while at the State Department, refusing to endorse the controversial project to bring tar sands oil to the U.S., but also not campaigning against its construction. Recently, she cozied up to billionaire Tom Steyer and to Susie Tompkins Buell, an old friend and co-founder of the Esprit clothing company, both of whom hosted gatherings for the former first lady, and both of whom are confirmed enemies of the pipeline.\n\nWhy has Hillary not thrown in with environmentalists who oppose Keystone? Maybe because supporters of the pipeline have been big donors to the Clinton Foundation. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the Clinton\u2019s Foundation had received between $250,000 and $500,000 from Canada's Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Development department, which has pushed for approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Other donors in that category included Anadarko Petroleum and ExxonMobil, whose CEOs both signed a letter addressed to President Obama advocating for Keystone XL.\n\nTo date, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign themes, like voter rights, seem especially tailored to her fundraising effort. There\u2019s not much money in challenging the NSA or the TPP; there probably will be a payday for opposing the Keystone Pipeline. The New York Times recently reported on her tactics of rifle-shot electioneering\u2014targeting the groups that elected Obama in two elections. They failed to mention the even more calculated selection of issues.\n\nNote to Mrs. Clinton: requiring voter IDs is not our biggest problem. Cynicism and corruption in politics looms much larger. My guess\u2014you won\u2019t be tackling that one.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton is going all-out for the criminal vote.
