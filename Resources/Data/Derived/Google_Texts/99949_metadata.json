Ann Rivers, R-La Center and Rep. Brandon Vick, R-Felida.\n\nAbout 60 people gathered in the Camas Public Library meeting room for one of two community events organized by the legislators. The purpose of the meetings was to discuss issues with the education budget and recent teacher walk-outs.\n\nSome tempers flared while others shed tears as they talked about their classroom experiences. Most people voiced frustration over standardized testing, overflowing class sizes, dwindling budgets and increasing health care costs.\n\nTensions seem to have reached a boiling point this spring, stemming from the Legislature\u2019s failure to fully fund K-12 education. A 2012 mandate from the Washington Supreme Court, known as the McCleary decision, says the state must do so by the 2018-19 school year. Additionally, there is demand to reduce class sizes after voters passed Initiative 1351 in November. Teachers say they are further frustrated by the fact that they haven\u2019t received a cost-of-living increase since the recession.\n\nOn May 13, some 2,500 teachers from the Evergreen, Camas, Washougal and Hockinson school districts picketed around the county to draw attention to these issues. Classes were canceled for the day for about 38,000 students, and the day will be made up at the end of the school year.\n\nBoth Rivers and Vick said they understand why teachers walked out but said it\u2019s not something they would have done in their place. They added that they have both received hundreds of emails containing \u201cbad information\u201d about progress being made on the education budget.\n\nRivers said part of the problem is that no one can agree upon what fully funding basic education looks like. \u201cIt changes each week,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she hoped Saturday\u2019s meetings would help clear up any confusion and create a healthy dialogue between the legislators and their constituents. Both legislators said they had no choice but to hold the meetings during a holiday weekend. The alternative would have been to hold them after voting on the funding plan next Saturday, Rivers said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been disingenuous to do it after the fact,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not here to change minds, we\u2019re here to listen.\u201d\n\nStill, many people in attendance said they felt they were not being heard, calling out to the legislators to let them speak.\n\nGail Anderson, a special education teacher with the Evergreen School District, told Rivers she\u2019s not necessarily angry over the low pay. \u201cI\u2019m angry that it took contempt of court for us to be heard,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she appreciates that Rivers was once a teacher but said she couldn\u2019t fully understand today\u2019s struggles unless she\u2019s been in a classroom the last 24 months. Many teachers act as social services for students who struggle with problems outside the classroom, like finding a place to sleep or food, Anderson said.\n\nOthers agreed, saying they didn\u2019t become a teacher for the money; they\u2019re in it for the children and the chance to be a positive influence in their lives.\n\n\u201cI need a class size that I can connect with,\u201d one teacher, Laurie Burpee, said.\n\nVick said lawmakers are already proposing to reduce class sizes for K-3. \u201cWe have X amount of money. I think this is a good start,\u201d he said.\n\nAudience members agreed it was a start but not enough.\n\nJennifer Ireland, a special education teacher with the Camas School District, told the legislators she needs a cost-of-living increase.\n\n\u201cWhen I have to stop putting money in my own child\u2019s college savings account to put gas in my car, I don\u2019t get paid enough,\u201d Ireland said. \u201cMy sister has less education and makes three times more than I do and works less hours. I could go to the private sector and make a lot more, but \u2026 I\u2019ve been a teacher since I was born. I\u2019m a second generation teacher. That\u2019s where my heart is.\u201d\n\nOver the last two years, however, Ireland has seriously considered switching careers, she said.\n\nIreland said she also takes issue with standardized testing, which she calls \u201cgarbage.\u201d She loses about six weeks of teaching time to the tests, and they are not user-friendly, she said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Ireland said she hopes the legislators \u201cheard our voices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping they take this seriously. If not, the next step is a walk out in September. I really don\u2019t want it to come to that,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "CAMAS -- Emotions ran high Saturday as local educators shared some of their struggles and concerns for their students during a town hall meeting with Sen.", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "CAMAS -- Emotions ran high Saturday as local educators shared some of their struggles and concerns for their students during a town hall meeting with Sen.
