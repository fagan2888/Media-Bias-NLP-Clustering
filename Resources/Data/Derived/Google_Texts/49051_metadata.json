Smith said Route 66 is an emergency evacuation route for tens of thousands of Shore area residents.\n\n\u201cDuring storms\u2014when the need for expeditious evacuation is paramount, the traffic moves at an alarmingly slow pace,\u201d Smith said.\n\nMORE: ROAD SAGE: A love letter to Route 18, a true freeway\n\nNeptune Committeeman Michael Brantley, formerly the mayor, has lobbied for the expansion of Route 66\u2013 a project he says has been discussed and stalled for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cFor over a decade, the Neptune Township Committee has been working aggressively with the state and county agencies to try to alleviate the backups and bottlenecks on Route 66,\u201d Brantley said in a statement. \u201cIf we can get this done, it would improve travel for a lot of motorists in this part of the county.\u201d\n\nState and local officials plan to hold a meeting in Neptune in November to provide additional information on the project.\n\nNicquel Terry; nterry@gannettnj.com; 732-643-4023\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
