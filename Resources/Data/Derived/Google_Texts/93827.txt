*Traci Braxton, a Republican?

Not quite, she was just checking out a GOP outreach event.

To celebrate Black History Month and attract black voters, the Republican Party held the event at the historical Howard Theatre in D.C.

Roland Martin spoke with former Florida Congressman Allen West about GOP outreach to black voters.

“I’ve always hated the word ‘outreach’,” West said. “This is about policy inclusiveness. This is about reestablishing a bond and a connection and that’s why an event like this is so important but we just can’t have it in Black History Month. We need to continue to have it every single month.”

West believes black voters can be attracted through the power of Booker T. Washington, education, entrepreneurship and self-reliance.

As for Braxton, she said she wanted to learn more about the party’s efforts.

“I’m out here to make sure I know what I’m talking about politically,” Braxton joked. She added, “Just because they’re Republican doesn’t mean they’re all bad. They also have some legit reasons for why this country is the way it is.”
