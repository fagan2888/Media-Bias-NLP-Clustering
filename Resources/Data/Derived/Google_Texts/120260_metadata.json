Carlin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to evolve our efforts and capabilities to confront cyber enabled threats and aggressively detect, disrupt and deter them.\u201d\n\nIf true, the charges against Eccleston point to an unusual case that combines both an insider cyber threat and the risks associated with targeted malware campaigns against the government.\n\nHis tool of choice \u2014 spear-phishing \u2014 involves disguising a malicious email to look safe to its recipient, who inadvertently infects his or her computer with malware by clicking on a dangerous link or file attachment.\n\nEccleston was fired from his job at the NRC in 2010, and moved to Davos City in the Philippines the following year. The reasons for his termination are unclear.\n\nAccording to an affidavit, Eccleston came to the attention of law enforcement when he entered a foreign embassy and offered to provide the country with classified U.S. government information.\n\nThe FBI responded by launching a sting operation in which Eccleston met with undercover agents posing as officials from the foreign country.\n\nHe offered to design and send emails that would extract information from government computers, and went on to send them to 80 Department of Energy machines in January 2015, the affidavit said. The FBI ensured that no malicious code was actually sent to government machines.\n\nEccleston was detained by Philippine authorities on March 27, and underwent his first court appearance on Friday at the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia.\n\n\u201cComputer intrusions are among the greatest cyber threats to our national security,\u201d said assistant director in charge Andrew G. McCabe of the FBI\u2019s Washington field office.\n\n\n\n\u201cCyber actors have become increasingly adept at exploiting our computer networks in order to exfiltrate our nation\u2019s secrets and valuable research. As threats to the U.S. government become increasingly complex, the FBI will continue to evolve in order to counter these threats.\u201d\n\n\n\nEccleston will remain detained until a hearing scheduled for May 20, according to the Justice Department.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The defendant allegedly sought to sell nuclear weapons information to a foreign government.", "description": "The defendant allegedly sought to sell nuclear weapons information to a foreign government.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The defendant allegedly sought to sell nuclear weapons information to a foreign government.", "title": "Ex-DOE worker charged with trying to steal, sell nuclear data", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/241484-former-doe-worker-charged-with-attempted-cyberattack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/nuclearfield05082015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/241484-former-doe-worker-charged-with-attempted-cyberattack", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-08T15:37-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elise Viebeck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Energy", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-08T15:37:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/241484-former-doe-worker-charged-with-attempted-cyberattack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The defendant allegedly sought to sell nuclear weapons information to a foreign government.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ex-DOE worker charged with trying to steal, sell nuclear data"}, "dcterms.title": "Ex-DOE worker charged with trying to steal, sell nuclear data"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTHis plans were thwarted by an FBI sting operation, and he now faces four felony charges, authorities say, including wire fraud.\nCharles Harvey Eccleston, 62, planned to sell the information to an undisclosed foreign government, according to charges unsealed Friday by the Justice Department.\n\u201cComputer intrusions are among the greatest cyber threats to our national security,\u201d said assistant director in charge Andrew G.
