Officials said the error will result in some paying more taxes and others paying less.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another black mark on the administration\u2019s handling of the health care act,\u201d Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, told the Associated Press. \u201cThey were hoping for a clean season.\u201d\n\nAndrew M. Slavitt, the deputy administrator at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said officials did not know why the mistake had occurred, according to The New York Times.\n\nAbout 50,000 of those who received the erroneous forms are estimated to have already filed their 2014 taxes. Taxpayers can sign onto their accounts at Healthcare.gov or call 800-318-2596 to find out if they\u2019re among those who got incorrect forms.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first instance of tax forms being incorrect because of the healthcare law. About 100,000 Californians have received similarly erroneous tax forms from Covered California, that state\u2019s healthcare exchange.\n\nThe Obama administration also announced that there would be a special enrollment period for those taxpayers who were unaware of the penalty for not having health coverage or an exemption from carrying it. The period will run from March 15 to April 30. Some of the state exchanges are also extending their enrollment periods.\n\n-Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nNew Woes for Healthcare.gov: Wrong Tax Info Sent Out (by Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Associated Press)\n\nTax Error in Health Act Has Impact on 800,000 (by Robert Pear, New York Times)\n\nFeds Sent Incorrect Tax Information to 800,000 People on ObamaCare (by Peter Sullivan and Sarah Ferris, The Hill)\n\nIs your Form 1095-A correct?
