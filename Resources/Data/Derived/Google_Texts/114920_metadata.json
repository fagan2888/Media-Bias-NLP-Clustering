Bobby Jindal accepted $60 million in federal funds provided under Obamacare while working to scrap the law.\n\nBut the Jindal administration said the dollars coming to the state had nothing to do with the health insurance exchanges or expansion of Medicaid \u2013 the guts of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nInstead, the funding is largely related to federal grants Louisiana had previously been receiving for programs that were swept into Obamacare, said state Department of Health and Hospitals chief of staff Frank Opelka Jr.\n\n\u201cWe exam these grants \u2018Is it good for the state? Is it not good for the state?'\u201d said Opelka. \u201cIt just so happens these were the grants in ACA that fit that model.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters\u2019 story said Jindal and three other Republican governors eying presidential bids \u2013 Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2013 secured at least $352 million under Obamacare for their states while opposing the law.\n\nOf Louisiana\u2019s funds, some $50 million is related to a nurse family partnership multi-year grant program that has been in place since 1999, Opelka said. Nurses go to the homes of pregnant women and those with young children, he said.\n\nOther funding cited in the Reuter\u2019s report included $1.25 million for a medical school student loan repayment program which rewards physicians who opt to practice in rural settings and five or six public health grants for such things as HIV-AIDS treatment, tobacco cessation and epidemeology, Opelka said.\n\nOpelka said the state initially accepted about a $1 million grant to establish a state-based health insurance exchange allowed under Obamacare. \u201cIt\u2019s something we looked a doing but quicky realized it was not cost-effective and gave the money back,\u201d he said. The money was returned in March 2011.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Louisiana Politics", "description": "Reuters news agency\u00a0reported\u00a0Wednesday that\u00a0Gov.
