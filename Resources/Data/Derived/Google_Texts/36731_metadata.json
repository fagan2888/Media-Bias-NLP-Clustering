We're working on how to do the methodology well, to make sure their questions are answered correctly.\u201d\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree in mathematics, Stanford University, 1983; master's degrees in operations research from Stanford and statistics from the London School of Economics, 1984; Ph.D. in statistics, Stanford, 1990\n\nBackground: Morton joined the University of Pittsburgh in 2005. Previously, she did private-sector work in biostatistics and public policy.\n\nNoteworthy: The Government Accountability Office appointed Morton, chair of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, to the methodology committee of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. The institute was established through the Affordable Care Act to research the most effective methods of treating conditions and make recommendations; the 17-member methodology committee will be responsible for making sure the institute's research and testing methods are sound.\n\nTribLive commenting policy\n\nYou are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.\n\nWe moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.\n\nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.\n\nWe value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either by the same reader or different readers.\n\nWe follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.\n\nWe do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.\n\nWe welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.\n\nWe appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matthew Santoni", "description": "Noteworthy: The Government Accountability Office appointed Morton, chair of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, to the methodology committee ...", "pubdate": "2014-09-22 23:21:00", "author": "Matthew Santoni", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "Noteworthy: The Government Accountability Office appointed Morton, chair of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, to the methodology committee ...", "title": "Newsmaker: Sally Morton", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=wwmW4lxXMvmbsCPsGP$46M$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvJzytDBjDrpE7Ijv95QjBQWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-09-25 19:35:31.563", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/6791678-74/methodology-research-institute", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Noteworthy: The Government Accountability Office appointed Morton, chair of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, to the methodology committee ...", "title": "Newsmaker: Sally Morton", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "creator": "@triblive", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=wwmW4lxXMvmbsCPsGP$46M$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvJzytDBjDrpE7Ijv95QjBQWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-22 23:21:00", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/6791678-74/methodology-research-institute", "sailthru.title": "Newsmaker: Sally Morton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Pittsburgh Allegheny", "headline": "Newsmaker: Sally Morton", "keywords": "biostatistics, committee, institute, methodology, methods", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2014-09-22 23:21:00", "subcategory": "Allegheny", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2014-09-22 23:21:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-25 19:35:31.563", "tag": "biostatistics, committee, institute, methodology, methods", "subsection": "Allegheny", "title": "Newsmaker: Sally Morton", "author": "Matthew Santoni"}, "docauthor": "Matthew Santoni", "sailthru.description": "Noteworthy: The Government Accountability Office appointed Morton, chair of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, to the methodology committee ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfb0\"", "article_summary": "Noteworthy: The Government Accountability Office appointed Morton, chair of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, to the methodology committee of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.\nTo avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction.\nTribLive commenting policyYou are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.\nWe make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either by the same reader or different readers.\nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective."}
