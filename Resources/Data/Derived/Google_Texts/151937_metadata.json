Another member is the brother of Walter Scott, the Black motorist who was shot in the back by a North Charleston policeman April 4.\n\nAfter Scott was murdered, the local participated in protest rallies and sponsored community meetings at its hall. With the Black Lives Matter movement and other organizations, it formed a new coalition in North Charleston, the Civil Coalition for Reform, which is pressing for a citizens review board to check the police.\n\nA POWERFUL SYMBOL\n\nLocal 1422 is not new to challenging racism. Its members, who load and unload ships at the Port of Charleston, are 99.8 percent Black. In 2000, the local was a prime mover of the effort to take down the Confederate flag from South Carolina\u2019s Capitol building.\n\nThe movement included an NAACP-led economic boycott of the state and the cancellation of many sports events and conventions. Local 1422 hired buses and organized members to walk the 120-mile march route from Charleston to the state capital, Columbia.\n\nThe boycott ended after a compromise moved the flag to a somewhat less prominent spot on the Statehouse grounds. But in the wake of the Emanuel shootings, even South Carolina\u2019s Republican governor finally said the flag had to go.\n\nKerry Taylor is a college history professor in Charleston and one of the organizers of the Days of Grace. When he heard that politicians were jumping to remove the flag, he said, \u201cmy initial response was, \u2018I\u2019m looking for something more substantive, something material.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut this has been a key demand of the Black civil rights community in South Carolina for many, many years. To be on hand for the removal of the flag, that was powerful.\u201d Local 1422 rented a bus so Charlestonians could witness the taking down July 10.\n\nIt was shortly afterward that Riley initiated the idea that became the Days of Grace. The whole purpose is not to stop at symbols. \u201cSome might be placated,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cbut my hope is that it\u2019s emboldening. Something from which we\u2019re able to build momentum.\u201d\n\nPINCKNEY\u2019S LEGACY\n\nThe march and conference are organized around the legacy of minister and State Senator Clementa Pinckney, who was killed at Emanuel, with the goal of winning legislation he had sponsored and causes he espoused.\n\nThese include an end to discriminatory policing and gun violence, $15 an hour and collective bargaining rights for all workers, expanded voting rights, Medicaid expansion, quality education, and \u201caccuracy in our historical commemorations.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina is one of the states whose governors have refused the expansion of Medicaid that is part of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cPeople are dying because they don\u2019t have coverage,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe governor gave in on the flag, but not on that.\u201d\n\nTaylor said the organizing committee expects the march and conference to draw participants from outside South Carolina, including from the Southern Workers Assembly, Black Workers for Justice, and Fight for $15 networks. They are expecting groups of fast food workers from North Carolina and Georgia, \u201cmaybe as far as Richmond.\u201d\n\nRev. Thomas Dixon, president of the Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment, stresses that the organizing team is seeking multiracial attendance. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to lots of white allies,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, he can\u2019t agree with those who\u2019ve said the U.S. is in a \u201cpost-racial era.\u201d Racism is alive and well, he says\u2014and when people stopped talking about it, \u201cit continued to fester till it exploded in a Dylann Roof [the Charleston shooter] and in our law enforcement and judicial systems.\u201d\n\nLABOR\u2019S ROLE\n\nRiley said he\u2019d angered some people when he objected to simply organizing shows of sympathy and commemoration. \u201cIf you love, let\u2019s change the policies,\u201d he said. For the Days of Grace conference, \u201cthe most important thing is to extract strategies.\n\n\u201cLabor has a unique responsibility to answer this kind of social injustice because we can mobilize people,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe have to come out of our comfortable place and do this work.\u201d\n\nDixon, too, is looking for results. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep wringing our hands talking about peace and love,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have a kumbaya moment again\u2014we need a kumbaya millennium.\u201d\n\nContact the Days of Grace organizing group at www.daysofgracecharleston.org, info[at]daysofgracecharleston[dot]org, or 864-513-3450.
