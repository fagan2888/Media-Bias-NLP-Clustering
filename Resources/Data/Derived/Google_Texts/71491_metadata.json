The extra cash is critical because the VA project is set to hit its spending cap next week \u2014 which would stop work at the site.\n\nCongressional sources said the $20 million would be enough to continue work at the Aurora site for about three weeks. That gives lawmakers and the administration a little breathing room to hash out a long-term funding deal.\n\nThe two sides have been deadlocked for weeks on how to pay for cost overruns at the hospital campus. The VA has said it needs $830 million to finish it.\n\nThe bill\u2019s rapid-fire passage in the House comes less than 24 hours after congressional leaders predicted the Aurora project was at risk of shutting down.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner ripped into the agency in a floor speech \u2014 a move Colorado lawmakers saw as a potential deal-killer for the hospital.\n\nHis rhetoric had faded some by Thursday morning, however, and Boehner issued a statement late in the day that talked about giving the VA a \u201cchance to get its act together.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince VA leaders are clearly not willing to step up, the House is stepping in and allowing the project to go forward in the short-term using resources the VA already has,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cNow the VA must lay out a long-term plan for completing the hospital responsibly using existing resources. This is more than fair.\u201d\n\nFor days, members of Colorado\u2019s congressional delegation said the biggest hurdle to getting a short-term deal was opposition among House leadership.\n\nHow exactly the delegation got Boehner to go from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes\u201d is unclear, although lawmakers and staffers described an all-out effort from local lawmakers.\n\nU.S. Sen. Cory Gardner \u2014 a former House member \u2014 walked over to the lower chamber Wednesday night to personally lobby the Republican leadership team.\n\nMeanwhile, his Democratic counterpart, Michael Bennet, reached out to the White House, and U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Aurora, made a final pitch to Boehner\u2019s staff Thursday morning.\n\nIncluded in that pitch was a letter penned by Kiewit-Turner that warned of the potential cost of a work stoppage. Company executives wrote that a shutdown could add as much as $200 million to the $1.73 billion price tag and push its opening \u201cwell into 2018.\u201d\n\nKiewit-Turner estimated it would cost $50 million to $75 million to demobilize and remobilize the site in case of a shutdown. Worse, they wrote, would be the potential loss of subcontractors \u2014 an expense that could run as high as $125 million.\n\n\u201cConsidering the strength of the current construction market in Denver, if another shutdown occurs, we believe many subcontractors may terminate their subcontracts and instead pursue other projects,\u201d noted Scott Cassels, president of Kiewit Infrastructure Group, and Peter J. Davoren, president and CEO of Turner Construction Co.\n\nWork at the site was suspended in December because of a rift between the VA and Kiewit-Turner.\n\nBut even if the Senate agrees to the short-term measure, it doesn\u2019t mean the drama is over.\n\nAs soon as Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess, the clock will start ticking again on the need to find a way to fund the Aurora project to its completion.\n\nConsidering the entrenched positions of the VA and Congress \u2014 and the often-heated attacks between the sides \u2014 there remains the possibility of another short-term punt.\n\nSpeaking to that point, U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Golden, said he was happy Congress was working to avoid a shutdown, but that he was generally irked at the whole situation.\n\n\u201cI am not pleased it is only a two- to three-week window and that we are only kicking the can down the road at the expense of veterans and construction workers out there,\u201d he said.\n\nMark K.
