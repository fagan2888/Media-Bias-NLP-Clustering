Notre Dame contends that the law forces it to violate Catholic doctrine, which bars most forms of birth control, by becoming conduits to purchasing contraceptives.\n\nThe three-judge panel didn\u2019t rule on the merits of the case; it only refused to allow the university to opt out of the provision as its lawsuit makes its way through the courts. Judge David Hamilton noted that granting the school\u2019s requested preliminary injunction would \u201ctemporarily cut off contraceptive coverage for hundreds or thousands of women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat this case needs now is a trial on the merits where the relevant factual issues can be explored in depth,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJudge Richard Posner also opposed the injunction, writing: \u201cAlthough Notre Dame is the final arbiter of its religious beliefs, it is for the courts to determine whether the law actually forces Notre Dame to act in a way that would violate those beliefs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his dissent, Judge Joel Flaum wrote that the law forces the school to \u201cact in ways it says violate its religious beliefs.\u201d He also said the \u201cgovernment has the burden of demonstrating that the challenged accommodation is the least restrictive means of serving a compelling interest.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame spokesman Paul Browne said Wednesday that the university was reviewing the 50-page opinion and \u201cweighing our options.\u201d The university self-insures its employees, but the school uses Meritain Health Inc. to administer the plan and Aetna Inc. to provide health insurance to students and staff.\n\nNotre Dame is among more than a dozen schools and religious nonprofits that have challenged the government\u2019s accommodation provision that allows the groups to shift payment of contraceptives elsewhere.\n\nThe university contends that even if it doesn\u2019t have to pay the cost for the health insurance provider covering the costs of the contraceptives, the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the school by forcing it to \u201cidentify and contract with a third party willing to provide the very services Notre Dame deems objectionable.\u201d\n\nThe 7th Circuit previously rejected Notre Dame\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction in February 2014. The US Supreme Court ordered the appeals court to reconsider the case in March, after the high court ruled that arts-and-crafts giant Hobby Lobby and other corporations could hold religious objections that allow them to opt out of the contraceptives requirement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/05/21/court-tells-notre-dame-it-has-to-cover-birth-control/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Birth-control-pills.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Another volley has been fired in the contraception wars as a federal appeals court has told the University of Notre Dame it must cover the cost of birth control for its students and staff.", "title": "Court tells Notre Dame it has to cover birth control"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd186a\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Another volley has been fired in the contraception wars as a federal appeals court has told the University of Notre Dame it must cover the cost of birth control for its students and staff.\nNotre Dame contends that the law forces it to violate Catholic doctrine, which bars most forms of birth control, by becoming conduits to purchasing contraceptives.\nNotre Dame is among more than a dozen schools and religious nonprofits that have challenged the government\u2019s accommodation provision that allows the groups to shift payment of contraceptives elsewhere.\nThe court rejected the school\u2019s request to temporarily be exempt from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires the Catholic school\u2019s insurance providers to cover the costs of contraceptives.\nCircuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that an exemption provided by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration allows Notre Dame to avoid directly paying for contraceptives, and therefore doesn\u2019t force the school to violate its religious beliefs."}
