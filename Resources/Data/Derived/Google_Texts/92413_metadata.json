Trump, who still leads most polls in the race for the GOP Presidential nomination, released his plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s tax system on Monday and came under fire from analysts across the ideological spectrum for the proposal, which would gut federal revenue and deliver a massive windfall to the wealthy while adding more than $11.98 trillion to the federal debt over the coming decade.\n\nHowever, the Tax Foundation pointed out in an analysis Tuesday that the $11.98 trillion figure is based on a \u201cstatic\u201d rather than a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis of the effect of Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nRelated: Trump Vows Lower Tax Rates, Revised Trade Agreements, Deep Spending Cuts\n\nThe difference is that a dynamic analysis of the proposal reflects the best estimates economists can make about the macroeconomic effects of dramatically lower taxes \u2013 things like increased consumer spending and investment. When the Tax Foundation ran a dynamic analysis, its researchers determined that the $11.98 trillion estimate was incorrect.\n\n\u201cOur analysis finds that the plan would reduce federal revenues by $11.98 trillion over the next decade,\u201d wrote the Tax Foundation\u2019s Alan Cole. \u201cHowever, it also would improve incentives to work and invest, which could increase gross domestic product (GDP) by 11 percent over the long term. This increase in GDP would translate into 6.5 percent higher wages and 5.3 million new full-time equivalent jobs. After accounting for increased incomes due to these factors, the plan would only reduce tax revenues by $10.14 trillion.\u201d\n\nBut it would also, by dramatically increasing the country\u2019s indebtedness, drive up the interest rate the government is forced to pay to borrow money, which would in turn likely make that figure even higher.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s tax plan would enact a number of tax reforms that would both lower marginal tax rates on workers and significantly reduce the cost of capital,\u201d Cole wrote. \u201cThese changes in the incentives to work and invest would greatly increase the U.S. economy\u2019s size in the long run, leading to higher incomes for taxpayers at all income levels.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump, Obama and Bush Agree \u2013 Close the Carried Interest Tax Loophole\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to get past the massive increase in the deficit that the Trump plan would create. Asked how his plan would close the gap, Trump on Monday said that a key element of his plan would be to do away with the carried interest loophole in the tax code, which allows investment managers to pay taxes on their fees as though they are capital gains.\n\nExperts say closing the carried interest loophole would save something on the order of $18 billion over ten years \u2013 or about 0.2 percent of the figure Trump\u2019s proposal would add to the deficit.\n\nAnd that\u2019s assuming that the Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis is correct. On Tuesday afternoon, Len Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, tweeted that he\u2019s not sure that the effect on economic growth of the Trump plan would be positive at all.\n\nI think @taxfoundation got the sign of macro effect wrong. #Trump plan's debt would be big drag on the economy. \u2014 Len Burman (@lenburman) September 29, 2015\n\nBut if nothing else, Trump should get credit for putting numbers on paper and letting experts debate them. Not all the candidates in the race for the GOP nominations have done as much.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Even analyzed in the way most likely to help it look good, the tax plan put forward by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on Monday would result in a massive increase to the federal deficit.", "title": "Even Conservatives Admit Trump's Tax Plan Would Add Trillions to the Deficit", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/29/Even-Conservatives-Admit-Trumps-Tax-Plan-Would-Add-Trillions-Deficit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07012015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/29/Even-Conservatives-Admit-Trumps-Tax-Plan-Would-Add-Trillions-Deficit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07012015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Even analyzed in the way most likely to help it look good, the tax plan put forward by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on Monday would result in a massive increase to the federal deficit.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s tax plan would enact a number of tax reforms that would both lower marginal tax rates on workers and significantly reduce the cost of capital,\u201d Cole wrote.\nHowever, the Tax Foundation pointed out in an analysis Tuesday that the $11.98 trillion figure is based on a \u201cstatic\u201d rather than a \u201cdynamic\u201d analysis of the effect of Trump\u2019s plan.\n\u201cOur analysis finds that the plan would reduce federal revenues by $11.98 trillion over the next decade,\u201d wrote the Tax Foundation\u2019s Alan Cole.\nWhen the Tax Foundation ran a dynamic analysis, its researchers determined that the $11.98 trillion estimate was incorrect.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Len Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, tweeted that he\u2019s not sure that the effect on economic growth of the Trump plan would be positive at all."}
