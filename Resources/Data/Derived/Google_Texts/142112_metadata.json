I was also a part of a group that went to the state water board meeting in Sacramento to testify on the Salton Sea.\n\nCommunity concern is there and community support for action is there. What we need now is dust protections before habitat creations. We can\u2019t wait any longer. The cost of letting the sea dry up \u2013 as measured by an increase in the number of deaths by respiratory illnesses from the exposed deadly toxins in the playa \u2013 far outweighs the monetary cost that would save the sea and the surrounding frontline communities of color.\n\nWe need Gov. Jerry Brown and the state of California to invest a lot more time and resources into the Salton Sea. We can\u2019t afford to wait; lives are at stake.\n\nRuben Garza, Mecca\n\nWhat about new development?\n\nThere was a glaring omission in your May 1 Our Voice opinion, \u201cOfficials must maintain smarter water policies.\u201d There was no mention of growth in the Coachella Valley.\n\nHow can any water agency reduce its water consumption mandated by the state based on 2013\u2019s water usage? If I used, on average, 10,000 gallons a month in 2013 and I use 6,800 gallons a month now, that\u2019s a 32 percent reduction (per your rate for DWA) in my water usage. That\u2019s fine. However, if one new house is built between 2013 and now and that house uses 6,800 gallons a month on average (like me) that would mean my water agency is now supplying 13,600 gallons (my 6,800 gallons and the new house\u2019s 6,800 gallons) versus the 10,000 gallons I used by myself in 2013.\n\nI believe the unspoken truth is no one wants to address development at all. It\u2019s like if we don\u2019t have growth (even smart growth) then the whole valley will just dry up and no one will want to come here anymore.\n\nJust how big do we want to grow here in the Coachella Valley?\n\nRonald E. Zimmerman, Palm Springs\n\nWhat about the drought?\n\nI am having a hard time understanding why we are asked to cut back on our water, yet we can start hosting new mega concerts. Are these people not going to use water?\n\nI have the same question about new housing in the Coachella Valley.\n\nCome on, people, let\u2019s wise up. How about a moratorium on building and concerts until we get our water under control. Or is this water shortage a farce?\n\nKathy Guttormsen, Palm Desert\n\nGot to give it to Trump\n\nThe Trojan Horse made it!\n\nThe Republican party has the virus. Mr. Trump is, as predicted, \u201cThe Trojan Horse!\u201d Like many others, I have become,\u201cA-political,\u201d however, my hat goes off to \u201cthe Donald!\u201d\n\nHe truly is a mastermind at controlling the horizontal and the vertical. He has put the GOP in a tailspin that will take many years to recover from.\n\nRick Raum, Banning\n\nWe must seek inner peace\n\nThere is a change of consciousness in the political world. People are turning away from conventional thinking, ergo Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.\n\nThere needs to be a change in the nation\u2019s thinking. Unfortunately, this change not a sense of higher consciousness, but instead just a flip of the coin.\n\nWe can add Ted Cruz to the extreme change being considered. Then we have Hillary Clinton \u2013 the same old, same old.\n\nWhat is not represented is a change of ego. The candidates come from an egotistical point of view, like most of the human species.\n\nA higher consciousness would entail coming from a place of authenticity, deeper than the old thoughts. It would be the voice of Jesus, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and all the great masters.\n\nAs much as it terrifies us, we are in a nuclear age. Either change happens before a catastrophe or a catastrophe happens to incite a change.\n\nWhether you believe in a higher power or not, it is up to individuals to start with introspection. We need to live in love, not fear. Peace, Shalom, Salaam, Namaste and whatever language suits you. We are all the same.\n\nRita Firestone Seger, Palm Desert\n\nUpdate this freedom\n\nLarry Shapiro\u2019s May 4 Valley Voice, \u201cFreedom of expression dinged on campuses, 2016 campaign trail,\u201d supports the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, and rightly so. He decries mob reactions, and rightly so, he protests racial discrimination, and rightly so, he defends military registration, and rightly so.\n\nHowever, he offers no solution.\n\nIt\u2019s time to consider an amendment or a logical interpretation of that First Amendment. There are too many incidents occurring because of the obsolete interpretation of that amendment.\n\nFlag burning, stomping, spitting, and using the flag in derogatory paintings. Using foul language or political cartoons that are neither witty or humorous in reference to our elected or other well-known individuals, etc.\n\nEither the amendment or a re-interpretation by the Supreme Court is necessary before our so called Freedom of Speech takes us into a world of hatred and horror.\n\nDr. L.J. Friedman, Palm Springs\n\nThere is no debate\n\nThank you, Arthur L. Prosser (\u201cRestroom debate is just propaganda,\u201d May 4 letter to the editor) for explaining so simply why this restroom issue has just now come to surface.\n\nI, too, have asked what bathrooms have the transgenders and sexual predators been using for the past hundred years and why, if the parents are so worried about their young children, don\u2019t they accompany them to the the public bathrooms?\n\nIt all boils down to common sense. Stop creating problems. Let\u2019s focus on the issues that matter.\n\nJoan Helms, Indio\n\nMORE LETTERS: Read all our letters to the editor\n\nCoachella left fine impression\n\nAs a 69-year-old former elementary school educator who attended all three days of Coachella weekend 1, I take issue with the views of Erika Baily in Sunday\u2019s \u201cYour Voice\u201d section. This was my first Coachella experience and at no time did I witness any drunken, sexual behavior that Baily somehow figures is taking place based on observing a few young women in \u201cblatant sexual dress\u201d at the Target store.\n\nAt Coachella I witnessed young people just enjoying themselves. Most were with a group of friends and I found them in every instance to be both friendly and polite. After three full days, I never once saw any drunken or sexual behavior. Yes, there were some in very skimpy dress; but the vast majority were dressed appropriately.\n\nI felt that the festival was extremely well-organized and at no time did I feel uncomfortable because of anyone\u2019s actions. I\u2019m confused as to how an entire festival can be judged by the dress of a few girls in the Target store.\n\nI needed to comment because, in my opinion, Ms. Baily is giving your readers an unfair impression of Coachella.\n\nBarbara K. Wall, La Quinta\n\nDr. Ruiz, practice medicine again\n\nHaving read Dr. Raul Ruiz\u2019s biography, it seems he possibly spent more time getting a medical degree than he did actually practicing medicine. I would think, if he is as interested in helping the people of this valley as much as he talks about in his campaign material that he would go back to practicing medicine full time and let some else who is in the business of politics handle that aspect.\n\nHe voted in support of the Affordable Care Act. However, one of the biggest problems facing the success or failure of this legislation, besides the cost, is the fact there are not enough doctors to deliver the services.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend eight to 10 years in undergraduate school and in post graduate school, which in his case was Harvard Medical School, to be a congressman. So, let\u2019s encourage Dr. Ruiz after taking a highly sought after slot in medical school to put his training to use.\n\nIf, Dr. Ruiz, as your political pitch says \u201cit is my privilege to serve the people of Southern California from the 36th Congressional District\u201d then serve them doing what you have been trained to do.\n\nBarbara Ebel, Bermuda Dunes\n\nMore to this story\n\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room regarding the final pachyderm performance of Ringling Bros.: The immoral lengths to which animal liberation activists will go to attack businesses.\n\nAnimal rights activists alleged that Ringling abused its elephants, but they had their day in court and got trampled. First, they sued Ringling in 2000 for allegedly abusing animals \u2013 and after a decade in court, had their case thrown out after it was found that they secretly paid their key witness, who had lied under oath. Ringling countersued these activists for racketeering, witness bribery, and fraud, and in the end, these groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, paid $25 million to Ringling\u2019s parent company. A law firm representing animal liberation groups was even sanctioned by the court.\n\nEventually, these activists were able to pass enough laws at the local level using misinformation to hamper Ringling from having elephant acts. But just because animal liberation groups claim to hold the moral high ground doesn\u2019t mean they do.\n\nWill Coggin, director of research, Center for Consumer Freedom, Washington, D.C.\n\nBoost Indian Wells\u2019 image\n\nThe proposed closing of the Ralphs store in Indian Wells is a blow to the community. But our Mayor is misdirecting responsibility by claiming the store is closing because of the California minimum wage law.\n\nRather than blaming a carefully considered law that gives California workers the opportunity to earn a decent wage, Mayor Reed should be directing his energy to finding a solution that will prevent its closing. It is a primary responsibility of the Mayor and Council to create an economic environment in Indian Wells that allows vital businesses to succeed.\n\nGinny Whitman, Indian Wells\n\nDon\u2019t blame the workers\n\nSpoken like a true Republican who doesn\u2019t want to see employees earn a decent wage, Indian Wells Mayor Dana Reed is trying to make the closing of Ralphs a wage issue.\n\nHow disgusting.\n\nThe store is underperforming and he blames the wage hike. Mr. \u201cRich Man\u201d should get to work and find his constituents a new grocery store instead of blaming employees who want to better support themselves and their families.\n\nBarbara Wintroub, Palm Desert\n\nBe safe on the roads\n\nMay is National Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month. Typically this is the time of year that riders return to the roads, while here in the Coachella Valley we are blessed with year-round riding opportunities, beautiful weather and scenic roads.\n\nMotorists, please remember to share the road and watch for motorcycles. And riders, please consider refreshing your skills to stay sharp and stay safe!\n\nDave and Allison Woods, So Cal Motorcycle Training, Palm Springs\n\nDon\u2019t see the logic here\n\nI am amazed at the sheer arrogance of politicians in California. While they raise the age for buying cigarettes or vaping devices to 21 due to sincere concern for health, why not also pass a bill that says you can\u2019t kill until you\u2019re 21, as in, no Californian can serve in the military until age 21?\n\nWhat would we do without California Democrats looking after our health?\n\nTom Simmerman, Palm Desert\n\nPalm Springs, think about growth\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with the comments Frank Tysen wrote in his May 5 Valley Voice, \u201cABCD also wants a better downtown.\u201d\n\nThe city of Palm Springs\u2019 development process is broken. No consideration is given to growth\u2019s effect on traffic, occupancy rates, economic sustainability and, most importantly, resident tranquility and enjoyment.\n\nCity meetings (commissions, council, etc.) involve exchanges of opinions, gut comments and emotion rather than fact-based, reasoned exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad affair.\n\nJoe Wild, Palm Springs\n\nThanks, Sue\n\nCongratulations to Sue Rappaport on her retirement after publishing 15 years of great articles in The Desert Sun's Food section.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed them all and it was my go-to page every Wednesday. I loved reading about the people who submitted their recipes. We have some very talented cooks and bakers here in the desert.\n\nAll the best to you, Sue!\n\nEllie Dzuro, Desert Hot Springs\n\nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/1T4nbEr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 8, 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "Desert Sun", "description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 8, 2016.", "title": "Salton Sea just one pressing water-related issue", "url": "http://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/05/07/desert-sun-letters-editor-050816/84030208/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desertsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reader submitted Desert Sun letters to the editor for May 8, 2016.", "title": "Salton Sea just one pressing water-related issue", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af4e590a67dee4c52edc89da2cd934480c796791/c=488-0-2513-2025&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/06/PalmSprings/B9322063562Z.1_20160506144220_000_GEHE9T98I.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@mydesert", "site": "@mydesert", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600074187", "fb": {"app_id": 116853348383382}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Just how big do we want to grow here in the Coachella Valley?\nJerry Brown and the state of California to invest a lot more time and resources into the Salton Sea.\nI have the same question about new housing in the Coachella Valley.\nBuy Photo The Red Hill Bay restoration project at the Salton Sea aims to cover 420 acres of exposed lakebed with wetland habitat.\nI was also a part of a group that went to the state water board meeting in Sacramento to testify on the Salton Sea."}
