With its remodeling of the former Nora B’s in Elm Grove complete, RiverMill Foods opened in its new, larger home late this week.

The restaurant moved from downtown Waukesha to be more centrally located to its catering clients, owner Laurie Runyan said. It's open to the public for sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, breads and cheesecake, and has added breakfast items at its new place, at 890 Elm Grove Road in the Village Court plaza.

Breakfast sandwiches (around $5) such as scrambled egg on English muffin and sweets like poundcake and scones will be sold. RiverMill is offering more wraps, such as chicken-avocado with lime cilantro dressing ($6.75), and will add a side such as potato salad to sandwiches.

The counter-service restaurant seats about 25 in the dining room and 15 or so in a back area for coffeehouse-style lounging, which can be reserved for gatherings. The courtyard seats another 20.

Hours are 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday.

The restaurant’s new number is (262) 787-0900.
