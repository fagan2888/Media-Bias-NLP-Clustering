In mouse models, a single dose was shown to boost significantly the subjects\u2019 cognitive function, allowing them to perform as well as other mice in behavioral tests. The researchers claim that the findings represent an important step towards more effective treatment methods, as well as a better understanding of the condition\u2019s genetic profile.\n\nAccording to Johns Hopkins University professor and lead investigator Roger Reeves, the findings build on previous inquiry into the condition\u2019s chromosomal idiosyncrasies. A signature property of a genome affected with Down syndrome is its chromosome 21 \u201ctrisomy\u201d \u2013 that is, the presence of three copies of chromosome 21 rather than two. Most of the physiognomic and cognitive divergences associated with Down syndrome appear to originate in the 300 genes that the extra chromosome contains.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working for some time to characterize the basis for how people with trisomy 21 diverge in development from people without trisomy 21,\u201d Reeves told FoxNews.com. \u201cOne of the early things we see is that people with Down syndrome have very small cerebellums, which does a lot more things than we used to think it did.\u201d\n\nThe cerebellum, meaning \u201clittle brain,\u201d is involved in a wide variety of complex functions, such as balance, coordination, motor skills, and cognitive functions. Impairment in this area leads to an overall reduction in learning capacity and complex thought.\n\nThe new compound, known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, counteracts this particular genetic divergence by stimulating cerebellum development. This allows the cerebellum to achieve its normal growth rate. In mouse models, this was shown to have significant bearing on the cognitive deficiencies associated with the condition.\n\n\u201cFrom that one injection, we were able to normalize the growth of the cerebellum, and they continued to have a structurally normal cerebellum when they grew up,\u201d Reeves explained.\n\nCarol Boys, chief executive of the Down Syndrome Association, told The Daily Mail that the results are of great interest to the Down syndrome community, but stressed that the new compound should not be considered a \u201ccure.\u201d In addition, the compound has yet to be approved for human use.\n\n\u201cAs Professor Reeves explains, this is not going to translate into clinical applications for people currently living with the condition but is another step along the path of understanding the complexity of an extra chromosome 21 in every single cell,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nThat said, the researchers are confident that the compound will provide new, valuable insight into the condition, and eventually allow scientists to limit cognitive symptoms.\n\nReeves told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of a revolution for expanding the potential of people born with trisomy 21.\u201d Source: I.
