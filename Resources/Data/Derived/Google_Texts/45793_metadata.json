Along with Anthem's PPO ACO, the medical group is participating in Medicare's shared savings ACO program.\n\nThe venture with HealthCare Partners is one of 14 ACOs that Anthem is offering members across California, where it covers almost a quarter of the insured population. Currently, the insurer's ACO program is available to fully-insured PPO members. By fall, it will be offered to self-insured group plans as well, the company said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/private-acos-look-promising", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Medicare's ACOs have had mixed early outcomes, but some commercial accountable care ventures, including PPO plans, are showing promise.", "title": "Private ACOs look promising"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "Medicare's ACOs have had mixed early outcomes, but some commercial accountable care ventures, including PPO plans, are showing promise.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Private ACOs look promising"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While Medicare's ACOs have had mixed early outcomes, some young commercial accountable care ventures, including PPO plans, are showing promise.&#13; An accountable care organization created by WellPoint's Anthem Blue Cross of California and HealthCare Partners, covering 55,000 patients, saved $4.7 million in the first half of 2013.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "While Medicare's ACOs have had mixed early outcomes, some young commercial accountable care ventures, including PPO plans, are showing promise.\nAlong with Anthem's PPO ACO, the medical group is participating in Medicare's shared savings ACO program.\nThe venture with HealthCare Partners is one of 14 ACOs that Anthem is offering members across California, where it covers almost a quarter of the insured population.\nCurrently, the insurer's ACO program is available to fully-insured PPO members.\nAn accountable care organization created by WellPoint's Anthem Blue Cross of California and HealthCare Partners, covering 55,000 patients, saved $4.7 million in the first half of 2013."}
