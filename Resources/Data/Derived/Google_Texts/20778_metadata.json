Another offers doctors and therapists all-expense-paid trips to visit and experience their offerings, including yoga classes.\n\nThe marketing efforts by these for-profit residential care centers are aimed at patients with eating disorders and the clinicians who treat them. The programs have proliferated in recent years, with some companies expanding across the country.\n\nThe rapid growth of the industry \u2014 there are more than 75 centers, compared with 22 a decade ago \u2014 has been propelled by the Affordable Care Act and other health insurance laws that have increased coverage for mental disorders, as well as by investments from private equity firms.\n\nThe residential programs, their directors say, fill a dire need, serving patients from areas where no adequate treatment is available.\n\n\u201cOnly 15 to 30 percent of people have access to specialized care for eating disorders, which means there are a lot of people out there who have zippo,\u201d said Doug Bunnell, the chief clinical officer for Monte Nido, a program that began in Malibu, California, and now operates centers in five states.\n\nBut the advertising and the profusion of centers, which typically cost $1,000 a day, is raising concerns among some eating disorders experts. In the companies\u2019 rush to expand, they argue, quality of treatment may be sacrificed for profit. And they question whether the spalike atmosphere of some programs is so comfortable that it fosters dependency.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, the people who are running and working in these programs believe they\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d said Dr. Angela Guarda, the director of the eating disorders program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. \u201cBut it\u2019s a slippery slope. Money can cloud your view.\u201d\n\nThe eating disorders world\n\nMany specialists agree that some patients require the supervision of residential programs and benefit from the treatment. But studies showing the programs\u2019 effectiveness are scant, Guarda and other experts said.\n\nThe quality and form of treatment varies widely, and in some cases includes approaches \u2014 equine therapy or \u201cfaith-based\u201d treatment \u2014 with little or no scientific evidence behind them. Some programs have full-time psychiatrists and medical doctors on staff, but others lack the expertise to handle emergencies or treat coexisting medical or psychiatric problems.\n\nThe perks offered to clinicians who might refer patients include free trips, restaurant meals, educational seminars and small gifts like pens and key chains. Critics liken them to pharmaceutical industry tactics that led to policies requiring financial disclosure, though on a smaller scale.\n\nIn an article in the journal Psychiatric Services, Dr. Evelyn Attia, director of the eating disorders program at Columbia University Medical Center, called for more transparency, and urged clinicians to be mindful of efforts to influence their recommended treatment.\n\n\u201cThe effect of these clinician inducements, which are aimed at building a program\u2019s patient referral base, may not be fully recognized by the professionals they target,\u201d wrote Attia and her colleagues.\n\nIndustry representatives said the trips and seminars offered to clinicians were primarily educational.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the eating disorders world is giving out swimming pools and trips to Europe and things like that,\u201d Bunnell said.\n\nJillian Lampert, president of the Residential Eating Disorders Consortium, a group that represents about 85 percent of the centers, said, \u201cHealth care\u2019s always been a business.\u201d If there are concerns, she said, \u201cwe are incredibly open to having those conversations.\u201d\n\nA deadly mental illness\n\nEating disorders are among the most difficult mental illnesses to treat.\n\nAnorexia, in particular, has stymied many of psychiatry\u2019s best efforts. The illness has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, with patients dying from starvation or suicide. The most severely ill patients require hospital treatment just to stay alive.\n\nBut even after being stabilized, many patients need time to regain weight and learn new behavior. The average length of stay in residential centers ranges is 83 days.\n\nIn the past, few insurers were willing to pay for 24-hour care after a patient was out of immediate danger. But the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in 2008 and the Affordable Care Act two years later mandated equal treatment.\n\nWall Street investors saw profits in providing treatment for eating disorders, alcoholism and drug abuse.\n\n\u201cThe number of covered lives is growing faster than the availability of services to treat them, creating compelling investment opportunities,\u201d the accounting and consulting firm BDO noted last year.\n\nLarger centers have acquired smaller ones and expanded across the country.\n\nFor example, Monte Nido, founded by Carolyn Costin, a former teacher who recovered from an eating disorder, began with a center in Malibu. But in 2012, with financing from an equity firm, Monte Nido began opening new programs in Oregon, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Monte Nido\u2019s approach to eating disorder treatment is what you and others like you have been waiting for,\u201d Costin wrote in a letter to potential patients on the company\u2019s website, which includes images of beaches, mountains and the Boston skyline on its home page.\n\nCold-calling for patients\n\nWith a need to fill more beds, marketers for some centers make cold calls to psychiatrists, psychotherapists, medical doctors and others who treat eating disorders, offering to inform them about a program\u2019s advantages and inviting them to visit.\n\nThe Denver-based Eating Recovery Center has a call center and employs 20 \u201cprofessional relations liaisons\u201d who contact clinicians. On its website, the company, which began with a single center, bills itself as \u201cthe only national health care system devoted to serious eating disorders at all levels of care.\u201d\n\nProspective patients or family members searching for a treatment program sometimes turn to edtreatmentreview.com, where former patients describe their experiences, evaluating the staff, critiquing the food and noting whether cellphones are allowed.\n\nMelissa R., 28, said after several hospitalizations for anorexia, beginning when she was 21, she found a residential center in the Southwest on the Internet. The center, which she described as \u201cmore like a resort,\u201d was \u201csomewhat helpful,\u201d she said, but not worth the time and money.\n\n\u201cPeople were nice, and the food was really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI had fun, I enjoyed rock climbing and stuff, but that\u2019s not why I was there. I\u2019m paying a lot of money to get well, not to rock climb.\u201d\n\nLast year, she spent two months at Eating Recovery Center in Denver, and began to gain control of her illness.\n\n\u201cERC was the best place I\u2019ve been,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were very individualized.\u201d\n\nAshley Bilkie, 29, had a different experience with ERC. When she returned home in February 2015 after about six months \u2014 her fourth stay in an inpatient program for anorexia and her second at ERC \u2014 \u201cI was getting sicker and sicker,\u201d she said. She lost the weight she had gained back at the center. \u201cI had to buy children\u2019s clothing,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was also expensive. Her father Robert Bilkie, a financial adviser in Michigan, calculated that over three years, he paid at least $350,000. ERC, he said, sent him bills for $30,000 each month. He paid willingly, but no program seemed to produce lasting results.\n\n\u201cWe spent an outrageous amount of money for what really amounted to ineffectual treatment,\u201d Robert Bilkie said.\n\nSomething that worked\n\nLast fall, Ashley Bilkie entered the eating disorder center at Johns Hopkins, a university-affiliated program.\n\nThe staff weaned her off high doses of Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Adderall, a stimulant. In group therapy, other patients put pressure on her to change her behavior. It was a switch, she said, from previous groups, where patients talked about their problems.\n\nWith the program\u2019s stress on weight restoration \u2014 studies show that it is the best predictor of how anorexic patients will do once they leave, rather than, say, elevated mood \u2014 her weight returned to normal. She was discharged in November and continues to do well.\n\n\u201cI hated every single solitary second of it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing, because I was not comfortable, and it meant that something was working.\u201d\n\nA history of ups and downs is not unusual for patients with eating disorders.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, you see one step forward, two steps back,\u201d said Dr. Mark Friedlander, the chief medical officer for Aetna Behavioral Health.\n\nHis company, Friedlander said, considers residential care essential for some patients. But, he said, a lack of outcome studies and a patchwork licensing system make it difficult to evaluate care.\n\n\u201cWe would love to see greater consistency and higher standards,\u201d he said.\n\nTo that end, a group of eating disorder specialists from treatment centers, including Eating Recovery Center and Monte Nido, have developed requirements for accreditation of residential programs. The Joint Commission, an independent company that accredits health care facilities, has adopted the requirements, which go into effect July 1.\n\nIn the meantime, many patients and families will continue to rely on word of mouth and any information they can find online.\n\n\u201cThese are black boxes,\u201d Dr. Scott Hadland, an adolescent medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School, said of the residential centers. \u201cPeople get the idea that these are places that can heal just based on what they see on a website or in the photos.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/05/HFcover1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The marketing efforts by these for-profit residential care centers are aimed at patients with eating disorders and the clinicians who treat them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the eating disorders world is giving out swimming pools and trips to Europe and things like that,\u201d Bunnell said.\nBut the advertising and the profusion of centers, which typically cost $1,000 a day, is raising concerns among some eating disorders experts.\nMoney can cloud your view.\u201dThe eating disorders worldMany specialists agree that some patients require the supervision of residential programs and benefit from the treatment.\nWall Street investors saw profits in providing treatment for eating disorders, alcoholism and drug abuse."}
