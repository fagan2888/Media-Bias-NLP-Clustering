They\u2019re muddied together,\u201d Mr. Lambdin said in an interview.\n\nThe polling contradicts findings in other surveys that seemed to show higher levels of satisfaction, including a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, that found three-quarters of people on exchange plans rated their overall coverage as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nThe discrepancies could result from how the surveys measure satisfaction and how much weight is given to people who feel lukewarm about their plans.\n\nDeloitte asked more than 3,800 adults, including 406 exchange enrollees, to rate their satisfaction from one to 10. More than half of exchange customers said they were in the \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d range of four to seven.\n\nFourteen percent of exchange users said they were \u201cnot satisfied.\u201d By comparison, those who have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or plans through their employers had dissatisfaction rates in the single digits.\n\nObamacare customers were twice as likely as the uninsured to see a primary care doctor, suggesting that the coverage is paying off in trying to create a more healthy population.\n\nAlso, 35 percent had a high level of confidence that the exchanges are providing good information.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is officially known, set up marketplaces in each state where those who lack insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid can purchase plans, usually with government subsidies in the form of tax credits.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the broad outlines of the law as constitutional, and in June issued yet another ruling finding that the law allows tax credits to be paid nationwide, putting Obamacare on surer footing.\n\nStill, the law has suffered from a number of self-imposed hiccups, including potential fraud, lax verification and potentially rising costs for customers as insurers figure out the economics.\n\nGoing forward, Obamacare exchange plans will have to balance consumers\u2019 \u201coverwhelming\u201d preference for low premiums with a plan that minimizes risk to out-of-pocket costs and lets patients see the doctors they want, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a vice president at Avalere Health, a Washington-based consultancy.\n\n\u201cA low-premium plan may work well for some consumers, but over time, others may view this trade-off differently,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said the Deloitte results reflect their critiques that high costs, mainly through big deductibles and copays, have left Obamacare\u2019s customers functionally uninsured.\n\n\u201cThe fact that so few people receiving large subsidies to purchase Obamacare coverage are satisfied is another testament to how the law has been an expensive failure,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican, said in response to the study.\n\nSometimes the hiccups with Obamacare have prevented people from signing up.\n\nTwo in five uninsured respondents to the survey said they experienced technical difficulties in trying to enroll on an Obamacare website, and 27 percent said they eventually stopped trying because of the glitches.\n\n\u201cPotential buyers report facing substantial technical and usability barriers, and need better decision-making support,\u201d the survey said.\n\nSeveral states are going after tech vendors for faulty exchanges that spoiled the early rounds of enrollment, particularly in the first year.\n\nA trio of Republican senators led by Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, urged Andy Slavitt, acting administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Monday to return any dollars recouped from faulty Obamacare contractors to the federal taxpayer.\n\n\u201cThese wasted dollars originally flowed from the federal Treasury, which is where they should return when they are recouped from contractors,\u201d they said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Less than a third of Obamacare exchange customers are satisfied with their plans, according to a survey released Monday that finds enrollees in the signature heath overhaul are less happy than those covered through government programs or their jobs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Less than a third of Obamacare exchange customers are satisfied with their plans, according to a survey released Monday that finds enrollees in the signature heath overhaul are less happy than those covered through government programs or their jobs.", "title": "Obamacare enrollees less satisfied than people with other types of coverage: survey", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/3/obamacare-enrollees-less-satisfied-others-survey/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/26/30ae8517529a4b217d0f6a7067000139.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/26/30ae8517529a4b217d0f6a7067000139.jpg", "description": "Less than a third of Obamacare exchange customers are satisfied with their plans, according to a survey released Monday that finds enrollees in the signature heath overhaul are less happy than those c", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare enrollees less satisfied than people with other types of cov"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb032\"", "article_summary": "More than half of exchange customers said they were in the \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d range of four to seven.\nJust 30 percent of customers on Obamacare\u2019s exchanges were satisfied with their coverage, the health care research arm of the Deloitte consulting firm said.\nOnly a quarter of Obamacare customers in the survey were confident that they could get care when they needed it, and just 16 percent felt \u201cfinancially prepared\u201d to handle future health care costs, Deloitte said.\nObamacare customers were twice as likely as the uninsured to see a primary care doctor, suggesting that the coverage is paying off in trying to create a more healthy population.\n\u201cThe fact that so few people receiving large subsidies to purchase Obamacare coverage are satisfied is another testament to how the law has been an expensive failure,\u201d Sen.
