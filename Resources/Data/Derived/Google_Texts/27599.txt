On Thursday, July 30, 2015, the White House and AIDS.gov will live stream the release of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Updated to 2020 during an event in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Strategy has reinvigorated the collective national response to HIV. It has changed the way Americans talk about HIV, as well as the ways they plan and deliver services at the local level to prevent new infections and support those living with HIV to seek treatment and stay in care.

You can read more about the upcoming update and view a video interview with Douglas Brooks, Director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, in this blog post from June 29, 2015.
