The obesity rate in America hit its highest level on record last year, with over 1-in-4 Americans being substantially overweight – despite Michelle Obama’s efforts to combat it.

Gallup and Healthways conducted the random survey with over 176,000 participants in reaching its findings that 27.7 percent of Americans were obese in 2014, up from 27.1 the year before, and up significantly from 2008 (the year Barack Obama was elected) when the rate was 25.5 percent.

Michelle Obama has made childhood obesity one of her key initiatives as First Lady. The goal of the Lets Move! campaign is to “raise a healthier generation of kids.” One of the greatest determinants of adult obesity are the lifestyle patterns created in childhood.

Additionally, starting in 2014, Obamacare required insurers to allow for screening and counseling for obesity at no cost to the patient.

The survey noted the states with the highest and lowest rates of obesity. Mississippi and Kentucky top the list for the highest obesity rates, while Hawaii and Colorado were the lowest.

NBC News reports that “People who are obese have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease.”

The survey also found obesity impacts one’s overall sense of well-being.

“There are proven, effective interventions for helping people lose weight and sustain their weight loss,” says Janet Calhoun, senior vice president at Healthways. “For maximum impact, interventions need to go beyond addressing eating habits and physical activity, and include the emotional and social aspects of well-being…[to achieve] long-lasting behavior change.”
