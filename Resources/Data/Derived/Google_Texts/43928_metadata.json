Here's a rundown of the stories currently trending in the world, the country and your backyard.\n\nHere's what's trending\n\nFerguson: Nearly two dozen people were arrested in Ferguson, Mo., Monday as the city remained under a state of emergency. The protest centered around the anniversary of the death of Michael Brown started out peaceful, but turned violent when protestors threw frozen water bottles at police officers and blocked downtown streets and a section of interstate.\n\nTrump on Fox: GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump will appear on two shows on Fox Tuesday, reportedly after Fox News chairman Roger Ailes assured him he would be treated fairly. Trump is set to appear on \"Fox & Friends\" and \"Hannity.\" Trump has been embroiled in a controversy following comments he made about Fox anchor Megyn Kelly following last week's GOP debate.\n\nRiver contamination: The governor of Colorado will tour an area near Silverton, Colo., to see first hand the effects of the accidental contamination of the Animas River. An EPA contractor spilled toxic waste into the waterway last week. Three million gallons of waste water has turned the river orange.\n\nLook up: What astronomers are calling the best meteor shower of the year begins Tuesday. The Perseids meteor shower will be most visible in the pre-dawn hours. NASA says if the weather is right, you could see as many as 80 meteors per hour.\n\nStates support Obamacare challenge: Sixteen states, including Alabama, filed friends-of-the-court briefs Monday in support of three Christian universities that are fighting Affordable Care Act requirements on contraception. Houston Baptist University, East Texas Baptist University, and Westminster Theological Seminary have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that forces them to expand contraception options in their health insurance plans.\n\nNever give up", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Animas River, Fox & Friends, news", "title": "Here's what's trending: Ferguson arrests; Trump on Fox; river contamination; Obamacare challenge", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Here's what's trending Tuesday", "title": "Here's what's trending: Ferguson arrests; Trump on Fox; river contamination; Obamacare challenge", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/08/heres_whats_trending_ferguson_1.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/mine-waste-leak-0b6a519b9eb89ee3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's what's trending Tuesday", "creator": "@DebbieMLord", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/mine-waste-leak-0b6a519b9eb89ee3.jpg", "title": "Here's what's trending: Ferguson arrests; Trump on Fox; river contamination; Obamacare challenge", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, August 11, 2015,  9:34 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, August 11, 2015,  5:51 AM", "article_author": "Debbie M.
