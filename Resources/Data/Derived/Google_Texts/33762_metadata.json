This year, the IRS will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s.\n\nTaxpayer services are suffering, too, with millions of phone calls to the IRS going unanswered.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe keep going after the people who look like the worst of the bad guys,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in an interview. \u201cBut there are going to be some people that we should catch, either in terms of collecting the revenue from them or prosecuting them, that we\u2019re not going to catch.\u201d\n\nBetter technology is helping to offset some budget cuts.\n\nIf you report making $40,000 in wages and your employer tells the IRS you made $50,000, the agency\u2019s computers probably will catch that. The same is true for investment income and many common deductions that are reported to the IRS by financial institutions.\n\nBut if you operate a business that deals in cash, with income or expenses that are not independently reported to the IRS, your chances of getting caught are lower than they have been in years.\n\nLast year, the IRS audited less than 1 percent of all returns from individuals, the lowest rate since 2005. This year, Koskinen said, \u201cThe numbers will go down.\u201d\n\nKoskinen was confirmed as IRS commissioner in December. He took over an agency under siege on several fronts.\n\nLast year, the IRS acknowledged agents improperly singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status from 2010 to 2012. The revelation has led to five ongoing investigations, including three by congressional committees, and outraged lawmakers who control the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nThe IRS also is implementing large parts of President Barack Obama\u2019s health law, including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance. Republicans in Congress abhor the law, putting another bull\u2019s-eye on the agency\u2019s back.\n\nThe animosity is reflected in the IRS budget, which has declined from $12.1 billion in 2010 to $11.3 billion in the current budget year.\n\nObama has proposed a 10 percent increase for next year; Republicans are balking.\n\nRep. Ander Crenshaw, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the IRS budget, called the request \u201cboth meaningless and pointless\u201d because it exceeds spending caps already set by Congress.\n\nKoskinen said he suspects some people think that if they cut funds to the IRS, the agency won\u2019t be able to implement the health law. They\u2019re wrong, he said.\n\nThe IRS is legally obligated to enforce the health law, Koskinen said. That means budget savings will have to be found elsewhere.\n\nKoskinen said he can cut spending in three areas: enforcement, taxpayer services and technology. Technology upgrades can only be put off for so long, he said, so enforcement and taxpayer services are suffering.\n\nLast year, only 61 percent of taxpayers calling the IRS for help got it. This year, Koskinen said he expects the numbers to be similar. To help free up operators, callers with complicated tax questions are directed to the agency\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe problem with complicated questions is they take longer,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nYour chances of getting audited vary greatly, based on your income. The more you make, the more likely you are to get a letter from the IRS.\n\nOnly 0.9 percent of people making less than $200,000 were audited last year. That\u2019s the lowest rate since the IRS began publishing the statistic in 2006.\n\nBy contrast, 10.9 percent of people making $1 million or more were audited. That\u2019s the lowest rate since 2010.\n\nOnly 0.6 percent of business returns were audited, but the rate varied greatly depending on the size of the business. About 16 percent of corporations with more than $10 million in assets were audited.\n\nMost people don\u2019t have much of an opportunity to cheat on their taxes, said Elizabeth Maresca, a former IRS lawyer who now teaches law at Fordham University.\n\nYour employer probably reports your wages to the IRS, your bank reports interest income, your broker reports investment income and your lender reports the amount of interest you paid on your mortgage.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s an employee, who gets paid by an employer, has a limited ability to take risks on their tax returns,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cI think people who own their own business or are self-employed have a much greater opportunity (to cheat), and I think the IRS knows that, too.\u201d\n\nOne flag for the IRS is when your deductions or expenses don\u2019t match your income, said Joseph Perry, the partner in charge of tax and business services at Marcum LLP, an accounting firm. For example, if you deduct $70,000 in real estate taxes and mortgage interest, but only report $100,000 in income.\n\n\u201cThat would at least beg the question, how are you living?\u201d Perry said.\n\nKoskinen said the IRS could scrutinize more returns \u2013 and collect billions more in revenue \u2013 with more resources. The president\u2019s budget proposal says the IRS would collect an additional $6 for every $1 increase in the agency\u2019s enforcement budget.\n\nKoskinen said he makes that argument all the time, but for some reason, it\u2019s not playing well in Congress.\n\n\u201cI say that and everybody shrugs and goes on about their business,\u201d Koskinen said. \u201cI have not figured out either philosophically or psychologically why nobody seems to care whether we collect the revenue or not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON -- As millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday's tax deadline, their chances of getting audi", "pubdate": 20140414, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON -- As millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday's tax deadline, their chances of getting audi", "title": "Chances of being audited by IRS lowest since 2005", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/irs.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/chances-audited-irs-lowest-years/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON -- As millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday's tax deadline, their chances of getting audi", "title": "Chances of being audited by IRS lowest since 2005", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/irs.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "tax audit"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "internal revenue service, irs, tax audit"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe3f\"", "article_summary": "Last year, the IRS audited less than 1 percent of all returns from individuals, the lowest rate since 2005.\nThe animosity is reflected in the IRS budget, which has declined from $12.1 billion in 2010 to $11.3 billion in the current budget year.\nOnly 0.6 percent of business returns were audited, but the rate varied greatly depending on the size of the business.\n\u201cI say that and everybody shrugs and goes on about their business,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s an employee, who gets paid by an employer, has a limited ability to take risks on their tax returns,\u201d Maresca said."}
