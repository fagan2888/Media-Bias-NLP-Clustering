Mike has found more emotional strength than he knew he had when the reality hit that caring for Joe is a 24-hour-a-day job.\n\nNancy went from daughter to family caregiver, and after weeks of sleeping in her father\u2019s hospital room, stress-filled months and sleepless nights, she learned to rely on her siblings, make a plan and step back into her life.\n\nAmy is an AARP expert on caregiving, juggling work and family. She now cares for her father in her own home. Until her mother passed away recently, both of Amy\u2019s parents lived with her. Family caregivers are all around us: friends, family members, acquaintances \u2013 ourselves. No matter the situation, we face many challenges as we help aging parents and other loved ones live independently. The reality is: Every day family caregivers do remarkable things. For example:\n\nThe majority provide an average of 20 hours a week of care.\n\nMany still maintain a job outside the home.\n\nMany more care for their loved ones 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nFamily caregivers provide more than $450 billion in unpaid care annually.\n\nThey administer medicine and care, most often without any training.\n\nThey serve as accountant, cook, assistant, nurse, housekeeper, companion and in many other roles to care for their loved ones.\n\nFamily caregivers safely keep their loved ones out of costly institutional care, like nursing homes.\n\n\n\nThis is why AARP is fighting to make sure family caregivers have the support they need to safely help their loved ones stay at home. This year, AARP launched a new multistate caregiving advocacy campaign, with nearly every AARP state office involved. Working with governors, state legislators, other policymakers and community partners, we\u2019re determined to advance policy options that will help family caregivers. Two significant components of the campaign are:\n\nThe Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act\n\nTen AARP state offices are working to pass the CARE Act through state legislation or regulation this year, with Oklahoma and Hawaii leading the way.\n\nIn Oklahoma , AARP fought successfully for 872,000 family caregivers, passing Senate Bill 1536 \u2013 the state version of the CARE Act. The measure was signed into law by Gov. Mary Fallin.\n\n, AARP fought successfully for family caregivers, passing Senate Bill 1536 \u2013 the state version of the CARE Act. The measure was signed into law by Gov. Mary Fallin. In Hawaii, the state legislature created a task force to explore the elements of the CARE Act, which would benefit 247,000 family caregivers, and determine the feasibility of introducing the bill in the 2015 session. The task force is due to report back to the legislature by January 1, 2015.\n\n\n\nBy passing the CARE Act states will ensure that:\n\nThe name of the family caregiver is recorded when a loved one is admitted into a hospital or rehabilitation facility.\n\nThe family caregiver is notified if the loved one is to be discharged to another facility or back home.\n\nThe facility must provide an explanation and live instruction of the medical tasks \u2013 such as medication management, injections, wound care and transfers \u2013 that the family caregiver will perform at home.\n\n\n\nFor more on AARP\u2019s advocacy: AARP Announces 2014 Advocacy Agenda: Across the States\n\nState Plan in Support of Family Caregivers\n\nLast year Arizona, Illinois, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia passed resolutions to better support and understand the needs of family caregivers. This year, 20 additional states are working to create a State Plan in Support of Family Caregivers. Already, Delaware, Mississippi, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, New Mexico, South Carolina and Utah have achieved victories. The State Plan in Support of Family Caregivers:\n\nCreates a joint committee to study family caregiving and the programs and services available to help seniors live independently, at home.\n\nIdentifies policies and resources available, as well as encouraging new and innovative practices.\n\nCompiles an inventory of resources currently available.\n\nProvides recommendations to the legislature and administration on how to improve support for family caregivers in the state.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, AARP is fighting to:\n\nMake sure respite care programs are available so family caregivers who are on call 24/7 can take a well-deserved and needed break.\n\nEstablish workplace protections \u2013 like paid and unpaid leave and sick leave \u2013 so caregivers don\u2019t have to worry about being fired from their jobs when they need to take a few hours off to help their loved ones.\n\nProvide for caregiver assessments so that the needs of family caregivers are incorporated into the care plans for their loved ones.\n\nExpand the scope of practice for nurses so they are able to use their full training and potential, and allow for nurses to delegate certain tasks to family caregivers.\n\nCreate tax incentives for the services and support family caregivers provide for their loved ones.\n\nExpand the network of services provided in homes and communities for those who are eligible for Medicaid and for all others.\n\n\n\nIf you are a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTo find the tools and support you need, as well as ways to connect with other caregivers, visit AARP\u2019s Caregiver Resource Center.\n\nTo stay up to date or get involved with our caregiving advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @RoamTheDomes for more news on caregiving and other advocacy across the country.\n\n11/12/14 CARE Act Update:\n\nOklahoma: On November 1st, 2014, Oklahoma became the first state in the nation to enact the CARE Act.\n\nHawaii: The state legislature created a task force to explore the elements of the CARE Act and determine the feasibility of introducing the bill in the 2015 session.
