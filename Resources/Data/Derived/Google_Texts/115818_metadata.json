The only thing that will jack up the price is making it \"free.\" How about a big federal program to provide every American with free toilet paper? Coincidentally, that's about all most college degrees are good for these days.\n\nObama's moronic proposal has presented the GOP with a fantastic opportunity. Since he brought it up, how about Republicans get to the bottom of why college is so expensive?\n\nThe cost of a college education has increased by more than 1,000 percent only since 1978. Nothing else has gone up that much -- not health care, consumer goods or home prices. The explosion in college tuition bears no relation to anything happening in the economy.\n\nWould anyone argue that colleges are providing a better education today than in 1978? I promise you: People coming out of college in the '50s knew more than any recent Yale graduate -- unless we're only counting knowledge of sexual practices once considered verboten.\n\nThey're teaching gender studies, ethnic studies, moral equivalence and hatred of America. Did the Japanese Really Start World War II or Did We? It's worse than not reading Shakespeare. They're reading Shakespeare for homosexual imagery. As Yale professor Daniel Gelernter says, colleges are \"threatening to become an elaborate, extremely expensive practical joke.\"\n\nThe fact that 80 percent of Weathermen -- the violent '60s radicals -- are full college professors tells you all you need to know about the state of higher education today.\n\nThe cost of college spirals continuously upward not because the product has gotten better -- it's gotten much, much worse -- but because college loans are backed by the taxpayer.\n\nThe government is chasing its tail every time it increases student financial aid. If the government hiked college loans and subsidies by $1 million per student, colleges would promptly raise tuition to: [current tuition] plus $1 million.\n\nAmericans are being bamboozled into paying any price for a college degree because they are relentlessly told that if they don't go to college, their lives will be hell. And they're told this not only by the colleges, but by the government.\n\nThe sales pitch is manifestly false. According to an article by Adam Davidson in The New York Times magazine last June,\n\n\"(m)ore than half of recent college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, meaning they make substandard wages in jobs that don't require a college degree.\" Evidently, most jobs don't depend on a degree in women's studies.\n\nMore than a third of college graduates, Davidson says, will never make enough money to repay their student loans.\n\nIf any other business made such false claims about a product, there would be massive congressional hearings, media denunciations and prison sentences for the CEOs. A college degree is the most expensive purchase most families will ever make, other than their home.\n\nRight before our eyes, Democrats are colluding with colleges to create a market bubble for an increasingly worthless product, and they're doing it by making the exact same promise that banks made about home mortgages before the housing market crash: Sure it's a lot, but it's an investment in your future!\n\nInstead of hauling college administrators to court, Democrats are active participants in the fraud, acting as Big Education's carnival barkers. It's as if the government is telling people: \"If you don't smoke, you'll never be cool.\"\n\nWhy is the left not willing to admit that education is an industry, just like Lockheed Martin, Enron or Philip Morris? Democrats love to rail about the high costs of everything else -- pharmaceuticals, health care, mortgages, missile systems, contraception and so on. College is a business, too -- a cartel that fixes prices, preys on teenagers and lies to consumers.\n\nBut liberals won't make a peep about the College Industrial Complex because college professors are brainwashing students into leftist politics. Every year, another 10 million graduates emerge, hating God, their parents, America and Republicans. For this, parents are spending $50,000 a year.\n\nThe education industry is how leftists make capitalists pay for socialism. It was a smart move for cultural Marxists to capture the country's education establishment. GOOD THINKING, CULTURAL MARXISTS!\n\nIt's not the fault of the students that they're getting a crappy product at inflated prices. They've been lied to by shady education peddlers, including the Democratic Party.\n\nLet's see if the middle class is more interested in the cost of college tuition or the Democrats' endless global warming initiatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama's moronic proposal has presented the GOP with a fantastic opportunity..05/25/2016 21:07:16PM EST.", "author": "Ann Coulter", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Obama's moronic proposal has presented the GOP with a fantastic opportunity.", "title": "- As Long as Obama Brought Up the Cost of College...", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2015/01/14/as-long-as-obama-brought-up-the-cost-of-college-n1943204", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/14/f79c546b-eaf3-4404-a5e1-4b66acfec740.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Obama's moronic proposal has presented the GOP with a fantastic opportunity.", "title": "- As Long as Obama Brought Up the Cost of College...", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2015/01/14/as-long-as-obama-brought-up-the-cost-of-college-n1943204", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/14/f79c546b-eaf3-4404-a5e1-4b66acfec740.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "As Long as Obama Brought Up the Cost of College..., Ann Coulter, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc65\"", "article_summary": "The cost of a college education has increased by more than 1,000 percent only since 1978.\nLet's see if the middle class is more interested in the cost of college tuition or the Democrats' endless global warming initiatives.\nA college degree is the most expensive purchase most families will ever make, other than their home.\nThe explosion in college tuition bears no relation to anything happening in the economy.\nAmericans are being bamboozled into paying any price for a college degree because they are relentlessly told that if they don't go to college, their lives will be hell."}
