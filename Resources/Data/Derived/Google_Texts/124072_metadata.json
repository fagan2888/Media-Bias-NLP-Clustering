But Young's supervisors at UPS denied her request for light duty. She was told that UPS only provided accommodations to three categories of workers: those who had been injured on the job, those who lost their Department of Transportation certification and those who have a disability as defined by the Americans with Disability Act.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday resurrected a woman's pregnancy discrimination claim against UPS, sending the case back to a lower court.", "pubdate": "2015-03-25T14:34:52Z", "author": "Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday resurrected a woman's pregnancy discrimination claim against UPS, sending the case back to a lower court.", "pubdate": "2015-03-25T14:34:52Z", "title": "Supreme Court resurrects pregnancy discrimination case", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/politics/supreme-court-ups-pregnancy-case/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130227203059-supreme-justices-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130227203059-supreme-justices-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,art-gal", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/politics/supreme-court-ups-pregnancy-case/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Supreme Court resurrects pregnancy discrimination case - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-03-25T16:55:45Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday resurrected a woman's pregnancy discrimination claim against UPS, sending the case back to a lower court.\nThe ruling is a victory for Peggy Young, a former driver for the company who claimed the package company violated her rights under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and now will have a chance to prove her case in court.\nWhen she became pregnant in 2006, Peggy Young's doctor told her not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds for the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy.\n\"Although today's ruling is narrow, it's an important victory for pregnant employees like Young,\" said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at American University and a CNN analyst.\nBut Young's supervisors at UPS denied her request for light duty."}
