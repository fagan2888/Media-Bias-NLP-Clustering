If you just wanted to ogle your favorite TV star, the show offered that.\n\nActresses tended to go one of two ways \u2014 pale and elegant, or bold and beautiful.\n\nEven when the went light in color, actresses made sure their gowns were rich and textured. Julie Bowen\u2019s Zac Posen dress had all kinds of action, from the bows on the shoulders to the sculpted bodice and body to the tiered petal-like show at the bottom. \u201cI\u2019m not a girly-girl,\u201d she said, but her frothy confection said the opposite.\n\nJanuary Jones sauntered onto the red carpet in a strapless Givenchy gown with a lace skirt, her hair gracefully sideswept. Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 sparkled in an ivory Monique Lhuillier gown, while Juliana Margulies\u2019 strapless ivory dress had a black vine trailing down one side. Kerry Washington\u2019s gown featured floral appliques in white and gold.\n\nElisabeth Moss wore one of her prettiest red carpet looks to date: a color-blocked style with a black strapless top and full white skirt.\n\nNote to Claire Danes and her stylist: don\u2019t put a woman with a boyish figure in a gown with a plunging neck.\n\nFor all the pale beauties, those wearing vivid color stood out, and blue was the top color of the evening. Tina Fey, Edie Falco, Jane Krakowski and Allison Williams were among the actresses who chose to make a cool splash. What made their looks impressive was how well they were tailored. Fey\u2019s halter-neck Narciso Rodriguez dress fit her like second skin. Her sleek hairstyle perfectly complemented the dress.\n\nSofia Vegara is an actress who always goes her own way when it comes to fashion, and the Emmys were no exception. Her plunge-neck red gown from Vera Wang followed her curves and the Lorraine Schwartz jumbo drop earrings added to the bold statement.\n\nEven the guys got into the spirit of mixing it up for the Emmys. Host Neil Patrick Harris wore a wine-colored jacket, as did Derek Hough. Jon Hamm wore a white jacket and black tie. Will Arnett sported the currently chic silvery gray jacket with black lapels, as did red carpet interviewer Ryan Secrest.\n\nSee all the looks from the red carpet here.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/style/2013/09/22/at-the-emmys-fashion-either-goes-soft-or-strong/28913/", "site_name": "Mile High Style", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Emmys fashion is all about color: Looks range from white to bright"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Emmys fashion is all about color: Looks range from white to bright", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/style/2013/09/22/at-the-emmys-fashion-either-goes-soft-or-strong/28913/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@suzannebro", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alison Williams,Claire Danes,Edie Falco,Elisabeth Moss,Enmy Awards,Givenchy,Jane Krakowski,January Jones,Jon Hamm,Julia Louis-Dreyfus,Julianna Margulies,Julie Bowen,Kerry Washington,Monique Lhuillier,Narciso rodriquez,Ryan Secrest,Sofia Vegara,Tina Fey,Vera Wang,Zac Posen"}, "article_summary": "Elisabeth Moss wore one of her prettiest red carpet looks to date: a color-blocked style with a black strapless top and full white skirt.\nJon Hamm wore a white jacket and black tie.\nHer plunge-neck red gown from Vera Wang followed her curves and the Lorraine Schwartz jumbo drop earrings added to the bold statement.\nSee all the looks from the red carpet here.\nWill Arnett sported the currently chic silvery gray jacket with black lapels, as did red carpet interviewer Ryan Secrest."}
