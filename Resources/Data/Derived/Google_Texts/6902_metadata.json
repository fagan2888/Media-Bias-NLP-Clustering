President Obama was also on a series of messages, though the government is withholding those.\n\nBut just how widely disseminated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s address was became clear in a single 2011 message from Anne-Marie Slaughter, who appeared to include Mrs. Clinton on a message alongside Supreme Court Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan, reporters Jeffrey Toobin, David Brooks, Fred Hiatt and Evan Thomas, CIA Director David H. Petraeus, top Obama aide Benjamin Rhodes and former White House counsel Gregory Craig.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 handguns in the U.S.\n\nComputer specialists said they would have had to know what they were looking for to spot Mrs. Clinton\u2019s address, but it was there for anyone who did look \u2014 raising questions about how her unique arrangement remained secret for so long. It came to the public\u2019s attention when news broke in March 2015 in The New York Times \u2014 after it was uncovered by a congressional investigation into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.\n\nThe State Department has since acknowledged that it did not search Mrs. Clinton\u2019s messages in response to open-records requests filed under federal law, and federal District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan is prodding the department about how the situation got so out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a Cabinet-level official who was accommodated by the government for reasons unknown to the public. And I think that\u2019s a fair statement \u2014 for reasons unknown to the public,\u201d the judge said at a hearing last week, where he decided to approve conservative legal group Judicial Watch\u2019s request for discovery to pry loose more details about who approved the odd email setup and how it ducked the rules.\n\nPHOTOS: Famous mistresses of the world's most powerful men\n\n\u201cAll the public can do is speculate,\u201d Judge Sullivan told the government lawyers who have been fighting to drag out the release of the messages Mrs. Clinton has turned over, and to prevent her from having to relinquish thousands of others. \u201cYou want me to say it\u2019s done, but I can\u2019t do that right now.\u201d\n\nThe final batch of messages the State Department has in its custody \u2014 2,000 of them \u2014 is due to be released Monday.\n\nThe facts have changed dramatically since the emails were first revealed and Mrs. Clinton insisted that she set up her unique arrangement out of \u201cconvenience\u201d for herself and insisted no classified material was sent on the account.\n\nAlready, 1,782 messages have been deemed to contain classified material, and 22 of those messages contain \u201csecret\u201d information. Another 22 messages contain \u201ctop secret\u201d material so sensitive that the government won\u2019t even release any part of them, meaning they will remain completely hidden from the public.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s arrangement set off public policy and security debates. Analysts said her server was likely unprotected against any moderately sophisticated attack.\n\nAlthough details remain sketchy as to what protection Mrs. Clinton used, analysts said having one person maintaining her server is no way to protect sensitive information from a hack. Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said there is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton was having her server tested by independent specialists \u2014 a major oversight.\n\n\u201cYou cannot secure your server with one guy working part time,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said.\n\nThat one person, Bryan Pagliano, who reportedly worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department and on the side as her server technician, asserted his Fifth Amendment right against incriminating himself in testimony to Congress last year.\n\nEven if the server itself wasn\u2019t compromised, Mr. Soghoian said, Mrs. Clinton was sending email over the broader Internet, where an enterprising opponent could have intercepted messages. If she had been using a State.gov account to email others within the government, that wouldn\u2019t have been possible, he said.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton was hacked, but analysts said that\u2019s of little comfort. Even if the FBI doesn\u2019t find evidence, it is not conclusive.\n\n\u201cClinton\u2019s use of unencrypted email left her vulnerable to nation states. There\u2019s no amount of investigation the FBI can do to prove that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said.\n\nBob Gourley, co-founder of cybersecurity consultancy Cognitio, said the government has to assume Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server was compromised, and he said it begs the question of why she declined to use a State.gov account and instead set up her own off-site server.\n\n\u201cAll indications are this was not just a matter of convenience,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why she should have used her own server and go to all the trouble to do that unless she wanted to hide something.\u201d\n\nThat something, Mr. Gourley believes, is the negotiating she did on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. She helped lead the foundation as soon as she stepped down from the secretary\u2019s job.\n\nThe security analyst said he suspects details of those negotiations are part of the 30,000 messages Mrs. Clinton indicated she sent during her time in office but that she declined to turn back to the State Department. The former secretary said those messages were personal business, such as scheduling yoga classes or arranging her daughter Chelsea\u2019s wedding.\n\nJudicial Watch is trying to get Mrs. Clinton to turn over those messages to the State Department, and that\u2019s the case pending before Judge Sullivan.\n\n\u201cThe big story on Monday is, wow, now we have reviewed about half of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s reported records. Where\u2019s the other half?\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. \u201cThat\u2019s what our discovery is about. Where\u2019s the other half, and how can we find out so they can be retrieved and reviewed and released to the public?\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton says the Obama administration is overclassifying her messages. She says she would like all of the messages she returned to the government released, including presumably the 22 the government deems so \u201ctop secret\u201d that they can\u2019t be shared even in part.\n\nShe and her campaign have questioned the political motivations or conclusions of the inspectors general who have pushed for classification, to Judge Sullivan, whose order of discovery could force her aides to answer tough questions and could eventually lead to her having to return the rest of her emails.\n\nMr. Fitton said the questions Judicial Watch will ask during discovery include how the government supported her email server, why the folks who handled Freedom of Information Act open-records requests weren\u2019t made aware of it, who else used it, what security precautions were taken and who approved it.\n\nA Washington Times analysis of the more than 28,000 messages that have been released show dozens of State Department employees, from the lowest to the highest levels, were aware that Mrs. Clinton was using her unique arrangement to conduct government business.\n\nThe extensive awareness within the department struck Judge Sullivan.\n\n\u201cHow on earth can the court conclude that there\u2019s not, at a minimum, a reasonable suspicion of bad faith regarding the State Department\u2019s response to this FOIA request?\u201d he said at a hearing last week.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s successor, current Secretary of State John F. Kerry, was one of those who emailed with Mrs. Clinton on her secret account during his time in the Senate. He was one of a handful of senators The Times found who were pen pals with Mrs. Clinton.\n\nLast week, Mr. Kerry tried to explain how he missed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behavior and told Congress he simply mailed the address he was given.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it. I didn\u2019t know if she had an account, or what the department gave her at that point in time, or what she was operating with. I had no knowledge,\u201d he told Rep. Darrell E. Issa, a California Republican who prodded him on the matter.\n\nStories about odd email practices have continued to dog Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure. His former administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa P. Jackson, used a secret agency email address to conduct government business, but the EPA says those messages were searched in open-records requests.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter used a private address to conduct some government business in the first months after taking office. He said the practice was wrong and apologized for it.\n\nMr. Gourley, the cybersecurity specialist, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s practice went beyond that. He compared it to a phone, saying everyone has a home phone or personal cellphone, and even top government officials occasionally use it for official business. But in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, she rejected an official government email account and used only her secret account.\n\n\u201cThose kinds of rules were just totally flouted by Clinton,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of people -- from White House officials and titans of the mainstream media to senators, Supreme Court justices and many of her top colleagues at the State Department -- could have known about Hillary Clinton's secret email account, if only they'd cared to look closely enough.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hundreds of people \u2014 from White House officials and titans of the mainstream media to senators, Supreme Court justices and many of her top colleagues at the State Department \u2014 could have known about Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email account, if only they\u2019d cared to look closely enough.", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s email account an open secret in Washington long before scandal broke", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/28/hillary-clintons-email-account-an-open-secret-in-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/28/HillaryClinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/28/HillaryClinton.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s email account an open secret in Washington lon", "description": "Hundreds of people -- from White House officials and titans of the mainstream media to senators, Supreme Court justices and many of her top colleagues at the State Department -- could have known about", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, United States Department Of State, Department Of State, Emmet G   Sullivan, Hillary Clinton"}, "article_summary": "But in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, she rejected an official government email account and used only her secret account.\n\u201cThe big story on Monday is, wow, now we have reviewed about half of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s reported records.\nLast week, Mr. Kerry tried to explain how he missed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behavior and told Congress he simply mailed the address he was given.\nMr. Gourley, the cybersecurity specialist, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s practice went beyond that.\nHe was one of a handful of senators The Times found who were pen pals with Mrs. Clinton."}
