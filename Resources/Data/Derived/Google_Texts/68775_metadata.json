With the critical international climate talks in Paris almost upon us, a look at recent political news suggests we are at an inflection point in climate politics that could have far-reaching implications for the 2016 elections and beyond.\n\nSince June, we have seen Pope Francis\u2019 sweeping encyclical on climate change and speech to a joint session of Congress, a Canadian election that ushered in a new pro-climate government, the death knell of the Keystone Pipeline, and the UK announcing it would phase out its remaining coal power plants in the next 10 years. But the must-read tea leaf came recently from endangered New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte Kelly AyotteSenators to Obama: Make 'timely' call on Afghan troops levels Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return Senate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill MORE, who tried to distance herself from her party and her own record by announcing that she would support limits on carbon pollution under President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan (CPP).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince the rise of the Tea Party in 2010, a nearly unwavering rejection of the scientific consensus around climate has been a persistent part of Republican dogma \u2013 until recently. Ayotte\u2019s attempt to greenwash her record and her party\u2019s reputation is the most recent indication that a reversal of this trend is underway. Vulnerable Republicans in purple states that want to speak to the general electorate in 2016 have little choice but to distance themselves from their climate-denying brethren \u2013 and their anti-climate voting records.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Ayotte\u2019s announcement came exactly three weeks after New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan announced she would challenge the Republican. Nor is it a coincidence that Sen.Mark Kirk Mark KirkFunding boost for TSA sails through committee GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo VA chief 'deeply' regrets if Disney comment offended vets MORE of Illinois, the most vulnerable Republican in the Senate, recently joined Ayotte in voting against the Republican CRA disapproving of the CPP, nor that 11 House Republicans, most from swing districts, recently signed onto a resolution acknowledging that climate change is caused by humans and calling for action to address the problem.\n\nThese endangered Republicans are right to worry. In the last two weeks, two of the most respected polls on energy an environmental issues, the University of Michigan National Survey on Energy and Environment and the University of Texas Energy Poll, both released new data showing a sharp uptick in the belief that climate change is occurring \u2013 returning to its 2008 apex (back when the GOP nominee for president supported cap-and-trade).\n\nMoreover, poll after poll shows that climate action is overwhelmingly popular. A recent poll for the League of Conservation Voters (conducted by a bipartisan team of pollsters) showed that a 60 to 28 percent majority supported the CPP, even after they heard a simulated debate about the issue that included messages from opponents of the plan. And Quinnipiac recently found that two-to-one majorities in Colorado, Virginia, and Iowa backed Pope Francis\u2019 call for climate action.\n\nDemonstrating the increased salience of the issue; a poll Global Strategy Group (GSG) recently conducted for a coalition of climate groups in the presidential battleground states found that if former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonCarson rooting for Trump, Sanders debate Clinton ad slams Trump for calling pregnancy 'an inconvenience' Sanders: Networks calling about Trump debate MORE were to support an ambitious plan to cut carbon pollution by 80 percent by 2050, voters would be more, rather than less, likely to support her candidacy for president by a 19-point margin.\n\nMoving forward, we will only see more of the Ayotte-style greenwashing because two of the most critical groups \u2013 millennials and Hispanics \u2013 in electoral politics are among the staunchest supporters of climate action. It is common knowledge that millennials are among the most pro-climate voting bloc. Indeed, according to a poll from NextGen Climate Action, 41 percent of millennial voters said that climate denial would fully disqualify a candidate for them, regardless of their other positions. Meanwhile, in a poll GSG recently conducted for the Sierra Club and Here Now, 69 percent of Hispanics rated \u201creducing carbon pollution\u201d as an extremely high priority for the country, 14 points higher than the electorate as a whole.\n\nLooking beyond the Clean Power Plan, candidates from both parties would be wise to take note of the growing electoral salience of energy and climate issues. Several recent polls, including our own, show that voters from across the political spectrum will reward leaders who support aggressive goals for moving the country to more renewable energy and energy efficiency at the ballot box.\n\nKelly Ayotte may be one of the first Republicans since 2008 to embrace climate action. But she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nBaumann and Canter are a vice president and senior vice president, respectively, at Global Strategy Group, a public affairs firm.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Endangered Republicans are right to worry.", "description": "Endangered Republicans are right to worry.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Endangered Republicans are right to worry.", "title": "An inflection point in climate politics", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/261219-an-inflection-point-in-climate-politics", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/261219-an-inflection-point-in-climate-politics", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-24T16:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Andrew Bauman and Matt Canter", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Kelly Ayotte, Mark Kirk,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-24T16:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/261219-an-inflection-point-in-climate-politics", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Endangered Republicans are right to worry.", "card": "summary", "title": "An inflection point in climate politics"}, "dcterms.title": "An inflection point in climate politics"}, "article_summary": "With the critical international climate talks in Paris almost upon us, a look at recent political news suggests we are at an inflection point in climate politics that could have far-reaching implications for the 2016 elections and beyond.\nMoving forward, we will only see more of the Ayotte-style greenwashing because two of the most critical groups \u2013 millennials and Hispanics \u2013 in electoral politics are among the staunchest supporters of climate action.\nMoreover, poll after poll shows that climate action is overwhelmingly popular.\nAnd Quinnipiac recently found that two-to-one majorities in Colorado, Virginia, and Iowa backed Pope Francis\u2019 call for climate action.\nKelly Ayotte may be one of the first Republicans since 2008 to embrace climate action."}
