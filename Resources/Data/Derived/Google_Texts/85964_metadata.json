Ted Cruz walked off the stage and left an event hosted by a Christian organization mid-speech after being booed on Wednesday night following comments praising Israel.\n\nThe Texas Republican senator and tea party icon was a keynote speaker at a Washington summit hosted by In Defense of Christians, a group that focuses on persecuted Christian and minority communities in the Middle East.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAccording to several reports and a video taken by EWTN News Nightly and obtained The Daily Caller, Cruz upset many in the crowd by offering strong support for Israel, saying at one point: \u201cChristians have no greater ally than Israel\u201d \u2014 a comment that drew boos.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)\n\nIn a subsequent statement to Breitbart News, Cruz said the crowd showed \u201ca shameful display of bigotry and hatred.\u201d\n\nThe video appears to catch the moments just before Cruz left the stage.\n\n\u201cI will say this: I\u2019m saddened to see that some here, not everyone, are so consumed with hate,\u201d he said at the outset of the video, his comments prompting continued booing and yelling out from some members of the crowd. \u201cI will say this: If you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you. Thank you, and God bless you,\u201d he said, walking off stage to scattered applause and boos.\n\nCruz told Breitbart that he intended to show how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well as other terrorist groups, threatened both Jews and Christians in the region.\n\n\u201cI told the attendees that those who hate Israel also hate America,\u201d he said. \u201cThat those who hate Jews also hate Christians. And that anyone who hates Israel and the Jewish people is not following the teachings of Christ. These statements were met with angry boos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is a corrosive evil, and it reared its ugly head tonight,\u201d he added later.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday evening, IDC President Toufic Baaklini blamed a select \u201cfew politically motivated opportunists\u201d for the incident.\n\n\u201c[A] few politically motivated opportunists chose to divide a room that for more than 48 hours sought unity in opposing the shared threat of genocide,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\n\u201cTonight\u2019s injection of politics when the focus should have been on unity and faith, momentarily played into the hands of a few who do not adhere to IDC\u2019s principles,\u201d Baaklini later added. \u201cThey were made no longer welcome.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent statement released Thursday evening, Baaklini partially blamed Cruz for his comments directed at some in the crowd.\n\n\u201cSen. Cruz abruptly ended his remarks accusing some participants of being \u2018consumed with hate,\u2019\u201d Baaklini said, in reference to the comment the senator made moments before he left the stage. \u201cThat was as unfortunate as the inappropriate reaction by a small number of attendees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Texas Republican offers a strong defense of Israel at an event in Washington.", "title": "Cruz booed, walks off stage", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/ted-cruz-booed-israel-comments-110848.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/09/09/140909_ted_cruz_2_js_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Middle East,Religion,Israel,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Texas Republican offers a strong defense of Israel at an event in Washington.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96d3\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Cruz booed, walks off stageSen.
