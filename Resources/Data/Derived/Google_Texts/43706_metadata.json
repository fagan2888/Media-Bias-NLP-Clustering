It\u2019s made students more aware and eager to help make a difference, she said.\n\n\"They just couldn't fathom the idea of them being, you know, sold for sex trafficking.\"\n\nOther Tucson high schools also will contribute efforts to the fashion show. And though some victims may not have the courage to speak out, Sold No More's Hansen, who is a sex trafficking victim herself, said she wants to give them a voice.\n\n\"What it took for them to walk away was to actually begin to understand that they have value and that they have worth,\" said Hansen.\n\nHansen said they\u2019re working on a campaign soon to get more people on board so more students can hear Sold No More's message.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
