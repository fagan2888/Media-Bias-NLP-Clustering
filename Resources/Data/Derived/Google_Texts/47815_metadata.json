Boulder police suggested Friday, however, that an RTD bus may have been involved in a hit-and-run that left Dial with what police called \"obvious trauma\", making it \"very apparent that he had been hit by a car.\"\n\nBoulder police spokeswoman Kim Kobel said Friday that RTD buses were being examined for damage and any evidence of a crash. Kobel added that RTD buses are being investigated because the body was located at the bus exit on the building's south end, but she said police haven't ruled out other possibilities.\n\nNo arrests have been made, and there were no witnesses to the death, which was first reported just before 9 p.m. Thursday by a passerby waiting at the transit center, near 14th Street and Canyon Boulevard.\n\nRTD spokesman Scott Reed has said that his office is working with police, but will not be able to provide security footage because none of the transit center's cameras are aimed at the area in which Dial died. Kobel said police will work with businesses in the area to see if any of their cameras caught the incident.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2014-11-08T17:55:31-0700", "modificationDate": "2014-11-08T18:19:57-0700", "byline": "By Alex BurnessCamera", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "description": "The man who died Thursday night after a hit-and-run in a crosswalk outside the downtown RTD station has been identified by the county coroner's office as Charles Marcus Dial, 62, of Boulder.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26896202:view"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The man who died Thursday night after a hit-and-run in a crosswalk outside the downtown RTD station has been identified by the county coroner's office as Charles Marcus Dial, 62, of Boulder.", "title": "Coroner ID's man killed in hit-and-run at Boulder RTD station"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The man who died Thursday night after a hit-and-run in a crosswalk outside the downtown RTD station has been identified by the county coroner's office as Charles Marcus Dial, 62, of Boulder.", "title": "Coroner ID's man killed in hit-and-run at Boulder RTD station", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-08T17:55:31-0700", "endDate": "2015-11-08T17:55:31-0700", "sailthru.title": "Coroner ID's man killed in hit-and-run at Boulder RTD station", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2014-11-08T17:56:23-0700", "news_keywords": "Camera: Top Stories, Camera: Top Stories news, Boulder Colorado Camera: Top Stories news, Boulder Colorado news, Camera: Top Stories Boulder news, Camera: Top Stories Colorado news, US Camera: Top Stories news, world Camera: Top Stories news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd267\"", "article_summary": "Boulder police spokeswoman Kim Kobel said Friday that RTD buses were being examined for damage and any evidence of a crash.\nThe man who died Thursday night after a hit-and-run in a crosswalk outside the downtown RTD station has been identified by the county coroner's office as Charles Marcus Dial, 62, of Boulder.\nKobel added that RTD buses are being investigated because the body was located at the bus exit on the building's south end, but she said police haven't ruled out other possibilities.\nKobel said police will work with businesses in the area to see if any of their cameras caught the incident.\nAn autopsy has been completed, and the cause and manner of death are pending investigation."}
