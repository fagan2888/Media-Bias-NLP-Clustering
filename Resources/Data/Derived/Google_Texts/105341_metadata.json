(Photo: Submitted image)\n\nThroughout the ages, humans have pondered the essence of life: the deep statements that define humanity and what it\u2019s like to truly be alive.\n\nResidents of the Delmarva region will have an opportunity to do just that on Nov. 15, when six-time Grammy winner TobyMac is scheduled to make a stop in Salisbury on his \u201cThis is Not a Test\u201d tour.\n\n\u201cThere are no practice runs in life; this is the real thing,\u201d TobyMac said. \u201cTake every day and every moment and use it as best as you can.\u201d\n\nTobyMac is a renowned Christian-contemporary artist that has been in the industry for nearly two decades. His success has taken him to places all around the world, but he says he loves playing in smaller towns and cities like Salisbury.\n\n\u201cIn the big city you get lost in the shuffle, but sometimes a smaller city gets people that might not normally come out to a show just because something is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI love that and I think there\u2019s a lot of appreciation toward you and you feel welcomed.\u201d\n\nHis recent album also titled \u201cThis is Not a Test\u201d features singles \u201cBeyond Me\u201d and \u201cFeel It.\u201d The majority of his performance in Salisbury will feature songs from the new album, but he will also play songs from his previous albums.\n\nSix-time Grammy winner TobyMac is scheduled to make a stop in Salisbury on his \u201cThis is Not a Test\u201d tour. (Photo: Getty File Image)\n\nIn 2012 he released \u201cEye On It,\u201d an album that contains songs like \u201cMe Without You,\u201d \u201cSteal My Show\u201d and \u201cSpeak Life.\u201d\n\nTobyMac says his favorite song to play right now is \u201cFeel It\u201d because it takes on the likeness of a funk jam and it turns the whole place into a big party.\n\n\u201cI want people to come and be entertained, I want them to laugh and to see a spectacle that gives them spiritual food for thought,\u201d he said.\n\nTobyMac won\u2019t be alone in his performance. Christian artists Britt Nicole, Colton Dixon and Hollyn will also take the stage at the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center.\n\nWhile he hopes to entertain the audiences that come to his show, he said nothing makes him more happy than walking out onto the stage and performing live.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk onto the stage, it\u2019s the moment that everything comes together,\u201d TobyMac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like my music is some self-indulgent thing, it\u2019s to serve. I hope my music is art that serves human kind; when I get to perform live, I see the people I hope my music is serving.\u201d\n\nIf You Go\n\nWhat: TobyMac's \u201cThis is Not a Test\u201d Tour\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Nov. 15\n\nWhere: Wicomico Youth & Civic Center, Salisbury\n\nCost: $75 Artist Circle; $36 Level 1; $28 Level 2; $27 Group Level 2; 10+, $18 Level 2\n\nOnline: http://www.wicomicociviccenter.org/events-listings/tobymac-this-is-not-a-test-tour\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/11/08/tobymac-performs-salisbury/75413188/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Christian-contemporary artist TobyMac is set to play at the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury.", "og": {"site_name": "Delmarva Daily Times", "description": "The Christian-contemporary artist TobyMac is set to play at the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury.", "title": "'This is Not a Test': TobyMac to rock Salisbury", "url": "http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/11/08/tobymac-performs-salisbury/75413188/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delmarvanow.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Christian-contemporary artist TobyMac is set to play at the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury.", "title": "'This is Not a Test': TobyMac to rock Salisbury", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5902e48e91686c4c450cfdc10059ef5f34e24f6c/c=0-0-2848-2848&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/08/Salisbury/B9319594192Z.1_20151108113429_000_G02CFSM6U.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "site": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858745131", "fb": {"app_id": 179822335370394}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "TobyMac, Salisbury TobyMac, Wicomico Youth & Civic Center, things to do in salisbury november 15"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2031\"", "article_summary": "Six-time Grammy winner TobyMac is scheduled to make a stop in Salisbury on his \u201cThis is Not a Test\u201d tour.\nTobyMac will play the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center on Nov. 15.\nChristian artists Britt Nicole, Colton Dixon and Hollyn will also take the stage at the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center.\nResidents of the Delmarva region will have an opportunity to do just that on Nov. 15, when six-time Grammy winner TobyMac is scheduled to make a stop in Salisbury on his \u201cThis is Not a Test\u201d tour.\n\u201cWhen you walk onto the stage, it\u2019s the moment that everything comes together,\u201d TobyMac said."}
