"Fans loved his performance," an onlooker tells Us Weekly. "Bobby did his New Edition classics and busted out into some of his signature dance moves, but had to stop several times during the 30-minute set."

When the singer stopped, he apologized to the crowd for the interruptions, saying, "Sorry, I'm in a different zone tonight. Y'all got me sweating and dancing. I'm so happy to be here tonight."

Bobby didn't mention his daughter, who is currently battling for her life. Bobbi Kristina was placed in hospice care on June 24, and her father rushed to be by her side just one day later. Bobby's New Edition bandmate Johnny Gill opened up to Entertainment Tonight about his friend's mental state following the development in his daughter's condition.

"State of mind? In a nutshell, not good. Not good," Gill said of Brown. "We just had a conversation yesterday. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy."
