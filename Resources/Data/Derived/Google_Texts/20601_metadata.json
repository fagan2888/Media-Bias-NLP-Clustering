(AP) - Back in 1961 the U.S. Air Force, without any attempt at secrecy or stealth, hauled nine long-range ballistic missiles by truck from California to Eastern Washington.\n\nThe trucks carried 82-foot-long Atlas E missiles that ended up parked inside heavily reinforced underground sites. Each missile was later armed with a 4-megaton nuclear bomb, ready to be launched.\n\nEastern Washington communities - including Spokane, Deer Park and Davenport - greeted the weapons caravans like a victory parade. That patriotic fervor, historians say, was part of the Cold War-era mindset fueled by nuclear dread and national pride.\n\nMore than 50 years later, those nine underground Atlas sites are largely ignored except by curiosity-seekers and military history buffs.\n\nMost people don\u2019t even know the buried bunkers exist, said Mark Kramer, whose family owns one of the 20-acre sites. It sits amid parched desert about a dozen miles from the family\u2019s home near the community of Lamona in Lincoln County.\n\nThe Kramers store farm equipment inside the facility, which was active from 1961 to 1965 as part of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 567th Missile Squadron, assigned to Fairchild Air Force Base.\n\nConstructed at the time for more than $4 million each, the silos were designed to withstand a nearby nuclear bomb blast and deliver a hydrogen bomb to a distant target.\n\nThe nine sites relied on crews of five airmen working 24-hour shifts, with three redundant communications systems connecting them to the Strategic Air Command. Instead of storing missiles vertically, the nine Atlas E locations held a single missile in a horizontal room, called the coffin.\n\nToday, all but one of the nine sites associated with Fairchild are privately owned.\n\nAt the Kramer family silo, at the end of a sloping concrete ramp, a 16-inch-thick metal door measures 15 feet wide and 17 feet tall. It stays closed except when Kramer drives the family\u2019s trucks or combines into or out of the main bunker or coffin, which extends nearly 28 feet below ground.\n\nExcept for the ramp, the silo is nearly all underground, with only the large iron lid that covered the coffin visible above the surface.\n\nThe Kramers have owned the site since 1969, when Mark\u2019s father, Bob Kramer, bought the abandoned site for $2,500.\n\nA nearby second, smaller door, also made of heavy steel, was the entry door for the site\u2019s crew members.\n\nThe door\u2019s padlocks are pocked with bullet holes from attempts to get inside.\n\n\u201cIf people would just ask us, we\u2019d show them ourselves what\u2019s here,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cMaybe we should have a once-a-year open house, so people don\u2019t keep trying to break in.\u201d\n\nAltogether, the Defense Department built 27 such Atlas E sites. Those missile crews only went on full alert one time, during the 13 days of the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nMost sites used for storage\n\nIn 1965, the Air Force decommissioned the Atlas E sites and replaced them with more modern missiles.\n\nThe original components - thousands of tons of wiring, plus steel, copper and iron fixtures in the sites - were hauled off long ago and sold for salvage.\n\nTheir current owners mostly use the silos for weather-resistant storage or as a secure location for personal property.\n\nThe exception is the best-preserved of the nine sites, near Reardan. That fully equipped site is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. That federal agency, which took over the role of the defunct Bureau of Mines, uses it for storage and occasional research, a CDC spokeswoman said.\n\nTwo of the other eight sites are used by farmers to hold equipment. Another site, in Lincoln County, has been converted into the owner\u2019s residence.\n\nBecause the sites are below ground and have thick concrete walls and floors, they still have some value for potential buyers, said Ed Peden, a Kansas-based operator of the website MissileBases.com, which lists abandoned missile locations for sale nationwide.\n\n\u201cSome people decide they\u2019ll grow mushrooms or other crops in them\u201d because they\u2019re often dark and dank, Peden said.\n\nOne Atlas E base in Kansas housed the country\u2019s largest illegal LSD lab at the turn of the century, Peden said.\n\nAlso looking to buy sites are \u201cpreppers,\u201d people who want off-the-grid storage for food and supplies so that they\u2019re prepared to survive widespread economic upheaval, he said.\n\nPeden has helped sell about 55 former missile sites, including the Newman Lake Atlas E site, which sold in 1999.\n\nPeden and his family bought a former Atlas site in eastern Kansas in 1983, paying $40,000. It took him 10 years to convince his wife they should move into the site, he said.\n\nWhile he acknowledges he\u2019s involved in promoting sales of such locations, Peden said they will continue attracting more interest over time. \u201cThese are some of strongest structures built,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think of them as the counterpart of European castles. To me, the silos are 20th century castles,\u201d he said.\n\nSix sites in Lincoln County\n\nMuch of the history of the region\u2019s Air Force missile sites has been collected by the Spokane-based Honor Point Military and Aerospace Museum. That group has compiled a large volume of photos and documents tracking the region\u2019s role in preparing for a war no one wanted to see start.\n\nThose records have been studied by the Kramers and others who have purchased some of the other Atlas silos.\n\nIn addition to the Kramers\u2019 site, Lincoln County has five other former Atlas locations. One near Wilbur is used by a farmer to grow seedlings, said Dick Mellor, former Air Force missile crew member.\n\nAnother site, near tiny Egypt, Washington, sits empty, said Mellor, who was a ballistic missile analyst - a general troubleshooter.\n\nSpokane has two sites. One in Deer Park, a short distance from the Deer Park Airport, is used by Northwest Energetic Services, a company that provides explosives for construction projects. The other, near Newman Lake, was purchased in 1999 by San Francisco resident John Oleg Konings. Konings has considered turning it into a museum or some other commercial use, but it currently sits vacant.\n\nAbout 20 miles from the Kramers\u2019 site is the Atlas No. 6 site, between Harrington and U.S. Highway 2. Its owner is Peter B. Davenport, the 66-year-old director of the National UFO Reporting Center. The site once belonged to long-haul truck driver Ralph Benson, who was convicted in 2004 of murdering a state auditor and dismembering the body.\n\nDavenport bought the site from Benson\u2019s sons in 2006. Since then he\u2019s used it to hold records related to his UFO research.\n\nDavenport said he gets frequent requests for tours, which tells him interest in that period of U.S. military history must be high. \u201cMost people tend to romanticize the ownership of an ICBM site, without recognizing just how big they are and how much maintenance they require,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nIdaho\u2019s lone Atlas site is in Kootenai County between Rockford and Worley and owned by a local family who use it to store farm equipment and supplies.\n\nThe one government-owned site at Reardan is the best preserved. After the other eight were closed and sold, the Reardan facility was leased to the Bureau of Mines\u2019 Spokane office. The missile facility is listed with the National Register of Historic Places and is also listed on Washington Heritage Register.\n\nRumors have swirled around the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health site, with some skeptics saying they find it strange a mining safety agency would locate its research in a site that isn\u2019t very deep. The Kramers say they\u2019ve heard speculation the Reardan site is a repository for biological samples being studied by the CDC.\n\nMichael Jenkins, an official with the agency\u2019s Spokane office, said those rumors are inaccurate and unfounded.\n\n15 minutes to launch\n\nMellor, who\u2019s now 81, said he doesn\u2019t go out often to visit the Atlas sites, where he once served as a technician and review officer, testing other members of the missile squadron. Once a week, every crew had to lift the rocket from its horizontal frame and get it ready for a possible launch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary going into one of them now,\u201d Mellor said. \u201cBecause, really, we were 15 minutes away from letting one of those missiles go. That would have changed the world as we know it.\u201d\n\nIn 1962, as the Cuban Missile Crisis started, Mellor was a member of the 567th \u201cstandboard\u201d team, which made regular visits to the nine sites, testing crews and making sure the missiles functioned normally.\n\nAs the crisis deepened, all U.S. missile sites were placed on full alert. But Mellor said only the nine local Atlas missiles were retargeted to Cuba.\n\n\u201cThe other missiles, in Kansas or Missouri, were too near Cuba; they\u2019d overshoot Cuba. So they had our nine Atlases all aimed at Cuba,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the order came, the crew started a 15-minute countdown. The 42-ton steel coffin lid would slide over and the missile would be lifted to upright position, followed by loading kerosene and liquid oxygen into the fuel tanks.\n\nIf the countdown reached the \u201ccommit\u201d point, at 59 seconds and counting, there was no way to stop the launch, he added.\n\n\u201cWe listened to reports from SAC (Strategic Air Command) throughout the whole thing, and we had to stay underground the 13 days,\u201d Mellor recalls.\n\nHe worried about his wife and three young sons who were on the airbase but would have been evacuated if war broke out, he said.\n\nIf the order to launch had come down, Mellor said it would have happened.\n\n\u201cOh yes, without a doubt. Without a doubt. That was our job.\u201d\n\nThe day the crisis was over, Mellor and the other crew teams left the sites.\n\n\u201cI got the hell out of there and took a shower,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Back in 1961 the U.S. Air Force, without any attempt at secrecy or stealth, hauled nine long-range ballistic missiles by truck from California to Eastern Washington.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Back in 1961 the U.S. Air Force, without any attempt at secrecy or stealth, hauled nine long-range ballistic missiles by truck from California to Eastern Washington.", "title": "9 missile silos near Spokane held nuclear bombs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/22/9-missile-silos-near-spokane-held-nuclear-bombs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/22/a54b043b54da7225600f6a706700c66a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/22/a54b043b54da7225600f6a706700c66a.jpg", "description": "Back in 1961 the U.S. Air Force, without any attempt at secrecy or stealth, hauled nine long-range ballistic missiles by truck from California to Eastern Washington.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "9 missile silos near Spokane held nuclear bombs"}, "Author": "TOM SOWA", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca994\"", "article_summary": "More than 50 years later, those nine underground Atlas sites are largely ignored except by curiosity-seekers and military history buffs.\nAnother site, near tiny Egypt, Washington, sits empty, said Mellor, who was a ballistic missile analyst - a general troubleshooter.\nAs the crisis deepened, all U.S. missile sites were placed on full alert.\nPeden has helped sell about 55 former missile sites, including the Newman Lake Atlas E site, which sold in 1999.\nThe exception is the best-preserved of the nine sites, near Reardan."}
