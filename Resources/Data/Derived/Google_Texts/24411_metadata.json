And only two \u2014 Louie Nunn and Ernie Fletcher \u2014 in my lifetime.\n\nFor those who believe in a strong two-party system, the election of Matt Bevin is a welcome event. It\u2019s an opportunity to bring new blood into government. And it offers Democrats a chance to re-examine their party.\n\nOf the last two Republicans to lead this state, Louie Nunn of Glasgow was by far the better. Nunn\u2019s administration was highlighted by passage and implementation of one of the nation\u2019s best community mental health programs. Under his leadership, the University of Louisville was integrated into the state\u2019s system of public higher education.\n\nErnie Fletcher, who was elected in 2003, was less successful. His term was derailed by a grand jury investigation of his administration\u2019s alleged misuse of the state merit system. A likeable guy, Fletcher never recovered after he and several staff members were indicted.\n\nIn modern times, it has been difficult for an attorney general to move to the Governor\u2019s Mansion. A number have tried \u2014 including Fred Cowan, Ben Chandler and Jack Conway. Each was effective as the state\u2019s chief lawyer. And so was Steve Beshear, who managed to become lieutenant governor but later was defeated in his first bid to become governor back 1987 \u2014 by a maverick Democrat named Wallace Wilkinson.\n\nIn many ways, Matt Bevin reminds me of Wallace Wilkinson. He, too, was a self-made businessman and outsider who seemed to come out of nowhere to win.\n\nLike the rest of the nation, Kentuckians seem unsettled about life. After emerging from a crippling recession, the state\u2019s prospects seem upbeat. But ongoing fears about the coal industry, health care and gay rights persist. And the electorate was clearly looking for an outside perspective.\n\nBeshear gained national praise for his leadership in implementing the Affordable Care Act and expanding Medicaid. Bevin was elected as a big-time critic of Obamacare. No doubt about it: He has a different worldview from the incumbent.\n\nPart of that worldview is no doubt informed by his family. It will be fun to watch a family of 13 move into the center of Kentucky politics. The photo of Bevin hoisting his young son into the air was endearing.\n\nAnd with the election of Jenean Hampton as lieutenant governor, the party of Lincoln has at long last provided the first African-American to win statewide office in Kentucky. That heritage, I hope, will inform and guide Matt Bevin as he approaches his formidable new job.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For those who believe in a strong two-party system, the election of Matt Bevin is an opportunity to bring new blood into government.
