Rand Paul is confronted by defections from an unexpected quarter: the die-hard idealists whose energy powered his father\u2019s campaigns.\n\nThat network of committed supporters was expected to convey to Paul, the natural successor to Ron Paul\u2019s libertarian movement, providing him with a plug-and-play ground organization in the make-or-break early voting states. But instead of embracing the Kentucky senator, many of those grass-roots activists are turning their backs on him, disillusioned by the younger Paul\u2019s concessions to mainstream politics.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne of the most prominent defectors is Drew Ivers, chairman of Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 Iowa campaign, who says he will not endorse Rand Paul for president. On Tuesday, three members of Iowa\u2019s Ron Paul-aligned Liberty movement \u2014 state Sen. Jason Shultz and former Iowa Republican Party central committee members Chad Steenhoek and Joel Kurtinitis \u2014 announced the same, adding that they will support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ivers said he does not plan to endorse any candidate.\n\n\u201cSen. Rand Paul continues to have tremendous support from the vast majority of the liberty movement,\u201d said Sergio Gor, communications director for the Paul campaign.\n\nShultz had endorsed Ron Paul in 2012 and Kurtinitis served as his Iowa regional director. Steenhoek worked for Newt Gingrich\u2019s Iowa campaign but was sympathetic to Ron Paul, who endorsed Steenhoek\u2019s subsequent bid to serve on the state central committee.\n\nIvers, who had dinner with Rand Paul in August, said the Kentucky senator has abandoned many of the stances that made Ivers loyal to his father.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s moderating on most of them, not taking a real clear stance on a number of them,\u201d said Ivers. \u201cThe strategy of sending a blended message is one that has risk.\u201d\n\nThat was never an issue for Ron Paul, whose uncompromising ways and willingness to operate on the margins relegated him to the sidelines of national politics. Even at the height of his national influence and popularity in 2012, the Texas congressman proved unable to win the popular vote in a single state and never seriously contended for the GOP nomination in several tries.\n\nRand Paul, by contrast, won statewide office in his first try and has established himself as a viable presidential candidate with a talent for taking the movement\u2019s liberty message to a broader audience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the prospect of Senator Paul running for president and look forward to his visit to Iowa on April 10. If, as expected, he launches his presidential campaign I will be proud to stand with Rand, who I believe stands head and shoulders above the other prospects in terms of electability and commitment to our cherished principles of freedom and prosperity,\u201d said David Fischer, a former Iowa GOP co-chairman who served as Iowa co-chair of Ron Paul\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to hundreds of people who supported Ron Paul and the vast majority of them are ready to stand with Rand.\u201d\n\nThe stylistic distinctions between father and son became clear at the 2012 GOP convention. Ron Paul was denied a speaking slot in large part because he refused to meet the pre-conditions \u2014 which included an endorsement of Mitt Romney. But the Kentucky senator endorsed the nominee despite some misgivings \u2014 and got a prime speaking slot.\n\nThe defections in Iowa, where Ron Paul finished third in the 2012 caucuses, are notable since it was one of his best-organized states that year. Rand Paul\u2019s challenge is to find a balance that enables him to retain much of his father\u2019s strong political network in the make-or-break early states while broadening his appeal to a larger audience.\n\nAn internal poll conducted last month by Liberty Iowa of Ron Paul\u2019s delegates to the 2012 Iowa Republican Convention \u2014 the vanguard of his Hawkeye State loyalists \u2014 found that Rand Paul is still the preferred choice by a wide margin. But there are signs of erosion: less than 70 percent are leaning Rand Paul\u2019s way in 2016, according to a person with knowledge of the polling who was not authorized to discuss it. Cruz was the group\u2019s second-favorite candidate, with support in the high single digits, followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nFor Kurtinitis, who initially planned on supporting Paul, the turning point came during Cruz\u2019s September 2013 filibuster of a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open. \u201cWhen Rand was filibustering, we saw Mike Lee and Ted Cruz standing there. When the shoe was on the other foot and Cruz was the one giving the filibuster, I and others in the liberty movement looked around and asked, \u2018Where\u2019s Rand?\u2019\u201d said Kurtinitis. \u201cIt kind of added insult to injury to learn that he planned to be at a fundraiser for [Iowa Gov.] Terry Branstad that day.\u201d\n\nBranstad has clashed with Iowa\u2019s Liberty movement, whose members at the time controlled the state Republican Party. Kurtinitis added that his wife, Kelsey, whom he met when she was a volunteer on Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 caucus campaign, is also supporting Cruz.\n\nAt the same time, Paul\u2019s Iowa effort is beset by lingering resentment from the state party establishment. Loyalists of Paul\u2019s father, led by A.J. Spiker, took control of the party\u2019s central committee in 2012 and alienated top officeholders and grass-roots activists from other wings of the party until they were pushed out last year. Spiker now works for RandPAC.\n\n\u201cObviously the legacy from the Ron Paul people who ran the Republican Party of Iowa is not good statewide. They failed to raise money. They basically ran it as a background Ron Paul for president committee. They excluded a vast majority of Republican activists statewide and were genuinely not respected or liked,\u201d said Andy Cable, a Republican activist from socially conservative northwest Iowa \u2014 a seat of opposition to libertarian control of the party. \u201cA lot of us would like to judge Rand Paul on his own merits but, unfortunately \u2026 when he\u2019s hiring some of the same people that his father brought, it\u2019s a question of whether the apple has fallen very far from the tree.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, with its more moderate brand of conservatism, Paul faces similar challenges. New Hampshire Rep. Bill O\u2019Brien, a former state House speaker, said he\u2019s seen a number of Ron Paul supporters gravitating toward Cruz. Aaron Day, a leader of the Free State movement, which seeks to enact libertarian principles in New Hampshire, says members of the movement are showing markedly less enthusiasm for Rand Paul than they showed for his father.\n\n\u201cOne of the big concerns is whether or not he\u2019s left his liberty base and is he moving towards the center in reality or just for the purpose of optics,\u201d he said. Day cited Paul\u2019s endorsement of moderate Republican Scott Brown\u2019s failed New Hampshire Senate bid and his lack of support for tea party activist Andrew Hemingway\u2019s gubernatorial primary bid against the eventual nominee Walt Havenstein as two episodes that turned off Free Staters.\n\nBut several key members of Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 New Hampshire team plan either to join his son\u2019s campaign or support it from the sidelines. One of those supporters, former state Sen. Jim Forsythe, the chairman of Ron Paul\u2019s New Hampshire campaign, dismissed the importance of disaffected Ron Paul backers. \u201cI think where you see that is some of the more fringe element libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the people like me who\u2019ve run for office and understand the realities, I think those kind of people are going to be mainly on board.\u201d\n\nForsythe said he got a glimpse of Paul\u2019s potential to transcend his father\u2019s small-but-hardcore base of support when he attended the 2012 Republican National Convention as a delegate. \u201cThe traditional Republicans weren\u2019t clapping for Ron Paul. The Ron Paul supporters weren\u2019t getting up for McCain. But when Rand Paul got up everyone was clapping,\u201d he said.\n\nBob Goodman, senior adviser to the 2012 New Hampshire effort, has assisted Rand Paul\u2019s recent trips to the state and expects to be involved with his primary campaign. State Rep. Tammy Simmons, chair of the Manchester Republicans and veteran of the last two Ron Paul New Hampshire campaigns, said she also plans to work on behalf of Rand Paul.\n\nMeanwhile, the hiring of Mike Biundo, a respected New Hampshire operative who served as Rick Santorum\u2019s national campaign manager, as a strategist for Rand Paul\u2019s PAC is expected to help Paul broaden his appeal in the state.\n\n\u201cHe gets Rand Paul a hearing among a broader audience than simply people who were favorably inclined towards his father do,\u201d said former state GOP chairman Fergus Cullen.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Many grassroots activists are disillusioned by Rand Paul\u2019s concessions to mainstream politics.", "title": "Ron Paul supporters bolt Rand camp", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ron-paul-leave-rand-paul-camp-116439.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/26/lede_150326_rand_paul_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,2016 Elections,Ron Paul,Rand Paul,Rand Paul 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Many grassroots activists are disillusioned by Rand Paul\u2019s concessions to mainstream politics.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd33\"", "article_summary": "Rand Paul continues to have tremendous support from the vast majority of the liberty movement,\u201d said Sergio Gor, communications director for the Paul campaign.\nOne of those supporters, former state Sen.
