His rocketing poll numbers in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire led to countless stories heralding a Sanders surge \u2014 but the story is as much about the issues as it is about the man.\n\nEven Republican candidates have taken notice of Sanders\u2019 rise. Ahead of a recent stop in Madison, Wisconsin, likely 2016 contender and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker welcomed Sanders to the state with a series of tweets attacking the democratic socialist once dismissed as too fringe. Walker may not have taken too fondly to Sanders attracting a record 10,000 people in his home state.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 campaign, surely more so than that of any of the Republican candidates, seems to be gaining traction more for the ideas he espouses than because of a cult of personality.\n\nGranted, many supporters have pointed to Sanders\u2019 straightforward manner and willingness to call out bad actors as refreshingly appealing, but unlike with Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Chris Christie, it isn\u2019t just a brash style that\u2019s being sold. Sanders makes a direct effort to address many of the issues that have arisen since the Hope & Change campaign of 2008 and it appears as though he is tapping into very real and long-simmering sentiments in the Democratic base.\n\nMore than a protest vote against Hillary Clinton, as some have suggested, Sanders\u2019 support appears to be support for issues Clinton\u2019s yet to fully address. Here are some of the ways that Sanders is gaining support by leading on issues or movements that other candidates ignore:\n\nVA Scandal\n\nSanders was chairman of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee when Democrats last controlled the chamber, and following the VA scandal, Sanders worked with Republicans in the House to pass legislation that expands health care access for veterans and makes it easier to fire underperforming officials.\n\nHis record and work on veterans\u2019 affairs issues has earned Sanders top awards from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the Military Officers Association of America, and now it appears as though that recognition is translating to support for his campaign.\n\nThe Boston Globe writes that Sanders\u2019 \u201csurge is partly fueled by veterans,\u201d citing \u201centire Reddit threads [that] are dedicated to how veterans can best pitch Sanders to other veterans\u201d and \u201ca Facebook page promoting Sanders to veterans.\u201d As the Globe notes, in the early voting state of South Carolina veterans make up about 11 percent of the electorate.\n\nOccupy Wall Street\n\nThe short-lived global protest movement suddenly shifted the national debate in the aftermath of the recession from talk of austerity to a focus on growing income inequality by introducing terms like the 1 Percent to national prominence in time for the 2012 campaign. But the Occupy Wall Street movement achieved no great legislative win, and after the encampments were broken down many of the grievances remained unacknowledged, let alone addressed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Bernie Sanders, it's leadership on the issues -- not a cult of personality -- propelling his long-shot bid", "title": "The real reasons Bernie Sanders is transforming the election: Here\u2019s why he galvanizes the left", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With Bernie Sanders, it's leadership on the issues -- not a cult of personality -- propelling his long-shot bid", "title": "The real reasons Bernie Sanders is transforming the election: Here\u2019s why he galvanizes the left", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/03/the_real_reasons_bernie_sanders_is_transforming_the_election_heres_why_he_galvanizes_the_left/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie_sanders7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Bernie Sanders, it's leadership on the issues -- not a cult of personality -- propelling his long-shot bid", "title": "The real reasons Bernie Sanders is transforming the election: Here\u2019s why he galvanizes the left", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie_sanders7.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Bernie Sanders, Campaign Finance, Editor's Picks, Obamacare, Occupy Wall Street, single payer, Student Debt, The Left, VA scandal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbad1\"", "article_summary": "More than a protest vote against Hillary Clinton, as some have suggested, Sanders\u2019 support appears to be support for issues Clinton\u2019s yet to fully address.\nEven Republican candidates have taken notice of Sanders\u2019 rise.\nBut Sanders\u2019 campaign, surely more so than that of any of the Republican candidates, seems to be gaining traction more for the ideas he espouses than because of a cult of personality.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Bernie Sanders, Campaign Finance, Editor's Picks, Obamacare, Occupy Wall Street, single payer, Student Debt, The Left, VA scandal, News, Politics NewsCNN dubbed this \u201cthe summer of Sanders\u201d as media outlets finally picked up on the large crowds Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has attracted during campaign stops.\nWalker may not have taken too fondly to Sanders attracting a record 10,000 people in his home state."}
