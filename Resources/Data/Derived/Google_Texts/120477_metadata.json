If that happens, and you decide to get the hell out of there, might I suggest moving to Cape Breton Island?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statement adds: \"Don\u2019t wait until Election Day to find somewhere else to live!\n\n\u201cStart now \u2013 that way, on Election Day, you just hop on a bus to start your new life in Cape Breton, where women can get abortions, Muslim people can roam freely and the only \u2018walls\u2019 are holding up the roofs of our extremely affordable houses.\u201d\n\nThe website then explained its rationale for seeking potential American residents disgusted by the prospect of a Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are an island about the same size as the Hawaiian Big Island on the east coast of Canada,\u201d its statement reads. \"We always rank high on travel magazine lists of beautiful islands, but we are experiencing a bit of a population problem at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe need people [and] we need you! This is not a joke! See for yourself \u2013 you belong here on Cape Breton Island, where healthcare is free, you know your neighbors and they look out for you and nobody has a hand gun.\u201d\n\nCape Breton Island also details some of its unique features as a North Atlantic tourist destination.\n\n\u201cIn Cape Breton, we value diversity,\u201d its tourism site reads. \"Here, you can hear a number of other languages, like French and Mi\u2019kmaq, even Gaelic! But everybody speaks English, too, just like you.\n\n\u201cYes, this is Canada, but Cape Breton isn\u2019t frozen all year round! Our summers are delightful with highs in the 80-degree range. Winters here are very similar to the Northeast USA.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"Don\u2019t wait until Election Day to find somewhere else to live!\" Nova Scotian island tells Americans.", "description": "\"Don\u2019t wait until Election Day to find somewhere else to live!\" Nova Scotian island tells Americans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"Don\u2019t wait until Election Day to find somewhere else to live!\" Nova Scotian island tells Americans.", "title": "Canadian island to Americans: Move here if Trump wins", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/269721-canadian-island-to-americans-move-here-if-trump-wins", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/trumptourism.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-17T14:35:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-17T14:35-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/269721-canadian-island-to-americans-move-here-if-trump-wins", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-17T14:16-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mark Hensch", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cape Breton Island, Tourism, Republicans, GOP,Donald Trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-17T14:16:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-17T14:35:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/269721-canadian-island-to-americans-move-here-if-trump-wins", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"Don\u2019t wait until Election Day to find somewhere else to live!\" Nova Scotian island tells Americans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Canadian island to Americans: Move here if Trump wins"}, "dcterms.title": "Canadian island to Americans: Move here if Trump wins"}, "article_summary": "A Canadian island is urging Americans to make it their new home should Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald TrumpAustralian opposition leader: Trump's views are \"barking mad\" Rubio signals support for Trump Trump to release veterans fundraising totals on Memorial Day MORE win the White House in November.\nIf that happens, and you decide to get the hell out of there, might I suggest moving to Cape Breton Island?\"\n\u201cHi Americans!\u201d a statement on a tourism website for Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, reads.\n\u201cWe are an island about the same size as the Hawaiian Big Island on the east coast of Canada,\u201d its statement reads.\nSee for yourself \u2013 you belong here on Cape Breton Island, where healthcare is free, you know your neighbors and they look out for you and nobody has a hand gun.\u201dCape Breton Island also details some of its unique features as a North Atlantic tourist destination."}
