Story highlights Paul unveils his impression of the GOP presidential opponent

Nashua, New Hampshire (CNN) It's come to this. How much time has Rand Paul spent practicing his Donald Trump impression?

At a Wednesday night town hall campaign stop, Paul unveiled his impression of the GOP presidential opponent while slamming him for buying access to politicians and taking Democratic positions on issues such as Obamacare and bank bailouts.

"We have now people up there who say such profound things as, 'You're stupid, you're fired, you're a pig, you look terrible, you only have half a brain,' and then when you respond with an argument it's like "You're stupid,'" Paul said.

"My favorite is, 'You know the reason I tell women they're ugly is I'm so good-looking, everybody knows I'm good-looking, right?'" Paul continued, with laughter from the crowd. "Another one is, "You know I must be smart, I'm rich."
