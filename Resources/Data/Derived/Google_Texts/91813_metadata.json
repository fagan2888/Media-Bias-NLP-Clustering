He did express hope for the situation, saying, \u201cI do believe they will take action and set up a proper protocol.\u201d\n\nThe Glendale hospital, which was established in 1905, hosts 515 beds, is an acute-care facility, and was designated by the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health as a facility to admit and treat mentally ill patients who were brought in on involuntary detention holds, according to the Times.\n\nFeuer vowed in January of this year, nearly a decade after news of this abuse first surfaced, that he would be cracking down on the illegal acts. He said, \u201cPatient dumping is inhumane and intolerable to me. I do have it in my mind to send a message to other hospitals that this won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mental 'Patient Dumping' on Skid Row Prompts L.A.
