To be honest, I get it mostly for the sports section as it\u2019s something to read while I\u2019m working out. But I do glance at the other sections, even if to just read headlines.\n\nA couple of years ago I noticed how the columnist, Charles Krauthammer, seemed to be the only opinion writer who stuck 100% to his/her political agenda. There are democratic and republican leaning writers of all sorts, but I can tell you at least one time they\u2019ve said something nice about the \u201cother side.\u201d But Krauthammer is the exception. We killed Bin Laden \u2013 no credit to the President. The stock market is doing amazing \u2013 no credit to the President. Wall St. Reform?? It\u2019s all bad to Chuck. Basically there hasn\u2019t been one instance that he\u2019s said something nice about President Obama. I don\u2019t even recall him giving a backhanded compliment.\n\nIt\u2019s become a lame sort of game I play to see how long he can keep his streak going. I get that it\u2019s his job to take as hard of an angle as he can and he doesn\u2019t have to be objective. He also doesn\u2019t have to be credible, but I don\u2019t think he cares about that. You can be against Obamacare in the real world, but still recognize that it has some good points. But that\u2019s not Chuck\u2019s world. His most recent column was to pick out every bad thing former defense secretary William Gates said in his memoir and not offer one positive point of view of the President.\n\nOf course this type of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d happens on Fox News, MSNBC and many other places, but you\u2019d think that newspapers would have some higher standard, even when it comes to syndicated columnists. Instead, the behavior of the Tribune and others is to get a few from the right, a few from the left and call it a day.\n\nI\u2019m bringing this up in a law blog because it reminds me of a lot of miserable lawyers that I know. They went down a particular career path that makes them good money, but they are miserable in what they do every day. That said, they don\u2019t have the ability to do anything else without a huge pay cut. So they keep at it even though their job makes them miserable people. I love what I do legally, but I can\u2019t say that if I started to hate it I\u2019d have the guts to cut my income dramatically. Sounds easy to say, but when you have a wife, kids, mortgage, desire to travel, etc., changing careers takes guts.\n\nI\u2019m both disgusted and fascinated by Krauthammer. I do wonder how authentic he is as compared to playing a character that supports his gravy train. But I\u2019ll bet a nickel that he didn\u2019t get in to journalism with the thought that he could just write hacky pieces every week to make a living, no more than someone who went to law school with thoughts of changing the world envisioned themselves defending insurance companies all day.\n\nOn another note, here are some great bad job photos I came across.\n\nAdvertisement:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chicagonow.com/chicagos-real-law-blog/2014/02/does-charles-krauthammer-have-the-worst-job-in-the-world/", "image": "http://www.chicagonow.com/chicagos-real-law-blog/files/2014/01/image001.gif", "type": "article", "description": "I am one of the seven remaining people in the world who still reads a hard copy of the newspaper.
