It required every state to expand Medicaid coverage to all Americans making up to 133 percent FPL, or slightly under $15,000 per year for an individual. And it offered government subsidies to people making up to 399 percent FPL to help them buy insurance in Obamacare\u2019s statewide insurance marketplaces. The law didn\u2019t extend any government subsidies to the poorest Americans living below the poverty level, reasoning that these people would be eligible for an expanded Medicaid pool and therefore wouldn\u2019t need them.\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruled the Medicaid expansion optional last summer, leaving it up to the states to decide whether or not to participate in it. That means if poor Americans live in states that refuse to expand Medicaid, they won\u2019t be able to take advantage of the expanded public program or receive subsidies to buy insurance on the Obamacare marketplace.\n\nMost GOP-led states home to lawmakers hostile to health reform have refused to go along with the optional expansion, despite the fact that the federal government will pay for the vast majority of it. Numerous studies have shown that states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid are losing out on billions of dollars in federal funding and denying health benefits to about two-thirds of the poor Americans who were originally expected to gain Medicaid coverage under the law. Nonetheless, 21 states have explicitly refused to expand their programs while five still remain undecided:\n\nCREDIT: The Commonwealth Fund\n\nThe expansion map highlights the reality that many of the states forgoing Medicaid expansion have some of the highest rates of uninsurance and poverty in the country. Texas, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia are all among the top ten most uninsured states in America. In addition, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Idaho, North Carolina, and Alaska have uninsurance rates higher than the U.S. national average of 21 percent. About one in five Americans residing in these states are living in poverty.\n\nWhile the Commonwealth study authors note that some states are likely to eventually give in and accept the Medicaid expansion, they suggest congressional action to assist those who fall into the unintended coverage gap in the meantime. \u201cCongress could step in and provide a solution by passing legislation that would amend the law to make all adults with incomes below 100 percent of poverty, who are not eligible for Medicaid, eligible for subsidized private plans offered through the marketplaces. This would ensure that all Americans have access to the law\u2019s sweeping new reforms when they take effect in January,\u201d the researchers wrote.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Americans who live below the poverty line make less than $11,200 per year.
