Burwell, a new challenge to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, could now result in a split decision, potentially allowing disparate lower court rulings to stand.\n\nAt stake is whether employees of religiously affiliated organizations such as universities, hospitals and charities can be stripped of their rights to contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cIn round one against the contraceptive mandate, the Hobby Lobby decision carved out a major accommodation for for-profit corporations,\u201d said Elizabeth Sepper, associate professor of law and an expert on health law.\n\n\u201cIn round two, Zubik wants to deliver a knockout punch to the mandate.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, the nonprofits say that having to request a religious accommodation itself substantially burdens their free exercise,\u201d said Sepper, who co-authored an amicus brief on behalf of a group of church-state scholars on the Establishment Clause implications of the case.\n\n\u201cAll federal law could have to survive the highest level of constitutional review in order to apply to religious objectors \u2014 whether they are individuals of disfavored faiths or craft stores aligned with powerful majority religions.\u201d Elizabeth Sepper\n\n\u201cThe nonprofits argue that sending in a letter to the government to avail themselves of the accommodation is too great a regulatory burden,\u201d she said. \u201cThe unprecedented and off-the-wall nature of this argument led seven out of eight appellate courts to soundly reject the nonprofits\u2019 claims.\u201d\n\nIf the Supreme Court concludes that a religious accommodation is itself a substantial burden on religion, \u201cevery regulation, or exemption therefrom, would also substantially burden religion,\u201d Sepper said. \u201cAll federal law could have to survive the highest level of constitutional review in order to apply to religious objectors \u2014 whether they are individuals of disfavored faiths or craft stores aligned with powerful majority religions.\u201d\n\nGranting the exemption would impose the cost of accommodating an employer\u2019s religious exercise on employees who do not share its beliefs, Sepper said.\n\nImposing such burdens, Sepper said, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from shifting the costs of accommodating a religion from those who practice it to those who do not.\n\n\u201cThe denial of contraceptive coverage would mean higher spending, greater health risks, and the perpetuation of disadvantage in both employment and education for the women who work for or study with petitioners,\u201d Sepper and her colleagues wrote in the amicus brief. \u201cThis would impede the ability of each beneficiary to make decisions about contraception based on her own religious and moral beliefs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#a51417", "application-name": "Washington University in St. Louis", "og": {"site_name": "The Source", "description": "Zubik v.
