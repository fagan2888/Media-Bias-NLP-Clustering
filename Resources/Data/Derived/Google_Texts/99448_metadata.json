The mystery unfolded over two seasons of bizarre, disturbing, laugh-out-loud funny episodes, influencing shows to this day with its otherworldly tone, hypnotic imagery and jazzy soundtrack.\n\nNearly 25 years and countless imitators later, co-creator David Lynch and Mark Frost\u2019s dark soap opera \u2014 and the Lynch-directed prequel film, \u201cTwin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\u201d \u2014 is getting its high-def due with a new Blu-ray boxed set (released July 29) and theatrical marathons across the country, including in Littleton.\n\n\u201cDavid Lynch actually willed it to be this way,\u201d said Keith Garcia, creative manager for the Alamo Drafthouse Littleton. \u201cHis decree was that the only way to truly experience \u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 was to get as close to a movie theater setting as possible \u2014 complete blackness, really great audio, a perfect picture \u2014 and just go with it.\u201d\n\nFans of the show and its spinoff movie can do just that on Aug. 16 when the Drafthouse screens the entire series (yep, all 30 hour-long episodes) in a continuous marathon, followed on Aug. 20 by a 35-millimeter screening of the notably darker, harsher 1992 curio \u201cFire Walk With Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will probably begin questioning their involvement in the 24-hour marathon once we get deep into the second season,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBut this show came out before we had binge watching, so I have a feeling there will still be some people sticking around. Maybe that weird, cliff\u2019s edge of sleep that you start feeling around Season 2 is the mysterious tool you need to actually figure out what\u2019s going on in the series.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is dripping with trademark Lynchian weirdness, which comes as much from subconscious dream logic as police procedural tropes and the school of absurdist humor.\n\nThe brilliant casting also helped, with Lynch muse Kyle MacLachlan playing FBI special agent Dale Cooper, a young Lara Flynn Boyle as moody high schooler Donna Heyward, Ray Wise as creepy dad/possessed killer Leland Palmer and, of course, Sheryl Lee as the troubled (to put it lightly) homecoming queen Laura Palmer.\n\n\u201cSheryl Lee as Laura Palmer became this cultural obsession,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cAnd what a tough role. You had to cast someone that people would care about, not knowing anything about her outside of being the poor girl who got murdered. I remember in Season 1 when (Lee) came back to play Laura\u2019s cousin Maddie and being so excited to see her back on the screen.\u201d\n\nSo was Lee.\n\n\u201cI was so grateful to (Lynch) for doing that, because had I just stayed away, it would have had a very different outcome,\u201d said Lee, who grew up in Boulder and was in Loveland last week as a featured artist at the Arise Music Festival. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to bring you back on the show,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I\u2019m dead!\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019 \u201c\n\nLee went on to play Palmer in \u201cFire Walk With Me,\u201d which followed the character on her final day.\n\n\u201cBecause Laura Palmer was dead \u2026 there was always this strange sense that people were seeing a ghost when they would see me,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd the feeling of the show did create a lot of fear or discomfort, even if people loved it, even if they were huge fans.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of those these days, and to please the cult of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d the Drafthouse will offer cherry pie, \u201cdamn fine coffee\u201d and doughnuts at its screenings \u2014 just as any patron of the Double R Diner would expect.\n\n\u201cThe marathon is actually free, but for $30 you can reserve a seat and you\u2019ll get that money back to spend on food and beverage,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo we\u2019re challenging fans, new and old, to come and at least sit through the first season. After that, the crazed delirium will probably start to take over.\u201d\n\n\u201cTWIN PEAKS\u201d 24-HOUR MARATHON.
