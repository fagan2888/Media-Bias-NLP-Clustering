Updated at 9:36 p.m.: Revised to include comment from Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins:

Related Ebola in Dallas

A patient with Ebola-like symptoms was seen at the Veterans Affairs emergency room Saturday afternoon, hospital spokesman Froy Garza spokesperson said in a prepared statement.

Garza said the patient was considered “extremely low risk” for Ebola. Nonetheless, the hospital immediately activated the response protocol for handling threat of serious infection. Those measures includes wearing protective equipment and placing the patient in an isolation room.

“VA North Texas consulted with local, state and federal counterparts including the Centers for Disease Control,” the statement said.

The patient, who was not identified, will be transferred to a regional Ebola assessment facility as a precaution, the hospital said.

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who helped lead the response to the 2014 Ebola crisis in Dallas, said he was told that the patient does not have the virus. He said privacy laws prevented him from commenting further.
