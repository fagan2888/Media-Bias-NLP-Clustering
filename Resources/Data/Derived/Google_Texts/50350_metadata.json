Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nation\u2019s second-biggest cigarette maker.\n\nThe judgment, returned on Friday night, was the largest in Florida history in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by a single plaintiff, according to Ryan Julison, a spokesman for the woman\u2019s lawyer, Chris Chestnut.\n\nCynthia Robinson of Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola sued the cigarette maker in 2008 over the death of her husband, Michael Johnson.\n\nJohnson, a hotel shuttle bus driver who died of lung cancer in 1996 at age 36, smoked one to three packs a day for more 20 years, starting at age 13, Chestnut said.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t quit. He was smoking the day he died,\u201d the lawyer told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nAfter a four-week trial and 11 hours of jury deliberations, the jury returned a verdict granting the widow $7.3 million and the couple\u2019s son $9.6 million in compensatory damages.\n\nThe same jury deliberated for another seven hours before deciding to award Robinson the additional sum of $23.6 billion in punitive damages, according to the verdict forms.\n\nLawyers for the tobacco company, a unit of Reynolds American Inc. whose brands include Camel cigarettes, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nBut J. Jeffery Raborn, vice president and assistant general counsel for R.J. Reynolds, said in a statement quoted by The New York Times that the company planned to challenge \u201cthis runaway verdict.\u201d Such industry appeals are often successful.\n\nChestnut countered, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a runaway jury, it was a courageous one.\u201d\n\nRobinson\u2019s lawsuit originally was part of a large class-action litigation known as the \u201cEngle case,\u201d filed in 1994 against tobacco companies.\n\nA jury in that case returned a verdict in 2000 in favor of the plaintiffs awarding $145 billion in punitive damages, which at the time was the largest such judgment in U.S. history.\n\nThat award, however, was tossed out in 2006 by the Florida Supreme Court, which decertified the class, agreeing with a lower court that the group was too disparate and each smoker smoked for different reasons.\n\nBut the court said the plaintiffs could file lawsuits individually. Robinson was one of them.\n\nThe Florida high court also let stand the jury\u2019s findings that cigarettes are defective, dangerous and cause disease, and that Big Tobacco was negligent, meaning those issues did not have to be re-litigated in future lawsuits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 A Florida jury has awarded the widow of a chain smoker who died of lung cancer punitive damages of more than $23 billion in her lawsuit against the R.J.
