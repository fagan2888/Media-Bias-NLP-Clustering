Administrators at his most recent employer, Complex Care Hospital at Ridgelake, did not say if they knew of the other allegations, according to the Herald-Tribune.\n\nMeantime, in a separate case, a caretaker in Royal Palm Beach is accused of stealing $850,000 from a 77-year-old man with dementia, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The arrest came after a tip from a neighbor, who grew suspicious when Isabelle Schillo, 57, started driving a new Porsche Panamera instead of her late model Oldsmobile. Investigators say the man\u2019s home was in \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions.
