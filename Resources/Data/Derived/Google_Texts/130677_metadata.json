The bill is expected to save about $16.6 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 251 to 166. The Senate is expected to take up the bill later this week.\n\nCompared with earlier, more contentious votes on the farm bill, Wednesday\u2019s vote was largely bipartisan. Many Democrats who had opposed it because of cuts to the food stamp program supported it on Wednesday. A number of Republicans, including many who wanted deeper cuts to the food stamps, also voted for passage.\n\nThe House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and the majority leader, Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, had endorsed the bill and urged Republicans to support it, even though they said they would have liked to see more changes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is legislation we can all be proud of because it fulfills the expectations the American people have of us,\u201d said Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, who led House efforts to pass the farm bill.\n\nHouse leaders are now expected to turn their attention to other issues, including the Affordable Care Act, ahead of the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nIt is unclear where the Obama administration stands on the new farm bill. Mr. Obama had signaled his opposition to any bill that cut food stamps and expanded crop insurance.\n\nThe new farm bill, which had been mired in partisan gridlock, makes fundamental changes to both nutrition and farm programs. It cuts the food stamp program by $8 billion, and about 850,000 households will lose about $90 in monthly benefits under the change.\n\nAnti-hunger groups called the food stamp cuts draconian. Feeding America, a coalition of food banks across the county, said the change would result in 34 lost meals per month for the affected households.\n\nThe bill does provide a $200 million increase in financing to food banks, though many said the money might not be enough to offset the expected surge in demand for food.\n\nFarm programs were not spared from the cuts in the new bill. The most significant change to farm programs is the elimination of a subsidy known as direct payments. These payments, about $5 billion a year, are paid to farmers whether or not they grow crops, and the issue had become politically toxic over the last several years as farm income has risen to record levels.\n\nThe new bill cuts this subsidy and adds some of the money to the government-subsidized crop insurance. The government pays 62 percent of premiums for the $9 billion-a-year insurance program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawmakers said the elimination of the direct payments ensured that only those who actually farm would receive subsidies and only when affected by a disaster such as drought. Budget watchdog groups called it a bait-and-switch, and said it replaced one subsidy with an even more generous one.\n\n\u201cThis bill is so bad, they literally stripped reform from the title,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, based in Washington.\n\nAlthough most agriculture groups generally supported the new farm bill, several were left disappointed.\n\nThe seafood industry expressed disappointment that a contentious seafood inspection program at the Agriculture Department remained in the bill, despite bipartisan efforts to repeal it. Meat and poultry industry groups also expressed their concern with the bill because it did not include language to delay a labeling program that requires retailers to list the country of origin of meat. The industry said the labeling was too costly.\n\nThe bill does not address the changes to the international food aid program sought by the Obama administration, but it does give an increase of about $80 million to the United States Agency for International Development to buy food closer to disaster areas, rather than shipping food from the United States.\n\nAnti-hunger groups, including the World Food Program, support the proposal. Several environmental groups, such as Ducks Unlimited, also expressed their support for the new farm bill because it includes new soil and water conservation measures.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140129114007, "twitter": {"description": "The measure calls for cuts in food stamps, affecting more than 800,000 households, and in some subsidies for farmers.", "title": "House Approves Farm Bill, Ending a 2-Year Impasse", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/politics/house-approves-farm-bill-ending-2-year-impasse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002677228"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "nixonron", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/politics/house-approves-farm-bill-ending-2-year-impasse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002677228", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/politics/house-approves-farm-bill-ending-2-year-impasse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "House Approves Farm Bill, Ending a 2-Year Impasse", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 29, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Farm Bill (US),Food Stamps,Crop Controls and Subsidies,House of Representatives", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ron Nixon", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By RON NIXON", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The measure calls for cuts in food stamps, affecting more than 800,000 households, and in some subsidies for farmers.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The measure calls for cuts in food stamps, affecting more than 800,000 households, and in some subsidies for farmers.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 29, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/ron_nixon/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-01-31", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published": "2014-01-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "30farm", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140131134627, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/politics/house-approves-farm-bill-ending-2-year-impasse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The measure calls for cuts in food stamps, affecting more than 800,000 households, and in some subsidies for farmers.", "title": "House Approves Farm Bill, Ending a 2-Year Impasse"}, "pdate": 20140129, "des": "Crop Controls and Subsidies", "articleid": 100000002677228, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "House Approves Farm Bill, Ending a 2-Year Impasse", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The new farm bill, which had been mired in partisan gridlock, makes fundamental changes to both nutrition and farm programs.\nCompared with earlier, more contentious votes on the farm bill, Wednesday\u2019s vote was largely bipartisan.\nIt is unclear where the Obama administration stands on the new farm bill.\nThe new bill cuts this subsidy and adds some of the money to the government-subsidized crop insurance.\nThe most significant change to farm programs is the elimination of a subsidy known as direct payments."}
