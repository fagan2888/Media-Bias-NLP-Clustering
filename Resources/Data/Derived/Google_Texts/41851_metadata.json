But members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Defense Secretary-designate Ashton Carter came close to promising the obliteration of the jihadists operating in Iraq and Syria.\n\nCarter, during his Senate confirmation hearing today, said it wouldn\u2019t be enough to simply defeat the terrorists and take back massive chunks of Iraq and Syria. Instead, he said, it must be a \u201clasting\u201d victory.\n\nRelated: The Three Hidden Messages Behind ISIS\u2019s Bloody Rampages\n\n\u201cI say lasting because it\u2019s important that when they get defeated, they stay defeated,\u201d said Carter, a former deputy defense secretary and trained physicist nominated by President Obama to succeed Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense. \u201cThat is why it\u2019s important we have those on the ground who will ensure that they stay defeated once defeated.\u201d\n\nCarter, to be clear, was not talking about putting more U.S. military boots on the ground to battle ISIS, as many Republicans and some Democrats say is necessary. Instead, he wants to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between U.S. and allied airstrikes against ISIS and the efforts to bolster Iraqi government and Kurdish forces in Iraq, as well as Syrian rebels friendly to the U.S.\n\nOutrage over a shocking ISIS video yesterday apparently showing the burning of the captured Jordanian fighter was on the minds of many lawmakers who questioned Carter.\n\n\u201cI hope this heinous crime helps us put in place what thus far has been lacking \u2013 a comprehensive strategy to achieve the goal to degrade and destroy ISIL,\u201d said committee chairman John McCain (R-AZ), using an alternate acronym for ISIS. \u201cWe still do not have a viable strategy to counter ISIL\u2026 If uou are not winning in war, you are losing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Would Violate Budget Control Act with $34B More for Defense\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-RI) warned that \u201cISIL\u2019s depraved and violent campaign in Iraq and Syria to establish a religious caliphate threatens to erase borders, destabilize regions, and create a breeding ground of fighters willing to return to the West and attack United States\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nReed told Carter that the Pentagon must offer leadership as the U.S. and allied forces battle ISIS, \u201cwhile being careful to ensure the U.S. doesn\u2019t end up owning the conflict in Syria and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMcCain said he and other leaders in Congress reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Jordan to provide key military equipment and resources during a meeting on Tuesday with Jordan King Abdullah. The king then rushed home to deal with the crisis surrounding the murder of the captured fighter pilot, Moaz al-Kasasbeh.\n\nAbdullah, seeking military equipment to assist in his country\u2019s fight against ISIS, signaled he was prepared to administer retribution against ISIS \u2013 shortly before Jordan executed two ISIS and al-Qaeda-linked terrorists before dawn on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: The Tide Is Turning Against ISIS in Iraq\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cOn the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u201d that ISIS is going to regret what it did. \u201cKing Abdullah is not Barack Obama,\u201d he said.\n\nHunter said Abdullah referenced the Eastwood movie Unforgiven and said there will be retribution. The king, not originally scheduled to meet with Obama, was invited after the video surfaced.\n\n\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WVA), recalling the meeting with the king, said today, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I heard yesterday about all the red tape [necessary] to get something they need on the front line \u2026 They just need the weapons to do the job.\u201d\n\nAsked if he considered ISIS the top threat in the Middle East \u2013 and thus deserving of the maximum focus of the DOD and the Obama administration \u2013 Carter replied that he viewed Iran as an equal threat to security in the Middle East and throughout the world.\n\nRelated: War Against ISIS Will Explode Our Nation\u2019s Debt\n\nCarter, a Pentagon pro, didn\u2019t directly contradict GOP criticism of Obama\u2019s strategy against ISIS. He noted that military and political situations in Iraq and Syria are quite different, requiring different approaches in propping up the Iraqi government and building up support in war-torn Syria.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a strategy to me, but maybe we can flesh out your goals,\u201d McCain said. \u201cSounds like a series of goals to me.\u201d\n\nHagel reportedly was frequently excluded from White House deliberations on troop strength and strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq, while two previous defense secretaries \u2013 Leon Panetta and Robert Gates \u2013 complained in their books about Obama and his advisers micro-managing the DOD.\n\n\u201cIf I am confirmed as secretary of defense, I will be a stickler for chain of command,\u201d Carter said, an apparent allusion to complaints about White House national security staff meddling in Pentagon affairs.\n\nCarter\u2019s nomination is expected to sail through the Senate.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "They may not have vowed Clint Eastwood-style", "title": "ISIS Outrage Dominates Ash Carter\u2019s Senate Hearing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/04/ISIS-Outrage-Dominates-Ash-Carter-s-Senate-Hearing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-defense-carter_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/04/ISIS-Outrage-Dominates-Ash-Carter-s-Senate-Hearing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-defense-carter_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "They may not have vowed Clint Eastwood-style", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc939\"", "article_summary": "Related: War Against ISIS Will Explode Our Nation\u2019s DebtCarter, a Pentagon pro, didn\u2019t directly contradict GOP criticism of Obama\u2019s strategy against ISIS.\nCarter, during his Senate confirmation hearing today, said it wouldn\u2019t be enough to simply defeat the terrorists and take back massive chunks of Iraq and Syria.\nThey may not have vowed Clint Eastwood-style retribution against ISIS for the burning death of a Jordanian military pilot \u2013 as King Abdullah did in Washington on Tuesday.\n\u201cKing Abdullah is not Barack Obama,\u201d he said.\nBut members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Defense Secretary-designate Ashton Carter came close to promising the obliteration of the jihadists operating in Iraq and Syria."}
