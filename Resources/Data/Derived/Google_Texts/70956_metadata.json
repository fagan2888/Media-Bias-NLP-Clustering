But it's the less noticed field efforts that could have greater impact and help reshape the Republican Party heading into the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\nBuilding on the community-based approach President Barack Obama used successfully in 2008 and 2012, it now has a political footprint unmatched among GOP-affiliated operations and is racking up legislative victories.\n\n\n\nThe group scuttled efforts to raise taxes to build a downtown campus for the well-regarded zoo in Columbus, Ohio, and derailed plans in Florida's Legislature to subsidize improvements to the Miami Dolphins' football stadium. It helped fend off a recall effort against Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., and pushed pro-business workplace laws in Michigan and Indiana.\n\n\n\nIt didn't shy away from going after traditional allies, as was the case when Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., briefly considered expanding Medicaid, a core component of Obama's health care law. Americans for Prosperity mobilized supporters, the Republican-led Legislature quickly rejected the idea and Scott dropped his proposal.\n\n\n\nTim Phillips, the group's president, said Americans for Prosperity had helped usher in \"a once-in-a-generation renaissance for economic freedom policies,\" and was poised to keep financial issues prominent in 2016.\n\n\n\n\"For the first time, we have the infrastructure on our side to sustain these policy battles,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThis fall, Americans for Prosperity is campaigning against a sales tax increase in South Carolina's Greenville County, as well as trying to elect conservatives to office. Unlike what it has done for most of this year, the group now is engaging in explicitly political messages for the campaign's final weeks.\n\n\n\nPotential presidential contenders have taken notice.\n\n\n\nGOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas spoke at the group's annual summit in August. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., headlined the Koch brothers' seminar for major conservative donors this year.\n\n\n\nAmericans for Prosperity sprung up in 2004 but has gained heft during the past two election cycles. Its budget has grown from less than $3 million in 2004 to more than $130 million for the 2012 election cycle.\n\n\n\nIn many places, the group has more trained and paid operatives than the traditional political parties have. Nowhere is this more obvious than Florida, where the group has 10 offices, its single largest field operation.\n\n\n\nIn the group's Orlando outpost, Phillips recently met with 15 volunteers who were wearing bright green T-shirts with Americans for Prosperity's torch logo.\n\n\n\nUsing iPads, they had spent the morning asking voters to take an issues survey that included the federal health law, government spending and taxes. The information helps them develop messages and test which arguments resonate with voters.\n\n\n\n\"That doesn't mean always knocking on the door and telling people 'Obamacare' is bad,\" Phillips told the volunteers. \"That's important, but the goal is to bring some good and build relationships over the long term.\"\n\n\n\nThat strategy has become central to the Koch network of organizations. This year, they are trying to help Republicans pick up the six seats they need to win control of the Senate \u2014 Americans for Prosperity spent $25 million on TV ads alone \u2014 but it is not what drives the organization.\n\n\n\n\"People say our biggest goal is a Republican Senate. Not true,\" Phillips said. \"Florida is our biggest imprint.\"\n\n\n\nAs the Nov. 4 vote nears, it's all about voter-to-voter contacts, relationships that could pay dividends in 2016 and beyond.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "afp, koch, brothers, political, network", "pubdate": "2014-10-11T08:54:44", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The flagship organization of the political network backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch is ditching campaign ads and building an army of conservative activists to shape the final days of the midterm elections.", "title": "Americans for Prosperity Builds Political Machine", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/afp-koch-brothers-political/2014/10/11/id/600095/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/afp-koch-brothers-political/2014/10/11/id/600095/", "description": "The flagship organization of the political network backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch is ditching campaign ads and building an army of conservative activists to shape the final days of the midterm elections.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Americans for Prosperity Builds Political Machine"}, "epoch": 1413017684, "keywords": "afp, koch, brothers, political, network", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-10-11T08:54:44"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/afp-koch-brothers-political/2014/10/11/id/600095/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The flagship organization of the political network backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch is ditching campaign ads and building an army of conservative activists to shape the final days of the midterm elections."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf09e\"", "article_summary": "Americans for Prosperity has become one of the conservative movement's best organized outside groups and has a political footprint unmatched among GOP-affiliated operations.\nAmericans for Prosperity mobilized supporters, the Republican-led Legislature quickly rejected the idea and Scott dropped his proposal.\nAmericans for Prosperity sprung up in 2004 but has gained heft during the past two election cycles.\nThis fall, Americans for Prosperity is campaigning against a sales tax increase in South Carolina's Greenville County, as well as trying to elect conservatives to office.\nAmericans for Prosperity has sent more than 500 workers into 35 states in the past few years to shape how voters see issues such as health care and the economy."}
