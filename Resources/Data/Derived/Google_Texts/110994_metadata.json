(AP) - Illinois has some of the least-restrictive laws regulating all-terrain vehicles, and enthusiasts and consumer advocates are divided about how to make the popular sport safer.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reports (http://trib.in/1LJVZId ) that July and August are the deadliest months for ATV accidents. In the first three weeks of this month, there were 43 ATV deaths nationally, including a 12-year-old girl from Chicago\u2019s southwest suburbs.\n\nIllinois has no restrictions on age, use of helmets, number of passengers, or requirements for safety certification, according to the Specialty Vehicle Institute of American, a trade association.\n\n\u201cIt unfortunately makes people in Illinois some of the least protected,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director for the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.\n\nSafety advocates want stronger laws, such as minimum-age and helmet requirements. Others say implementing tougher rules doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be followed, particularly in an activity that often occurs off the beaten path.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think laws are the answer, because people will kick over fences and ride where they want to,\u201d said Justin Vandenberg, 34, of Rockford, who\u2019s been on ATVs since childhood.\n\nATVs appeared in 1967 when American Honda dealers sought a new product after motorcycle sales slowed in winter. Farmers soon learned they could complete many tasks on a fraction of the fuel a tractor uses. And, of course, recreational use grew.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of freeing,\u201d said Trevor Glenn of Oregon, a 17-year-old who\u2019s spent nearly a decade riding ATVs and wears protective gear. \u201cYou can get away from everything else and have fun.\u201d\n\nMany manufacturers provide safe-usage guidelines on riding, passengers and avoiding paved roadways - where the bulk of fatal accidents occur. The Specialty Vehicle Institute has offered education centers and safety courses since 1988, along with its \u201cGolden Rules\u201d for riding, including wearing a helmet and adult supervision of riders under 16.\n\nThe Consumer Federation of America and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that no one under 16 ride an ATV.\n\nRider groups say more laws could lead to more problems - added work for police departments or more accidents as scofflaws flee the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stop an activity just by making it illegal,\u201d said Peter Horst of the American Motorcyclist Association, which represents ATV riders and racers. \u201cYou drive it underground.\u201d\n\nMike Campabello, president of the Chicagoland ATV Riding club, said a better answer might be adding trail systems or ATV parks where users would have to follow safety rules. \u201cThe riding areas in Illinois have dwindled,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rocky Glen OHV park in Rockford offers 20 miles of trails and three tracks, said its general manager, Michelle D. Strand. It typically receives Illinois Department of Natural Resources grant money to provide upkeep. ATV riders flood the park on weekends, some of whom camp overnight or bring grills and lawn chairs for a day outdoors.\n\nRiding rules include wearing a helmet, goggles, gloves and over-the-ankle boots, and no passengers on vehicles designed only for one.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly watching people and making sure people are being safe,\u201d Strand said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illinois has some of the least-restrictive laws regulating all-terrain vehicles, and enthusiasts and consumer advocates are divided about how to make the popular sport safer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/25/consumer-groups-question-illinois-laws-on-atv-safe/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Illinois has some of the least-restrictive laws regulating all-terrain vehicles, and enthusiasts and consumer advocates are divided about how to make the popular sport safer.", "title": "Consumer groups questions lax Illinois laws on ATV safety"}, "twitter": {"description": "Illinois has some of the least-restrictive laws regulating all-terrain vehicles, and enthusiasts and consumer advocates are divided about how to make the popular sport safer.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Consumer groups questions lax Illinois laws on ATV safety"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a17\"", "article_summary": "ATV riders flood the park on weekends, some of whom camp overnight or bring grills and lawn chairs for a day outdoors.\n\u201cYou drive it underground.\u201dMike Campabello, president of the Chicagoland ATV Riding club, said a better answer might be adding trail systems or ATV parks where users would have to follow safety rules.\nRiding rules include wearing a helmet, goggles, gloves and over-the-ankle boots, and no passengers on vehicles designed only for one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stop an activity just by making it illegal,\u201d said Peter Horst of the American Motorcyclist Association, which represents ATV riders and racers.\n\u201cYou can get away from everything else and have fun.\u201dMany manufacturers provide safe-usage guidelines on riding, passengers and avoiding paved roadways - where the bulk of fatal accidents occur."}
