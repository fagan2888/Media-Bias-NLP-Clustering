It\u2019s damaging our teachers. It\u2019s disrespectful. It can be demeaning.\u201d\n\nEducators say the frustration stems from the sheer number of tests administered \u2014 but also from a new factor: the added time it takes for schools to work through each test because they don\u2019t have enough computers.\n\nState law requires that most state tests this year be given on computers. So until the district acquires a computer for each student, up to six years from now, students will have to take turns using the available computers. That stretches some testing periods from a few days with paper exams to several weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major change in what we do in school,\u201d said Sam Whitten, Hillsborough\u2019s director of assessment and accountability. \u201cWe\u2019re caught in that transition window right now.\u201d\n\nHillsborough\u2019s tentative testing calendar for this school year spans three pages and includes state-mandated assessments as well as national exams and district tests used to measure students\u2019 progress in subjects including reading, math, art and physical education.\n\nSome are given only to students in certain grades, to takers of certain classes or to specific groups such as those still learning English and those with disabilities.\n\nSome tests, such as the Florida Assessments for Instruction in Reading, are repeated throughout the year. Others, such as Advanced Placement tests, are optional.\n\nHillsborough this year will give 17 kinds of state- mandated tests, including the new Florida Standards Assessment in reading and math and the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test science exam.\n\nThere are also end-of-course exams in every single subject, as well as diagnostic tests throughout the year that are used solely to help classroom teachers gauge what their students know.\n\nThe issue carries wide- ranging effects. Students\u2019 test scores figure into their teachers\u2019 evaluations and help determine whether they keep their jobs and how much they are paid. Test scores also count toward state-issued school grades. And, most importantly, they play a major role in student advancement.\n\n\u201cIn every school on almost any given day, someone is pulling some kids out of class to test something,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThat means the teacher isn\u2019t teaching all the kids.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe debate over standardized testing has reached a crescendo this fall as new education standards take full effect in schools across the state and new tests replace most parts of the high-stakes Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test in the spring.\n\nWhen the Lee County School Board voted to opt out of all state tests last month, then reversed its decision several days later because it feared the consequences, it drew national attention and sparked a statewide discussion over testing in Florida.\n\nAdditionally, Gov. Rick Scott, who is seeking re-election this year, has called for an investigation into all Florida standardized tests.\n\nAn Alachua County kindergarten teacher made headlines this month when she refused to give her students the FAIR test, a state reading comprehension assessment, because of the amount of time it takes out of the school day to administer.\n\nFlorida Education Commissioner Pam Stewart suspended the test for the rest of the school year for kindergarten through second-grade students because of problems teachers were experiencing with new technology used to administer it.\n\nStill, testing critics saw it as a victory.\n\nThe Florida Education Association passed a resolution last week calling for an \u201cimmediate end to the misuse and abuse of testing.\u201d And the Florida PTA has recommended that the state education department stop giving school grades until schools can get a handle on the new test that will be given in 2015 \u2014 the Florida Standards Assessment.\n\nThis most consequential of tests is still being developed and will be aligned to the state\u2019s new Common Core-based standards.\n\nStephanie Baxter-Jenkins, executive director of the Hillsborough Classroom Teachers Association, agrees that the district needs to look into all assessments, especially the ones that the school district controls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just gone completely overboard,\u201d Baxter-Jenkins said. \u201cThe amount of instructional time lost to tests is excessive. Teachers want to teach. We\u2019re spending all our time proctoring tests. What we have to do is try to balance as best we can so we know where kids are but that we aren\u2019t taking away time.\u201d\n\nWhitten expects technology to improve over the next several years. Hillsborough aims to have one computer for every single student by the year 2020. This year, it has one computer for every four students.\n\nFor now, groups of students shift in and out of computer labs to take tests rather than taking them all at the same time using paper and pencil.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s school disruption,\u201d Whitten said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking away from instructional time.\u201d\n\nDuring the last four days of the school year, at least 400 different end-of-course tests are given on paper to all of the county\u2019s high schoolers and middle schoolers.\n\nBut the state\u2019s four computer-based end-of-course exams, in algebra, geometry, biology and history, take up to four weeks, Whitten said.\n\nThe district\u2019s diagnostic tests, Whitten said, in subjects such as math, writing and science, don\u2019t figure in to students\u2019 grades, teacher evaluations or the state-issued school grades. They\u2019ve been given for years, and she sees value in them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not high stakes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply to support teacher instruction, to give them feedback on how the kids are doing so far.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nDeputy Superintendent Jeff Eakins said district staff will explore each of the assessments to see whether the information they provide could be gleaned elsewhere, maybe through robust district data systems that already track student progress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a prudent thing to do right now,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAssessment has its purpose, but we have to make sure every assessment we use does something positive.\u201d\n\nIn addition to eliminating some tests established by the school district, board member Olson wants to lobby legislators to consider doing away with some exams required by the state.\n\n\u201cI know there will be pushback,\u201d said Olson, a longtime board member who is finishing up her last term. \u201cEvery test that\u2019s on the list, somebody thought it was a good idea.\u201d\n\nOther board members backed up the idea to reduce testing where possible.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that if we were to eliminate some of the tests that the district has control over, the irony would be that our students would perform better on state-mandated tests,\u201d board member Stacy White said during a school board meeting Sept. 9.\n\nBoard member Doretha Edgecomb said she supports the idea of creating a committee.\n\n\u201cWhat can we then substitute that\u2019s ongoing in terms of instructional data?\u201d Edgecomb asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s suggesting we eliminate everything.\u201d\n\nParent Lisa Ledbetter, who thinks her children are tested too much, was encouraged to hear the district is looking at the testing.\n\nLedbetter, who lives in eastern Hillsborough County, estimates that her 10th-grade son will take more than a dozen standardized tests this year.\n\n\u201cI know they take this data, figure out what they need to know and follow progress all the way through, but come on,\u201d Ledbetter said. \u201cWhen did our children stop being students and just became data?\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7999\n\nTwitter: @ErinKTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 20 Sep 2014 22:41:53 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Hillsborough County school district is joining others across the state in scrutinizing the crush of tests given to students throughout the school year.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Hillsborough County school district is joining others across the state in scrutinizing the crush of tests given to students throughout the school year.", "title": "Hillsborough weighing crush of testing in schools", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/hillsborough-weighing-crush-of-testing-in-schools-20140920/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140920/ARTICLE/140929914/AR/0/AR-140929914.jpg", "height": 1097}, "updated_time": "2014-09-21T18:39:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The Hillsborough County school district is joining others across the state in scrutinizing the crush of tests given to students throughout the school year.", "title": "Hillsborough weighing crush of testing in schools", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140920/ARTICLE/140929914/AR/0/AR-140929914.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-20T22:41:53Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-21T18:39:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08dc\"", "article_summary": "The Hillsborough County school district is joining others across the state in scrutinizing the crush of tests given to students throughout the school year.\n\u201cI think testing has metastasized,\u201d school board member Candy Olson said at a recent board meeting.\nStudents\u2019 test scores figure into their teachers\u2019 evaluations and help determine whether they keep their jobs and how much they are paid.\nStephanie Baxter-Jenkins, executive director of the Hillsborough Classroom Teachers Association, agrees that the district needs to look into all assessments, especially the ones that the school district controls.\nState law requires that most state tests this year be given on computers."}
