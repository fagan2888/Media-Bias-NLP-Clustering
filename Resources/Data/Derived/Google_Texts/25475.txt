Bummer of the day: the park ranger heading up the investigation of that guy who (apparently) kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon says that the investigation has hit a dead end.

In case you missed the video (it's online, even though YouTube took it down, but I'm not linking it), here's what happened: two shirtless dudes are standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon, one makes a path of food that a squirrel follows, then the other one kicks it to its likely doom. It's pretty gross and just weird. Why the hell would you go to the Grand Canyon if you hate wildlife? Spend another night in Scottsdale or something, clowns.

From the Republic:

Grand Canyon Chief Ranger Bill Wright said Monday that the case will remain open, but none of the tips provided by the public have led to the alleged squirrel-kicker. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) announced last week that it is adding a vacation to the Grand Canyon to the $15,000 reward it offered last month for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man. [...] PETA wants anyone with information to contact Wright at 928-638-7888.

In my head, I'm sort of hoping those guys ended up falling into a hole somewhere, blown off-balance by a seemingly-random gust of wind, but that's probably wishful thinking.
