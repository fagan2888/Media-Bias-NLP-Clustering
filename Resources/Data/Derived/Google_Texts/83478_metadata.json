Claire McCaskill (D-MO) voted No: \u201cThis package is one fiscally irresponsible step too far. It includes important provisions for programs I support, like a boost to the E/A-18 Growler and F/A-18 Super Hornets production lines in St. Louis. But the bulk of this package is just a series of huge, expensive tax giveaways to the wealthy and special interests\u2014not paid for\u2014that will add significantly to our national debt and hamper our ability to achieve my goal of a simpler, fairer tax code.\u201d\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) voted Yes: \u201cThe way the Senate works is when a constructive cooperative majority can find a constructive cooperative minority, that\u2019s why this significant bill was passed today.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Bost (R-IL) voted Yes: \u201cWhile this legislation may not have included everything we wanted, it does make significant reforms that are win-wins for Southern Illinois,\u201d said Rep. Bost. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve come together to provide long-term certainty for our military members, small businesses, and hardworking families in Southern Illinois, we can now redouble our efforts on the important initiatives that were not included in this bill and hopefully make progress there as well.\u201d\n\nRep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO) voted Yes: \u201cToday\u2019s passage of the legislation that will fund the government for the next fiscal year represents a bipartisan compromise that includes a number of priorities that are important to Americans. National security is arguably the biggest concern right now and this legislation fully funds our military and tightens security requirements for those entering our country under the nation\u2019s Visa Waiver Program. It includes no new funding for Obamacare, and in fact, undermines Obamacare\u2019s funding; reduces EPA\u2019s budget to its lowest level since 2008 and cuts its employees to the lowest number since 1989; blocks the anti-gun UN Arms Trade Treaty; repeals mandatory Country of Origin Labeling, which is hurting America\u2019s farmers and ranchers; prohibits taxpayer funding for abortions and cuts the UN\u2019s Population Fund. This legislation will also repeal the decades old oil export ban which will help grow jobs and promote greater exploration of natural resources in our country. While this bill is not perfect, it ultimately is a step in the right direction. It is my hope the House of Representatives will get back to regular order and pass appropriations bills one-by-one so Congress can avoid governing by crisis.\u201d\n\nMissouri Senator Roy Blunt (R) & Illinois Senator Mark Kirk (R) both voted Yes.\n\nMissouri Reps Lacy Clay, Ann Wagner, Blaine Luetkemeyer, & Vicky Hartzler all voted Yes. Jason Smith voted No.\n\nIllinois Reps John Shimkus, Rodney Davis, & Mike Bost all voted Yes. Darin LaHood voted No.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
