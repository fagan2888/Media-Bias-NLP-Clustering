Some even called his presidential terms a miracle.\n\nThe hate for Obama is real.\n\nSince the beginning of Obama\u2019s first term, he has continually created ground-breaking moments.\n\nMany slight Obama on his continuous success by refusing to acknowledge his landmarks, but the groundbreaking change in laws and the relief many middle-class Americans feel are proof that he has done great things.\n\n\u201cThis is what a successful presidency looks like,\u201d said Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman in Rolling Stone. \u201cNo president gets to do everything his supporters expected him to.\u201d\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s presidency, student loan tax rates fell, gay marriage was legalized, health care laws were dramatically changed, and he continues to deliver some of the most powerful speeches anyone has ever heard.\n\n\u201cI think president Obama is incredible,\u201d kinesiology sophomore Michael Upkong said. \u201cI think sometimes people don\u2019t respect him, because of their personal views\u2026. I feel like he broke down this stereotype of \u2018Presidents have to be this and they have to talk and walk like that\u2019 and all those other things people think a president should do,\u201d said Michael Upkong kinesiology sophomore.\n\nObama\u2019s legacy goes beyond political decisions. He is relatable because he connects with most of today\u2019s youth.\n\nHe was the struggling college student. He was the kid that was raised by his grandparents and grew up without a father.\n\nHe was the small-town kid with big dreams and was the one black student in most of his Harvard classes but, through it all, he overcame every circumstance.\n\nEvents that occurred in the White House over the past six years have never happened in history. Most recently, the White House lit up as a rainbow in support of gay marriage \u2014 something that has never done before.\n\nObama\u2019s presidency represents the evolution of America. Although the U.S. has so much further to go, the groundbreaking moment of a black man swearing into the Oval Office can never be forgotten.\n\nOpinion columnist Faith Alford is a journalism junior and may be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has made more of a positive impact than people give him credit for.
