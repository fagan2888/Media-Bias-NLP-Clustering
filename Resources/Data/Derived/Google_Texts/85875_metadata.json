Murphy praised Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) for leading the effort in the Senate.\n\nHouse Republican leaders said Thursday that they were unlikely to approve the Senate\u2019s version of the spending bill, heightening concerns about a government shutdown. But House aides said they did not expect the agricultural provision to be reinserted.\n\nIn unusually direct language, the provision in the House bill instructs the agriculture secretary to allow farmers or producers to continue to use genetically modified seeds and harvest crops grown with them even if a federal judge finds that they pose a potential risk, overturns their approval, and orders more studies of the plants.\n\nSeveral major grower groups and others, including Monsanto, a leading producer of genetically modified seeds, supported the provision, which they said was intended to protect farmers from the disruption caused by frivolous lawsuits.\n\nBut consumer groups, organic food advocates and others complained that the measure provided a sweetheart deal for corporate interests and a dangerous way to avoid court review of government agencies.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Monsanto called the expiration of the provision \u201cno surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis discussion shows the need to address the larger problem \u2014 abuse of the legal process by activists and returning the regulatory system to one based on real science, operating in a timely and data-driven manner to deliver choices to farmers and the economy they support,\u201d the company said.\n\nAs a possible sign of lessening support for the provision, the 2014 agriculture spending bills approved by the House and Senate appropriations committees \u2014 but not the full House or Senate \u2014 did not contain the measure.\n\n\u201cWe take things year by year,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cThis year, a decision was made not to continue it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "monsanto, continuing resolution, gm seeds, monsanto protection, farmer assurance, roy blunt, mikulski appropriations", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Food safety advocates hailedthe Senate move as an important victory.", "title": "Senate funding bill strips controversial provision on genetically modified crops", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-funding-bill-strips-controversial-provision-on-genetically-modified-crops/2013/09/26/353247ae-26c4-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hollyy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-funding-bill-strips-controversial-provision-on-genetically-modified-crops/2013/09/26/353247ae-26c4-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "monsanto, continuing resolution, gm seeds, monsanto protection, farmer assurance, roy blunt, mikulski appropriations", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "353247ae-26c4-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Food safety advocates hailedthe Senate move as an important victory."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecee\"", "article_summary": "But the Senate bill also explicitly cuts the crops provision, a move that food safety advocates hailed as an important victory.\nThe short-term spending plan moving through the Senate would eliminate legislative language that allows farmers to continue growing genetically modified crops even if a court has blocked their use.\nHouse Republican leaders said Thursday that they were unlikely to approve the Senate\u2019s version of the spending bill, heightening concerns about a government shutdown.\nThe Farmer Assurance Provision \u2014 dubbed the Monsanto Protection Act by its critics \u2014 was inserted into an earlier government funding bill that expires Monday and would have remained in place under the stop-gap funding bill approved by the House last week.\nThe 16-page version of the funding bill drafted by Senate Democrats makes two highly publicized changes to the House version: It strips the House language that would defund the Affordable Care Act and shortens the length of the spending measure, to Nov. 15 from Dec. 15."}
