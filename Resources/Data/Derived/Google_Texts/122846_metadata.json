How he was drawn to coaching two years earlier than planned because of a near-death experience in college. How he hung around Barry Switzer\u2019s office at Oklahoma every day until he was offered a low-ranking position with the Sooners. How Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh once told him that, to become a great head coach, he\u2019d have to learn more about every position on the field than anyone else.\n\nAnd with each shared memory, each line of motivation, Shanahan reminded anyone listening that he is still a coach. And that he still wants to be a head coach.\n\n\u201cYou go 18 hours a day for 40-something years, and then you got a year and a half to two years where you feel like you got the time to do whatever you want to do,\u201d he said of his life now, after he was let go by the Washington Redskins in December 2013. \u201cI still study the heck out of football. I actually have more time. I study more football now than I actually did before.\u201d\n\nShanahan\u2019s name typically comes up when head coaching vacancies arise.\n\nOn Friday, as he not-so-casually dropped hints of his desire to return to the sideline, he admitted he wouldn\u2019t jump at just any opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d have to be the right situation, for both sides \u2014 ownership and myself,\u201d he said.\n\nShanahan, who still lives in the Denver area, believes Broncos general manager John Elway has built a team primed for another Super Bowl run, saying: \u201cEvery decision he\u2019s made is based on what he thinks gives the team the best chance to win the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nShanahan added that Gary Kubiak, his former player and offensive coordinator, is the right man to lead the team now.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s everything you look for,\u201d Shanahan said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Shanahan says he could coach again if the situation were right", "title": "Mike Shanahan says he could coach again if the situation were right", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/16/mike-shanahan-says-he-could-coach-again-if-the-situation-were-right/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516_035059_mike-shanahan.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516_035059_mike-shanahan.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-16T15:52:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:05:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And that he still wants to be a head coach.\nI study more football now than I actually did before.\u201dShanahan\u2019s name typically comes up when head coaching vacancies arise.\nHow Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh once told him that, to become a great head coach, he\u2019d have to learn more about every position on the field than anyone else.\nAnd with each shared memory, each line of motivation, Shanahan reminded anyone listening that he is still a coach.\nGive Mike Shanahan the floor and he\u2019ll make an audience believe it is in the middle of his one of his pregame pep talks."}
