Three months prior, their unborn daughter had been diagnosed with Down syndrome, but an ultrasound at 30 weeks showed a large tumor that threatened the infant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThe doctor prepared us that this was really bad,\u201d Jones told ABC News. \u201cThe prognosis was very poor.\u201d\n\nJones, a mother of a 2-year-old named Audrey, is a nurse who works in neurology, so she was aware of the severity of her future daughter\u2019s condition. Jones also said the tumor came as a surprise to the family and seemed to grow very quickly. After having a 26-week ultrasound, doctors found nothing wrong with the child\u2019s brain.\n\nJones says it was like the tumor \u201cliterally came out of nowhere. At the 26-week ultrasound, her brain looked completely fine.\u201d But just four weeks later, the tumor that had grown in a part of her brain appeared \u201cmassive.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 6, Abigail Noelle Jones was born. Doctors told the family she may die shortly after birth, but she did not. Inspired by their story, professional photographer Mary Huszcza took photos of the family and their new baby girl.\n\nUnfortunately, after Abigail\u2019s birth, an MRI revealed that the tumor had grown. They diagnosed the case as an aggressive form of brain cancer and told the Jones they could not give Abigail chemo, because it would likely kill her. An operation was ruled out as well, because it could not prevent the tumor from coming back. The Jones decided to take their daughter home and take care of her themselves.\n\nThough Abigail\u2019s condition has not changed, the Jones say they have hope for their baby girl and know that if she cannot be healed in this life, she will be healed in the next.\n\nTo see Mary Huszcza's photos, click \"view slideshow\" above.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "florida, family, takes, incredible, photos, newborn, abigail, jones, who, was, diagnosed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Florida girl was born Aug. 6, despite doctors telling her family she may not make it.", "title": "Newborn With Inoperable Brain Tumor's Family Photoshoot Will Give You Chills [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/florida-family-takes-incredible-photos-newborn-abigail-jones-who-was-diagnosed-351180", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/03/photo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Florida girl was born Aug. 6, despite doctors telling her family she may not make it.", "title": "Newborn With Inoperable Brain Tumor's Family Photoshoot Will Give You Chills [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/florida-family-takes-incredible-photos-newborn-abigail-jones-who-was-diagnosed-351180", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/03/photo.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/03/photo.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-03T15:13:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-03T15:13:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Florida girl was born Aug. 6, despite doctors telling her family she may not make it."}, "article_summary": "When Florida mother Erika Jones was told her soon-to-be second born had an aggressive brain tumor, her husband Stephen prepared for the worst.\n\u201cThe doctor prepared us that this was really bad,\u201d Jones told ABC News.\nJones also said the tumor came as a surprise to the family and seemed to grow very quickly.\nThey diagnosed the case as an aggressive form of brain cancer and told the Jones they could not give Abigail chemo, because it would likely kill her.\nInspired by their story, professional photographer Mary Huszcza took photos of the family and their new baby girl."}
