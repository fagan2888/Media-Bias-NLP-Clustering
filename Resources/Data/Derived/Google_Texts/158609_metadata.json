(Photo: By David Zalubowski, AP)\n\nThe national head of Planned Parenthood called for an end to violence against women, doctors and clinicians who seek or offer reproductive healthcare, saying \"enough is enough\" during an appearance in Denver Saturday marking a day of unity for the organization.\n\nCecile Richards said that the Rocky Mountain branch, which operated a clinic that was seen of shooting Nov. 27, was an inspiration among supporters and workers for reopening its doors a day after the tragedy, reports the Associated Press.\n\n\"National Day of Solidarity\" rallies were held around the country, according to Planned Parenthood. Supporters responded on social media by using the hashtag #StandWithPP and adding pink filters to their profile pictures.\n\nThe organization said the events are being held to honor the three victims of the Nov. 27 shooting at the clinic in Colorado Springs, Colo., and 14 killed in San Bernardino, Calif. Wednesday.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is calling for an end to the rhetoric that, they say, has fueled violence against abortion clinics and marginalized groups, such as the black, immigrant and transgender communities.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the victims of these terrible tragedies, and we are resolved to stop this from happening again,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to denounce the tragedy without also denouncing the poisonous rhetoric that fueled it. Instead, some politicians are continuing to stoke it, which is unconscionable \u2014 going so far as to try and pass legislation further blocking access to health care just days after the tragedy in Colorado Springs.\u201d\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share A campus police officer killed in the Planned Parenthood shooting was honored Friday for volunteering to rush to the clinic as shots rang out, an act those who knew him say was driven by his sense of purpose and faith. (Dec. 4). AP\n\nPlanned Parenthood, which is the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, has been in the national spotlight since the July release of undercover videos that allegedly showed employees discussing the illegal sale of tissue and organs from aborted fetuses for profit. The organization vehemently denied these accusations, saying they had consent from the patient to donate the fetal tissue in question to medical researchers for stem-cell research.\n\nIn an attempt to move past the controversy, the organization revised its policies in October and no longer receives reimbursement for supplying tissue to researchers.\n\nBut with the release of the video came a spike in concern for violence against abortion providers. In September, the FBI warned of \"likely criminal or suspicious incidents\" against reproductive health care providers, their staff and facilities and said they were tracking nine criminal or suspicious incidents nationwide.\n\nWhile politicians spanning the spectrum decried the Nov. 27 attack, conservative lawmakers have continued to prioritize changing abortion legislature.\n\nThe Senate voted Thursday to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood for one year as well as repeal key provisions of Obamacare. The legislation has not yet been by the House, which passed a different version in October, but President Obama will veto the bill if it reaches his desk, the White House said Wednesday.\n\nContributing: Gregg Zoroya, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1XR3L5U", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The organization is honoring the victims and rallying in support of women's healthcare.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "The organization is honoring the victims and rallying in support of women's healthcare.", "title": "Planned Parenthood 'day of solidarity' held after deadly clinic shooting", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/12/05/planned-parenthood-national-day-of-solidarity/76781772/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The organization is honoring the victims and rallying in support of women's healthcare.", "title": "Planned Parenthood 'day of solidarity' held after deadly clinic shooting", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8c13ba8e2c7ed87f0d730899e9bf50d0fcf41b05/c=285-0-1018-733&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Abortion", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Abortion", "title": "Planned Parenthood 'day of solidarity' held after deadly clinic shooting", "author": "Taylor Maycan", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7f605c246e7ac946122bbee2c53184118ff4911/c=359-0-909-733/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3e34f32042bba8ef58f92e1ed79ac8490d57a31/c=285-0-1018-733/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc72efea2bd587754c604aa96e6c387b330e24ad/c=45-0-1020-733/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df29d86ae0c633cd43e1dc82f150ad5694d10078/c=0-57-1022-634&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-12-05T16:45:41.370000-05:00", "shorthed": "Planned Parenthood hosts 'day of solidarity'", "articleid": 76781772, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aca4502169ac7e57dfc405f46e5e835ed8eeefab/c=0-57-1022-634/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1719065d672ae33402ddc25087c4dcec1c3bed08/c=449-0-859-733/local/-/media/2015/12/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635849297650793461-richards.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "planned parenthood, san bernardino, national day of solidarity, #standwithpp, planned parenthood solidarity day, colorado springs,"}, "article_summary": "\"National Day of Solidarity\" rallies were held around the country, according to Planned Parenthood.\nCecile Richards, center, national head of Planned Parenthood, and others wore pink for their \"National Day of Solidarity.\"\nThe Senate voted Thursday to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood for one year as well as repeal key provisions of Obamacare.\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the victims of these terrible tragedies, and we are resolved to stop this from happening again,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\nPlanned Parenthood is calling for an end to the rhetoric that, they say, has fueled violence against abortion clinics and marginalized groups, such as the black, immigrant and transgender communities."}
