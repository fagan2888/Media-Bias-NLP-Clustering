If the ordinance passes its second reading in August, marijuana dispensaries will have to set aside 2 percent of their product \u2014 which must be of equivalent quality to the marijuana they\u2019re selling at market prices \u2014 and give it free to city residents with incomes below $32,000.\n\nIt makes a lot more sense than it sounds like at first.\n\nIn a way, Berkeley\u2019s action is ordinary: The government provides free or cheap medical products to people with low incomes all the time, with a goal of ensuring that people do not go without needed medical care. The government requires hospitals to provide emergency care to patients in need regardless of ability to pay. It provides free health insurance to the poor through Medicaid, and subsidizes insurance for people with low and moderate incomes through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThose regular channels don\u2019t work for medical marijuana users. Even though California authorizes medical marijuana, it\u2019s illegal under federal law, and the Food and Drug Administration has not approved it. As a result, Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid, doesn\u2019t cover it. If any private health insurance plans cover it, I couldn\u2019t find them; Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the industry group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, told me they\u2019re not aware of any plans that cover marijuana, either.\n\nPhoto\n\nDepending on the level of use, a low-income medical marijuana user may be on the hook for hundreds of dollars a month in expenses. Some dispensaries in California offer assistance, including reduced prices for people who qualify for Medi-Cal, but it\u2019s nothing like the comprehensive coverage that insurance provides for F.D.A.-approved drugs.\n\nBerkeley is addressing a real coverage gap. Still, the set-aside is not a perfect mechanism. Because it\u2019s limited to 2 percent of production, it won\u2019t serve the entire needy population. And it relies on the dreaded \u201ccross-subsidy\u201d: Dispensaries can be expected to raise prices on everybody else to cover the cost of giving away marijuana free to some.\n\nIt would be better if the city just paid cash to finance marijuana purchases by the poor, so the costs would be borne by taxpayers at large instead of by nonpoor medical marijuana users, in the same way that Medicaid is financed with broad-based taxes. But, like the health insurers, the city of Berkeley might be wary of buying quasi-legal marijuana. Cross-subsidies are often used to hide the true fiscal cost of what\u2019s being provided free or cheaply; in this rare instance, Berkeley has a good reason for wanting to hide the ball.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf marijuana is legalized, federally regulated and integrated into the regular medical system, a local set-aside system like Berkeley\u2019s won\u2019t be necessary. Until then, the city\u2019s wacky-sounding free marijuana plan will serve as a useful workaround.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140711073005, "twitter": {"description": "Although the circumstances are unusual, the city is acting normally in providing a service to the needy.", "title": "Don\u2019t Laugh: Berkeley Plans to Give Free Marijuana to the Poor", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/upshot/dont-laugh-berkeley-plans-to-give-free-marijuana-to-the-poor.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002994588"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jbarro", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/11/upshot/11UP-Marijuana/11UP-Marijuana-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/upshot/dont-laugh-berkeley-plans-to-give-free-marijuana-to-the-poor.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002994588", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/upshot/dont-laugh-berkeley-plans-to-give-free-marijuana-to-the-poor.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 11, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Medi-Cal", "keywords": "Berkeley (Calif),Marijuana,Medical Marijuana,Law and Legislation,Medi-Cal", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Pot Weed", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Josh Barro", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/11/upshot/11UP-Marijuana/11UP-Marijuana-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JOSH BARRO", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Although the circumstances are unusual, the city is acting normally in providing a service to the needy.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/11/upshot/11UP-Marijuana/11UP-Marijuana-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Although the circumstances are unusual, the city is acting normally in providing a service to the needy.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/josh_barro/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-07-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Medi-Cal", "published": "2014-07-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Berkeley (Calif)", "slug": "12up-berkeley", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140712222607, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/upshot/dont-laugh-berkeley-plans-to-give-free-marijuana-to-the-poor.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/11/upshot/11UP-Marijuana/11UP-Marijuana-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Although the circumstances are unusual, the city is acting normally in providing a service to the needy.", "title": "Don\u2019t Laugh: Berkeley Plans to Give Free Marijuana to the Poor"}, "pdate": 20140711, "des": "Law and Legislation", "articleid": 100000002994588, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Don\u2019t Laugh: Berkeley Plans to Give Free Marijuana to the Poor", "col": "A Medicine to Some", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe8c\"", "article_summary": "If any private health insurance plans cover it, I couldn\u2019t find them; Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the industry group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, told me they\u2019re not aware of any plans that cover marijuana, either.\nUntil then, the city\u2019s wacky-sounding free marijuana plan will serve as a useful workaround.\nEarlier this month, Berkeley\u2019s City Council voted unanimously for an ordinance that would provide free medical marijuana to patients with low incomes.\nIt provides free health insurance to the poor through Medicaid, and subsidizes insurance for people with low and moderate incomes through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\nEven though California authorizes medical marijuana, it\u2019s illegal under federal law, and the Food and Drug Administration has not approved it."}
