What is the difference between a healthcare navigator and a healthcare broker?\n\nAs a navigator we are really just sort of there to help people navigate healthcare.gov. Brokers can really help people to give them specific direction and suggestions on what plans might best fit their situation, versus a navigator, we\u2019re there to just help them through the process and couldn\u2019t direct them to a plan that might best fits their needs.\n\n2. Will I get the same information about healthcare plans from a navigator and a broker?\n\nYes. Brokers and navigators are both able to help people on the marketplace. A broker might have more options outside of the marketplace. For instance, I believe Aetna is one that\u2019s really offering a lot of plans. But they don\u2019t offer plans on the marketplace. So a broker would be able to give you more options whereas a navigator just helps you on those plans that are available at healthcare.gov.\n\n3. When will the healthcare.gov website start working?\n\nCurrently the federal government has stated that by November 30, they expect to have the website up and functioning. Once we are confident in the subsidy calculation and the functionality of the marketplace, we will deploy in full force to get individuals enrolled.\n\n4. Since the website isn\u2019t working properly, I keep hearing that I can enroll by phone or mail. Is this true?\n\nThe bottom line is no. The website, healthcare.gov is the one location where individuals can enroll into the federally facilitated marketplace. If the website is not functioning, individuals cannot enroll over the phone.\n\n5. What\u2019s the difference between enrolling for an insurance plan through healthcare.gov and enrolling straight from a provider?\n\nIf you qualify for a government subsidy, the only way to enroll into a health insurance policy and have that subsidy apply to your premium is through healthcare.gov. If you do not qualify a government subsidy, you can go direct to a carrier.\n\n6. How do I qualify for a government subsidy?\n\nYou qualify for a subsidy really based on your household income, so for household income, we use the federal poverty guidelines. If you\u2019re somewhere in between 100-400% of the federal poverty line in this state then most likely you\u2019re going to qualify for financial assistant \u2013 aka, a subsidy \u2013 to help you pay for your health coverage.\n\n7. What is Alaska\u2019s federal poverty line?\n\nFor an individual, it would be $14,350 all the way up to around $57,000. So 100% of the federal poverty line in Alaska is that $14,350 and then four times that is at that $57,000. So if you\u2019re an individual and you are somewhere in between that income level, then most likely you\u2019re going to get financial assistance in the marketplace and you should definitely pursue that.\n\n8. If I\u2019m Alaska Native and I use the tribal health options that are available to me in my community, do I have to enroll in a new health plan?\n\nNo, if you go to a tribal health facility, you can keep going there just like you\u2019ve been doing, that stays the same, but you do need to sign up for that exemption called the Indian Status Exemption so you aren\u2019t subject to a tax penalty at the end of the year.\n\n9. Do military have to apply for an exemption like Alaska Natives do?\n\nNo, if you get benefits, VA benefits or any sort of veteran benefits, then you don\u2019t need to prove or apply for an exemption. And then in addition, if you\u2019re on government programs like Medicaid or you have Medicare then you don\u2019t need to apply for an exemption. You\u2019re considered someone who has health insurance.\n\n10. And finally, I keep hearing about bronze, silver, gold packages. What are they?\n\nAll plans have to offer what are called ten essential health benefits. So if they are really offering the same coverage, they\u2019re going to differ in this metallic rating of bronze, silver, gold. If you have a bronze plan you\u2019re probably paying less per month but maybe more in your out-of-pockets expenses when you go to the doctor for your copays or deductibles. Compared to someone who has a gold plan, they\u2019re probably paying more per month for their premium, but then when they go to the doctor, they might have a smaller copay or deductible as part of that plan.\n\nAdditional questions:\n\nWhere can I find prices of different healthcare plans so I can start shopping around by myself?\n\nOn the bottom of healthcare.gov, there\u2019s an option to preview plans that are available in your state. You just select Alaska and then you\u2019ll see 36 different plans available on the marketplace, and you can start to see what your monthly payment will be. If you\u2019re just shopping around, it won\u2019t calculate or tell you what your premium subsidy would be to offset your costs, but it will start to give you an idea of what is available out there for Alaskans.\n\nWhat do the acronyms ACA, FFM, and QHP mean? Are there other healthcare acronyms that I might need to know?\n\nACA refers to the Affordable Care Act, which is the health reform law, also known as Obamacare.\n\nFFM refers to the Federally Facilitated Marketplace, and that includes Alaska. Alaska chose not to partner as a state with the federal government so we\u2019re what\u2019s called a federally facilitated marketplace and we\u2019re using healthcare.gov as our route to apply for marketplace coverage.\n\nQHP refers to Qualified Health Plans. They are covering essential health benefits, which make them qualified to be sold in the marketplace.\n\nBesides acronyms, there\u2019s a lot of health insurance speak, things like, \u2018deductibles,\u2019 \u2018copays,\u2019 \u2018cost-sharing.\u2019 If you\u2019re not in the world of health insurance or if you haven\u2019t gone through the process of finding a plan on your own before, that\u2019s confusing. There\u2019s a lot of insurance speak and jargon. If you\u2019re someone who needs a breakdown of those, there are resources on Premera and Moda\u2019s website as well as healthcare.gov, but seek out help whether through a navigator, an agent, an in-person assistor and ask those questions. Those are fundamental terms that you want to know to help you make an informed decision on your healthcare needs.\n\nWhat information should I have prepared for when healthcare.gov does work?\n\nSome things people should get together is \u2013 if you\u2019re a family and you may have children \u2013 social security numbers, dates of birth, tax forms from the previous years, maybe pay stubs from 2013 to get an idea of what your income might look like for 2014. You might want to have a list if you have any special prescription drugs that you have to take so that we can compare plans and make sure the plan you select covers those prescriptions. Bring your list of doctors as well.\n\nHow can I find out what my subsidy might be?\n\nThere are different tools available to calculate your subsidy or what you might qualify for. On healthcare.gov, there is the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator and we\u2019ve found that to be a pretty good guess. However I\u2019d say that navigators, as well as licensed agents and brokers, do have some other tools that are more manual and include percentages, so they\u2019re probably going to be a little more accurate. But if you\u2019re just curious, you can definitely go to Kaiser Family Foundation calculator or go to healthcare.gov, type in subsidy calculator and you will find it. There are ways to get it online, but know that it\u2019s probably not exact; it\u2019s just a rough calculation.\n\nWhat if I buy insurance in Alaska but move to another state?\n\nYou\u2019ll have to change your policy to the state where you reside at that point in time. You\u2019ll have a certain time frame that you can switch over that insurance and it should be a seamless transition of coverage. It ends on the 30th of the month and starts on the 1st of the next month. In your new state exchange or federally facilitated marketplace, they have to recalculate the subsidy based on where you are residing at that time.\n\nWhy did my insurance plan get cancelled?\n\nIndividuals are getting cancellation notices because those individual insurance policies do not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and, therefore, they are being cancelled. Individuals will then have to go out and purchase new insurance. If they qualify for a subsidy, they need to purchase an insurance plan on the marketplace, which is healthcare.gov. If they do not qualify for a subsidy, they can purchase a plan on the marketplace or outside the marketplace.\n\nSo if my insurance plan got cancelled, I have to shop for a new one? My insurance company won\u2019t just automatically enroll me into a new plan?\n\nInsurance carriers will map your coverage over, but they won\u2019t determine if you\u2019re subsidy-eligible or not, so they\u2019re encouraging individuals to see if they are subsidy-eligible when they go pick a new plan. Insurance carriers won\u2019t just outright cancel you. For Moda and Premera \u2013 the two insurance carriers we have within the Marketplace \u2013 they will map you over to a new plan. They will send out the new plan and tell you at that point in time, \u2018This is your time to make a plan choice. Stick with the one we\u2019ve given you and take the premium increase, or go to the marketplace and determine if you\u2019re subsidy-eligible.\u2019\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Featured News,Health", "description": "\"I keep hearing that I can enroll by phone or mail.
