Asa Hutchinson said last week he wants the state Legislature to move away from what has become a yearly debate over the so-called private option and take a longer view of health care reform.\n\nHutchinson proposed retaining the program for two more years, after which he said he wants the state to implement something new, based on the recommendations of a task force. If legislators go along, the private-option could be virtually a non-issue in the session that enters its third week Monday.\n\nThat is a big \u201cif\u201d for a Legislature that saw its last two sessions dominated by fights over the Medicaid expansion program. Appropriating another year of federal funding for the program will require a three-fourths majority vote in both chambers, a high bar to reach.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the past two years, our state has been wrapped around the political axle,\u201d Hutchinson said Thursday in a speech at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock. \u201cThe phrase \u2018private option\u2019 itself has become politically toxic, so much so that it\u2019s almost impossible to have a constructive conversation about health care reform without passions rising and folks taking sides.\u201d\n\nThe private option is Arkansas\u2019 alternative to the Medicaid expansion that was envisioned in the federal Affordable Care Act. A group of Republican state legislators crafted a plan to use federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for people earning up to 135 percent of the federal poverty level, instead of adding them to the state Medicaid rolls as the Obama administration proposed.\n\nBy the end of November, 223,456 private-option applicants had been deemed eligible and 213,200 had completed enrollment, according to the state Department of Human Services.\n\nThe program has received solid support from Democratic legislators but has sharply divided Republican legislators, as Hutchinson noted. Some GOP legislators who have voted against the program in the past or campaigned on opposition to it say they are still reluctant to vote \u2018yes.\u2019\n\n\u201cI still feel the same as I did during my campaign,\u201d said Sen. Scott Flippo, R-Bull Shoals, who campaigned against the private option. \u201cI can appreciate the governor\u2019s efforts on this issue, it\u2019s a difficult issue and it has been a divisive issue. But because a good majority of the people in District 17 still do not support Medicaid expansion, I\u2019m hesitant to vote to support it to go through 2016.\u201d\n\nSen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, who has voted against the program in the past, said, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me how many people are going to be on that thing at the end of 2016. Costs are still a factor. It\u2019s harder to cut people off or scale back after they\u2019ve been on there. \u2026 I\u2019ve still got my ears open, but I don\u2019t know of anything I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s changed my mind.\u201d\n\nSen. Cecile Bledsoe, R-Rogers, who chairs the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee and has voted against the private option in the past, said she is still interested in \u201crepealing the private option as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nBut some who have opposed the program in the past say Hutchinson\u2019s plan has changed things.\n\n\u201cI am prepared to vote for it, seeing that we\u2019ll have and end to it in 2016,\u201d said Rep. Justin Harris, R-West Fork, who has voted against the private option in the past.\n\nRep. Joe Farrer, R-Austin, who has voted against the program in the past, said of Hutchinson\u2019s plan, \u201cI\u2019ll support it. To me, it ends it.\u201d\n\nRep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbrier, who voted against the private option in the past, said after Hutchinson\u2019s speech, \u201cI\u2019ll just say I\u2019m more open to it than I was yesterday. A lot of it will depend on the details that come forth.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate did not meet Friday, giving members a three-day weekend that some said they would use to get feedback from constituents.\n\nSeveral groups have already weighed in, including the conservative Americans for Prosperity Arkansas, which complained that Hutchinson\u2019s speech lacked a call for an enrollment freeze, a mechanism for moving people off the program and a \u201cdefinitive end date.\u201d\n\nHospitals and groups that advocate for children, families and the poor have lauded Hutchinson\u2019s call to keep the private option going for the next two years.\n\n\u201c(Hutchinson\u2019s) approach does two important things \u2014 it keeps affordable coverage for more than 200,000 newly insured Arkansans and it helps hospitals and providers plan for the near future,\u201d said Chris Barber, president and CEO of St. Bernard\u2019s Healthcare in Jonesboro.\n\n\u201cWe commend Gov. Hutchinson for announcing that he will support continued funding for the private option in 2016, his recognition of the benefits in providing insurance to more than 200,000 Arkansans, the savings for hospitals, and providing federal budget aid in 2016 for the state government,\u201d said Lee Powell, director of the Delta Grassroots Caucus.\n\nRich Huddleston, executive director of Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said the group applauded Hutchinson \u201cfor laying out a pragmatic way forward on the private option, guaranteeing Arkansans affordable coverage, giving hospitals and health care providers more certainty, and protecting the state budget in the process.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDale Ellis contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Gov.
