Taking time out from paid employment to look after children and ageing parents meant they had less superannuation.\n\nThe State of the Family report also highlighted other groups who were vulnerable to poverty.\n\nIt noted that refugees and asylum seekers struggled to find secure accommodation in the competitive rental market due to a combination of lower income, poor English skills, lack of knowledge of the process and racism and discrimination.\n\nPeople with a disability are also more susceptible to poverty, as they face several barriers in getting into paid employment.\n\nAs of August, Australia\u2019s unemployment rate was 6.2%. For people living with a disability, that rate was 9.4%.\n\nThe report also revealed that gains in the broader community were made at the expense of people living with disability.\n\nRelated: One in seven Australians living below the poverty line, survey reveals\n\n\u201cWorkforce participation rates for people with disability have declined at the same time as national participation rates have improved,\u201d it said. \u201cOne fifth of the people with a disability who are not participating in the work force has reported that their disability is not the reason that they are not participating.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnglicare recorded data from over 36,600 people who accessed its six emergency relief centres in Sydney and the Illawarra between 2007 and 2014.\n\nUnemployment and housing stress were two key factors.\n\nOnly 5% of the people who accessed the centre had full or part time work, and the majority \u2013 62% of people seeking relief from the centres \u2013 had a fortnightly income of $1,000 or less. A massive 94% of single people who accessed the centre had a fortnightly income of $1,000 or less.\n\n\u201cFor the two-year period [between] 2013-14, 68% of emergency relief clients from lone person households fell within or below the December 2013 poverty line,\u201d the report said. \u201cAlmost one in three (30%) were approaching severe housing stress by spending more than 45% of their low income on accommodation costs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "State of the Family report reveals older women more vulnerable to poverty, citing unpaid caring responsibilities, lower savings and lack of affordable housing", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Shalailah Medhora", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "State of the Family report reveals older women more vulnerable to poverty, citing unpaid caring responsibilities, lower savings and lack of affordable housing", "title": "Older single women are the new face of homelessness, says Anglicare report", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/12/older-single-women-new-face-of-homelessness-anglicare-report", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff47168e76c2e479d03aa40273248624995d2b61/1059_848_2351_1410/master/2351.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=60f30b7c174a7d338a8a4e7a528747a4", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2015/oct/12/older-single-women-new-face-of-homelessness-anglicare-report?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/12/older-single-women-new-face-of-homelessness-anglicare-report", "iphone": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2015/oct/12/older-single-women-new-face-of-homelessness-anglicare-report?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ff47168e76c2e479d03aa40273248624995d2b61/1059_848_2351_1410/master/2351.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2015/oct/12/older-single-women-new-face-of-homelessness-anglicare-report?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Housing affordability,Women,Poverty,Housing,Welfare in Australia,Disability,Australia news,Social exclusion,Australian economy,Society", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-10-11T19:55:21.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shalailah-medhora", "section": "Australia news", "modified_time": "2016-05-08T23:03:08.000Z", "tag": "Housing affordability,Women,Poverty,Housing,Welfare in Australia,Disability,Australia news,Social exclusion,Australian economy,Society"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff47168e76c2e479d03aa40273248624995d2b61/1059_848_2351_1410/2351.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=e00216baa81ee9e8849c8a3ae9651b04", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Housing affordability,Women,Poverty,Housing,Welfare in Australia,Disability,Australia news,Social exclusion,Australian economy,Society"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc847\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOlder single women represent the changing face of homelessness; experiencing homelessness for the first time later in life,\u201d the report said.\nOlder single women are the new face of homelessness in Australia, welfare group Anglicare has revealed in a new report that looks at the groups falling through the cracks in society.\n\u201cAnecdotally, we know that the instances of older women experiencing unstable housing are on the rise.\u201dThe report said statistics did not necessarily reflect the trend of older women living in their cars or seeking temporary shelter with friends and family.\nThe State of the Family report, released on Monday, found that older single women were much more vulnerable to poverty and homelessness due to lower workplace participation, lifelong unpaid caring responsibilities and lack of affordable housing.\nThe report also revealed that gains in the broader community were made at the expense of people living with disability."}
