The study, published in the Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies, specifically highlights that adults who were top players in high school were more competitive in the job market.\n\n\u201cParticipation in competitive youth sports \u2018spills\u2019 to occupationally advantageous traits that persist across a person\u2019s life,\u201d Kevin Kniffin, lead researcher and a postdoctoral research associate at Cornell University\u2019s Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, said in a university news release. In the study, researchers found that people who played varsity sports in high school had more self-confidence and leadership skills \u2014 qualities that are very marketable when looking for a job.\n\nThey also noted that varsity athletes were more involved in volunteering and participated in charitable events. Researchers found that late-career workers who had earned a varsity letter over 50 years ago had more of the qualities people look for when searching for employees. \u201c\u2026Plus, they donate time and money more frequently than others and possessed great prosocial behavior than in their 70s, 80s, ad 90s,\u201d Kniffen said.\n\nConfidence is the key to getting highly competitive jobs. If you weren\u2019t a star athlete in high school, you can still gain the confidence you need to be competitive in the workplace. Dr. Lois Frankel, president of Corporate Coaching talks about self-esteem in her book Nice Girls Don\u2019t Get The Corner Office. She writes that people who have lower self-esteem are probably doing poorly in the work place. In her book, Frankel says that people with low self-esteem rarely speak up at meetings and are very unsure of themselves.\n\nThe Positivity Blog gives some tips to help you regain your confidence so you can compete when applying for jobs. One of the questions the blog tells you to ask yourself is: What is the worst that can happen? The purpose of posing this question is to get rid of the fear of failing. Uplifting music is also helpful in gaining your confidence. If you need to put on the \"Eye of the Tiger\" to get you pumping, then turn those speakers right on up \u2014 whatever it takes to bring your spirits high.\n\nThe blog also recommends trying new things. Breaking out of your comfort zone is critical to gaining confidence. A few more tips include exercising, facing your fears, and not comparing yourself to others. Being positive, of course, is also on the list. Not putting yourself down when you underperform but acknowledging what you did well is also helpful.\n\nSource: Kniffen K, Wansink B, Shimizu M.
