More than 60 people gathered in pink Tuesday to stand with Planned Parenthood.

LAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) – More than 60 people rallied Tuesday as part of the first National Pink Out Day to stand with Planned Parenthood.

It was a sea of pink on the steps of the Tippecanoe County Courthouse. The rally was intended to bring attention to the effects of defunding the organization.

Organizers said Planned Parenthood provides 2.7 million patients a year with health care. They believe defunding is part of a political agenda that would be detrimental to those who need those services.

“Which we find pretty outrageous. We feel like over this past year, attention to Planned Parenthood is deceptive,” said Sheila Rosenthal.

Planned Parenthood has been under fire since the release of secretly-recorded videos by an anti-abortion group in which representatives speak about providing fetal tissue for medical research. President Cecile Richards testified Tuesday before Congress that the bulk of its work is health screenings and calls videos part of a smear campaign.
