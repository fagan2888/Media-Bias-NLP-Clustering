Amanda Gryce, 24, experiences up to 50 orgasms a day, triggered by anything from a car trip to a loud, thumping bass. The afflicted woman has been suffering from persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) since she was 6 years old, and about a year ago, she started to seek treatment.\n\n\"Pleasure is supposed to be a good thing, but when you have it for too long, it's like eating a lot of candy \u2014 something that's really good and makes you happy, but then you start getting sick from it because you've had too much,\" Gryce told Barcroft TV in the video. Gryce has suffered in silence for years, as she was too ashamed to tell her family or friends. However, since last year, she has been in contact with pelvic pain expert Dr. Robert Echenberg, who has given her hope in finding a way to control her orgasms.\n\n\u201cAfter seeing Echenberg, I found there are things which can reduce the intensity of the orgasms, even though they are still constant,\u201d she said. The 24-year-old currently takes medication to numb her genitals, does exercises to take her mind off PGAD, and must abstain from sex \u2014 doctor\u2019s orders, The Huffington Post reported. Gryce receives support from her boyfriend, Stuart Triplett, 22, who has actually been helping her abstain from sex. \u201cStuart's really been holding me back as far as the intimacy goes \u2014 he actually has to remind me we're not allowed to do anything.\u201d\n\nAlthough abstinence is a major element to her health routine, she actually notices immediate and positive results. Gryce must abstain from sex until she gets her condition under control. \u201cI finally feel like I'm going to have a more normal life \u2014 and eventually a positive sex life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "persistent genital arousal disorder, pgad, having sex, orgasms, pelvic pain, sexual health, women's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Twenty-four-year-old Florida woman Amanda Gryce has up to 50 orgasms a day, but can\u2019t get no satisfaction, as the rare genital disorder leaves her with constant pelvic pain.", "title": "Woman Orgasms 50 Times A Day, But Can't Get No Satisfaction [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/never-satisfied-woman-has-50-orgasms-day-without-having-sex-due-rare-condition-276198", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/amanda-gyrce-suffers-50-orgasms-day.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twenty-four-year-old Florida woman Amanda Gryce has up to 50 orgasms a day, but can\u2019t get no satisfaction, as the rare genital disorder leaves her with constant pelvic pain.", "title": "Woman Orgasms 50 Times A Day, But Can't Get No Satisfaction [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/never-satisfied-woman-has-50-orgasms-day-without-having-sex-due-rare-condition-276198", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/amanda-gyrce-suffers-50-orgasms-day.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/amanda-gyrce-suffers-50-orgasms-day.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-04-11T17:55:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T17:55:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Twenty-four-year-old Florida woman Amanda Gryce has up to 50 orgasms a day, but can\u2019t get no satisfaction, as the rare genital disorder leaves her with constant pelvic pain."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6ab\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI finally feel like I'm going to have a more normal life \u2014 and eventually a positive sex life.\u201d\nFor most women, an orgasm is a euphoric moment filled with happiness and pleasure, but for a Florida woman, orgasms are the constant torture of her life.\nAmanda Gryce, 24, experiences up to 50 orgasms a day, triggered by anything from a car trip to a loud, thumping bass.\nGryce must abstain from sex until she gets her condition under control.\nGryce receives support from her boyfriend, Stuart Triplett, 22, who has actually been helping her abstain from sex."}
