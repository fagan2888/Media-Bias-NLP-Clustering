In an interview with HuffPost Live, he called it an \u201cinferred fiduciary duty\u201d for American immigrants to learn English in order to become successful.\n\n\u201cGet rid of your accent. I did. Be a legal immigrant. I\u2019m a legal immigrant. Come to the country [but] just buckle your knees a little bit, make the effort to learn the culture, assimilate to the point that you can \u2026 all [be] proud of who you are and where you come from. \u2026 Great, whatever you\u2019re proud of, just tip your hat to America, which is the melting pot and makes it all possible,\u201d he said, before admitting to digressing.\n\n\u201cYou digress, but you open a can of worms to a degree,\u201d host Ricky Camilleri commented.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m actually saying the thing that needs to be said because the politically correct climate is bull[expletive],\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to upset anybody by saying, \u2018Learn to speak [expletive] English.\u2019 So, as an immigrant, I\u2019m telling you: Learn to speak [expletive] English. It is the key that will unlock the keys to the kingdom. If you make the effort, then all the possibilities of this culture will open up for you and give you all the rewards that I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d\n\nMr. Camilleri argued that Mr. Simmons\u2018 comments could be interpreted that he thinks immigrants are lazy and don\u2019t want to learn English, to which Mr. Simmons shot back: \u201cWow, do you know Bill O\u2019Reilly? Wow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll state it as fact once again,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cThe more you learn to speak English, and the more you know about American history, the more of an advantage you\u2019ll have in this culture. There\u2019s no other way.\n\n\u201cArianna Huffington couldn\u2019t speak a word of this language. She learned to speak the language. She educated herself. And then she got 800 million bucks for the Huffington Post. Learn to speak the language. Learn the people skills, the language skills. You\u2019ll get the money,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "KISS rocker Gene Simmons had some blunt words for immigrants coming to America in search of prosperity: \"Learn to speak [expletive] English.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "KISS rocker Gene Simmons had some blunt words for immigrants coming to America in search of prosperity: \u201cLearn to speak [expletive] English.\u201d", "title": "Gene Simmons to fellow immigrants: \u2018Learn to speak English\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/17/gene-simmons-fellow-immigrants-learn-speak-english/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/09/24/20090923-232633-pic-877941549.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/09/24/20090923-232633-pic-877941549.jpg", "description": "KISS rocker Gene Simmons had some blunt words for immigrants coming to America in search of prosperity: \"Learn to speak [expletive] English.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Gene Simmons to fellow immigrants: \u2018Learn to speak English\u2019"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Gene Simmons, Chaim Witz"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to upset anybody by saying, \u2018Learn to speak [expletive] English.\u2019 So, as an immigrant, I\u2019m telling you: Learn to speak [expletive] English.\nIn an interview with HuffPost Live, he called it an \u201cinferred fiduciary duty\u201d for American immigrants to learn English in order to become successful.\n\u201cThe more you learn to speak English, and the more you know about American history, the more of an advantage you\u2019ll have in this culture.\nI\u2019m actually saying the thing that needs to be said because the politically correct climate is bull[expletive],\u201d Mr. Simmons said.\nKISS rocker Gene Simmons had some blunt words for immigrants coming to America in search of prosperity: \u201cLearn to speak [expletive] English.\u201dMr. Simmons, born Chaim Witz, immigrated to New York from Israel with his mother when he was 8 years old."}
