(AP) - The first lesson in caring for an Ebola-infected patient: It\u2019s hard to hear your fellow medical workers speak when you\u2019re wearing full-body protective gear.\n\nThat point became clear to a group of Madigan Army Medical Center doctors and nurses who spent Thursday running through simulations of how they\u2019d care for an Ebola patient at the hospital south of Tacoma.\n\nThey found they had to shout to say anything to their patient, or to each other.\n\n\u201cWe have three pairs of gloves on. The hood has a motor in it, so I can\u2019t hear much of anything. I can barely hear myself talk,\u201d said Capt. Stacey Good, a Madigan doctor. \u201cCommunication on the team is extremely important.\u201d\n\nGood and about 50 others are preparing to be Madigan\u2019s go-to team if an Ebola patient appears at the hospital. They\u2019re following an Army directive to get ready for the virus that coincides with the military\u2019s buildup of its Ebola-response headquarters in Liberia.\n\nUp to 4,000 U.S. military service members could be sent there in the next months, mostly from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. They\u2019re deploying to help build facilities that can treat patients infected with a virus that has claimed more than 4,800 lives in West Africa.\n\nSo far, Madigan is setting aside two beds in its intensive care unit for potential Ebola patients, said Madigan Chief Medical Officer Col. Steve Yoest.\n\nHospital leaders say they think they\u2019re most likely to encounter someone with Ebola if a military service member or family member travels to West Africa for personal reasons and comes home with the virus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that we are prepared,\u201d Yoest said.\n\nCivilian hospitals in Pierce County had Ebola-training sessions for staffers last month after two nurses who treated an Ebola patient became infected with the virus in Dallas. They were eye-opening events for medical staff who once thought of Ebola as a virus contained to a faraway continent.\n\nMadigan\u2019s sessions added an extra layer of stress by incorporating high-tech dummies that can simulate Ebola symptoms, such as vomiting. They\u2019re controlled by staffers who can speak to doctors through a voice box in the dummy.\n\n\u201cAm I going to die?\u201d the simulated patient asked Good during a training session. \u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m not going to die.\u201d\n\nThe patient\u2019s heart rate increased and he began to vomit. Madigan staffers had to figure out how to clear his mouth and throat while wearing awkward protective gear.\n\nAt the end of the drill, the dummy\u2019s simulated vomit left traces all over the medical staff members; it could be seen under a black light, revealing that the seemingly clean staffers were actually covered with the patient\u2019s fluids. Ebola is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the stuff we can\u2019t see that\u2019s really the danger,\u201d said Lt. Col. Mohamad Haque, director of the Andersen Simulation Center at Madigan.\n\nJoint Base Lewis-McChord\u2019s role in the military\u2019s Ebola-response efforts is mostly handled by airmen in the 62nd and 446th Airlift Wings who are flying missions to deliver supplies and troops to Liberia and Senegal. They spend little time on the ground, so are unlikely to encounter the disease.\n\nA doctor and a nurse from Madigan, meanwhile, are joining a medical unit on its way to Liberia. They\u2019ll be quarantined for 21 days when they return home, in accordance with a Pentagon order.\n\nAt Madigan, the simulated Ebola drills eased some concerns among medical staffers.\n\n\u201cIt gives you the confidence to be able to say, \u2018If we get one of these patients, I\u2019ve done something similar. I know what to do to take care of them,\u2019 \u201d Good said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News Tribune, http://www.thenewstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first lesson in caring for an Ebola-infected patient: It's hard to hear your fellow medical workers speak when you're wearing full-body protective gear.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The first lesson in caring for an Ebola-infected patient: It\u2019s hard to hear your fellow medical workers speak when you\u2019re wearing full-body protective gear.", "title": "Madigan doctors training for Ebola patients", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/7/madigan-doctors-training-for-ebola-patients/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/07/149d14bdcb99b12b640f6a706700836b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/07/149d14bdcb99b12b640f6a706700836b.jpg", "description": "The first lesson in caring for an Ebola-infected patient: It's hard to hear your fellow medical workers speak when you're wearing full-body protective gear.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Madigan doctors training for Ebola patients"}, "Author": "ADAM ASHTON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc20b\"", "article_summary": "So far, Madigan is setting aside two beds in its intensive care unit for potential Ebola patients, said Madigan Chief Medical Officer Col.
