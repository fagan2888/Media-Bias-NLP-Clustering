(David Paul Morris, Bloomberg)\n\nThose who visit the overburdened website may see a \u201cholding page\u201d for a few minutes before they are able to enter the application process. Federal officials advised consumers to remain on the page and not refresh their browsers to hold their place in line.\n\nMany ran into more trouble on the third step of the application process, which asks people to select security questions for their accounts. On several attempts late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the drop-down boxes that are supposed to populate a list of security questions were left blank, stalling the process.\n\nOfficials said the issue is the result of high volume rather than a programming glitch.\n\nSome consumers, they note, have been able to successfully create accounts, compare insurance plans and sign-up for coverage, though the government would not provide any enrollment data.\n\nIn Illinois, the state landing page (www.getcoveredillinois.gov) had no issues Wednesday morning. The website has recorded 115,000 unique visitors since its launch at midnight Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman said.\n\nObama administration officials continued to blame the sluggish sign-up systems on a crush of consumers flooding to the federal site, which logged 4.7 million unique visits in its first 24 hours of operation. An additional 190,000 consumers called the 800-318-2596 help line, and more than 104,000 others requested online chats, officials said.\n\n\u201cVolume at healthcare.gov continues to be high,\u201d said Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the agency running the 34 state exchanges, including the one for Illinois. \u201cWe expect to see similar volume as yesterday, and while this overwhelming interest is continuing to cause wait times, there will be continuing improvements in the coming hours and days.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Affordable Care Act, visit chicagotribune.com/health/aca/\n\npfrost@tribune.com | Twitter: @peterfrost", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "Delays and technical problems continued to plague enrollment efforts on the online insurance marketplaces created under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law on Wednesday.
