It\u2019s also the first time the Obama administration \u2014 or any administration \u2014 has set a target on value-based payments.\n\nBuzzwords like \u201cquality-based payments,\u201d \u201cpatient-centered systems\u201d and \u201cdelivery system reforms\u201d are part of a decadelong shift in the nation\u2019s healthcare system. And it\u2019s one that began far before the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConway, whose background also includes work for private companies, said the efforts have intensified in the last three years and have been part of a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201d Nationally, the attention on these issues has been driven by a stronger focus on transparency by patient groups as well as increased availability of information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning of a sea change,\u201d Marc Boutin, CEO of the National Health Council, said at The Hill\u2019s panel on Tuesday. \u201cWe are now beginning to ask patients for the first time: What is value to you? What is important to you?\u201d\n\nBy 2018, Burwell said half of all payments to Medicare would be judged on whether a patient is healthier, among other measures. In the current healthcare system, doctors are paid almost entirely by procedure.\n\nThese new types of payments, which take into account new metrics such as patient experience and coordination of care, are known as \u201calternative payment models.\u201d\n\nUnder this system, federal health officials say that hospitals have incentives to work with other providers \u2014 such as physicians, home health agencies and nursing facilities \u2014 that would otherwise be operating in different spheres.\n\nWhen those providers offer conflicting care, it can lead to rehospitalizations and complications, the CMS warns.\n\nFederal health officials hope that by integrating outcome-driven care into Medicare \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest healthcare payer \u2014 it will have a ripple effect.\n\n\u201cAs a very large payer in the system, we believe we have a responsibility to lead,\u201d Burwell said in a press conference announcing the initiative in 2015. \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re going to set clear goals and establish a clear timeline for moving from volume to value in the Medicare system.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, patient groups say they hope the massive amounts of new data \u2014 from patient ratings to other types of quality outcomes \u2014 will be able to highlight strengths and weaknesses of each provider.\n\n\u201cA critical part of our journey is putting out data,\u201d Conway said.\n\nThere are growing pains, however, particularly for doctors and hospitals accustomed to the current \u201cfee-for-service\u201d system.\n\n\u201cHospitals being asked to step up,\u201d Peggy O\u2019Kane, president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, said in an interview last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like turning healthcare systems upside down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make change on this scale without unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nThe ways of measuring that success are complicated, and that has giving rise to new initiatives such as \u201cmeasurement science\u201d by groups including the National Quality Forum.\n\nBesides improving quality, the end goal is reducing costs. As part of that approach, health officials are seeking ways to entice providers to spend more time with the nation\u2019s costliest patients. About 20 percent of the population accounts for about 80 percent of the costs, according to HHS.\n\nAnother challenge is working with a GOP-led Congress that is often skeptical of the Obama administration\u2019s health agenda.\n\n\u201cDelivery system reform truly is, and should be, a bipartisan issue that we can communicate clearly, not just on the Hill but to the American people,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve communicated this well. I don\u2019t think the average consumer across America really gets it at the level that we need to. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nThis article is a part of the From Volume to Value series sponsored by Astellas.
