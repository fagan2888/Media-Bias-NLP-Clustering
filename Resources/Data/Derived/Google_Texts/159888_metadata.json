When asked, \u201cCan you imagine Google becoming a health company?\u201d, Brin responded:\n\nHealth is just so heavily regulated, it\u2019s just a painful business to be in. It\u2019s just not necessarily how I want to spend my time. Even though we do have some health projects, and we\u2019ll be doing that to a certain extent. But I think the regulatory burden in the U.S. is so high that I think it would dissuade a lot of entrepreneurs.\n\nPage agreed:\n\nI am really excited about the possibility of data also to improve health. But I think that\u2019s what Sergey\u2019s saying.
