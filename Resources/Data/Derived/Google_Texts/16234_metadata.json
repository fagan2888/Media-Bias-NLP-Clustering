One thing I wanted when I retired was to not have a schedule and to get to know places I\u2019d only seen from airplanes on business trips.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who retired in 2008, are members of a high-octane tribe of retirees who are transforming their golden years into a golden age of adventure on the open road.\n\nInspired by disparate strands of the American way of life \u2014 from don\u2019t-tread-on-me individualism to an it-takes-a-village communitarianism, from a love of nature to a craving for the best creature comforts modernity can offer (or both) \u2014 they are a wildly diverse bunch.\n\nSome have small trailers that cost a few thousand dollars and are barely larger than a van. Others cruise the country in expensive rigs \u2014 such as those favored by celebrity RV enthusiasts like Clarence Thomas and Robert De Niro \u2014 with flat-screen televisions and king-size beds.\n\nSome seek the country\u2019s most isolated nooks and crannies; others stay in plush RV resorts that offer more activities than costly summer camps for children. Most travel as couples; a few go solo.\n\nThey include former teachers, lawyers, doctors, firefighters, artists and corporate executives. Not that it matters.\n\nIn RV culture, \u201cno one asks what you\u2019ve done,\u201d said Kathi Vogler, 64, a retired nurse from Pompton Plains, N.J., who has traveled with her husband, John, a retired middle-school principal, for five years, \u201cjust where you\u2019ve been, where you\u2019re going, what you\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nThe best estimates say 750,000 to 1 million retirees call RVs home, according to Kevin Broom, director of media relations for the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association. He said independent studies suggested their ranks were growing.\n\nAlthough the recession took a toll on sales of new RVs, the number of RV owners 55 and older increased 20 percent, to 3.6 million, from 2005 through 2011.\n\nThat is not surprising. \u201cWe are seeing a lot more people, 55, 57, 58, who got laid off and decided they couldn\u2019t handle retirement,\u201d said David Gorin, an industry consultant from McLean, Va. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing more people who can use technology to work from the road and those who have just decided, \u2018Let\u2019s enjoy life while we can.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act may also make it easier for retirees who do not qualify for military benefits or Medicare to secure health insurance, making health care more accessible on the road.\n\nTech makes it easier\n\nBut the RV landscape has changed considerably in the last decade because of new technologies and the active lifestyle embraced by baby boomers.\n\nWhen Jaimie Hall Bruzenak, 69, began full-time RV traveling in 1992, cellphones, the Internet and satellite television were nascent technologies. She needed a service to forward her snail mail and an 800 number where friends could leave messages she would answer at pay phones\n\nNow online banking gives her and her husband, George, instant access to Social Security checks; Skype allows them to stay in touch with friends; and GPS makes it hard to get lost and easy to find stores.\n\nSolar panels help power the couple\u2019s rig. Oddly enough, these advances have made it easier for them to live in the wild.\n\n\u201cWe love boondocking,\u201d or camping without hookups for water or electricity, \u201cin national parks and other public lands, away from everything except nature,\u201d said Bruzenak, whose books on the lifestyle include \u201cRetire to an RV: The Roadmap to Affordable Retirement.\u201d\n\nParks and other public lands remain among the most popular destinations, said Jeff Crider, an industry consultant in Palm Desert, Calif. \u201cThere are about 6,000 public campgrounds in the country, many of them in the most beautiful places on earth,\u201d he said.\n\nBudget cuts create opportunities for these retirees, as park agencies increasingly rely on volunteers. Called VIPs (volunteers in park), they provide visitor information, patrol trails and present programs in exchange for camping privileges and an opportunity to explore the park in depth.\n\nAllen Parsons, 79, a former financial planner, and his wife, Bonnie, 69, a former physician assistant, who lived near Philadelphia, have served as \u201cvolunteer interpretive rangers\u201d at several national parks, including Yosemite, Yellowstone and Petrified Forest.\n\nSince hitting the road in 2007, they have observed bears, bison and many other species while wandering through every state in the Lower 48.\n\nHis voice filled with wonder, Allen Parsons recalled watching animals congregate at the remaining water holes when the Everglades dried out in the spring. \u201cAs crocodiles lazed nearby, we watched an osprey family in their massive nest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mother is feeding her three young fledglings, as big as the adults, and chases away a vulture, while she\u2019s calling to her mate to provide more fish. On our last day at Flamingo we saw the fledglings fly for the first time.\u201d\n\nSights and community\n\nTwo great myths surround RV owners. The first is they are in constant motion. Even if high gas prices and poor gas mileage did not make travel expensive \u2014 a typical large rig might get 7 to 10 mpg \u2014 owners say the destination is even more important than the journey. Instead of bouncing from attraction to attraction, most spend weeks or months camped at particular locations.\n\nThe second myth is that RV owners are a solitary lot, a gang of two. A prime attraction is a sense of community \u2014 Deadhead Bohemianism mixed with Mayberry traditionalism \u2014 kindled by its like-minded members.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim and Jaylene Myers knew exactly what they wanted to do when they retired: Go wherever whim and chance might take them in their 45-foot recreational vehicle.
