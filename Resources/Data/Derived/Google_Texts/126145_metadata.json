And while opponents of the law may be quick to judge the law\u2019s success or failure, numbers are lacking with experts say if they were to grade the law\u2019s first week, it would be \u201cincomplete.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe administration has remained tight-lipped on divulging exact numbers as to how many people have signed up for coverage on the exchanges, but anecdotal reports have been heavily weighted with tales of glitches and inaccessibility to enroll. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said 2.8 million people visited Healthcare.gov on its first day live, but declined to say how many people successfully enrolled in an insurance plan.\n\nDevon Herrick, senior analyst at the National Center for Policy Analysis, says the administration has been extremely aggressive in promoting the exchanges, holding nationwide rallies and enlisting celebrities to raise awareness and urging people to sign up for coverage\u2014specifically young people.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to get the \u2018young invincibles\u2019 into the market,\u201d Herrick says. \u201cThe administration really needs this, it\u2019s the cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act and they really need it to work.\u201d\n\nThe federal health exchange, which is operating in 36 states, wasn\u2019t operating as efficiently due to the amount of people visiting in large volumes. President Obama likened the glitches to what happens when major companies like Apple (AAPL) roll out a new product.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the capacity online, but that doesn\u2019t mean insurance won\u2019t sell,\u201d Herrick says. \u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services won\u2019t release any figures, but it appears to be more a trickle than a flood for the first week of open enrollment.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nStates that operate on their own exchanges seemed to fare better in getting people online, according to reports, Herrick says.\n\n\u201cKentucky, for example, seemed to go pretty well,\u201d Herrick says. \u201cBut they tested this in advance, so it was ready and it seemed to work. Some others, not as much\u2014and in states like Texas and Florida [with higher populations] that\u2019s more of a headache, so it makes sense.\u201d\n\nSusan Dentzer, senior policy advisor to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, says the federal exchange experienced more glitches than many expected, but individual state exchanges did better than predicted.\n\n\u201cThis is not \u2018glitch-free\u2019 by any means,\u201d Dentzer says. \u201cBut given the enormity of the task, it\u2019s not unexpected. In a perfect world, they would have been finding this out through testing six months ago.\u201d\n\nHerrick agrees, adding the government\u2019s plan was simply just too ambitious, and should have been tested one piece at a time.\n\nBut for Larry Kocot, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, its way to soon to pass judgment on how well the rollout fared. He says there has been too much emphasis on numbers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give this an incomplete,\u201d Kocot says. \u201cYou can\u2019t really evaluate in week one. We anticipated a lot of technical problems, as you have with any new programs as soon as someone flips the switch. But I don\u2019t think you can infer anything about open enrollment based on how many hits there were on a website.\u201d\n\nEnrollment completion can be judged once individuals actually pay for their premiums, Kocot says.\n\n\u201cThe process isn\u2019t over until someone pays a monthly premium, and that is the question people should be asking\u2014how many people actually completed the enrollment process and are in a plan?\u201d\n\nBut the open enrollment period still has nearly six months to go, ending on March 31, 2014, and coverage purchased on these exchanges won\u2019t kick in until the New Year, so many may wait until mid-December to actually sign up, he says.\n\nDentzer agrees it\u2019s too premature to grade the rollout. And glitches aside, she says the volume is positive.\n\n\u201cIt shows a lot of people are aware of these exchanges, and if the test is whether or not Americans are interested, the answer is yes,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 03:36:38 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The Department of Health and Human Services says 2.8M people visited the Affordable Care Act's site on day one, but experts say it\u2019s too early to grade its success in marketplaces.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/04/grading-obamacare-week-one.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/100713/0/0/100613_fbn_kate.jpg?ve=1", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services says 2.8M people visited the Affordable Care Act's site on day one, but experts say it\u2019s too early to grade its success in marketplaces.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Grading ObamaCare, Week 1: Incomplete"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Grading ObamaCare, Week 1: Incomplete\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/100713/0/0/100613_fbn_kate.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-04T20:48:59Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/04/grading-obamacare-week-one.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"9ecffa8e-d61f-43b0-b515-db56e77db39c\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "The Department of Health and Human Services says 2.8M people visited the Affordable Care Act's site on day one, but experts say it\u2019s too early to grade its success in marketplaces.", "dc.identifier": "9ecffa8e-d61f-43b0-b515-db56e77db39c", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services says 2.8M people visited the Affordable Care Act's site on day one, but experts say it\u2019s too early to grade its success in marketplaces.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Grading Obamacare, Week 1: Incomplete", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-10 03:36:38 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services says 2.8M people visited the Affordable Care Act's site on day one, but experts say it\u2019s too early to grade its success in marketplaces.", "title": "Grading ObamaCare, Week 1: Incomplete  | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/04/grading-obamacare-week-one.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/100713/0/0/100613_fbn_kate.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-10-04", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Grading ObamaCare, Week 1: Incomplete\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/100713/0/0/100613_fbn_kate.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-04T20:48:59Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/10/04/grading-obamacare-week-one.html\",\"post_id\":\"9ecffa8e-d61f-43b0-b515-db56e77db39c\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Kate Rogers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa0c\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchanges made their long-awaited debut this week, kicking off open enrollment on the same day the federal government went into shutdown mode.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the capacity online, but that doesn\u2019t mean insurance won\u2019t sell,\u201d Herrick says.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really evaluate in week one.\nPresident Obama likened the glitches to what happens when major companies like Apple (AAPL) roll out a new product.\nWe anticipated a lot of technical problems, as you have with any new programs as soon as someone flips the switch."}
