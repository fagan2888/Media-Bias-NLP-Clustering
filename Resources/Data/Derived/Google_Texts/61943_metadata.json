Maggie Hassan.\n\n\u201cAddiction is chronic illness,\u201d said keynote speaker Thomas McLellan, former deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy for the Obama administration. As such, its care should be covered by private and public health insurance in the same way as a condition such as diabetes, he said.\n\nBut although the Affordable Care Act mandates that treatments for substance misuse and mental illness should be covered like physical illnesses, only about 2.3 million out of the nearly 23 million Americans addicted to alcohol, opioids or cocaine are currently in treatment, he said. And even though another 40 million American adults suffer from less serious forms of substance use disorder, substance misuse remains misunderstood and often untreated, according to McLellan.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a constituency that\u2019s willing to stand up and demand their rights,\u201d he said.\n\nLocally, those with substance use disorder include about 40 pregnant mothers now receiving care at Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s Perinatal Addiction Treatment Program on Mechanic Street in Lebanon. \u201cMost of our patients have very difficult life circumstances,\u201d said Daisy Goodman, a nurse-midwife in the program.\n\nAbout 65 mothers and their newborns have received care since the program began in 2013.\n\nBut the challenge of substance misuse by pregnant women is more widespread. Of the 1,150 babies born in a year at Mary Hitchcock Hospital in Lebanon, about 80 are at risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, said Catherine Milliken, director of the program.\n\nThe official statewide total of confirmed deaths from drug overdoses in 2015 was 437, according to a May 2 release from New Hampshire\u2019s chief medical examiner. That was more than double the death toll in 2013, according to the CME. This year, there have been 82 confirmed drug overdose deaths, and another 72 deaths were awaiting toxicology test results, the CME reported.\n\n\u201cThe heroin and opioid crisis is the most urgent public health and public safety issue facing our state,\u201d Hassan said in a release issued after Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nEarlier, Hassan welcomed attendees with the announcement that this week, the state will launch a 24-hour substance misuse hotline. She also urged her listeners to lobby legislators who have before them legislation to expand New Hampshire\u2019s drug courts, beef up law enforcement efforts to stem the flow of illicit drugs and upgrade the state\u2019s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.\n\nThe PDMP is an electronic database where pharmacists are required to report all prescriptions filled for opium-related drugs. Physicians can use the database to see if their patients are obtaining some dangerous drugs from multiple providers.\n\nMichelle Ricco Jonas, the program manager, said that a provision of state law that forbade the use of taxpayers\u2019 money to support the system had been erased, but that $130,000 needed to pay for system enhancements had not yet been appropriated.\n\nIn a luncheon speech, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack stressed the importance of connecting prescription drug monitoring systems across state lines. Currently, New Hampshire\u2019s system lacks that capability, but it should be added later this year, Ricco Jonas said later.\n\nVilsack also called for law enforcement to \u201cstem the incredible flow of this poison into our states, our communities, our homes\u201d and for naloxone, a drug that can be used to reverse a narcotic overdose, to be made more readily available to first responders and families of those with substance use disorder.\n\nMaterial from The Associated Press was used in this story.
