He didn\u2019t always possess such mellow gravitas.\n\nGrowing up in a broken home in Detroit, he says, \u201cI used to go after people with baseball bats and chains and everything else. When I was 14 I tried to stab someone.\u201d\n\nLucky for both young Ben and his victim, the knife broke on a large metal belt buckle. \u201cI realized I tried to kill somebody over nothing,\u201d Carson says on a break from a tour to promote his inspiring book, \u201cOne Nation: What We Can All Do to Save America\u2019s Future.\u201d It\u2019s in its third week at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. (Yet the Times, like the LA Times, The Washington Post and Time magazine, has completely ignored it. The book that sits just behind it on the list, left-wing economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d has generated at least 20 Times pieces.)\n\nAfter the stabbing incident, Carson recalls, it was time to choose what kind of man he was going to be.\n\n\u201cI realized there was no chance of becoming a doctor with a temper like that. So I locked myself in the bathroom and I prayed with the Bible.\n\n\u201cI came to an understanding that to lash out at people, rather than being a sign of strength, was a sign of weakness. I also recognized that selfishness had a lot to do with everything. After three hours I walked out of the bathroom and my temper was gone.\u201d\n\nCarson went on to Yale on his way to becoming chief of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. In 1987, he pulled off the medical miracle of the decade when he separated twins born conjoined at the head.\n\nMeanwhile, he found mollification worked far better than anger as a coping strategy. As a surgeon, he was often mistaken for an orderly by nurses. \u201cAfter many years of hard work to achieve the title of doctor, many might say that I would have been justified in reacting angrily,\u201d he writes in \u201cOne Nation.\u201d Instead, he said, he tried to look at things from the nurse\u2019s point of view. \u201cThe only black males she had seen come onto the floor were orderlies . . . Why would she think differently in my case?\u201d\n\nNurses would be mortified when they learned of their mistake. Carson\u2019s policy? To be extra nice to them. Then: \u201cI would have another friend for life.\u201d\n\nLast year Carson made millions of friends for life when his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast went viral. Speaking extemporaneously and with an ensorcelling simplicity, he sketched out a vision for the country\u2019s future heavy on education, personal and fiscal responsibility and national pride.\n\nIn that speech, and in \u201cOne Nation,\u201d Carson makes a special target of political correctness, which he identifies as a destructive force, traceable to \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d author Saul Alinsky, that shuts down conversation, inhibits frankness and generally drives people further apart.\n\n\u201cIf we are to survive as a united nation,\u201d Carson writes, \u201cwe must learn how to engage in civil discussions of our differences without becoming bitter enemies . . . Let\u2019s talk about the tough issues without scrutinizing every word and castigating anyone who dares to violate the PC rules.\u201d\n\nNow mobs greet him at his book signings. A super PAC dedicated to drafting him to run raked in more money last quarter than did the similar Ready for Hillary group.\n\nCarson has been coy about a political run and inched away from that in a chat on Thursday. \u201cI continue to prefer not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a long and arduous career and I was kind a looking forward to retirement to be honest. Also I\u2019ve noticed that everyone who goes into that office comes out looking about 20 years older.\u201d\n\nCarson, 62, says he hopes another candidate with respect for the Constitution and our shared values steps forward.\n\nAnd \u201cif the American people have decided that they no longer subscribe to the original vision of America and want to subscribe to the government\u2019s cradle-to-grave program, then who am I to say they\u2019re wrong?\u201d he says. \u201cA lot will be decided in November.\u201d\n\nJust to be safe, though, left-wingers have begun dumping on Carson. Times columnist Charles Blow is one of many who insisted that the National Prayer Breakfast speech amounted to \u201cblasting\u201d President Obama, who was sitting nearby.\n\nAs you can read in \u201cOne Nation,\u201d which opens with a transcript of that speech, Carson didn\u2019t mention, or even allude to, the president, except in his opening round of thank-you\u2019s.\n\nAsked about Obama now, Carson says, \u201cI would rate him as doing a tremendous job when it comes to fundamentally changing this country. If that\u2019s what you want, he\u2019s doing great.\u201d\n\nCarson does create controversy, though. I asked him whether it was a poor choice of words to call ObamaCare the \u201cworst thing that has happened in this country since slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an excellent choice of words,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s because the most important thing a person has is their health and their health care and who you subject control of that to anyone but yourself, especially government bureaucrats, you have fundamentally changed the power structure of America.\u201d\n\nHis book tour winding down, Carson is looking forward to going home to learn to play the organ. But he closes by giving conservative acolytes some fresh hope that he might run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to see that people are waking up by responding,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real chance that we can get America moving in the same direction again.
