From 2001 to 2013, the rate of prescription drug-related overdose deaths more than doubled.\n\nAnd while more money has been spent on treatment in recent years, the resources necessary to ensure wider access to treatment haven\u2019t kept up with the explosive demand, say the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe found that 80 percent of people with an opioid addiction are not getting treatment,\u201d says study leader Brendan Saloner, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Bloomberg School. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t changed, despite the growing and more complicated problem of opioid abuse and dependence.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Saloner and Shankar Karthikeyan, a recent Master of Public Policy (MPP) graduate from the Bloomberg School, analyzed data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, a nationally representative survey of people ages 12 and older, to identify 6,770 people meeting clinical criteria for an opioid use disorder.\n\nParticipants self-reported that they were either physically dependent on opioids or that their use of opioids caused personal, financial, or legal problems. The researchers compared two time frames: From 2004 to 2008 and from 2009 to 2013.\n\nThe findings showed that approximately 20 percent of those with a drug use disorder were in treatment during each time period. Since opioid use rose so dramatically during this period, the actual number of people in treatment increased from about 293,000 individuals in 2004 to 473,000 individuals in 2013, nearly a 50 percent increase, Saloner says.\n\nThe percentage of this population using heroin jumped dramatically from 24 percent in the first time period to 35 percent in the latter one. It is widely believed that many people addicted to prescription painkillers like oxycontin are switching to heroin, which is a cheaper alternative.\n\nOne pressing problem is that some people do not have access to a drug treatment program in their area. Also, many state Medicaid programs restrict access to buprenorphine and methadone, medications for managing addiction to opioids. Saloner says they work by preventing the body\u2019s physical withdrawal while also keeping users from becoming high. They can also help prevent overdose in people who experience a relapse.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge in this is getting more people into settings where they can get methadone or buprenorphine,\u201d says Saloner.\n\n\u201cWe also need to think about changing the conversation about opioid addiction, which is a chronic relapsing illness, just like diabetes. Referring to drug users as junkies or criminals keeps people with addiction in the shadows and away from getting help. They may be open to treatment but they never seek it out because of the stigma associated with their addiction.\u201d\n\nHe says that getting more people health insurance through the Affordable Care Act may also improve access to affordable treatment.\n\nThe findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nSource: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n\n\n\nMan in therapy photo by shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the significant rise in deaths from prescription painkillers and heroin over the past decade, only about 20 percent of people who suffer from opioid", "og": {"site_name": "Psych Central News", "description": "Despite the significant rise in deaths from prescription painkillers and heroin over the past decade, only about 20 percent of people who suffer from opioid dependence and addiction are receiving treatment, according to a new study by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
