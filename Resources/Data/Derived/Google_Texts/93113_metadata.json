Bill Haslam is held on Legislative Plaza Saturday, Jan. 17, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)</p>\n\nAs his predecessor might say, Gov. Bill Haslam is embarking on a hazardous voyage into legislative waters this week after four years of smooth sailing. Shipwreck is a real possibility.\n\nFormer Gov. Phil Bredesen was famous for nautical analogies in his speeches on steering the Tennessee \u201cship of state\u201d with a legislator crew. It\u2019s somewhat curious that the most perilous voyage in his eight-year reign was trying to slash enrollment in TennCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, over objections from fellow Democrats, then in the majority at the Legislature, and with the support of most Republicans.\n\nNow we have Haslam trying to expand TennCare over the objections of many members of his own party \u2014 Republicans, who now enjoy supermajority status \u2014 while backed by most of the Democrats.\n\nSo the past and present governors took different tacks. Yet Haslam has praised Bredesen for his actions at the time, given the circumstances he faced, and Bredesen backs expansion today, given the circumstances created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nBredesen ultimately prevailed in cutting about 170,000 people from TennCare enrollment after considerable controversy in courtrooms as well as in Legislatorland. Haslam\u2019s success in adding about 280,000 (an estimate increased by about 80,000 last week) will be decided in a special legislative session that begins Monday.\n\nOnce upon a time, the great bugaboo in Tennessee politics was the idea of a state income tax. In today\u2019s environment, the great bugaboo of Tennessee politics, at least for Republicans, is President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law.\n\nErgo, every Republican legislator fears that if he or she votes for Insure Tennessee, he or she will be attacked by an opponent in a GOP primary for supporting Obamacare. That makes for an easy attack ad \u2014 some legislators have already been attacked on that basis \u2014 as a lead-up to the special session.\n\nTo overcome this political predisposition of Republicans, the governor and his supporters \u2014 and there are a lot in the businesss/health care community \u2014 must raise a countering concern and, ideally, have a means of compromise and horse trading.\n\nHaslam can make a good case that logic and reason dictate support for his proposal, but logic and reason sometimes do not count for much in politics. Explaining such things is a lot more difficult than shouting from the other side that \u201cIt\u2019s Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAs for a counter-threat, there potentially is one, especially for rural Republicans. Leaders in rural communities understand that their small hospitals face bankruptcy in the current environment and would not if Insure Tennessee is approved. And a lot of their constituents stand to benefit individually. Thus, there\u2019s at least a chance that voting no will make key people mad and, perhaps, even provoke a primary challenge.\n\nOne rural Republican expressed willingness last week to vote for the governor\u2019s proposal, even at the risk of being attacked as an Obama-loving liberal, if \u2014 and only if \u2014 the vote will lead to passage. If the governor\u2019s plan is doomed, why take the risk? And, right now, the legislator said doom looms.\n\nWhich brings up the horse-trading possibilities. On that front, Vanderbilt University professor James Blumstein, who was a lawyer supporting Bredesen\u2019s efforts to cut TennCare enrollment, suggested an array of possible legislative revisions to the governor\u2019s proposal during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last week.\n\nOne key suggestion: Make legislative approval tentative, subject to a final legislative signoff once the waiver document comes back from the federal folk in final format rather than buying into something that is now arguably a \u201cpig in a poke.\u201d That, Blumstein said, would actually \u201cstrengthen the governor\u2019s hand\u201d in confronting a federal bureaucracy he deemed \u201cadversarial\u201d and perhaps result in a \u201cbetter deal\u201d for Tennessee.\n\nThe governor is likely to oppose such a move, which would defeat the purpose of calling a special session to resolve the issue promptly and finally \u2014 a notion that some suggest is among Haslam\u2019s early and multiple mistakes in charting a course for Insure Tennessee. But that would provide some political cover for those ready to abandon what they see as a sinking Insure Tennessee ship. And maybe the seas will be less choppy after a few weeks in port.\n\nTom Humphrey, retired Nashville bureau chief, may be reached at tomhumphrey3@aol.com.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Tom Humphrey: Haslam faces rough seas for health reform", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/opinion/columnists/tom-humphrey/tom-humphrey-haslam-faces-rough-seas-for-health-reform-ep-904184115-353609971.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/tennesseeinauguratio_2_1421519627670_12548693_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 448}, "type": "article", "description": "As his predecessor might say, Gov.
