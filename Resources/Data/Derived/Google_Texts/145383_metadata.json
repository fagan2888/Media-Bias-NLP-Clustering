And then, as night follows the day: \u201cI was the Grand Marshal, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the Grand Marshal down Fifth Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade,\u201d Trump said at a debate in February. He brought up his role as Grand Marshal in the parade to a CNN interviewer in December, and to a Christian Broadcasting Network interviewer in January. If you ask Donald Trump why he will be a great American president for Israel, he will, like your great uncle who tells the same exaggerated story about how drunk he got at his wedding at every family gathering, undoubtedly bring up the time he was named Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade. This is his defining Israeli validation.\n\nHere is my followup question to Trump\u2019s assertion that he was Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue in 2004: What???\n\nHere\u2019s just one more followup: Huh?????\n\nThe \u201cGrand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade\u201d line lacks any meaning whatsoever. It should be convincing to absolutely no one, and yet there it is, trotted out so often, and with such confidence, to questions about Israel, as though Donald Trump had won the endorsement of Golda Meir\u2019s estate.\n\nWhat makes the line so ridiculous? Part of it is the sentence, and the sentiment, itself. \u201cI was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade several years ago\u201d is, out of context, a hilarious thing to say. What a weird, semi-prestigious title to brag about! It sounds like a line of dialogue spoken by a depressed Alec Baldwin character in a Wes Anderson film. The line should be soundtracked by a Moldy Peaches song.\n\n\u201cI was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade\u201d is not a policy bona fide; it is a character quirk. It\u2019s a detail in a 1960s Philip Roth novella. It exists in the same comedy universe as Will Ferrell attempting to exert dominance over his family\u2019s dinner table conversation by shouting \u201cI DRIVE A DODGE STRATUS\u201d over and over.\n\nBeing the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade more than a decade ago is an answer you give in an interview for a job you aren\u2019t qualified for. \u201cWhat leadership experience do you have?\u201d the interviewer asks. You are sweating profusely, as you have no leadership experience, and after several seconds pause, you answer: \u201cWell, I was president of the chess team in middle school. I think that leadership experience would translate well here when I become CEO of JPMorgan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t really looking for \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat leadership experience do I have?\u201d You soldier on. \u201cWell, my siblings and I auditioned for Family Feud several years ago and everyone agreed that, had we taped a show, I would have been the captain of our team. It was a tremendous honor.\u201d\n\nOf course, having led a middle school chess team does represent leadership experience, whereas marching in a parade with the word \u201cIsrael\u201d in it more than a decade ago represents nothing. Citing your involvement in a parade as a foreign policy credential is a step above claiming that you have many Israeli friends. Could Donald Trump negotiate a better trade deal with China? He once successfully argued for a 10% discount at a Sichuan restaurant in 1975, so you tell me.\n\nAlso, as an aside: Isn\u2019t it fun to envision Donald Trump\u2014whose persistent dourness, joylessness, and anger suggests the general opposite mood you typically find at a parade\u2014as the Grand Marshal of anything?\n\nCan\u2019t you just imagine Trump, schvitzing in the summer heat in one of his dark suits, jubilant Israeli music blasting at his back, lips pursed, eyes squinting, wondering how much longer he\u2019ll have to be at this stupid parade before he can go back to his air-conditioned apartment to drink a beautiful lemonade and read Golf Magazine?\n\nAnyway, having absolutely nothing relevant to say about an issue isn\u2019t necessarily a problem for a campaign that has been propelled by very little substance, and it is perfectly Trumpian that, when challenged on something, he points to a meaningless honorific he once received as counter-evidence. It is also entirely consistent that the parade for which Donald Trump was Grand Marshal was called the Salute to Israel Parade, and not the Israeli Day Parade.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump as Grand Marshall in Salute to Israel Parade in 2004 https://t.co/57ZDluVDCc #GOPdebate pic.twitter.com/MHTVC99GLd \u2014 Michelle Ye Hee Lee (@myhlee) March 11, 2016\n\nWhether a Donald Trump presidency would actually serve Israel well, I will leave to the experts.
