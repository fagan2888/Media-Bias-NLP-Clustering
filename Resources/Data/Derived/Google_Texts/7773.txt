Texas’ revenue is growing strong, but the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas foresees multiple challenges to the state’s main revenue sources — the state sales tax.

Low taxes and a light-regulatory environment have helped Texas grow fast, but state lawmakers increasingly will face more health and education needs that may need additional funding, Dallas Fed senior economist Jason Saving wrote in the bank’s latest issue of its Southwest Economy publication. Education and health care consume 75 percent of the state’s annual budget, he said.

The state’s revenue grew faster than most other large states, except for California, in the first half of this year vs. the same period last year. Texas’ 8 percent revenue growth is nearly twice the national rate.

While Texas levies various taxes, sales tax accounts for more than half of all state tax revenue. Last year’s 54.3 percent share of sales tax revenue was larger than all of the other state taxes combined. (See chart above right.)

Saving sees a few major challenges to the state’s dependence on sales tax:

– The rise in Internet commerce and issues over sales tax collections on online sales could Texas revenue. Texas’ relatively high sales tax rate (6.25 percent) might divert commerce to other states.

– Because Texas opted out of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, about 1.2 million residents can’t obtain coverage from that program.

– Will education funding will be sufficient to keep up with future employer demands as Texas’ population continues to grow faster than the national average?

Texas legislators will meet in January to draft a new state budget.
