The new effort, named \u201cThe Real Cost\u201d campaign, will use both video and print ads to show youth aged 12 to 17 that smoking does have real consequences, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cWe know that early intervention is critical, with almost nine out of every 10 regular adult smokers picking up their first cigarette by age 18,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg. \u201cToday marks a historic moment as we launch the FDA\u2019s first-ever national education campaign to prevent tobacco use among our nation\u2019s youth, and we bring to life the real costs that are of the most concern to young people.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,200 kids under the age of 18 try their first cigarette each day and more than 700 kids under the age of 18 become daily smokers. The Real Cost campaign aims to specifically save their lives. With ads on MTV and in Teen Vogue, as well as social media use, the FDA will run anti-smoking messages in more than 200 markets in the United States. The new multimedia campaign will cost a whopping $115 million, according to USA Today. It will target about 10 million American teens who are already experimenting with cigarettes. The ads were sanctioned under authority granted to the FDA by the Family Smoking and Tobacco Control Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009. The Act allows the FDA \u201cto regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products to protect public health.\u201d\n\nMatthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, says the investment is well worth it. \"[It\u2019s] one of the most important efforts in recent times in the effort to reduce youth smoking,\" said Myers, according to USA Today. \"The FDA has carefully researched which ads will have the greatest impact on at-risk youth. These were designed with the same scientific rigor that Madison Avenue uses to market its products.\"\n\nOne of the commercials, which was posted on YouTube, shows a teen paying for cigarettes at a store counter. As she pays, her skin is scraped from her cheek and wrinkles begin to appear. The ad says that cigarette smoking \u201cwill cost her\u201d her smooth and youthful skin. That ad as well as print ads will emphasize the outward physical effects of smoking.\n\nThe campaign is set to launch nationwide on Feb. 11 and will last for at least 12 months. Watch a few of the ads below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda teen anti-smoking campaign, real cost", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration announced a new campaign aimed at preventing teen tobacco use. \"The Real Cost\" campaign will use multimedia ads to show kids the real consequences of smoking.", "title": "The FDA Asks Teens 'What Are Cigarettes Costing You?'
