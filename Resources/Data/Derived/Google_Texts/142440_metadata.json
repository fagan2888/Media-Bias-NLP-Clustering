Live stream courtesy WMAZ-TV Macon.\n\nThree novice politicians will face off tonight at the Georgia National Fair in pursuit of Georgia\u2019s vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nCandidates Michelle Nunn (D), David Perdue (R) and Amanda Swafford (L) will compete for the office held by retiring Senator Saxby Chambliss (R) in a debate hosted by WMAZ-13 Macon. Frank Malloy, an anchor for the station, will moderate.\n\nAlthough none of the candidates have held major office before \u2014 Nunn comes from the nonprofit sector, Perdue and Swafford from the private \u2014 the major-party players nonetheless enjoy statewide name recognition: Nunn\u2019s father was a U.S. Senator himself, and Perdue\u2019s cousin, Sonny, is Georgia\u2019s former governor.\n\nSwafford is the surprise element in this race: her presence on the ballot could force a January run-off if neither Nunn or Perdue rake in a majority of votes. Currently, the GOP needs to gain six seats to take control of the Senate. Worst case scenario, a runoff could send the Senate into 2015 with no sense of which party is in charge.\n\nThis has placed Georgia, somewhat surprisingly, staunchly within both Democratic and Republican crosshairs. Team Nunn is counting on a conservative third-party candidate to pull votes from her opponent, and the Peach State\u2019s changing demographics \u2014 Democratic-leaning minority groups make up an increasingly large portion of the eligible voting pool \u2014 are keeping this traditionally-GOP-held seat in play.\n\nAs PBS NewsHour\u2019s Domenico Montanaro has reported, both Nunn and Perdue have been playing up their outsider status. Tonight\u2019s debate will be important to shaping these newcomers\u2019 narratives, and will likely focus on their respective plans to fix Washington. Perdue has been outspoken in his criticism of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, and immigration reform. Like other Democrats running in red states, Nunn will have to highlight her moderation and bipartisanship on issues like health care and environmental regulations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three novice politicians will face off tonight at the Georgia National Fair in pursuit of Georgia\u2019s vacant U.S. Senate seat.", "pubdate": 20141007, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Three novice politicians will face off tonight at the Georgia National Fair in pursuit of Georgia\u2019s vacant U.S. Senate seat.", "title": "WATCH LIVE: Georgia Senate debate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Georgia_Senatecropped.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/watch-live-georgia-senate-debate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Three novice politicians will face off tonight at the Georgia National Fair in pursuit of Georgia\u2019s vacant U.S. Senate seat.", "title": "WATCH LIVE: Georgia Senate debate", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Georgia_Senatecropped.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "michelle nunn"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Amanda Swafford, david perdue, debates, Election 2014, georgia, michelle nunn"}, "article_summary": "Watch the Georgia debate for U.S. Senate at 7 p.m. EDT tonight, featuring Michelle Nunn (D), David Perdue (R), and Amanda Swafford (L).\nThree novice politicians will face off tonight at the Georgia National Fair in pursuit of Georgia\u2019s vacant U.S. Senate seat.\nLike other Democrats running in red states, Nunn will have to highlight her moderation and bipartisanship on issues like health care and environmental regulations.\nCandidates Michelle Nunn (D), David Perdue (R) and Amanda Swafford (L) will compete for the office held by retiring Senator Saxby Chambliss (R) in a debate hosted by WMAZ-13 Macon.\nWorst case scenario, a runoff could send the Senate into 2015 with no sense of which party is in charge."}
