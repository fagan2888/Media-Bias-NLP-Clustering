The agreement became amendable in May and the two side began talks in February.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is the second largest carrier at Denver International Airport, claiming 26 percent of the market share in June. The carrier officially acquired AirTran in May 2011 and have since been going through the process of merging the carriers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "airline mergers,airline unions,AirTran,flight attendants", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2013/09/03/airtran-flight-attendants/10765/", "site_name": "The Balance Sheet", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Southwest Airlines-AirTran flight attendants reach tentative agreement"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Southwest Airlines reaches tentative agreement with AirTran flight attendant group", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2013/09/03/airtran-flight-attendants/10765/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@kristenpainter", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that the carrier has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing its AirTran Airways flight attendants."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc429\"", "article_summary": "Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that the carrier has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing its AirTran Airways flight attendants.\n\u201cThis contract includes progressive concepts that are beneficial for AirTran Flight Attendants, while supporting Company objectives.\u201dWhat exactly these \u201cprogressive concepts\u201d involve remains unclear as details of the agreement have not been released.\nSouthwest Airlines is the second largest carrier at Denver International Airport, claiming 26 percent of the market share in June.\nThe agreement with the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) still must be ratified by its members.\nThe carrier officially acquired AirTran in May 2011 and have since been going through the process of merging the carriers."}
