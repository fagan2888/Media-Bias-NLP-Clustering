Any whiff that the GOP\u2019s Plan B is a continuation of Obamacare is bound to spark furious protests from the conservative base, putting pressure on the presidential hopefuls to respond. Cruz, for one, would press for a wholesale repeal of the law \u2014 or to allow states to opt out of Obamacare \u2014 if the high court provides the opening.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTop Republicans warn those conservatives are playing with fire.\n\n\u201cThings can\u2019t be turned on a dime,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. \u201cPeople can run for president, but we\u2019ve actually got to solve a problem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest example of how presidential politics continues to be the biggest wild card facing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as he tries to work his will in a body where any one senator can upset his plans. Already, White House hopefuls have altered McConnell\u2019s strategy on Iran and the PATRIOT Act. The aftermath of the King v. Burwell case could be next.\n\n\u201cCorralling our presidentials on a plan or a solution is going to be a bit of a challenge,\u201d said John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader. \u201cEveryone is going to be running away from \u2014 lock, stock and barrel \u2014 any connection whatsoever to the current program.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans in the Senate, the issue is particularly urgent since GOP seats are in contention in next year\u2019s elections in states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, Missouri and North Carolina \u2014 all of which adopted the federal exchange and are at risk of losing the subsidies depending on how the court rules. If Congress can\u2019t find a resolution, Republicans in these states worry they\u2019ll face a sharp backlash from people who rely on the subsidies to defray their health care costs.\n\n\u201cIt would hurt real people. That\u2019s something any member of Congress, any public elected official, has got to respond to,\u201d said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who faces a tough reelection next year. He\u2019s the author of a leading Republican plan to respond to the court\u2019s ruling by extending the subsidies for 18 months, but scrapping the employer and individual mandates, a nonstarter for Democrats. \u201cYou just can\u2019t stop something cold turkey. It\u2019s not responsible. It\u2019s not a fair thing to do.\u201d\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules against Obamacare \u2014 a decision is expected within weeks \u2014 it would strike down subsidies for millions of people who are enrolled in states with a federally run exchange. Though some experts believe the high court is more likely to preserve the law, the possibility that it won\u2019t has Senate Republicans scrambling for a replacement strategy.\n\nGOP senators have discussed several proposals behind closed doors but are nowhere near consensus. After vowing for years to scrap the law and replace it, the party is rife with tension over what it would do if the onus was suddenly on it to come up with an alternative. Even if Republicans could settle on a legislative response, President Barack Obama would almost certainly veto it.\n\nWith a ruling expected this month, McConnell has signaled his preference by signing on to Johnson\u2019s plan. McConnell also has signaled an interest in a separate approach by freshman Sen. Ben Sasse, a conservative from Nebraska who has proposed offering financial assistance through tax credits over 18 months but reducing them gradually over that time period.\n\nThe Johnson proposal is supported by a majority of GOP senators, no small feat for a party that has struggled to find consensus on the health care law. But despite the support of 32 GOP senators, the proposal faces stiff headwinds from presidential hopefuls like Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul, as well as House conservatives.\n\nForget a temporary patch of Obamacare, the Kentucky Republican said in an interview: The party should push for a whole new law.\n\n\u201cI would like to legalize inexpensive insurance policies, give more choice, let people choose their doctor, expand health savings accounts, help people save for their insurance,\u201d Paul said. Asked if his plan would involve extending the subsidies, the Kentucky Republican replied: \u201cA better way would be to try to legalize inexpensive insurance policies. \u2026 The president has made it illegal to buy inexpensive insurance in our country.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview last week, Cruz said a victory for his side in the court case would be a \u201creal opportunity for Congress to lead.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn a perfect world, we would take that opportunity to repeal Obamacare. At a minimum, we should allow states to opt out.\u201d\n\nCruz has his own Plan B: Scuttle the entire health care law, though he would allow for a six-month transition period in order to let the markets and states adjust to a full-scale repeal.\n\nAnother GOP hopeful, Marco Rubio of Florida, has praised Sasse\u2019s plan as a \u201ccredible\u201d alternative. The senator\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to a March op-ed published on Fox News\u2019 website laying out a four-point health care plan, when asked how he\u2019d like Congress to respond to a court ruling against the White House.\n\nOne Senate Republican who is running for president is firmly in favor of Johnson\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should terminate them until we have a plan,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said of the subsidies.\n\nMcConnell and Senate Republican leaders have little margin for error. The most likely legislative vehicle to push their health care alternative will come through the so-called budget reconciliation process, which can pass with just 51 votes since the legislation would not be subject to a filibuster. That means McConnell can lose no more than three Republicans \u2014 no sure bet in a caucus with a band of conservatives and presidential hopefuls. Even then, whatever the GOP approved would be subject to a presidential veto.\n\n\u201cIt may be a problem,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said of presidential politics.\n\nBut some conservatives have left their names off of Johnson\u2019s bill out of reluctance to associate themselves with Obamacare, even though his legislation would knock out central planks of the law. That opposition may only harden if presidential hopefuls like Cruz and others whip up fervor among the grass roots and the conservative rank and file.\n\nGOP leaders say they\u2019re aware of the problem they could face, though they argue it won\u2019t be clear how stiff the opposition is until the ruling comes down.\n\nIf the court rules against Obamacare and Republicans are under pressure to fix the subsidy issue, some House and Senate conservatives are worried they\u2019ll be accused of salvaging a law they\u2019ve voted dozens of time to repeal. Nevertheless, the thinking in some conservative circles is that the president is going to veto whatever Republicans pass anyway \u2014 because the plan is likely to gut Obamacare\u2019s mandates \u2014 so they might as well go big to show what the party stands for rather than pass \u201cObamacare-lite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very strong argument, particularly when it gets vetoed anyway,\u201d said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). \u201cLet\u2019s just bring up our replacement bill and vote on it and send it to the president and he can veto that.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the government shut down when Senate conservatives, led by Cruz and Mike Lee (R-Utah), rallied the right in the House to back only spending bills that attempted to defund the president\u2019s signature domestic policy initiative. But conservatives hope things will be different this time: They aren\u2019t tying their efforts to a spending bill \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nBut even if they can\u2019t get the votes of all the senators running for president, GOP leaders are at least hoping that the presidential politics leave some room for governing.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican has great concerns about the law,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). \u201cI want to do nothing to protect this law. I do want to protect the people who have found that they thought they were following the law and now find out the president is acting illegally.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans running for president could stymie the party's response to an anti-Obamacare ruling.", "title": "GOP rife with tensions over Obamacare-SCOTUS response", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/gop-rife-with-tensions-over-obamacare-scotus-response-119040.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/15/150615_ted_cruz_rand_paul_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,Elections,Republicans,Health Care,2016 Elections,Mitch McConnell,PATRIOT Act,Supreme Court,Affordable Care Act,John Cornyn,Health Insurance", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans running for president could stymie the party's response to an anti-Obamacare ruling.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But even if they can\u2019t get the votes of all the senators running for president, GOP leaders are at least hoping that the presidential politics leave some room for governing.\nBut the GOP senators running for president \u2014 starting but not ending with firebrand Ted Cruz \u2014 threaten to stymie their leaders\u2019 carefully hatched plans.\nEven if Republicans could settle on a legislative response, President Barack Obama would almost certainly veto it.\nAnother GOP hopeful, Marco Rubio of Florida, has praised Sasse\u2019s plan as a \u201ccredible\u201d alternative.\nThough some experts believe the high court is more likely to preserve the law, the possibility that it won\u2019t has Senate Republicans scrambling for a replacement strategy."}
