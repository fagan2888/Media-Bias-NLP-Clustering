It always elicits laughter, even from people who pay off their credit card balances every month and enjoy reward points for their frequent business.\n\nWhy do people laugh?\n\nIs it because the phrase is so ridiculous? Can credit itself \u2014 the lending of funds to individuals or companies or government \u2014 actually be evil?\n\nIt sounds preposterous because the use of credit has become so ingrained. Most people can hardly escape it. We borrow to buy everything. You can even use a credit card to pay your tax bill.\n\nBut in many cases, the things purchased with credit have long been consumed or tossed out while the debt lingers on.\n\nI\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations about credit lately because April is Financial Literacy Month, a time when consumer advocates, regulators and, yes, even financial companies attempt to help people manage their money and credit better.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of academic research on consumer behavior as it relates to credit. Adding to that examination is a new book, Consumer Credit and the American Economy, by Thomas A. Durkin, Michael E. Staten, Gregory Elliehausen and Todd J. Zywicki.\n\n\u201cWe all think we know about credit, but do we?\u201d the authors ask in the preface of the book. They then spend 710 pages, including a lengthy index, dissecting consumer credit and its history. This is not light reading, although it\u2019s thoroughly enlightening.\n\nOne passage early in the book really stuck with me.\n\n\u201cMost purchases on credit could be accomplished by accumulating cash first and then buying the item later, but this often is not the time pattern consumers prefer,\u201d the authors write. \u201cFor many goods, accumulating cash first could mean doing without the item or paying for more expensive substitute services for a period that might amount to years, both of which are costly.\u201d\n\nThat observation is the crux of credit. It raises the question: Is credit helpful or harmful?\n\nActually, I believe it\u2019s both.\n\nCredit has been most helpful in enabling families to become homeowners. And it\u2019s through homeownership that many Americans build wealth. So yes, the ability to borrow has propelled many families into middle-class status.\n\nBut credit has also pushed families to their financial limit. They bought things when they should have waited until they had the cash.\n\nI often focus on people who use credit to live above their means, chastising them for being irresponsible. But I see a lot of people who are living right at their means.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the distinction: Yes, they can make the credit payments. Technically, by the measures used by lenders, they can handle the debt load based on their income \u2014 gross, not net, I might add \u2014 on top of their other debt obligations. On paper, they don\u2019t appear to be living above their means.\n\nBut if anything goes wrong \u2014 an illness, divorce, job loss \u2014 these folks are living on the edge.\n\nInstead of saving more, they\u2019ve paid the cost to maintain that consumer debt. It\u2019s much easier to ride out a financial crisis if there isn\u2019t debt to carry.\n\nI see the effects of credit when I teach and coach people one-on-one and in groups. I have worked with people who either used credit recklessly or were the victims of predatory lending. I\u2019ve also seen the results of people who overestimated their ability to handle their credit cards or loans.\n\nSo I\u2019m on a mission to sound the alarm about credit and to help consumers understand the consequences of indebtedness. Today, you may be able to handle it. But what about tomorrow?\n\nIn Word Origins, author John Ayto says evil can be translated as \u201cexceeding due limits.\u201d Isn\u2019t that exactly what many consumers do when they use credit? In good financial times and bad, they exceed what they should spend because they can.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In many cases, the things purchased with credit have long been consumed or tossed out, while the debt lingers on.", "og": {"description": "In many cases, the things purchased with credit have long been consumed or tossed out, while the debt lingers on.", "title": "Michelle Singletary: The curse of credit", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150418-michelle-singletary-the-curse-of-credit.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-18T23:14:29Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-18T23:13:49Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Michelle Singletary: The curse of credit\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150418-michelle-singletary-the-curse-of-credit.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2263029\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-18T23:13:49Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"Michelle Singletary\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-18T23:13:49Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0905\"", "article_summary": "I have worked with people who either used credit recklessly or were the victims of predatory lending.\nThey then spend 710 pages, including a lengthy index, dissecting consumer credit and its history.\nAdding to that examination is a new book, Consumer Credit and the American Economy, by Thomas A.
