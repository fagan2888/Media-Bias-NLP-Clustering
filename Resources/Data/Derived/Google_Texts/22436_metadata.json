Sallie Sacker did just that when her husband Jon lay on his death bed earlier this year. She opted for the Hemolung lung respiratory technology, and today her husband is the first individual in the United States to have received the revolutionary treatment, but most importantly, he is alive.\n\nLife-Saving Technology\n\nEarlier this year, Jon Sacker\u2019s family gathered around his hospital bed, believing they would soon say goodbye to their beloved. Sacker has suffered from cystic fibrosis for his entire life, and after his first lung transplant failed, Sacker\u2019s health took a turn for the worst. Although the Oklahoma man was hooked up to a ventilator to aid with breathing, the carbon dioxide levels in his bloodstream were increasing at a dangerous rate.\n\n\"I didn't see any other alternative other than withdrawing support from this young man,\" said Dr. Christian Bermudez, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center chief of cardiothoracic transplants, CBS Pittburgh reported. Respiratory dialysis was the last option. There was one big problem, though: There were no Hemolung machines in the entire United States.\n\nUnderstanding the critical condition of Sacker, ALung Technologies' CEO Peter DeComo agreed to drive the device from Toronto to Pittsburgh. By the next day, Sacker was hooked up. Less than a month later, his health improved enough to receive the lung transplant. To Sacker, the device is nothing short of divine intervention. \"You get a call at the last second about a device that has never been used here in the United States \u2014 that's a miracle,\" explained the 33-year-old.\n\nThe Hemolung\n\nThe Hemolung works as dialysis for the lungs, able to cleanse the patient\u2019s blood of carbon dioxide. Developed by the company ALung Technologies, the Hemolung was designed for individuals suffering from acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, such as what occurs in patients with COPD. It is \u201ca truly innovative medical device,\u201d which offers patients \u201ca much needed alternative treatment option,\u201d DeComo explained in a recent press release. The device has the go-ahead for use in Europe and Canada but is still waiting the much stricter U.S. testing required for FDA approval. This will include \u201ca randomized controlled trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the device in the U.S. population,\u201d Scott Morley, a representative for ALung, told Medical Daily.\n\nFDA Approval\n\nAccording to CBS, it could take between three and five years before the Hemolung is FDA approved. Unfortunately, Morley told Medical Daily that he believes Sacker\u2019s case, although compelling, \u201cis unlikely to result in lesser regulatory requirements with the FDA, due to these requirements being \u201cmandated by federal legislation.\u201d In order to get the device to Sacker in Pittsburgh, Sacker\u2019s doctors had to apply for emergency compassionate use through the UPMC\u2019s Institutional Review Board. \u201cOnce Jon was connected to the device, we had to provide frequent updates to the FDA relative to the performance of the device, whether we were having any adverse events, and the clinical condition of the patient,\u201d DeComo said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "unapproved, lung, device, keeps, cystic, fibrosis, patient, alive, long, enough, transplant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Oklahoma man with cystic fibrosis has been saved thanks to a new non-FDA-approved respiratory dialysis machine called Hemolung.", "title": "1st US Patient To Use Unapproved Lung Dialysis Machine Calls Device A 'Miracle'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unapproved-lung-device-keeps-cystic-fibrosis-patient-alive-long-enough-transplant-currently-awaiting", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/lungs_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Oklahoma man with cystic fibrosis has been saved thanks to a new non-FDA-approved respiratory dialysis machine called Hemolung.", "title": "1st US Patient To Use Unapproved Lung Dialysis Machine Calls Device A 'Miracle'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unapproved-lung-device-keeps-cystic-fibrosis-patient-alive-long-enough-transplant-currently-awaiting", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/lungs_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/lungs_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-03T12:09:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T12:30:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Oklahoma man with cystic fibrosis has been saved thanks to a new non-FDA-approved respiratory dialysis machine called Hemolung."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9646\"", "article_summary": "It is \u201ca truly innovative medical device,\u201d which offers patients \u201ca much needed alternative treatment option,\u201d DeComo explained in a recent press release.\nFDA ApprovalAccording to CBS, it could take between three and five years before the Hemolung is FDA approved.\n\"I didn't see any other alternative other than withdrawing support from this young man,\" said Dr. Christian Bermudez, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center chief of cardiothoracic transplants, CBS Pittburgh reported.\nSacker has suffered from cystic fibrosis for his entire life, and after his first lung transplant failed, Sacker\u2019s health took a turn for the worst.\nTo save the life of a loved one, would you risk an experimental treatment not yet approved by the FDA?"}
