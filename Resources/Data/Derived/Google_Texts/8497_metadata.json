Ancestry.com, an online genealogy database based in Utah, proposed the joint project, and took on the cost of scanning the records, reports McClatchy.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the funds or the time to digitize all these records,\u201d Laura Martin, deputy director of research at the Oklahoma Historical Society, told McClatchy. Those records were largely on microfiche, or original documents, so having them available online makes them available to many more people.\n\nThe information that has been digitized covers 1830-1940 and supplements information Ancestry.com already had available on its site.\n\n\u201cWe were able to tell a more complete story by going back further,\u201d Lisa Arnold, senior content strategist at Ancestry.com, told the Associated Press. \u201cThis will be the most comprehensive collection of Indian records.\u201d\n\nWhile Ancestry.com is a paid site, many libraries have subscriptions, so patrons can use the site free.
