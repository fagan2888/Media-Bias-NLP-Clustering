While advances in technology may help enhance learning, many digital devices are still relatively new and the long-term effects on young eyes are still being determined.\n\nAccording to the American Optometric Association\u2019s (AOA) 2015 American Eye-Q\u00ae survey, 41 percent of parents say their kids spend three or more hours per day using digital devices, and 66 percent of kids have their own smartphone or tablet.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s children have had access to electronic devices their whole lives,\u201d says Dr. Nicholas Colatrella, President of the Minnesota Optometric Association and owner of PineCone Vision Center, Sartell, Minnesota. \u201cSince technology use is expected to continue to climb, we need to ensure that children and parents are aware of the visual risks associated with staring at screens for long periods of time and take the proper precautions to help alleviate eye and vision problems.\u201d\n\nParents should watch for signs of digital eye strain in children, which can cause burning, itchy or tired eyes, headaches, fatigue, loss of focus, blurred vision, double vision or head and neck pain. To protect children\u2019s eyes and vision, encourage them to take frequent visual breaks by practicing the 20-20-20 rule: when using technology or doing near work, take a 20-second break, every 20 minutes and view something 20 feet away.\n\nToday\u2019s electronic devices also emit high-energy, short-wavelength, blue and violet light, which may affect vision and even prematurely age the eyes. Early research shows that overexposure to blue light could contribute to eye strain and discomfort and may lead to serious conditions in later life such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can cause blindness.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to make comprehensive eye exams a priority each school year. \u201cA child\u2019s eyes are still changing between the ages of 5 and 13 years old,\u201d said Dr. Colatrella. \u201cTherefore, during this time, the distance between the lens and the retina is also still changing. When the distance between the two lengthens, we see an increase in the instances of nearsightedness.\u201d\n\nThrough the Pediatric Essential Health Benefit in the Affordable Care Act, parents can take advantage of yearly comprehensive eye exams for children ages 18 and younger.\n\nVideo:\n\n30-sec: http://bcove.me/cz5g6g0y", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today's kids use digital devices for hours daily, which may have long term consequences for their eyes and vision.
