Not only does it provide the infant with essential nutrients, but it is a form of emotional bond between mother and child as well \u2014 and can help mothers recover from childbirth far more quickly due to the release of the hormone oxytocin.\n\nThe only issue is that sometimes, a mother doesn\u2019t have enough breast milk for the child and must take a daily stimulant, known as a galactagogue, to boost milk production. One such galactagogue is domperidone, which can boost production of breast milk. Though previous research has shown that domperidone doesn\u2019t appear to have any risks for babies who consume it, a new study published in the Journal of Human Lactation has found that the breast milk stimulant can pose danger to the mothers and cause heart problems.\n\nPast studies have surmised that domperidone was linked to irregular heartbeat and sudden cardiac death, but researchers wanted to find out how true those associations were. To do so, they analyzed various studies that had already existed on the stimulant\u2019s effects on mothers and infants, as well as studies that examined domperidone use in gastrointestinal disorder treatment. What they found initially wasn\u2019t too concerning: there were no adverse effects among the 85 infants and 60 treated mothers. And as expected, breast milk production increased after 3 daily doses of 10-20 mg of the stimulant. But the researchers also discovered that women who took over 30 mg per day of the stimulant had an increased chance of sudden cardiac death \u2014 which spelled out a big warning for women who have heart problems or are vulnerable to heart disease.\n\n\u201cIn these circumstances, an improvement of breastfeeding practices seems to be more effective and safer than the use of an off-label domperidone treatment,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nGalactagogues can be a synthetic or plant-derived substance that helps boost production of breast milk in both humans and animals. Domperidone as well as metoclopramide are both synthetic galactagogues; they trigger the dopamine system to produce more prolactin, which in turn cause mothers to produce more breast milk.\n\nAuthors of a 2010 study on the effects of breast milk stimulants suggest \u201cto use galactagogues only when reduced milk production from treatable causes have been excluded and educational plans failed,\u201d they noted in their conclusion. \u201cPharmacotherapy should only be recommended for mothers who desire to breast-feed but are unable to maintain an appropriate lactation.\u201d They note that domperidone is the \u201cdrug of first choice\u201d due to its proven efficacy and lack of side effects in infants, as well as \u201crare side effects in mothers.\u201d\n\nBut the new study suggests that women should be more cautious when thinking about taking breast milk stimulants; if you\u2019re looking to boost your breast milk production, talk to your doctor first about the risks and benefits of galactagogues.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "galactagogues, breast milk stimulants, breastfeeding, domperidone", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "While domperidone, a breast milk stimulant, has been considered safe for infants, a new study shows that it might pose a threat to mothers who are vulnerable to heart disease.", "title": "Breast Milk Stimulants Boost Milk Production, But Might Cause Heart Problems For Mothers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/breast-milk-stimulants-though-they-boost-milk-production-they-could-cause-heart-313200", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/breastfeed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While domperidone, a breast milk stimulant, has been considered safe for infants, a new study shows that it might pose a threat to mothers who are vulnerable to heart disease.", "title": "Breast Milk Stimulants Boost Milk Production, But Might Cause Heart Problems For Mothers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/breast-milk-stimulants-though-they-boost-milk-production-they-could-cause-heart-313200", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/breastfeed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/breastfeed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-04T18:49:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T18:57:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "While domperidone, a breast milk stimulant, has been considered safe for infants, a new study shows that it might pose a threat to mothers who are vulnerable to heart disease."}, "article_summary": "Galactagogues can be a synthetic or plant-derived substance that helps boost production of breast milk in both humans and animals.\nResearch has shown that breastfeeding is beneficial, and less dangerous than infant formula; but some mothers must use breast milk stimulants to boost their production.\nThe only issue is that sometimes, a mother doesn\u2019t have enough breast milk for the child and must take a daily stimulant, known as a galactagogue, to boost milk production.\nOne such galactagogue is domperidone, which can boost production of breast milk.\nAnd as expected, breast milk production increased after 3 daily doses of 10-20 mg of the stimulant."}
