Instead, they are allowed to enter the U.S. with instructions to report to a local [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] office or immigration court, which many do not do.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in California ruled in July that the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s system to detain illegal immigrants at unlicensed facilities is in violation of the law.\n\n\u201cThey are holding children in unsafe facilities, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d an attorney in the case, Peter Schey, said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s intolerable, it\u2019s in humane, and it needs to end, and end sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nA report by the Congressional Research Service shows that 62 percent of children did not show up for their cases before an immigration judge from July 2014-February 2015, reports The Washington Times.\n\nThe new August data shows an increase in arrests for the month, but the total border arrests for the year have decreased from a year ago.\n\n\u201cWhile the administration has taken steps to tell would be illegal immigrants that they will be returned to their home country, actions speak louder than words,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cIt has become clear to those contemplating illegally entering the U.S. that once here, you are unlikely to be deported.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year it was reported that Mexico now deports more illegal immigrants from Central America than the United States does.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The amount of arrests made by the United States Border Patrol soared in the month of August.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The amount of arrests made by the United States Border Patrol soared in the month of August.", "title": "Border Arrests of Children, Families Surge 52% in August", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150922_BorderPatrol_Jessen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LSeozd"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The amount of arrests made by the United States Border Patrol soared in the month of August.", "title": "Border Arrests of Children, Families Surge 52% in August", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150922_BorderPatrol_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-09-26T09:56:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "illegal immigrants, border security"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0911\"", "article_summary": "White House press secretary Josh Earnest called the increase in border patrol arrests during August a \u201cconcern\u201d for the administration.\nThe amount of United States border patrol arrests soared in the month of August.\nThe new August data shows an increase in arrests for the month, but the total border arrests for the year have decreased from a year ago.\nData released by the U.S. Border Patrol on Monday shows this is an increase of 52 percent from the amount of arrests made in August 2014.\nThe Associated Press reported that almost 10,000 immigrant children and families were arrested at the Mexico border as they tried crossing illegally during the month of August."}
