She would go to her doctor, her doctor would hand her information \u2013 a pamphlet, and then she would have to leave and return the next day. It\u2019s what they call a \u2018reflection period,\u2019\u201d Moskowitz said.\n\nHe said that because they\u2019re so \u201con the fringe\u201d on this issue, they didn\u2019t create any exceptions. He proposed an amendment that would have created an exception for women who were raped, were victims of incest, or if the health of the mother was compromised. They voted that amendment down in committee he said, however, the Senate forced some of that amendment into the bill so there is a rape and incest exception. First, a woman must provide a doctor with documents proving these things occurred.\n\n\u201cVery few people that go through those experiences go to the police department and document those things.\u201d\n\nMoskowitz pointed out that the Republicans put out restrictive women issues on non election years.\n\n\u201cLast year when Governor Scott was running for reelection? No women\u2019s choice issues. This year, an off-year election? Lot\u2019s of of bills. This is the one that passed. Next year, presidential election? I\u2019ll bet you we don\u2019t see them.\u201d\n\nMoskowitz touched on why there wasn\u2019t an agreement on the budget. \u201cWe saw a sleep session without a budget\u2026.we don\u2019t have to pass any bills, if we pass the budget, we can go home as we\u2019ve done our constitutional duty.\u201d\n\nHe said that issues stem from the Senate\u2019s support for using Medicaid funding to provide private insurance for 850,000 low-income Floridians. The federal government is phasing out a program to reimburse hospitals that provide care for low-income patients, known as the Low Income Pool (LIP) as it shifts to new programs provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs part of their negotiations, the Senate wants to expand Medicaid and impose new requirements on low-income residents as it phases out LIP funds, however, the House rejects that idea.\n\n\u201cThe federal government told us at the end of last year that this will be the end of the program, but if you were to do healthcare expansion, we would look at it again,\u201d said Moskowitz.\n\n\u201cAll year we did nothing, and when the session came they were still doing nothing, then towards the end of the session, the issue exploded. The Senate says, \u2018We want to do Medicaid expansion and the Federal government has not sent us our LIP money.\u2019 The Senate passes a budget for Medicaid expansion and the House passes a budget with no Medicaid expansion and no LIP funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s over a four billion dollar difference between both budgets,\u201d he said. \u201cNever before in the history in Florida has the House and the Senate passed a budget that was four billion dollars a part.\u201d\n\nMoskowitz will be heading back to Tallahassee on June 1-20 for a special session to pass the budget.\n\nOther budget items in the works locally: Water improvement projects for Tamarac and road improvements for Coral Springs along North University Drive.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Coral Springs Talk", "description": "State Representative Jared Moskowitz updated the residents of a local Democratic Club on what happened during the legislative session in Tallahassee and why the budget wasn\u2019t passed.", "title": "State Representative Speaks to Residents About Legislative Session", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://coralspringstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jared-Moskowitz-May2015.jpg", "height": 1001}, "url": "http://coralspringstalk.com/state-representative-speaks-to-residents-about-legislative-session-11702", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-05-28T17:41:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:41:55+00:00", "author": "http://coralspringstalk.com/author/sharon"}, "fb": {"app_id": 482959705049364}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Other budget items in the works locally: Water improvement projects for Tamarac and road improvements for Coral Springs along North University Drive.\nBy: Sharon Aron BaronState Representative Jared Moskowitz updated the residents of a local Democratic Club on what happened during the legislative session in Tallahassee and why the budget wasn\u2019t passed.\n\u201cAll year we did nothing, and when the session came they were still doing nothing, then towards the end of the session, the issue exploded.\nHe said that because they\u2019re so \u201con the fringe\u201d on this issue, they didn\u2019t create any exceptions.\nI\u2019ll bet you we don\u2019t see them.\u201dMoskowitz touched on why there wasn\u2019t an agreement on the budget."}
