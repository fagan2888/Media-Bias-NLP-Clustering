It means \u2018Our Father, Our King,\u2019 right? Why don\u2019t we translate it that way anymore?\u201d\n\nI answered: \u201cThose old male metaphors for God can seem both limiting and outmoded.\u201d\n\nTo which he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. My dad died twenty years ago, and I still miss him.\u201d\n\nHmnn.\n\nWhen it comes to Jewish and Christian liturgy, we have no shortage of references to God as Father. Jews have \u201cOur Father, Our King,\u201d which only makes an appearance during the High Holy Days. Christians have \u201cthe Lord\u2019s Prayer\u201d \u2014 \u201cOur Father, Who art in heaven\u2026.\u201d\n\nBut feminists of all faiths have trouble with the notion of God as Father \u2013 or, as King, or any other masculine metaphor. (\u201cGod talk\u201d is the subject of a new anthology, edited by Lawrence Hoffman, and published by Jewish Lights \u2013 Naming God \u2013 to be released in August. This blog entry is a version of my essay in the volume).\n\nBut, as retro as it seems, maybe the metaphor of God as Father is not as bad as we once thought.\n\nIt\u2019s about relationship. Many people want a personal relationship with God, and if you want that personal relationship, you have to go through the tradition\u2019s file folders and find an appropriate metaphor.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? God as King? Too medieval. God as Shepherd? Too pastoral. God as spouse? Fine \u2014 as long as the marriage works out. God as \u201cfriend?\u201d Not bad, but a little too familiar for some people.\n\nAs metaphors go, the parental relationship is actually pretty good. The Fifth Commandment \u2014 the one that tells us to honor our parents \u2014 is right there in the middle of the Ten Commandments.\n\nAs Rabbi Richard Levy wrote: \u201cHow would you like your mother to be? How would you like your father to be? Your parents have the potential to be that way, but God is that way now.\u201d\n\nThere is no such thing as a \u201cgeneric\u201d parent. When your daughter stubs her toe, she does not yell, \u201cParent! Parent!\u201d Jews have reclaimed the Shekhina, the feminine presence of God, as understood by the ancient rabbis and mystics. So, if we can have Shekhina (the maternal side of God), what\u2019s wrong with Abba (Father)?\n\nWhen your daughter stubs her toe, she does not yell, \u201cParent! Parent!\u201d Jews have reclaimed the Shekhina, the feminine presence of God, as understood by the ancient rabbis and mystics. So, if we can have Shekhina (the maternal side of God), what\u2019s wrong with Abba (Father)? Our own parenting helps us understand God. Our toddler takes her first steps. She stumbles. Of course, we want to catch her. But not always, and not forever. So, too, God watches humanity mature, and exercises self-restraint from intervening when we stumble.\n\nTo paraphrase Oscar Wilde: When we are young we idealize our parents; when we are adolescents we judge them; when we are older we understand them.\n\nWhen the Jews were a young people, they idealized the God Who was active in history. In the period of Jewish adolescence, which began with the destruction of Judean independence in 70 CE. and ended with the Holocaust, Jews began to judge the God Who was no longer active. Now that the Jewish people is older, perhaps we \u201cunderstand\u201d God more \u2013 a God who is not all-powerful, and Who needs us as much as we need God.\n\nGod is a nurturing father. The Jews are, like Moses, an adopted people. \u201cHe found him in a desert region, in an empty howling waste\u2026 Like an eagle who rouses his nestlings, gliding down to his young, so did He spread His wings and take him\u2026He fed him honey from the crag, and oil from the flinty rock.\u201d (Deut. 32:10-13).\n\nThe Jews are, like Moses, an adopted people. \u201cHe found him in a desert region, in an empty howling waste\u2026 Like an eagle who rouses his nestlings, gliding down to his young, so did He spread His wings and take him\u2026He fed him honey from the crag, and oil from the flinty rock.\u201d (Deut. 32:10-13). God is a father with emotions and vulnerabilities. As Harold Bloom wrote, God is like Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear \u2013 the simultaneous Father-King, who watches his three daughters (Judaism, Christianity and Islam?) fight, and who ultimately and tragically winds up alone. Except, God does not wind up alone.\n\nThe poet Yehuda Amichai put it this way: \u201cOur Father, Our King.\u201d What does a father do when his children are orphans and he is still alive? What will a father do when his children have died and he becomes a bereaved father for all eternity? Cry and not cry, not forget and not remember\u2026\u201d\n\nAs a \u201cfather,\u201d God is pretty non-authoritarian. In a famous passage in the Talmud, the sages argue with God over a Jewish legal matter, and they turn out to be right. \u201cGod laughed with joy, saying, \u2018My sons have defeated Me, My sons have defeated Me.'\u201dIt is like the parent who loves being beaten in chess or in football by his or her child \u2013 or who loves it when his or her child comes back with a witty retort.\n\nHenry Slonimsky once wrote: \u201cGod is primarily and pre\u2011eminently a great heart, caring most for what seems to be important and sacred to us, namely, our loves and aspirations and sufferings.\u201d\n\nAnd that is why I worry: what would we lose if God the Father suddenly moved to a retirement home, and did not return my calls.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Institutions, Opinion, Avinu Malcheinu, Catholic, Christian, feminism, God, Harold Bloom", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Did you send God a Father's Day card?
