Casey.\n\nBitcoin Latest Price: $367.11, up 4.06% (via CoinDesk)\n\nCrossing Our Desk:\n\n\u2013So far, it has been a good venture-capital fundraising week for bitcoin.\n\nThursday brought the news that bitcoin mining company BitFury has raised $20 million in new funding. That followed Tuesday\u2019s announcements that wallet provider Blockchain had pulled in over $30 million in venture-capital seed funding, and bitcoin derivatives provider SolidX had raised $3 million. That\u2019s $53 million in three days. Not bad for businesses associated with a currency for which the headlines have this past month been about a plunging price.\n\nBitFury makes high-powered bitcoin mining rigs that use its proprietary ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips, and also runs what it describes as one of the world\u2019s largest mining operations out of Finland, Iceland and the Republic of Georgia. Rather than describing itself as a bitcoin mining company, however, BitFury identifies itself as a \u201cleading Bitcoin infrastructure provider and Bitcoin transition processing company.\u201d\n\nThe company said the funding round was led by venture capitalist Bill Tai, former VeriFone CFO and Flextronics President Bob Dykes, and Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen. It also received more funding from the $6 billion privately-run Georgian Co-Investment Fund, an existing BitFury investor.\n\nIt said it would use the funds to increase the capacity at its data centers to 100 megawatts, \u201callowing the company to cement our reputation as the Bitcoin industry leader.\u201d\n\nThat large electricity consumption underscores how big the business of bitcoin mining has become. As costs and competitive challenges rise, profit margins on the bitcoins that miners earn for processing transactions have shrunk, which means there\u2019s a race toward large-scale, highly efficient, high-volume operations. BitFury\u2019s approach is said to typify that trend.\n\nOn its web site, BitFury says that some 40% of all bitcoins are mined with rigs that use its chips. (Michael Casey)\n\n\u2013Trying to explain bitcoin\u2019s volatile price moves is a fool\u2019s errand \u2013 even more so trying to predict its future.\n\nAbout the only thing that can be said with any certainty after the past week\u2019s gyrations is that volatility will continue \u2014 it\u2019s ingrained into a market with thin volumes and an absence of fundamental information with which to gauge the worth of its participants\u2019 all-or-nothing bets on bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nNonetheless, an analysis of the past week\u2019s price movements and, in particular, of the sell-order that it started it all is instructive. While there\u2019s nothing to say that another big shock could in the days and weeks ahead set off another slide in the price, the way things have transpired could suggest that there\u2019s at least a base of support around the $300 level.\n\nIn an analysis of the 30,000-coin sell order that was first placed at Slovenia-based exchange BitStamp on Sunday morning, Pantera Capital showed in a report released late Wednesday that 24,580 coins were sold from that order. And whereas some had speculated that the giant order was part of an effort to manipulate the price lower by a big player such as an exchange, the bitcoin investment firm concluded that the coins originated from a relatively early adopter\u2019s bitcoin address where bitcoins originated on April 3, 2013.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that despite the pain it inflicted on the market and the accompanying panicked sales that it triggered from other investors, the sell order \u2014 which was twice as big as BitStamp\u2019s average daily volume \u2014 was almost entirely bought by the market. That could suggest that a decent floor of demand exists at the $300 level around which most of the sales took place. Tellingly, we\u2019ve seen the price come back significantly since Monday. After Thursday\u2019s 3.66% gain, bitcoin is now up 27% from the intraday low of $286 it hit on Sunday.\n\nPantera noted that the original single sell order exceeded the size of the 29,656 coins that the U.S. Marshals auctioned in June but whereas the latter came with a two-week warning , \u201cSunday\u2019s 30,000 BTC sell wall was brought down in a single evening.\u201d It further suggests there\u2019s a decent pool of buyers who think that $300 represents good value for bitcoin. (Michael Casey)\n\n\u2013Here\u2019s a real-world effect of the sharp drop in bitcoin\u2019s price this year: Sean\u2019s Outpost, the Pensacola, Fla., homeless shelter that was founded by Jason King in March 2013 and takes donation in bitcoin, has lost so much money because of the price drop that the group took to its Facebook page to ask for donations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often you will hear us asking outright for donations, but we could really use them right now. The recent price drop in BTC has played havoc with our finances and we are down to the bone.\u201d\n\nThe group says it has served more than 120,000 meals since its inception, and serves 2,000 meals a week to the homeless, \u201cregardless of the price of bitcoin.\u201d (Paul Vigna)\n\nContacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Bitcoin mining company BitFury has raised $20 million in new funding.", "title": "BitBeat: BitFury Pockets $20 Million, Adding to Big VC Inflows for Bitcoin", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/09/bitbeat-bitfury-pockets-20-million-adding-to-big-vc-inflows-for-bitcoin/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/DE-BK282_bitcoi_P_20141007043845.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "BitBeat: BitFury Pockets $20 Million, Adding to Big VC Inflows for Bitcoin", "description": "Bitcoin mining company BitFury has raised $20 million in new funding.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Michael J.
