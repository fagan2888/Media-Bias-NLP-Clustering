You really can\u2019t plan for your domain to be a rallying cry of a presidential candidates grassroots base. Through this domain I have been in contact with the Sanders team, Martin Shkreli, and some notable Wall Street names. In terms of traffic, Last month saw a high of about 18,000 visitors. I know it would be higher if I put up some content but didn\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t really have an asking price but I am getting offers right now of around 8k which I still think is a bargain given the political importance. In addition, it would make a good strategic political play if one of the opponents picked it up for their digital efforts. Just a imagine an army or people chanting \u201cFeel The Bern\u201d and then you go to FeelTheBern.com and you get __INSERT WHATEVER__! I get so many passionate emails of people asking for me to donate it. I tell them if it is that important then why don\u2019t you crowdfund it or something and to no surprise they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe domain name has an Alexa ranking of 342,000 in the US over the last 30 days.\n\nThe domain, FeelTheBurn.com which of course is normally the \u201cright spelling\u201d but not in the case of Mr Sanders\u2019 supporters, is even getting traffic, and has an Alexa Ranking of 18 Million worldwide.\n\nFor me the question of who would be the buyer of the domain?\n\nThe candidate, owns and uses the domain name BernieSanders.com as his official site, asking people to go to his site to make contributions last night in his victory speech, coupled with the fact that he also once again stated in his speech that he does not have, nor does he want, a Political Action Committee (PAC or Super PAC) to support his candidacy.\n\nThere is a Facebook page using the name \u201cFeel The Bern \u201d which has over 82K followers.\n\nSo it\u2019s either Sanders or Hillary Clinton who uses the domain name HillaryClinton.com for her website, or one of the PAC\u2019s or Super Pac\u2019s that support her, that would be the most likely buyer of the domain, to use against Bernie or the owner of the Facebook page that is selling Bernie Sanders merchandise.\n\nIf you have an interest in buying the domain you can just visit FeelTheBern.com and fill out the inquiry form.\n\nWe will keep you updated.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TheDomains.com", "description": "Yesterday Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic primary of the 2016 election beating Hillary Clinton by over 20%.
