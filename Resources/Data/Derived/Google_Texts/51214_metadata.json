Martin methodically built the world of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from the history up \u2014 his latest book, \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d takes place a century before any of the events chronicled in the respective series \u2014 but there\u2019s one challenge he wasn\u2019t equipped to face, so when HBO decided to adapt his novels, they turned to linguist David Peterson to create living languages from the scraps of Dothraki and High Valyrian in the novels.\n\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Art of Language Invention,\u201d Peterson describes the process by which he created those languages, and provides a template for neophyte \u201cconlangers\u201d \u2014 people who wish to invent their own foreign tongue \u2014 to produce their own. He graciously spoke to Salon about both process and product.\n\nCould you talk a little bit about the role the Internet played in the development of conlangs generally, and yours in particular?\n\nI started creating my first language in 2000, and I thought it was pretty good. I\u2019d never heard of anyone else creating a language just for their own use, so I also thought I was the only person ever to do so. Had I never met another conlanger, I imagine I would\u2019ve kept right on with that language and never created another. Its lexicon would\u2019ve expanded, I would\u2019ve done translations in it\u2014I might even be fluent in it\u2014so it would be large and functional, but it would also be irredeemably terrible. The language was a mess from start to finish, but having nothing to compare it to except Esperanto, I thought it was the greatest language ever created.\n\nMost conlangers prior to, say, 2010 had very similar experiences with their own creations. Language creation was simply not well known, and generally one didn\u2019t discuss it with others (few friends and family members end up being interested). Once the internet became more common in homes, the first language creation community formed\u2014the Conlang Listserv\u2014and little by little, conlangers began to find one another. This was key in the advancement of the craft, as for the first time in history, conlangers were comparing their work and actively learning from and teaching one another. It was there that I really learned how to do what I do today. Plus, it\u2019s just amazing to be able to talk to another human being about the intricacies of language invention. There\u2019s a camaraderie amongst language creators that\u2019s really encouraging in what\u2014especially prior to 1991\u2014was a truly solitary practice.\n\nWhat are the biggest misconceptions about conlangs? Do you think they\u2019re legitimate, or part of a larger cultural bias against science fiction and fantasy?\n\nPerhaps the biggest misconception is that creating a language is tantamount to creating a code for English, as opposed to creating every single aspect of an entire language. Simlish isn\u2019t a conlang; whatever Furbies are doing isn\u2019t a conlang; the Minions aren\u2019t speaking a conlang; Pig Latin isn\u2019t a conlang. They\u2019re definitely creative uses of language, but they\u2019re either based on English (or some other already existing language), or not linguistically coherent\u2014or, as with, for example, penalty hand signs in American football, they aren\u2019t complete systems.\n\nA lot of the other misconceptions about language creation can be dispelled by recognizing that conlangs are art pieces. No one questions the value of a novel (a \u201cfake\u201d history), and at places like San Diego Comic-Con, we celebrate simply being a fan of something. If conlangs, like novels and television shows, are art pieces, they can be enjoyed and celebrated by anyone without doing any harm to their non-fictional counterparts\u2014the natural languages of the world. Plus, if the language creators and conlang fans I know are any indication, those who engage with created languages are much more likely than those who don\u2019t to enjoy, study, and value the natural languages present on Earth.\n\nAs a former linguistics major, I\u2019m very amenable to the idea that people who study language are more open-minded, but could you go into detail of what you mean by that?\n\nAs tiny little humans, we naturally assume everyone else is like us until reality shows us something different. If our parents speak one language, and the community we\u2019re raised in speaks one language, we think that\u2019s how language works period; we never imagine a language could work any other way than our own. It\u2019s easy to dismiss or \u201cotherize\u201d someone who speaks a different language\u2014one we don\u2019t understand and which doesn\u2019t work the way we feel language \u201cshould\u201d work. The first second language one comes to learn is key. It\u2019s the first time we see that language has the ability to work differently\u2014that the logic can be different. Many in the world are fortunate to have their first exposure to a second language occur simultaneously with their first. For those that don\u2019t, the earlier the exposure comes, the better. If someone who otherwise would not be interested in language at all becomes interested due to exposure to a created language, I can think of no higher compliment to the creator.\n\nWhat do you think the most successful fictional conlang is? Why?\n\nIt depends how one defines success with respect to a conlang. For a naturalistic language, when it comes to depth, ingenuity, artistry, and breadth, I\u2019d think Okuna by Matt Pearson would be a strong candidate. If the size of the lexicon isn\u2019t as much of an issue, I\u2019d nominate Sylvia Sotomayor\u2019s newer language Sodemadu, which is one of the most brilliant concepts I\u2019ve ever seen executed. If one is referring to how well known a language is, it has to be Klingon taking the prize over either of Tolkien\u2019s well-known conlangs, Sindarin and Quenya. Bear in mind, though, that the category of fictional languages automatically disqualifies certain other well-known languages, such as Esperanto, Lojban, or John Quijada\u2019s Ithkuil, none of which are intended for fictional purposes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Linguist David Peterson explains how he created the languages that enrich the world of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\"", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the same without him: Meet the man who made the Dothraki speak", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Linguist David Peterson explains how he created the languages that enrich the world of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\"", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the same without him: Meet the man who made the Dothraki speak", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/game_of_thrones_wouldnt_be_the_same_without_him_meet_the_man_who_made_the_dothraki_speak/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/game_of_thrones45.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Linguist David Peterson explains how he created the languages that enrich the world of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\"", "title": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the same without him: Meet the man who made the Dothraki speak", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/game_of_thrones45.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, conlangs, david peterson, Game of Thrones, the art of language invention", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Simlish isn\u2019t a conlang; whatever Furbies are doing isn\u2019t a conlang; the Minions aren\u2019t speaking a conlang; Pig Latin isn\u2019t a conlang.\nTopics: conlangs, david peterson, Game of Thrones, the art of language invention, Entertainment News, NewsAs most readers and viewers know, George R.R.\nHad I never met another conlanger, I imagine I would\u2019ve kept right on with that language and never created another.\nOnce the internet became more common in homes, the first language creation community formed\u2014the Conlang Listserv\u2014and little by little, conlangers began to find one another.\nCould you talk a little bit about the role the Internet played in the development of conlangs generally, and yours in particular?"}
