Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThe compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.\n\nNotre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for employees even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.\n\nThe case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Lawrence Hurley", "Author": "Lawrence Hurley", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday revived the University of Notre Dame's religious objections to the requirement for contraception coverage under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, throwing out a lower court decision in favor of the federal government.", "title": "Supreme Court revives Notre Dame's Obamacare contraception objections", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150309&t=2&i=1030774614&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB280OJ", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
