That\u2019s so miniscule, in fact, that it\u2019s about the thickness of a cell membrane or even the size of a virus.\n\n\u201cWe were able to demonstrate that the unaided human eye is able to determine the thickness of a thin film \u2014 materials only a few nanometers thick \u2014 by simply observing the color it presents under specific lighting conditions,\u201d Sandy Peterh\u00e4nsel of the University of Stuttgart, an author of the study, said in the press release.\n\nThe researchers conducted various experiments at the University of Eastern Finland, in collaboration with the University of Stuttgart, Germany. They gathered several participants, then trained them to identify extremely subtle color differences in light that passed through films of titanium dioxide, under very controlled lighting. What the researchers found was an \u201cuntapped potential\u201d that \u201crivals sophisticated optics tools that can measure such minute thicknesses,\u201d according to the press release. In other words, under highly controlled conditions, and with proper training, the human eye is able to identify changes in color that correspond to film thickness differences.\n\nThe researchers admit that there are some limitations to the human eye, and it\u2019s unlikely that humans will replace current technological methods to determine film thickness (which is important for various commercial and manufacturing things \u2014 like solar panels).\n\n\u201cThe intention of our study never was solely to compare the human color vision to much more sophisticated methods,\u201d Peterh\u00e4nsel said in the press release. \u201cFinding out how precise this approach can be was the main motivation for our work.\u201d\n\nHe concludes that we often underestimate our own abilities. \u201cPeople often underestimate human senses and their value in engineering and science,\u201d Peterh\u00e4nsel said in the press release. \u201cThis experiment demonstrates that our natural born vision can achieve exceptional tasks that we normally would only assign to expensive and sophisticated machinery.\u201d\n\nSource: Peterh\u00e4nsel S, Laamanen H, Lehtolahti J, Kuittinen M, Osten W, Tervo J.
