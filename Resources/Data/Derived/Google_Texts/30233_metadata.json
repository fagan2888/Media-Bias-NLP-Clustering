Rand Paul, who has been telling Republican donors he is not a libertarian extremist, told the Center for the National Interest in Washington Tuesday he is not an isolationist, rather US foreign policy is 'too belligerent.'\n\nRep. Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky speaks outside the White House after President Obama announced the first five 'Promise Zones,' as a way to create jobs, in Washington January 9, 2014.\n\nAs Rand Paul tests the 2016 presidential waters, he has been busy making the case to mainstream Republican economic and foreign policy circles that he is not the libertarian extremist that even some in his own party have pegged him to be.\n\nIn just the past week the first-term Kentucky senator with the famous dad has taken his message to mainstream and deep-pocketed Republican donors in Atlanta and to a couple of Washington\u2019s most prominent think tanks.\n\nTuesday night he told an audience assembled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the prestigious realist organization, the Center for the National Interest, that he is not the \u201cisolationist\u201d that some detractors would like to label him as.\n\nRecommended: 14 Republicans running in 2016\n\nRather, the junior senator who filibustered for 13 hours over the Obama administration\u2019s drones policy said, \u201cOur foreign policy and national security policy are too belligerent.\u201d A better foreign policy, Senator Paul said, is one grounded in \u201cthe idea that negotiation can improve our world\u201d \u2013 and he cited how he believes that intensified relations with China can lead to progress on North Korea, and how stronger engagement with Russia can yield results on Syria. [Editor's note: The original version of this story mischaracterized Senator Paul's reasoning for his filibuster.]\n\nAnd Paul\u2019s rather traditional internationalist ideas didn\u2019t fall on just any ears. In the audience were such realist Republican foreign policy icons as Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft.\n\nPaul, whose antiwar father, former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, was a repeat Republican presidential candidate, was clearly comfortable criticizing the \u201cneocons\u201d who flourished under the George W. Bush administration. His words suggested he felt he could reliably assume that the National Interest audience contained few of them.\n\nIn the first of several swipes at the neoconservative thinking that underpinned the Iraq war and spawned the vision of a Middle East democratized by way of Baghdad, Paul said foreign policy must be pursued by addressing \u201cevents as they are, not as we wish them to be.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s foreign-policy talk followed a brief appearance earlier in the day across town at the Heritage Foundation, where he introduced the conservative think tank\u2019s annual global Index of Economic Freedom.\n\nThis year\u2019s index, which is developed in partnership with the Wall Street Journal, found that while economic freedom is expanding globally \u2013 in Asia, Africa, and in parts of Europe \u2013 in the United States it slipped for the seventh year in a row.\n\nFor the first time this year, the index has the US falling out of the list of the world\u2019s Top 10 freest economies \u2013 largely as a result of Obamacare\u2019s going into effect, rising regulation, and tax policy.\n\nIn addressing the Heritage audience, Paul zeroed in on Obamacare, calling it \u201cthe biggest loss of freedom of choice in 50 years.\u201d But he cited as the larger culprit in the US fall on the index the growth of Big Government.\n\nEconomic freedom is \u201cincreasingly proportional to the size of your government,\u201d he said, adding that the US government \u201ccontinues to grow at an alarming rate.\u201d\n\nAt Heritage, one got the impression that Paul\u2019s brief remarks were in part a favor to Heritage president and former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who raised mainstream Republican eyebrows when he endorsed Paul in Kentucky\u2019s 2010 Republican senatorial primary over the establishment Republican candidate.\n\nBut at the National Interest dinner, Paul\u2019s longer talk \u2013 focused on the more mainstream idea that \u201cproblems should be approached first by engaging\u201d \u2013 sounded more like the vision of a potential presidential candidate out to appeal to a broader audience than the one he\u2019s usually associated with.\n\nNot only is the diplomacy-first approach one that can appeal to both Republicans and Democrats in a war-weary America, but there were other clues that Paul is out to reach a wider swath of voters.\n\nAs the dinner\u2019s emcee, National Interest board member Richard Burt, noted in introducing Paul, the senator was the only speaker of the evening \u201cto come with his own teleprompters in tow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "a241e5aa870ecb51f02a39a780603391", "sailthru.author": "Howard LaFranchi", "description": "Sen.
