However, that was less than the $91 million it lost in the same quarter of 2014, the first time new federal taxes and fees went into effect.\n\nTufts Health Plan said it lost $24 million, down from a loss of $44 million last year. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care lost $20 million, up from about $17 million last year. And at Fallon Health, the losses were about $7 million, up from $3 million.\n\nInsurers are required to record payment of the taxes and fees in the first quarter of the year. They don\u2019t expect significant losses to continue for the rest of 2015, but the first-quarter losses could drag down their overall earnings. Last year, most of the large insurers reported operating losses and blamed them largely on the federal taxes and fees. But income from investments or other sources helped them end 2014 with net gains.\n\nThe losses in the first quarter of this year are on track with what insurers said they were expecting. Their new taxes and fees are significant; Blue Cross, for example, said it paid $87 million to the federal government to pay for the health care overhaul.\n\nThe federal government is collecting some $8 billion from health insurers and using the money to, in part, underwrite coverage for people receiving subsidized policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the charges have been in effect only since last year, insurers warned they could trickle down to consumers in the form of higher premiums. Blue Cross and Tufts, for example, said premiums are up about 1 to 2 percent.\n\n\u201cIt has to get passed eventually to customers,\u201d said Tufts\u2019 chief financial officer, Umesh Kurpad. \u201cThis is the reason why health plans are looking for ways to reduce costs in all other aspects of our business.\u201d\n\nAnother ongoing challenge, insurers said, is the cost of expensive new medicines. The biggest budget buster among specialty drugs in recent months has been Sovaldi, a breakthrough drug for hepatitis C that costs $84,000 for per treatment per person.\n\nIn addition to the federal taxes and fees, \u201cthe major story of the quarter, and likely for the year, is the increasing cost of so-called specialty medications which continue to rise,\u201d Allen Maltz, chief financial officer at Blue Cross, said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.2919794083", "eomportal-id": 409961, "description": "The state\u2019s four largest health insurers lost a combined $124 million on operations in the first three months of the year as they continued to finance the federal health care overhaul.", "eomportal-instanceid": 26, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The state\u2019s four largest health insurers lost a combined $124 million on operations in the first three months of the year as they continued to finance the federal health care overhaul.", "title": "Mass. health insurers lose money on federal taxes - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/05/15/mass-health-insurers-lose-money-federal-taxes/q9b9rPAnbAwgHyppRv1h1M/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "health insurers,health plans,blue cross blue shield,harvard pilgrim,tufts health plan,fallon health,affordable care act,overhaul,finance,taxes", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 18:26:11 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "health insurers,health plans,blue cross blue shield,harvard pilgrim,tufts health plan,fallon health,affordable care act,overhaul,finance,taxes,fees,Hepatitis C,Sovaldi", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "110d832c-fb73-11e4-8dd0-51240f23976e"}, "article_summary": "The federal government is collecting some $8 billion from health insurers and using the money to, in part, underwrite coverage for people receiving subsidized policies.\nLast year, most of the large insurers reported operating losses and blamed them largely on the federal taxes and fees.\nThe state\u2019s four largest nonprofit health insurers said Friday that hefty taxes and fees related to the federal health care law caused them to lose a combined $124 million on operations in the first three months of the year.\nHarvard Pilgrim Health Care lost $20 million, up from about $17 million last year.\nTheir new taxes and fees are significant; Blue Cross, for example, said it paid $87 million to the federal government to pay for the health care overhaul."}
