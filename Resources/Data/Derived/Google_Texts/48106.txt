Re: “Hospitals, doctors differ on universal health care in Colorado,” May 14 news story.

Thanks for your article about ColoradoCare. As a family physician, it is clear to me that while Obamacare has been a step forward in providing quality care to all, it is not enough. High deductibles, for example, keep the newly “insured” from getting sufficient care.

The opposition group Coloradans for Coloradans could more appropriately be named “Insurance Companies for Their Self-Interest.” I am aware that ColoradoCare is a complex proposal with many details still to be worked out. But let’s not fool ourselves about what we have now: a very broken system that serves fewer and fewer people well. We need to try for something better.
