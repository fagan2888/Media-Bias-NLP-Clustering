Webb then missed a chance to force a playoff when a difficult attempt for par from the same distance drifted left of the hole.\n\n\u201cI feel very happy, like a bird,\u201d Kim said through a translator. \u201cI want to fly in the sky.\u201d\n\nKim led Webb by one shot overnight and they both posted 3-under rounds of 68 in perfect conditions, with no clouds or wind to disrupt them.\n\nShe finished on 11-under 273 overall, having shot the lowest ever round in a major with a 61 on Thursday.\n\nWebb, meanwhile, was looking to win her eighth career major and first since Kraft Nabisco in 2006.\n\n\u201cI believe in fate a little bit, and I wasn\u2019t meant to win,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI hit a lot of good putts this week. Probably the one on the last was the poorest I hit all week.\u201d\n\nOnly Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson \u2014 both from the U.S. \u2014 have won majors at a younger age than Kim, who is studying physical education in Seoul.\n\nShe seemed to take it all in her stride.\n\nWhen Webb\u2019s putt rolled wide, Kim removed her glasses slowly and then walked up to give Webb a small hug.\n\nHer caddie, Gordon Rowan, said Kim didn\u2019t know she\u2019d won at first.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she was aware of the real situation of the scores,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cI said \u2018You\u2019ve won. She said \u2018No, no, I haven\u2019t,\u2019 which was quite sweet.\u201d\n\nKim and Rowan were paired randomly the last time she played Evian, tying for fourth in 2012 \u2014 the final year before Evian became the fifth major. It\u2019s a partnership that has flourished since.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Masters major at 19", "title": "Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Masters major at 19", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Masters major at 19", "title": "Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Masters major at 19", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/14/hyo_joo_kim_wins_evian_masters_major_at_19/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/france-golf-evian-championship.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Masters major at 19", "title": "Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Masters major at 19", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/france-golf-evian-championship.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jerome Pugmire", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI believe in fate a little bit, and I wasn\u2019t meant to win,\u201d Webb said.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsEVIAN-LES-BAINS, France (AP) \u2014 Going up against a seven-time major winner more than twice her age, it was teenager Hyo-Joo Kim who showed the calm nerves of a veteran.\nKim came from a shot back on the last hole to beat Australian great Karrie Webb by one shot on Sunday and win the Evian Championship, becoming the third youngest major winner at 19 years, 2 months.\nShe finished on 11-under 273 overall, having shot the lowest ever round in a major with a 61 on Thursday.\nWhen Webb\u2019s putt rolled wide, Kim removed her glasses slowly and then walked up to give Webb a small hug."}
