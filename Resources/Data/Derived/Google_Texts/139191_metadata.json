Andrew Romanoff, a former Speaker of the House in the state legislature, is facing incumbent Mike Coffman to represent Colorado\u2019s 6th congressional district. Profiles of the candidates in the governor and U.S. Senate races will run in the next two weeks.\n\nDENVER (CBS4) \u2013 In a bit of political reinvention, Andrew Romanoff moved to Colorado\u2019s 6th U.S. House district to challenge for its congressional seat.\n\nBut, in a sense, the district has also revamped itself.\n\nBefore its boundaries were redrawn in 2012, the 6th was composed of more rural areas to Denver\u2019s south, west and east. The district is now much more suburban after incorporating western portions of Adams and Arapahoe counties, part of northern Douglas County and cities like Brighton, Centennial, Littleton and parts of Aurora.\n\nThat\u2019s made it much more competitive.\n\nEnter Romanoff, who is looking to become the first Democrat to represent the district since its inception in 1983.\n\nIn a district evenly split by Republicans, Democrats and independents, Romanoff is focusing on his economic message to broadly appeal to the 6th\u2019s constituents.\n\nRELATED: Coffman\u2019s Campaign More Inclusive As District Changes\n\n\u201cIf you meet with folks in this district, as I have, and you talk about an economic recovery, a lot of folks are still waiting and wishing that Congress would increase the minimum wage,\u201d Romanoff said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to janitors and fast-food workers who are struggling to make ends meet on a minimum wage that hasn\u2019t kept up with inflation in the last 40 years.\u201d\n\nHe said he supports a minimum wage increase.\n\nHe\u2019s also said frequently that cutting waste and abuse in government would help trim debt. Romanoff, who fashions himself as a fiscal hawk, said raising taxes should be a last resort.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not part of my plan. You ought to collect the taxes that people and corporations already owe. I\u2019m not talking about increasing tax rates. I\u2019m talking about collecting legal obligations, which a lot of folks, because of tax evasion, are skirting,\u201d Romanoff said, claiming that if the government collected all outstanding taxes owed, it would contribute $450 to $500 billion in annual federal revenue.\n\nRomanoff says the best way to balance the budget is to grow the economy because it means more people are working and paying taxes to cut the annual deficit. He said he believes negotiating better prescription drug prices and policing fraud in entitlement programs would save costs.\n\n\u201cWhen comes to federal budget, there is too much waste. There is too little effort to examine every expenditure. And before anybody proposes any increase in federal taxes, they ought to be able to ensure taxpayers that we\u2019re wringing every ounce of waste out of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a conversation that Congress is having now, either.\u201d\n\nMajor Health Care Changes Now Would Be \u2018Disruptive\u2019\n\nAnother major tenant of this year\u2019s campaign is the Affordable Care Act, which Romanoff supports.\n\nIn his 2010 primary campaign for the U.S. Senate, Romanoff said he supported a single-payer system as an alternative to President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. But during debates and on the campaign trail this year, he maintains that the current law needs to be improved \u2014 something a single-payer plan wouldn\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cIt would be disruptive to the country and awfully disorderly to businesses that are trying to comply to change the rules in the middle of the game,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that efforts to repeal the law, which have occurred dozens of times in the GOP-controlled House in the last couple years, aren\u2019t fruitful.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go backward now,\u201d Romanoff said.\n\nCongress should tweak the law, he said, and build on progress. That\u2019s not happening, he said: \u201cThere is no appetite on Capitol Hill to take a look at what works and what doesn\u2019t work and fix it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Regret\u2019 Followed 2006 Measure That Punished Illegal Immigrants\n\nWhile House Speaker in Colorado in 2006, Romanoff led a state effort to pass a law considered one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in the nation.\n\nHe now says he supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and that the legislation nearly a decade ago was actually a compromise to ward off an even more draconian amendment to Colorado\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cI regret that we were forced into a special session by the governor and, frankly, by Mike Coffman and the other folks who were pushing a constitutional amendment. I think a lot of folks who weren\u2019t here in 2006 may not know the circumstances,\u201d Romanoff said.\n\nHe said Bill Owens, the governor at the time, demanded the amendment appear on the ballot, which Romanoff said would have prevented the state from providing services to illegal immigrants without exceptions for children or public health and safety.\n\n\u201cThat was a bad idea,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s why there was a compromise, he maintains.\n\nNearly 20 percent of the district\u2019s residents are Hispanic, raising the profile of immigration issues.\n\nRomanoff said he wished Colorado legislators were more successful getting Congress to act on broader reform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still talking about that because Washington hasn\u2019t done anything in eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my biggest regret.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Good For The Environment Is Good For Colorado, Romanoff Says\n\nIn a debate on Sept. 23, Romanoff said he believes humans are largely responsible for changes in the climate. Coffman disagreed, a distinction Romanoff has cited repeatedly.\n\nDuring his time in the state legislature, Romanoff supported measures that would have increased protections for Colorado\u2019s water and air and created more incentives for solar and geothermal studies.\n\n\u201cOur district is home to businesses I\u2019ve visited that are taking advantage of our transition to a clean-energy economy, creating good middle-class jobs, investing in sun and wind, biomass (and) geothermal energy sources,\u201d he said. \u201cThey recognize it\u2019s good for our environment, good for our health, good for our economy and good for our national security.\u201d\n\nRomanoff has said he\u2019ll push to devote more money to research of renewable energy, if elected, and attempt to decrease reliance on traditional energy sources.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see fossil fuels as the future of America,\u201d he said at the debate.\n\nMore Campaign 2014 Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a bit of political reinvention, Andrew Romanoff moved to Colorado's 6th U.S. House district to challenge for its congressional seat.
