Karl Rove on Sunday defended House Speaker John Boehner’s decision to sue the Obama administration, comparing the president’s use of executive powers to England's King George rule over the early American colonies.

"This is imperial power. This is (King) George III. This is some monarch to say I am the law," Rove said on Fox News Sunday. Rove used the Affordable Care Act as an example for his argument. "I actually read the Affordable Care Act. I can find little or no authority at all for the 39 exemptions that (President Obama’s) gotten.

Rove said the George W. Bush administration — which he was a part of as a senior advisor and deputy chief of staff — did not abuse executive powers at the same level that Obama has. While the president has "broad authority" in international issues, Congress must be consulted when domestic policies, like those on immigration, are being created, Rove said. "The legislative branch is the Congress," Rove said. The Constitution "does not say the legislative power is shared between the president and the Congress."
