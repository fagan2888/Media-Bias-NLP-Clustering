Police identified him only as a 28-year-old foreigner, without releasing a name.\n\nPhotographs were also shown of what police seized, including detonators, ball bearings and a metal pipe that police believe was intended to hold a bomb.\n\n\u201cThe bomb materials are the same, similar or the same type\u201d as those used in both bombings, police chief Somyot Poompanmoung told reporters, adding that the suspect had traveled in and out of Thailand since January 2014.\n\nPolice also found \u201ca number of passports from one country,\u201d Prawuth said. He did not name the country but photographs shown during the broadcast showed stacks of passports that were similar to those from Turkey.\n\nEarlier, Prawuth said that authorities had not yet determined his nationality and dismissed Thai news reports saying he is Turkish. Images of a Turkish passport with the apparent suspect\u2019s picture were posted on social media.\n\n\u201cThe passport you see is fake,\u201d said Prawuth, referring to the online photos. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he is Turkish or not.\u201d\n\nA Turkish government spokesman said he had no information on the suspect held or any possible Turkish link to the attack. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with Turkish government rules that bar officials from speaking to journalists without prior authorization.\n\nAsked what could be the motive for the bombing, the police chief told reporters, \u201cit\u2019s a personal grudge .. not international terrorism.\u201d He did not elaborate or give a clear explanation. The man faced charges of possessing unauthorized explosives, Prawuth said, without specifying a penalty. He was taken to a military base for further interrogation.\n\nThe blast at the Erawan Shrine was unprecedented in the Thai capital, where smaller bombs have been employed in domestic political violence over the past decade, but not in an effort to cause large-scale casualties.\n\nThe shrine is a popular tourist destination, particularly with Chinese visitors, who are an important segment of the lucrative tourist market. At least six of the dead were from China and Hong Kong. It sits on the corner of a busy traffic intersection with a nearby overhead walkway in a neighborhood full of upscale shopping malls and five-star hotels.\n\nSoon after the bombing, police released an artist\u2019s sketch of a man seen in a security camera video leaving a backpack at a bench then walking away from the open-air shrine. A separate camera showed the man, wearing a yellow T-shirt, on the back of a motorcycle taxi leaving the site.\n\nThe man seen in the video was believed to have carried out the bombing, which police said was likely planned by a group of people. They indicated in Saturday\u2019s news conference that the man arrested was not the bomber seen in the video.\n\n\u201cWe believe he is a culprit in the same network. More details will be given later,\u201d Prawuth said.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the blast, sparking a variety of theories into who might be behind it.\n\nPossible suspects include parties seeking to avenge Thailand\u2019s forced repatriation of ethnic Uighurs to China. Uighurs are related to Turks, and Turkey is home to a large Uighur community.\n\nOther theories included Muslim separatists from southern Thailand, opponents of Thailand\u2019s military government and feuding factions within the security services.\n\nPolice have been criticized for releasing conflicting statements and rapidly hosing down the crime scene at the shrine before all forensic evidence was recovered. Many accused authorities of rushing to clean up the bomb scene to reassure the public \u2014 especially foreign tourists \u2014 that security in the city was back to normal.\n\nPolice say they have been handicapped by low-quality and broken surveillance cameras and a lack of sophisticated image-processing equipment to clarify the fuzzy images in security videos, which were the only firm evidence they had.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Papitchaya Boonngok in Bangkok and Suzan Fraser in Istanbul contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thai authorities arrested a foreign man Saturday they said had been holed up in a suburban apartment with bomb-making equipment and stacks of passports, the first possible breakthrough in the deadly bombing at a Bangkok shrine nearly two weeks ago.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Thai authorities arrested a foreign man Saturday they said had been holed up in a suburban apartment with bomb-making equipment and stacks of passports, the first possible breakthrough in the deadly bombing at a Bangkok shrine nearly two weeks ago.", "title": "Bangkok bomb case: Thai police arrest foreigner, find passports", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/bangkok-bomb-case-thai-police-arrest-foreigner-fin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/THAI.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/THAI.jpg", "description": "Thai authorities arrested a foreign man Saturday they said had been holed up in a suburban apartment with bomb-making equipment and stacks of passports, the first possible breakthrough in the deadly b", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bangkok bomb case: Thai police arrest foreigner, find passports"}, "Author": "Nattasuda Anusondisai and Jocelyn Gecker", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Thailand, Bangkok, Prawuth Thavornsiri"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cbb\"", "article_summary": "Earlier, Prawuth said that authorities had not yet determined his nationality and dismissed Thai news reports saying he is Turkish.\nBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thai authorities arrested a foreign man Saturday they said had been holed up in a suburban apartment with bomb-making equipment and stacks of passports, the first possible breakthrough in the deadly bombing at a Bangkok shrine nearly two weeks ago.\n___Associated Press journalists Papitchaya Boonngok in Bangkok and Suzan Fraser in Istanbul contributed to this report.\nHe did not name the country but photographs shown during the broadcast showed stacks of passports that were similar to those from Turkey.\nPhotographs were also shown of what police seized, including detonators, ball bearings and a metal pipe that police believe was intended to hold a bomb."}
