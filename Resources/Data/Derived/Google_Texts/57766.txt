Warren Redlich, back in 2010, was the Libertarian Party candidate for governor of New York (Nick Gillespie even highlighted him on the blog here). Needless to say, he didn’t win.

But Redlich is back in the news getting publicity for his method of dealing with police DUI checkpoints in Florida (where he lives now) while protecting one’s constitutional rights. It’s getting him attention from USA Today and the Associated Press, and a video he posted showing his method in action has gotten more than two million views on YouTube.

His method is fairly simple. Display your driver’s license and proof of insurance in a plastic sleeve along with a flyer saying you remain silent, refuse search requests, and want a lawyer, among other things. Then hang them outside the fully closed driver’s side window and approach the checkpoint. Then the driver has to commit to not speaking or rolling down the window, so as not to give police any sort of opening to say they smelled alcohol or that the driver slurred his or her words.

Some police are, of course, not happy about this system. From the Associated Press:

Police across Florida have seen the video. A spokeswoman for a large metro police agency says Gray's experience at the checkpoint doesn't mean the no-talk tactic is legitimate. "He was allowed to proceed because he clearly was not driving while intoxicated," said Veda Coleman-Wright, spokeswoman for the Broward Sheriff's Office. "If those officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver was impaired, they would have investigated further."

Well yes, but Redlich’s system makes it harder for police to just fabricate a reason, which is his declared goal. He pointed out in a video to the Associated Press that this method is complex enough and requires enough patience and discipline to make it hard for actual drunken drivers to replicate.

Redlich has a site here with the flyer, specifically designed for use in Florida. Watch his video below:
