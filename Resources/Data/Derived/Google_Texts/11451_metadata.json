The Spanish-language version of the Web site is allegedly written in \u201cSpanglish,\u201d instead of \u201creal\u201d Spanish.\n\nExcept it\u2019s not.\n\nThe first example many critics are pouncing on is the site\u2019s use of the word \u201cprima\u201d to mean \u201cpremium.\u201d The critics note, correctly, that in Spanish the word \u201cprima\u201d means \u201cfemale cousin.\u201d And in fact it does. It also means \u201cinsurance premium.\u201d (Those crafty Latinos, coming up with multiple definitions of the same word. What will they think of next?)\n\nFirst, here\u2019s how the Affordable Care Act Spanish-language site uses the word \u201cprima,\u201d meaning \u201cpremium.\u201d In this case, the site defines a \u201cpremium\u201d as the amount you have to pay to your insurance company or medical plan. Pretty basic definition, but it works.\n\nThe critics includ the AP:\n\nThe website translates \u201cpremium\u201d into \u201cprima,\u201d but that Spanish word is more commonly used to mean a female cousin, Plaza said. A more accurate translation, she said, would be \u201ccuotas,\u201d \u201ccouta mensual\u201d or \u201ccosto annual.\u201d\n\nAnd Ezra Klein at the Washington Post:\n\nThe Web site, for instance, translates the word \u201cpremium\u201d into \u201cprima\u201d \u2014 a word more typically used in Spanish to denote a female cousin. Veronica Plaza, a professor who teaches medical Spanish at the University of New Mexico, told ABC that the site should\u2019ve used \u201ccuotas,\u201d \u201dcouta mensual\u201d or \u201ccosto annual.\u201d\n\nWell, the Royal Spanish Academy\u2018s official dictionary begs to differ with AP and Klein. The Royal Spanish Academy is \u201cthe official royal institution responsible for overseeing the Spanish language.\u201d So they might know a thing a two about the language. Here\u2019s their definition of pro\u201dprima\u201d: \u201cThe price the insured person pays the insurance company.\u201d\n\nAnd not that we need much additional proof, but here\u2019s Univision using the word \u201cprima\u201d as well:\n\nNow, you can haggle over regional dialects of various Spanish speakers in the United States, if you want to. But it seems rather petty. Though that\u2019s exactly what AP did when confronted with their error, and the accurate definition of \u201cprima\u201d from the Royal Spanish Academy:\n\nThat\u2019s nice for people in the southwest, but what about Spanish-speakers in the rest of America?\n\nRemember, we are not an officially Spanish-speaking country, so we have no official version of the Spanish language to write in. Thus, we have Mexican Spanish, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Panamanian and Argentine versions of the language \u2013 not to mention, Spanish from Spain \u2013 to name a few. And while the languages are virtually the same, they\u2019re not 100% the same. Much in the same way that the English we speak in America is essentially the same thing they speak in the UK, though there are are differences, like the American use of the word \u201cpants,\u201d which in the UK means \u201cunderwear.\u201d Or my personal favorite \u2013 the time I asked a flight attendant on Virgin Atlantic to return my \u201cfanny pack\u201d that she had stowed for take-off. Hilarity ensued on that one.\n\nAs for Spanish, they\u2019ve got some funny regional differences as well. For example, you might want to be careful when referring to the very large insects they have in Puerto Rico (a Chilean friend made that mistake while talking to a woman he\u2019d just met). Or when discussing sea shells (a Mexican man made that error when telling my Argentine friend that the shell on her belt just fell to the ground). And if you know what\u2019s good for you, you won\u2019t use any word to say \u201cgrab\u201d other than \u201cagarrar.\u201d\n\nSo which Spanish should the ACA Web site use? And more importantly, is it really fair to use this as the primary example of how the Spanish is supposedly \u201cwrong\u201d on the Spanish-language version of the Affordable Care Act Web site?\n\nNo it\u2019s not fair at all.\n\nFollow @aravosis\n\n(I\u2019m told that in order to better see my Facebook posts in your feed, you need to \u201cfollow\u201d me.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics claim the Spanish-language version of the ACA Web site got the word `premium` wrong.
