It challenges the moral fabric of the societies we live in. To think, to be told, that your country can in some way isolate itself from the crisis is insane. It\u2019s completely wrong.\u201d Sutherland added: \u201cAre we going to allow refugees to stand in freezing rivers at our borders this winter, to live in freezing tents with their children?\u201d\n\nSpeaking after the European Commission estimated that more than three million more people are expected to arrive in the EU by the end of next year and that those numbers are not expected to diminish until 2017, Sutherland said the EC had mechanisms to deal with the crisis, but that the humanitarian response had been woefully inadequate. \u201cIf the national debate is all around the negatives, keeping people out, then of course it\u2019s going to be polarised and xenophobic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not me having an Anglophobic rant. Right across Europe the evidence is that migration makes a positive contribution, not a negative one. Migrants contribute far more than they take out and they are necessary to keep a balance between retirees and workers.\u201d\n\nSutherland has been scathing of the language of \u201cracism and xenophobia\u201d used by David Cameron and other heads of state, criticising them for dismissing the plight of those they called \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d. But he said there was no longer any hiding place for leaders confronted with the issue. \u201cThis is a generational challenge for Europe. Earlier generations have had theirs, and have coped with them. We have to know that this is our moment,\u201d he said. \u201cLegally and morally, proximity should never define response. Why should people whose lives have been commendably saved in the Mediterranean become the responsibility of Italy? Why should Greece take all the responsibility because they are on the route? This is a distortion, this is a global responsibility, a European responsibility. Resettlement and relocation has to be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nSutherland said there was a lack of strong leadership: \u201cAngela Merkel has provided enormous leadership; Sweden has provided enormous leadership. Then you compare to what others are doing and you see the chasm.\n\n\u201cYou can say problems are developing politically in Germany, which they are. But part of the reason there\u2019s antagonism is the fact that the responsibility is not being fairly shared. It\u2019s inevitable that people in Sweden, Germany and Denmark look around and think, \u2018This is unfair\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year 700,000 people have come to Europe looking for sanctuary or jobs. Britain has pledged to take in 4,000 a year from camps near Syria, a tiny number compared with German and Swedish offers. Sutherland said Europe was more than capable of absorbing a problem which is \u201cless than 1% of our population\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have three alternatives. One, do we send them back? Two, do we leave them on the beaches or put them in insanitary camps getting bigger and bigger? Three, do we welcome them? There\u2019s no way to dress this up. These are the questions and the moral answer is we take them in. You cannot solve this problem by building fences or moats.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "This is the moment our generation must act, says migration expert Peter Sutherland", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Tracy McVeigh", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "This is the moment our generation must act, says migration expert Peter Sutherland", "title": "UN warns Cameron not to turn his back on refugees as winter nears", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/europe-refugees-david-cameron-united-nations-warning", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7187070c3ce5e0edd8a74f8e4cc7b0ca1971b5e2/0_266_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2c678eb8df2262e27fd539e7d2570a6f", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2015/nov/07/europe-refugees-david-cameron-united-nations-warning?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/europe-refugees-david-cameron-united-nations-warning", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2015/nov/07/europe-refugees-david-cameron-united-nations-warning?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7187070c3ce5e0edd8a74f8e4cc7b0ca1971b5e2/0_266_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2015/nov/07/europe-refugees-david-cameron-united-nations-warning?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Migration,United Nations,Refugees,UK news,Immigration and asylum,David Cameron,Conservatives,Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-11-07T16:58:27.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tracymcveigh", "section": "World news", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:44:49.000Z", "tag": "Migration,United Nations,Refugees,UK news,Immigration and asylum,David Cameron,Conservatives,Politics"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7187070c3ce5e0edd8a74f8e4cc7b0ca1971b5e2/0_266_4800_2879/4800.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=041734a4d22823ae53d646f5a5c01d48", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Migration,United Nations,Refugees,UK news,Immigration and asylum,David Cameron,Conservatives,Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ecc\"", "article_summary": "Resettlement and relocation has to be part of the solution.\u201dSutherland said there was a lack of strong leadership: \u201cAngela Merkel has provided enormous leadership; Sweden has provided enormous leadership.\nTo think, to be told, that your country can in some way isolate itself from the crisis is insane.\nSutherland said Europe was more than capable of absorbing a problem which is \u201cless than 1% of our population\u201d.\nAs winter weather sets in across Europe, Peter Sutherland, a former attorney general of Ireland, and chairman of the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThis is not a transient issue.\nBut part of the reason there\u2019s antagonism is the fact that the responsibility is not being fairly shared."}
