Parks is the clinic\u2019s co-founder and medical director; Meegan, its executive director; and Ball, the board\u2019s president.\n\nThe trio thanked attendees for their support, noting that the night\u2019s proceeds would help to ensure that the Brandon Outreach Clinic, at 517 N. Parsons Ave., would continue to serve as a \u201chealth care safety net for those vulnerable individuals who fall through the cracks of our fragmented health care system.\u201d\n\nClinic services include diagnostic screenings, lab tests and medications necessary to treat chronic conditions and diseases, including diabetes and high blood pressure. According to Meegan, the demand for clinic services has remained critically high for eligible patients, even with the national health insurance reforms signed into law with the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Brandon Outreach Clinic serves people who have incomes but whose paychecks are not enough to cover their medical expenses.\n\n\u201cWe keep our patients healthy so they can go to work to keep their jobs to support their families and to keep their homes,\u201d Meegan said, in an interview May 3, at the Center Place Fine Arts & Civic Association, at the start of the Kentucky Derby Party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing as many uninsured people as we always did,\u201d she added. \u201cA lot of people are being forced to work part time, the economy still isn\u2019t as strong as it should be and many people are working two jobs. People don\u2019t realize how fragile things are in society, that people like the ones we see will always need our help.\u201d\n\nDoctors, nurses and other medical professionals donate their time and services to provide care through the not-for-profit clinic. To be seen, a patient must be between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level, depending on household size, Meegan said.\n\n\u201cThe Brandon Outreach Clinic isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people needing help to save their lives.\u201d\n\nShe noted one woman in particular, who came in for a Pap smear and got a mammogram as well. \u201cIt turned out she had breast cancer and who knows for how long,\u201d Meegan said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t feel a lump. We got her in time and treated her and she is alive today.\u201d\n\nThe annual Kentucky Derby fundraiser traces its roots to attorney Eileen Griffin, who had a similar party in her home for years. Griffin provides pro bono legal counsel for the clinic. When Griffin stopped throwing the party, Meegan suggested they adapt the theme for a Brandon Outreach Clinic fundraiser.\n\nThis year marked the third such event. Attendees showed up in big, colorful, creative and theme-related hats. As for the race itself, the so-called \u201cRun for the Roses\u201d was streamed in live from Churchill Downs thoroughbred racetrack in Kentucky. Attendees bet on horses for cash prizes and awards were given, too, including for \u201cBest Hat\u201d and most \u201cDapper Man.\u201d\n\nPlacing winning bets for California Chrome were Terry Fink, Rachel Griffin, Maggie Tagliarini, Tim Watts and Melissa Weeks. Best Hat went to Juliet Wilks, whose hat sported a small plastic horse and trophy cup and a miniature bottle of Maker\u2019s Mark bourbon, commonly referred to as \u201ca Kentucky gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the gentleman\u2019s drink,\u201d Wilks said. \u201cEverybody was wearing a funky hat so I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s make it really funky,\u2019\u201d she added, on her decision to go for the gold in Best Hat honors.\n\nAs for winning Dapper Man, Al Morris, who owns his own landscaping business, said he drew inspiration from his previous job. \u201cI was in banking for 13 years, so I dressed like a banking officer,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the night got underway, Meegan gave a posthumous shout out to William W. \u201cBill\u201d Wolfe, the clinic board member who brought her on board and served as her mentor. The civic-minded Wolfe, who died in 2009, was affiliated with many organizations and served on many boards, she said.\n\n\u201cHe had no agenda. He just knew people would support us if they knew about us, so he put people together, he connected the dots,\u201d Meegan said. \u201cI miss that man. He was the loyal, steady heartbeat of the clinic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 21 May 2014 10:05:44 -0400", "Description": "Both \u201ctwo minutes\u201d and 25 years were celebrated this month at Center Place, where the Brandon Outreach Clinic marked its quarter-century of service in the community with a fundraiser ti", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Both \u201ctwo minutes\u201d and 25 years were celebrated this month at Center Place, where the Brandon Outreach Clinic marked its quarter-century of service in the community with a fundraiser ti", "title": "Brandon Outreach Clinic\u2019s commitment, service heralded at fundraiser", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/brandon/brandon-outreach-clinics-commitment-service-heralded-at-fundraiser-20140521/", "image": {"width": 1760, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140521/ARTICLE/140529888/EP/1/4/EP-140529888.jpg", "height": 1166}, "updated_time": "2014-05-21T10:05:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Both \u201ctwo minutes\u201d and 25 years were celebrated this month at Center Place, where the Brandon Outreach Clinic marked its quarter-century of service in the community with a fundraiser", "title": "Brandon Outreach Clinic\u2019s commitment, service heralded at fundraiser", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140521/ARTICLE/140529888/AR/0/AR-140529888.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-21T10:05:44Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-21T10:05:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee12\"", "article_summary": "The Brandon Outreach Clinic serves people who have incomes but whose paychecks are not enough to cover their medical expenses.\nWhen Griffin stopped throwing the party, Meegan suggested they adapt the theme for a Brandon Outreach Clinic fundraiser.\n\u201cThe Brandon Outreach Clinic isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she added.\nBoth \u201ctwo minutes\u201d and 25 years were celebrated this month at Center Place, where the Brandon Outreach Clinic marked its quarter-century of service in the community with a fundraiser tied to the 140th running of the Kentucky Derby.\nParks is the clinic\u2019s co-founder and medical director; Meegan, its executive director; and Ball, the board\u2019s president."}
