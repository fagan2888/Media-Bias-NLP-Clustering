Close the grisly trade in body parts. And open the abundant gifts of your salvation and life.\u201d\n\nAs explained in a Sept. 10 letter that Thomas Olp of the Thomas More Society sent to Office Depot CEO Roland C. Smith, customer Goldstein had asked the company\u2019s Schaumburg, Ill, store to make 500 copies of a flyer featuring this prayer.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by allowing and ratifying your employees\u2019 refusal to serve Ms. Goldstein because of their hostility to and disagreement with her flyer, you have unlawfully discriminated against Ms. Goldstein because of her religion and religious expression within the meaning of the Cook County Human Rights Ordinance and Illinois Human Rights Act,\u201d Olp said in his letter to Office Depot CEO Smith.\n\nThis is a screen capture of part of Maria Goldstein's flyer.\n\nThe company explained its decision in a letter its assistant general counsel, Robert A. Amicone, sent Olp on Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cYou also say that [the flyer] is \u2018religious throughout in tone and content\u2019 and \u2018contains a prayer\u2019 seeking an end to abortion,\u201d said the Office Depot attorney in this letter. \u201cYou do not mention, however, certain language within the prayer that discusses \u2018the killing of children in the womb\u2019 and \u2018the grisly trade in baby body parts.\u2019\n\n\u201cNor do you address the strong language presumably condemning those who perform and obtain abortions,\u201d said the Office Depot letter. \u201cIndeed, the prayer characterizes those individuals as \u2018evil,\u2019 and it advocates for the closure of the \u2018death camps in our midst.\u2019 It is this type of language that led to the decision to refuse you client\u2019s copying request.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are two provisions [of the company\u2019s policy] applicable to this dispute,\u201d explained the lawyer. \u201cThe first prohibits the copying of \u2018graphic material,\u2019 which can include descriptions of dead or dismembered bodies. The second provision prohibits the copying of \u2018hate material\u2019 that advocates for the persecution of groups of people, regardless of the reason.\u201d\n\nGoldstein\u2019s flyer did not contain any illustrations\u2014and called for the \u201cconversion,\u201d not persecution, of those who advocate aborting unborn children.\n\n\u201cTo be clear,\u201d said Office Depot\u2019s lawyer, \u201cOffice Depot\u2019s position is that the above-quoted language falls within the definition of \u2018graphic material\u2019 and/or \u2018hate material,\u2019 making the refusal to print the flyer appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Office Depot lawyer also said the decision not to make copies of the flyer was lawful.\n\n\"Office Depot's decision was not based in any part on the fact that the message here is couched in terms of Ms. Goldstein's religious beliefs,\" he said. \"In other words, the language at issue would violate Office Depot's policy regardless of the content surrounding it.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the flyer was related to your client's beliefs\u2014whether based in religion or not\u2014did not bear on our decision,\" he wrote. \"Thus, Office Depot\u2019s actions violated no laws.\"\n\nAs reported by Lifenews.com, however, before the end of the day Friday Office Depot had reversed its position and apologized for its initial refusal to print the flyers.\n\n\u201cUpon a more detailed review, we have determined that the content of Ms. Goldstein\u2019s flyer is not a clear violation of the company\u2019s policy,\u201d said a statement from Office Depot spokeswoman Karen Denning published by Lifenews.com.\n\nThe statement included an apology from Office Depot CEO Smith.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Ms. Goldstein for her experience and our initial reaction was not at all related to her religious beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe invite her to return to Office Depot if she still wishes to print her flyer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "*/", "title": "Office Depot Retreats from Refusal to Print Pro-Life Prayer it Said Was \u2018Hate Material\u2019", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/office-depot-retreats-refusal-print-pro-life-prayer-it-said-was-hate", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/office_depot-ap-1.jpeg", "updated_time": "2015-09-12T19:06:29-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T15:15:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T19:06:29-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "*/", "title": "Office Depot Retreats from Refusal to Print Pro-Life Prayer it Said Was \u2018Hate Material\u2019", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/office-depot-retreats-refusal-print-pro-life-prayer-it-said-was-hate", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/office_depot-ap-1.jpeg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "*/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTo be clear,\u201d said Office Depot\u2019s lawyer, \u201cOffice Depot\u2019s position is that the above-quoted language falls within the definition of \u2018graphic material\u2019 and/or \u2018hate material,\u2019 making the refusal to print the flyer appropriate.\u201dThe Office Depot lawyer also said the decision not to make copies of the flyer was lawful.\nAs reported by Lifenews.com, however, before the end of the day Friday Office Depot had reversed its position and apologized for its initial refusal to print the flyers.\n\u201cWe invite her to return to Office Depot if she still wishes to print her flyer.\u201d\nThe statement included an apology from Office Depot CEO Smith.\n\"In other words, the language at issue would violate Office Depot's policy regardless of the content surrounding it."}
