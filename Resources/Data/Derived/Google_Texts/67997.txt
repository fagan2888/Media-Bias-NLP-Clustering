Katy Perry didn’t let her parents come to her performance at Obama’s inauguration … because they didn’t vote for him

When someone makes it big in show business and is asked to perform at a presidential inauguration, you’d think that person would invite their proud parents to witness the monumental event. But not Katy Perry, apparently.

In an article published on Monday, the singer revealed to magazine Marie Claire that she was mildly outraged that her parents even dared ask to accompany her to President Barack Obama’s second inauguration.

“My parents are Republicans, and I’m not,” she told the magazine. “They didn’t vote for Obama, but when I was asked to sing at the inauguration, they were like, ‘We can come.’ And I was like, ‘No, you can’t. I love you so much, but that — on principle.’ They understood, but I was like, ‘How dare you?’ in a way.”

Perry also told the publication she has a wonderful relationship with her parents, Keith Hudson and Mary Perry Hudson. She lauded the fact that there’s no judgment, pointing out that her mom and dad are more “fascinated” by her fame than anything.

“They don’t necessarily agree with everything I do, but I don’t necessarily agree with everything they do,” she said. “They’re at peace with — they pray for me is what they do.”

The singer was an outspoken supporter of Obama during the 2012 election cycle, performing at an October concert fundraiser to drum up dollars for the President. Post-election, she’s also been spreading the word about Obamacare, retweeting a health care-related post on the official Barack Obama Twitter account.
