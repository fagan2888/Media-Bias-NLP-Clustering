Michelle Obama is offering a glimpse into her workout routine.

The first lady tweeted a link to a YouTube video Tuesday night showing her getting physical in the White House gym. Donning a light blue manicure and two different-colored sneakers, Obama is seen jumping rope, using a medicine ball while doing some abdominal work, and lifting a pair of 35-pound weights as her personal trainer, Cornell McClellan, looks on.

“We’re not afraid to lift weights,” McClellan, a member of the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, says, “This is an incline bench exercise, which kind of really works the upper region of the pectoral.”

The two-minute clip was released as part of Obama’s #GimmeFive campaign, which encourages Americans to share five ways they’re being healthy. The campaign was launched to mark the fifth anniversary of Obama’s “Let’s Move!” anti-childhood obesity initiative.

The executive mansion resident jumps up on an exercise bench and goes into a squat before she takes a few jabs during a kickboxing routine in the video. “We really love to use boxing for conditioning,” McClellan says, “for hand and eye coordination, for transference of power — learning how to move from point A to point B and bring your power with you — and because it’s fun.”

At the end of her sweat session, Obama appears on-camera with a full glass of water. “Don’t forget, always drink up,” she says, as she raises the glass.
