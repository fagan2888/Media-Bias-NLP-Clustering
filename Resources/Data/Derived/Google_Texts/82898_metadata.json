Last year, he used a floor speech to accuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of lying.\n\nCorners of the GOP establishment worry that Senate and House candidates down the 2016 ballot could suffer, should either of those men top the ticket and alienate key voting blocs.\n\nMr. McCarthy said the field will sort itself out, so for now the House is working on a bold agenda that should entice the eventual winner.\n\n\u201cWhoever the nominee is, they\u2019re going to want to be a part of what the House \u2026 puts together,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McCarthy hasn\u2019t endorsed anyone in the race, though several lawmakers have rallied around Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, as a nominee who can unite the party and take on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders from the Democratic side.\n\nMr. Rubio is eyeing a third-place finish in Iowa, where Mr. Cruz is hoping to edge Mr. Trump by contrasting his consistent conservative values with the real estate mogul\u2019s mixed record on Republican priorities.\n\nFor his part, Mr. McCarthy said he had no reason to doubt Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to the party. The front-runner has no voting record, he said, so he can only rely on Mr. Trump\u2019s track record in business and what the mogul says on the trail.\n\n\u201cI take him as a conservative,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to say Monday what an anti-establishment nominee for president would mean for Republicans hoping to hold their majorities in Congress, insisting that the GOP is poised for a good year no matter who leads them into November.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to say Monday what an anti-establishment nominee for president would mean for Republicans hoping to hold their majorities in Congress, insisting that the GOP is poised for a good year no matter who leads them into November.", "title": "Kevin McCarthy says he isn\u2019t sweating 2016 race", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/1/kevin-mccarthy-says-he-isnt-sweating-2016-race/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/30/KevinMcCarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/30/KevinMcCarthy.jpg", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to say Monday what an anti-establishment nominee for president would mean for Republicans hoping to hold their majorities in Congress, insisting that the G", "card": "summary", "title": "Kevin McCarthy says he isn\u2019t sweating 2016 race"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Kevin Mccarthy"}, "article_summary": "For his part, Mr. McCarthy said he had no reason to doubt Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to the party.\nMr. Cruz is running neck and neck with Mr. Trump in Iowa, yet he won few friends in Congress with his quixotic push to defund Obamacare in 2013.\nMr. McCarthy said the field will sort itself out, so for now the House is working on a bold agenda that should entice the eventual winner.\nThe front-runner has no voting record, he said, so he can only rely on Mr. Trump\u2019s track record in business and what the mogul says on the trail.\nMr. McCarthy, California Republican, said it is too early to tell how the race will shake out, anyway, since New Hampshire and later primary states \u201cprobably have mattered more for who the Republican nominee is than Iowa.\u201d\u201cI trust the American people,\u201d he told reporters."}
