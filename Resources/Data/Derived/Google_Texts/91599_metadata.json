They are each part of the same malignancy that afflicts the body politic.\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 An ultra-Orthodox Jew rampaged through the Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade on Thursday with a knife, wounding six participants, including one woman who was in critically injured.\n\nThe suspect, Yishai Shlissel, was released from prison early last month after serving his sentence for wounding three people in an attack on the same parade in the same city in 2005.\n\nHaaretz reports that police near his home in the settlement of Modi\u2019in Ilit claim they had no obligation to monitor him because the crime for which he was sentenced took place in Jerusalem, outside their jurisdiction. While the Jerusalem police intelligence unit had flagged him as a danger to the gay community, it had not identified the potential danger he posed to those attending this year\u2019s parade.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nYet this is a country with security services monitoring suspected Palestinian terrorists day and night. Israeli authorities arrest scores of militants every day in order to frustrate their designs. Israel employs every tool of the security state to stop Palestinian terror. But Jewish terror? Not so much.\n\nUpon his release from prison, Shlissel testified publicly to his continuing fixation on gays and the annual Jerusalem event. He told a Haredi news interviewer (Hebrew):\n\n\u201cWhat was important and still is \u2014 is that these evil people [gays] who hold this despicable parade do so in Jerusalem, in particular. It\u2019s even outrageous in Tel Aviv. But for such a thing to happen in Jerusalem is nothing but sacrilege. \u2026\n\nPerhaps my [2005] deed was extreme, but we must stop this parade. If one man wants to stop it he must do something extreme. Because of our own laxness, the evil ones will make their abominable march in our City of the King. \u2026 The Holy One watches to see if we are faithful to Him and will respond to this defiling of his name or whether each of us will care only for our personal material well-being. For that reason, a Jew is obligated to dedicate himself to striking blows, to prison, and even danger in order to join together and stop this defiling of God\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bring knives today\u2019\n\nHaaretz notes that the attacker published the message on a Haredi online forum the morning of the attack. He accompanied it with this chilling promise: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring knives today.\u201d He added: \u201cOn the one hand this is incitement to murder, on the other it\u2019s a holy war. Your opinions, my friends?\u201d Then he signed it with his own name.\n\nIn light of Thursday\u2019s crime, it\u2019s sad to note that an Israeli appeals court reduced his sentence for his previous attack from 12 to ten years, claiming it wasn\u2019t clear that Shlissel had actually intended to harm one of the victims.\n\nIsrael prides itself on being a gay mecca and exploits this in tourism promotion. It also uses the technique of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d as a wedge issue against its Arab enemies. Israel juxtaposes its claims of being a paradise for gays against the supposed wretched reputation the Arab world has for its intolerance of the gay community. In doing so, Israel makes homosexuality nothing more than a propaganda tool in a larger political struggle between Israel and the Arab world. Israel\u2019s leaders don\u2019t care about gay pride per se; they care about ways in which they can exploit it to their own ends.\n\nTel Aviv gay youth center killings\n\nBut the facts and events continually prove the Israeli narrative questionable, if not outright wrong. In 2009, an attacker opened fire on a Tel Aviv gay youth center, killing two teenagers. Four years later, police arrested a suspect and persuaded another accomplice to turn state witness. The latter escaped from police custody, and, possibly after exchanging a few words with his pal, recanted his testimony. No one else has been arrested in the case and it\u2019s presumed the original suspect may be the actual killer. Yet it appears he will not be charged or prosecuted, which means the worst anti-gay hate crime in Israel\u2019s history remains unsolved.\n\nThese attacks are no less acts of terrorism than Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Yet few Israelis would dare label this what it is: an act of terror. As such, it must be fought with all the severity Israel brings to addressing Palestinian terrorism.\n\nFurther, while Yishai Shlissel was wrestled to the ground by police shortly after he began his assault, no police officer drew a gun or shot him. If he had been Palestinian, he would\u2019ve been shot dead on the spot.\n\nSuch attitudes toward Jewish terrorists are a further indication of a brand of Israeli racism which refuses to attribute evil intent to Jews, but attributes it almost instinctively to Palestinians. If Shlissel\u2019s crimes aren\u2019t terror then Israel is casting a blind eye on the evil that lurks within.\n\nInstead of listening to tourist ads proclaiming Israel as a hotbed of gay pride, it\u2019s worth examining the actual status of gays in Israel. The same Orthodox Jewish community which produced Shlissel controls marriage and divorce. No one can marry inside Israel without rabbinical approval. Since Orthodox Judaism views homosexuality as cursed, the state will never recognize gay marriages (though same-sex couples may marry outside Israel).\n\nA key coalition partner in the current government, the Jewish Home party, featured its opposition to gay marriage prominently in its campaign platform. Its candidates trumpeted their homophobia in public appearances ahead of elections earlier this year. One called the gay \u201cagenda\u201d \u201csuicide for society.\u201d Another described himself as a \u201cproud homophobe.\u201d This was the same candidate, who, in 2006, organized an anti-gay event, which he dubbed \u201cBeast Parade,\u201d to coincide with Gay Pride Day.\n\nKahanist leader: \u2018Being homosexual is the same as robbing a bank\u2019\n\nThere were other right-wing Jews protesting at Thursday\u2019s Pride march. Benzi Gopstein, the Kahanist leader of the anti-miscegenation group Lehava, told the Jerusalem Post homosexuality was no less a crime than bank robbery. He added:\n\n\u201cThe threat posed to the Jewish family doesn\u2019t just come from assimilation but also from undermining the sanctity of marriage. It cannot be that something that is declared in the Torah as an abomination will become a source of pride, and there is certainly no place for this in the heart of Jerusalem, the holy city.\u201d\n\nLehava pressures Jewish business owners not to hire Palestinian employees. It warns that Arab men deliberately target Jewish women and groom them for marriage so they will convert to Islam. If this sounds historically familiar, it should: This sort of racialism was common to the Third Reich, as well, and popularized in the Nuremberg Laws.\n\nGopstein is suspected of the murder of a Palestinian couple in 1994 in revenge for the assassination of his mentor, Meir Kahane. Yet another Gopstein NGO is directly funded by the state treasury. He even receives a salary for his efforts, which conveys state approval of his racialist agenda. Israel\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely, one of the most popular politicians in the Likud Party, has even invited Lehava to testify on this subject before a Knesset committee.\n\nThere is one positive development to emerge from this tragedy: This Knesset has had no \u201cout\u201d members until now. After the Jerusalem Pride attack, MK Itzik Shmuli announced he is gay. He was a co-founder of the J14 social justice movement and entered Knesset with the Labor Party.\n\nPalestinian baby dies in \u2018price tag attack\u2019\n\nFriday morning saw another Jewish terror attack. Arsonists, widely believed to be radical settlers, set fire to two homes in the West Bank village of Duma. One was inhabited by a Palestinian family of four. While the parents managed to save one of their children, the other, an 18-month-old boy, was suffocated and died. On the outside of the home the killers scrawled graffiti: \u201cVengeance\u201d and \u201cLong live the Messiah.\u201d\n\nApparently, the settler \u201cMessiah\u201d demands the death of Palestinian babies. And what sort of Messiah demands such obscene human sacrifices? Moloch? Isn\u2019t that precisely what ancient Jewish Biblical religion rebelled against? Let\u2019s be clear that this is settler Judaism, not any form of Judaism that the rest of the Jewish people would recognize or condone.\n\nThese are known as \u201cprice tag attacks,\u201d but that term minimizes what they are: acts of terror. Because Israel treats these attacks lightly, despite public statements of outrage from prime ministers and presidents, they recur. The severity increases as perpetrators discover they can get away with, literally, murder.\n\nAuthorities will locate the attackers. The Israeli security services likely already know who they are. They will arrest them, but no Israeli media will be able to report their identities because of a security gag order. They may be tried. They may be found guilty. They may be imprisoned.\n\nNevertheless, they will be treated with kid gloves. In several years, a future president will grant them clemency, as presidents have done for many Jewish terrorists in the past. There is even a campaign to grant clemency to Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s assassin, Yigal Amir.\n\nHere is the problem in a nutshell: Jewish terror is condoned by the state. Any country that does not eradicate terror, root and branch, is not only going to continue to be victimized \u2014 it becomes an accessory after the fact. In Israel, a country in which terrorists and their enablers are honored in the Knesset, the problem is greater by ten-fold.\n\nMK Miri Regev cried that African refugees were a \u201ccancer\u201d inside Israel, but the real cancer is Israeli hate, whether it be homophobia or Arabophobia.
