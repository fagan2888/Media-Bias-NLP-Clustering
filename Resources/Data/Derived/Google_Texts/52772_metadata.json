More than 550,000 youths have received the two-year deportation deferrals, which are now being renewed for another two years.\n\nThe DACA program stands as one of Obama\u2019s most significant executive actions, and he\u2019s signaled a willingness to go further given the stalemate in Congress on immigration legislation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what Obama has in mind, though he\u2019s been pressured by Hispanic groups to do more to lower deportations.\n\nContraception mandate\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to throw out ObamaCare\u2019s mandate that private employers offer contraception in their employee health plans was a serious blow to the White House.\n\nBut the decision came with a caveat. Justice Anthony Kennedy said it would be possible for the administration to pay for the contraception coverage itself.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest hinted the administration might find a way to reverse the decision without legislation, though what precise steps the White House will take are unknown.\n\nClimate change\n\nObama\u2019s use of executive actions to fight climate change have been among his most aggressive, and are expected to be a major battleground in Senate and House races around the country.\n\nIn early June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rules that would require power plants to cut their carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 30 percent by 2030. The proposals aren\u2019t expected to be finalized until summer 2015, after which states will be given a year to design their own implementation plans.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nObama has been unable to get Congress to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, but he did use executive actions to raise the wage for federal contract workers to $10.10.\n\nObama signed the order in mid-February, but it will be a while before it takes effect because it applies to federal workers such as dishwashers, construction workers and janitors hired under new federal contracts beginning in January 2015.\n\nGun control\n\nLegislation to impose tougher background checks on gun purchases died in the Senate, but that didn\u2019t stop Obama from announcing 23 executive actions to combat gun violence.\n\nThe action include steps to make information about mental illness available in the federal background check system. He\u2019s also expanded research into the causes of gun violence.\n\nObama has said Congress\u2019s inaction on gun control is the biggest disappointment of his presidency.\n\nClosing the gap for same-sex couples\n\nThe administration has gradually extended federal rights to same-sex couples since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2013 that the Defense of Marriage Act barring gay marriage is unconstitutional.\n\nIn June, the Labor Department announced a proposed rule that would extend protections of the Family Leave Medical Act to eligible employees in legal same-sex marriages regardless of whether they lives in a state that recognizes their marriage.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder announced in February that the government would allow same-sex couples to file jointly for bankruptcy and mandate that they will not be compelled to testify against each other in trial. The administration also now treats same-sex couples like married couples when it comes to filing taxes.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Obama\u2019s use of executive power will be a major issue in the midterm elections.", "description": "Obama\u2019s use of executive power will be a major issue in the midterm elections.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Obama\u2019s use of executive power will be a major issue in the midterm elections.", "title": "Obama\u2019s key executive actions", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/211303-obamas-key-executive-actions", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_052814getty2_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-06T07:30:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-06T07:30-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/211303-obamas-key-executive-actions", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-06T07:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Immigration, Climate change, gay rights, Minimum wage,undefined,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T07:30:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-06T07:30:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/211303-obamas-key-executive-actions", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Obama\u2019s use of executive power will be a major issue in the midterm elections.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s key executive actions"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama\u2019s key executive actions"}, "article_summary": "Despite the attention to Obama\u2019s use of executive power, the president has actually issued fewer executive orders than some of his predecessors.\nThe DACA program stands as one of Obama\u2019s most significant executive actions, and he\u2019s signaled a willingness to go further given the stalemate in Congress on immigration legislation.\nPresident Obama\u2019s use of executive power will be a major issue in this fall\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe White House believes that by using executive power, Obama can distinguish himself from a Congress he wants to pain as dysfunctional and obstructionist.\nHere are some key executive actions Obama has and will continue to pursue:ImmigrationIn June 2012, Obama announced that his administration would defer deportations for two years for people who came to the United States illegally as children."}
