The Congressional Budget Office warns that within six years, our interest costs will exceed what we are currently spending on the entire defense budget.\u201d\n\nMcClintock points out Congress adopted a budget that \u201cpointed us back to balance by 2024,\u201d but he adds, \u201cwe had to stay that course, and we haven\u2019t. The budget now awaiting House action doesn\u2019t balance until 2026 \u2013 and only then if we are able to summon the discipline to stick to these new numbers.\u201d\n\nMcClintock brings up another problem, $1 trillion in spending that Congress does not directly control. He says, \u201cThat\u2019s mainly entitlement programs like food stamps, Obamacare, Medicaid. This spending is exploding. The only way to control it is to change the underlying laws, something that today\u2019s divided government makes virtually impossible.\u201d\n\nMcClintock proposes two alternatives, first to control mandatory spending through the same appropriations process that controls discretionary spending by changing Rule XXI, Clause 2(b) that forbids any changes to mandatory spending in an appropriations bill. Second he proposes to gradually revive enforcement of the 1837 House Rule XXI clause 2(a), which he says is the mechanism that forces Congress to periodically review the one third of the discretionary spending that goes to authorized programs that have expired. In addition he proposes that appropriations bills include statutory adjustments to mandatory spending necessary to keep them within the enacted budget.\n\nFor the details on the two reforms and a rough outline of how McClintock says the debt breaksdown read his newest blog here.\n\nWritten by Sabrina Biehl.
