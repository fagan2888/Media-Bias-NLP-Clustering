Floats, beads, and candy filled the streets of Bonifay Saturday.

Thousands came out to see the Northwest Florida Championship Rodeo Parade.

The parade wrapped up the 3-day event, with everyone from political contestants and first responders, to schools, organizations, and businesses taking part in the event.

"It brings in lots of revenue for our county and for our city, and it's a spectacular event that we've had now for 71 years," Parade Coordinator Catrina Carroll said. "We're very proud of it. It always brings lots of people to our town, and brings our community together."

Following the parade, Carroll said the evening festivities kicked off at 5:30, while the rodeo started at Memorial Field at 7:30.
