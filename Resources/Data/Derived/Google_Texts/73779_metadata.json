Quod erat demonstrandum. You see it at the end of a mathematical proof or maybe you hear it at the end of an argument. It\u2019s Latin and it means, more or less, that you\u2019ve proven your point. It\u2019s also the name of a new website, dedicated to domestic policy, that launches at the New Republic on Monday.\n\nWriting on policy is a century-old tradition in these parts. It goes back to the days when Herbert Croly, Walter Lippmann, and kindred spirits sketched out their vision for the Progressive Era\u2014and then the New Deal. Today that conversation continues. It's faster, more complex, and more serious than ever before. Readers expect a lot more information and they want to absorb it in different ways. But they still want answers to the old questions, too. What should be done? What can be done? On climate change, economic security, reproductive rights, the safety net\u2014the stakes are as high as ever.\n\nQ.E.D. will help you follow and think through these issues\u2014by providing consistent, timely coverage of domestic policy and giving it a special home within the New Republic. It\u2019s a blog or, if you want to use the industry term, a \u201cvertical.\u201d It will feature writing from a core team of writers\u2014Rebecca Leber, Danny Vinik, and me\u2014as well as contributions from other New Republic writers, some on staff and some from our extended family.\n\nQ.E.D. will have some regularly recurring features, like \"QEDaily,\" a morning newsletter, and \"QEData,\" where writers will break down statistics. With \u201cQEDecide,\u201d we'll ask some of the nation\u2019s leading experts to make arguments about the most important topics of our time\u2014in accessible, question-and-answer style. We hope it\u2019s the kind of feature people find worth reading once\u2014and then revisiting, as a reference, when issues come back to the news.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Q.E.D.&nbsp;Quod erat demonstrandum.&nbsp;You&nbsp;see it at the end of a mathematical proof or maybe&nbsp;you&nbsp;hear it at the end of an argument.
