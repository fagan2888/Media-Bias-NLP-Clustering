For those who have, not everything went exactly as planned.\n\nOne North Texas man says he signed up for coverage and has been paying his premiums, but the private company he signed up with is not providing him the coverage he needs.\n\nFormer pastor Lawrence Harrison has been unemployed for 18 months. He dabbles in landscaping to make a living and lives with several medical issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already had surgery on my neck because of degenerative arthritis. I have a rod in my neck,\u201d he explained.\n\nHarrison lived without medical coverage until the Affordable Care Act was initiated. He said he was excited when Healthcare.gov was established, because it meant he could get insurance coverage.\n\nThe Rowlett resident says he used Healthcare.gov to sign up for health insurance in October.\n\n\u201cI accidentally signed up for the HMO, cancelled it the same day, and signed up for the PPO, so I could go to the doctors I\u2019ve been seeing for the last 11 years.\u201d\n\nHarrison chose Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, but claims the company is not covering his care, even though he\u2019s paying his bill. When it was time to see his doctors, the coverage didn\u2019t match. For 60 days, Harrison fought to access the health coverage he signed up for under the Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still paying premiums. If I stop, they\u2019ll cancel my coverage, even though I\u2019m not getting what I\u2019m covered for.\u201d\n\nDue to privacy laws, a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson declined to discuss the specifics of Harrison\u2019s coverage complaints, but acknowledged the surge of medical coverage sign-ups has created challenges for the insurance provider.\n\nThe company released a statement today that reads in part, \u201cWe regret any delays our members have experienced in reaching our customer service team.\u201d\n\nTwo days after CBS 11\u2019s initial meeting with Harrison, Blue Cross officials confirmed the coverage Harrison wants and has been paying for.\n\n\u201cI am finally enrolled in the program that I signed up for,\u201d said Harrison.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m experiencing this, how many other people are in the same exact position, and why does it take an investigation by the news station to get something like this done?\u201d he asked.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield has also agreed to reimburse Harrison for his out of pocket medical expenses that should\u2019ve been covered under the insurance he\u2019s been paying for.\n\n(\u00a92014 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
