Former state lawmaker Sheila Kuehl and Kennedy family scion Bobby Shriver are in a runoff for the seat Yaroslavsky is vacating. Both supervisors were forced out by term limits.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors hired Fujioka in 2007 to take over as chief executive officer of the nation\u2019s largest local government as part of a management reorganization that gave new powers to the chief executive.\n\nThey scaled back Fujioka's powers in 2011, taking the county probation department and Department of Children and Family Services out from under his direct oversight.\n\nFujioka worked for the county for many years in various positions, including as a hospital administrator. He also served for eight years as the top administrator for the city of Los Angeles and retired briefly from that post before coming out of retirement to take the county position, where he earns a salary of $355,584 and oversees a $26-billion budget.\n\nMy biggest accomplishment is ensuring during the recession that we didn't lay anybody off, we didn't furlough anybody, and we continued to provide critical services. \u2014 William T Fujioka\n\nFujioka said in an interview that he had agreed to stay five years when he was hired, but he remained longer to help guide the county through the Great Recession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not have been a good time to go several years ago\u2026. When the day\u2019s over, my biggest accomplishment is ensuring during the recession that we didn\u2019t lay anybody off, we didn\u2019t furlough anybody, and we continued to provide critical services.\u201d\n\nHe declined to say who he would recommend to replace him, but said he thought the new top manager would need to have experience in a \"very large county\" because of the scope and diversity of services Los Angeles County provides.\n\nThe board had a difficult time filling the top post when Fujioka's predecessor, David Janssen, retired. After a months-long search, they offered the job to then-Orange County chief executive Tom Mauk, who agreed to take the post but changed his mind one day later.\n\nAlthough the county's finances have stabilized, the new top manager -- and new board -- will face serious challenges including the continuing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, a planned $2-billion reconstruction of the downtown Men's Central Jail, and sweeping reforms in the county's child welfare system.\n\nFollow @sewella for more county government news.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Los Angeles County top executive William Fujioka announces retirement", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Los Angeles County\u2019s top manager, William T Fujioka, announced plans to retire Thursday, signaling another wave in the sea change in county leadership.", "title": "Los Angeles County top executive William Fujioka announces retirement", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fujioka-retires-county-20140626-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53ac8fd7/turbine/la-me-ln-fujioka-retires-county-20140626", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Fujioka, supervisors, Los Angeles County, retirement", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80645572", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-06-26", "Description": "Los Angeles County\u00bfs top manager, William T Fujioka, announced plans to retire Thursday, signaling another wave in the sea change in county leadership.", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Fujioka, supervisors, Los Angeles County, retirement"}, "article_summary": "Los Angeles County\u2019s top manager, William T Fujioka, announced plans to retire Thursday, signaling another wave in the sea change in county leadership.\nMy biggest accomplishment is ensuring during the recession that we didn't lay anybody off, we didn't furlough anybody, and we continued to provide critical services.\nHis departure will coincide with a major transition on the board, as two new supervisors and a new sheriff take office.\nFujioka worked for the county for many years in various positions, including as a hospital administrator.\nFujioka, 61, said in a letter to his staff that he would step down in November to \"provide sufficient time for a smooth transition.\""}
