And no donor is more important than the host of this year\u2019s conference, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.\n\nThe conference was held in the Adelson-owned Venetian hotel and casino, and his presence loomed large over the gathering.\n\nNational media dubbed this year\u2019s conference the \u201cSheldon Primary,\u201d in recognition of the many potential Republican presidential candidates who arrived not only to address the crowds but for private sit-downs with Adelson, who spent a reported $93 million on the 2012 presidential election and has announced he will spend much more on 2016. He also is backing an effort to bring the 2016 Republican National Convention to Las Vegas.\n\nAlong with a Shabbat dinner address by Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, and a scotch-tasting with Israeli venture capitalist Jonathan Medved, this year\u2019s conference featured a cattle call of sorts for GOP presidential hopefuls. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, spoke at an exclusive dinner at Adelson\u2019s private airplane hangar March 27. On March 29, Govs. Chris Christie, Scott Walker and John Kasich, as well as John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, addressed attendees.\n\nAs they gathered beneath the Venetian glass chandeliers, painted ceilings and gold leaf ornaments of the hotel\u2019s palatial surroundings, conference-goers echoed many of the hot-button concerns that have dominated the GOP discourse \u2014 creeping socialism, the IRS, Benghazi. But one issue consistently stood out: Israel.\n\nConferees could be overheard sharing tales of Democrats\u2019 fecklessness toward the Jewish state, and it was invocations of Israel that drew the loudest applause during the speeches.\n\n\u201cThis administration has played Jews for suckers,\u201d Sobel said, accusing the Obama administration of \u201ctrying to put Israel in its place.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, Jews need to be one-issue voters,\u201d he added.\n\nAdelson, too, has long declared that Israel is his top political issue, above even banning online gambling.\n\nSensitivities surrounding Israel landed Christie in a bit of hot water during his otherwise well-received speech. The New Jersey governor was holding his audience spellbound with a rapturous description of his recent trip to Israel when he tripped a rhetorical landmine.\n\n\u201cI took a helicopter ride from the occupied territories across, and just felt, personally, how extraordinary that was to understand the military risk that Israel faces every day,\u201d Christie told the crowd.\n\nAlthough Christie received a standing ovation at the end of his speech, his use of the phrase \u201coccupied territories\u201d upset some attendees who felt that such wording casts aspersions on Israel\u2019s claim to the West Bank.\n\n\u201cChris Christie either does not understand the issues affecting Israel, or he\u2019s not a friend of Israel,\u201d said Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America.\n\nKlein said he brought up the remarks with Adelson, and Politico subsequently reported that Christie later apologized to Adelson in a private meeting.\n\nThe RJC\u2019s executive director, Matthew Brooks, dismissed Christie\u2019s remark as \u201ca slip of the tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have every confidence that Gov. Christie is an unabashed, unequivocal supporter of Israel,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nChristie was not the only candidate making an effort to connect with the crowd. Walker spoke of how his son\u2019s name, Matthew, translates from the Hebrew as \u201ca gift from God,\u201d and of lighting menorah candles at the Wisconsin governor\u2019s mansion. Kasich described his effort to build a Holocaust memorial on the grounds of the Ohio Statehouse.\n\nBolton brought the crowd to its feet with his fierce denunciations of the Obama administration\u2019s Iran diplomacy and his call for the United States to firmly back the Jewish state, even if Israel should choose to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\n\nBut the candidates also touted their broader appeal, with Christie and Walker citing their experience as governors of traditionally Democratic states and Kasich defending his decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, though without explicitly referencing Medicaid or the act known as Obamacare.\n\nAll the speakers pledged, with varying degrees of specificity, to pursue a muscular and assertive foreign policy.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we see within our own party a rising tide of what can only be called isolationism,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nBrooks said the RJC\u2019s focus was on this year\u2019s midterm congressional elections rather than 2016. Like many Republicans, he is hopeful the party can take control of the Senate. Brooks said the RJC was aiming to broaden its outreach as part of the campaign.\n\nSome of the politicians in attendance seemed to be tailoring their pitches more narrowly. Kasich made it clear that he had a particular target in mind as he concluded his speech to the conclave: \u201cHey listen, Sheldon, thanks for inviting me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "J. provides weekly news articles, reviews and features about the Jewish community of the San Francisco Bay Area and Northern California.", "author": "admin", "region": "ISO 3166-2:US", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "msvalidate.01": "1B0FF2D1969066FC86852DF20BB9EE65", "fb": {"app_id": 141824192518882}, "keywords": "J weekly, Jewish Newspaper, Jewish,  San francisco News Paper", "y_key": "f1c620d3aba89d73"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4357\"", "article_summary": "Adelson, too, has long declared that Israel is his top political issue, above even banning online gambling.\nSensitivities surrounding Israel landed Christie in a bit of hot water during his otherwise well-received speech.\nKlein said he brought up the remarks with Adelson, and Politico subsequently reported that Christie later apologized to Adelson in a private meeting.\nAnd no donor is more important than the host of this year\u2019s conference, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.\nChris Christie, Scott Walker and John Kasich, as well as John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, addressed attendees."}
