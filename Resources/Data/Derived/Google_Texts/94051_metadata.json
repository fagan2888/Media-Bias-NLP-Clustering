We can look at states like California or New York and see them struggle after decades of big government rule. There are many cities suffering from big government as well. Look at the experiment that was to be the progressive, shining example of government assistance, Detroit. The blight brought to Detroit courtesy of big government cannot be denied, facts are too clear. Regulatory entanglement and big government \u2018care\u2019 proved itself once again. Big government breeds destruction.\n\nOver regulation and the hands of big government always bring worse results than limited government and make sense regulation. Heavy regulation and big government do not act alone, they are bound together with political cronies who take advantage of complex processes and regulations to gain advantage over others. Charles Murray writes, \u201cAspects of America\u2019s legal system have become lawless, for reasons that are inextricably embedded in the use of law for social agendas.\u201d Even at the lowest levels it is increasingly difficult for citizens to simply speak with their representatives. Today they must bring an \u2018association\u2019 or lobbyist and invest hard-earned money just to have their case heard. If they want their case to win then a lot of money and very skilled lobbyists better be in tow, big government relies on these two areas.\n\nAs Bruce Yandle and Adam Smith point out, \u201cpoliticians run a kind of legislative protection racket in which they are rewarded for doing nothing.\u201d They are also rewarded for doing the bidding of cronies seeking regulatory advantages against competitors. \u201cOften, however, firms can profit as handsomely by hindering their market rivals as they could by seeking direct payouts from public coffers\u2014and without the public scrutiny that typically attends such transfers.\u201d Payouts from public coffers provides potential wealth for some at the expense of many. This leads to divisions of those who pay and those who collect and profit through government. Many paid, over the decades, for the government\u2019s experiment in Detroit and a few made great profits despite the failure of the regulations to help the people they claimed to want to help. This is a very common result of government over regulation.\n\nAs Calhoun pointed out in 1810, \u201cIt must necessarily follow, that some one portion of the community must pay in taxes more than it receives back in disbursements; while another receives in disbursements more than it pays in taxes. . . . The necessary result, then, of the unequal fiscal action of the government is, to divide the community into two great classes; one consisting of those who, in reality, pay the taxes, and, of course, bear exclusively the burthen of supporting the government; and the other, of those who are the recipients of their proceeds, through disbursements, and who are, in fact, supported by the government; or, in fewer words, to divide it into tax-payers and tax-consumers.\u201d\n\nCitizens become lost in a sea of regulations. Simply look to the tax code for an example of how regulations can grow out of control while consuming billions in productivity, while producing little in the way of direct benefits for most who pay. When income taxation was sold to the citizens as a very small tax on the very rich (sound familiar) in 1913 there were 400 pages according to the Wolters Kluwer CCH Standard Tax Reporter. The first 26 years saw another 104 pages added. Then came big government and social regulations growing the code to 40,500 pages by 1995. Since the dawn of Obamacare, or what regulators sold as the Affordable Care Act, it has nearly doubled again to 73.954 pages in 2014. This is just one book of regulatory codes citizens are accountable to, it is far more entangling when all federal, state, and local regulatory volumes are considered.\n\nThe federal government is now collecting more in taxes and regulatory fees than ever before. Spending more on social engineering and over regulation than ever before big government is leaving citizens so tied up in red tape we cannot even read the volumes of regulations we are accountable to live under. States and cities are learning from their federal overlords and styling government approaches the same; crony capitalism is breeding destruction while a few profit and citizens become further alienated.\n\nIt took far less government control to bring a generation of citizens to conclude, in the 18th Century, limited government breeds success. It stands to reason if big government over regulation brings failure to the many while benefitting the few than limited government regulation brings success to the many while challenging for a few. This type of logic led to the birth of the American experiment in limited government with the added idea of separating powers among several branches and levels to avoid crony capitalism and factional divide. The experiment had some rough roads but overall the United States prospered during a period when it actually operated under American federalism. Most people\u2019s lives improved and prosperity was the norm for decades.\n\nAs government began to morph into the lobbying, influence peddling behemoth of today prosperity began to once again shift from the many to the few. Politicians, major corporate partners, and factional groups effectively killed off the experiment of separation and limitation, leaving citizens today with little say and little choice, bound in a Gordian knot of regulatory oversight. The structure of government designed to be run by the U.S. Constitution is nothing more than a fa\u00e7ade.\n\nPeople living today do not understand their constitution because none have ever lived under its proper use. Limited government is nowhere to be found and prosperity is waning for the United States and every state in the union. Even states thought to be \u2018conservative\u2019 or friendly to small government are operating in a big government model. Texas is a shining example of a fa\u00e7ade of freedom with an operating system as corrupt and entangled as any other state, slowly choking the very freedom this great state is known for and it is nothing more than the latest state morphing into crony control.\n\nLimited government has been given very few opportunities in the history of the world. Each time it has success has followed. The United States was the last, best application of limited government, combining a unique separation of government powers. The experiment has long passed and big government now rules strong through bureaucracy, consolidation, and regulatory control. History shows clearly what follows and evidence is mounting America will not change history. For citizens to once again have any hope of success for the many, while caring for the few outside of government coffers, limited government must be restored.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nolan Chart", "description": "There are no shortage of examples proving big government stifles or, worse, destroys success.\u00a0 We can look at states like California or New York and\u2026", "title": "Limited government breeds success", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 686, "identifier": "https://www.nolanchart.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wolters-kluwer-cch-tax-law-pileup-2013.png", "height": 921}, "url": "https://www.nolanchart.com/limited-government-breeds-success", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Libertarianism", "tag": "success", "published_time": "2015-05-18T14:17:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T14:17:11+00:00", "author": "https://www.nolanchart.com/author/gary-wood"}, "fb": {"app_id": 380007855467375}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ab1\"", "article_summary": "It took far less government control to bring a generation of citizens to conclude, in the 18th Century, limited government breeds success.\nOver regulation and the hands of big government always bring worse results than limited government and make sense regulation.\nFor citizens to once again have any hope of success for the many, while caring for the few outside of government coffers, limited government must be restored.\nIt stands to reason if big government over regulation brings failure to the many while benefitting the few than limited government regulation brings success to the many while challenging for a few.\nLimited government is nowhere to be found and prosperity is waning for the United States and every state in the union."}
