The party, he wrote, could expect Obamacare to collapse under its own weight. But it shouldn't distract from the system's failures by causing the rest of the political system to sputter. \"Republicans will have a good shot at passing real reform\u2014so long as they avoid blundering into a government shutdown that will not stop Obamacare but will only lend credence to false Democratic claims that the problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t the law itself but rather GOP obstruction and sabotage.\"\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nMcCormack reminded me of that column today after President Obama's lengthy press conference drew no reporter questions on the implementation of Obamacare. There was agreement on the right and among mainstream reporters that this was crazy. And hey, I agree\u2014it was crazy!\n\nRemarkable is... one word RT @BCAppelbaum: Also, it is remarkable that Obama's been going for an hour and no one has mentioned healthcare. \u2014 Logan Dobson (@LoganDobson) October 8, 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut anyone who understands the normal rhythms of the press corps could have predicted this. Conservatives like McCormack did predict it. The press always rates a conflict above an expected outcome. The administration had previewed the health care exchanges by pre-apologizing for glitches. Glitches occured\u2014all the Slate readers participating in a project to report their \"lives under Obamacare\" failed to log in.\n\nThis was enough of a story to lead off the Associated Press's weekend interview with the president. \"What's happened is the website got overwhelmed by the volume,\" said Obama, \"and folks are working around the clock and have been systematically reducing the wait times, but we are confident that over the course of the six months\u2014because it's important to remember people have six months to sign up\u2014that we are going to probably exceed what anybody expected in terms of the amount of interest that people have.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Why the Press Didn't Ask Obama About Obamacare Today", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "On Sept. 30, the day before the shutdown, the Weekly Standard's great reporter-pundit John McCormack made a short yet complicated argument against Repu ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "On Sept. 30, the day before the shutdown, the Weekly Standard's great reporter-pundit John McCormack made a short yet complicated argument against Repu ...", "title": "Why the Press Didn't Ask Obama About Obamacare Today", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today/183654675.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Sept. 30, the day before the shutdown, the Weekly Standard's great reporter-pundit John McCormack made a short yet complicated argument against Repu ...", "title": "Why the Press Didn't Ask Obama About Obamacare Today", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today/183654675.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@daveweigel", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-08T16:38:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Why the Press Didn't Ask Obama About Obamacare Today", "sailthru.headline": "Why the Press Didn't Ask Obama About Obamacare Today", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Why the Press Didn\\u0027t Ask Obama About Obamacare Today\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today/183654675.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"200131008006\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-08T16:38:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"David Weigel\",\n  \"tags\": [\"government shutdown\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Why the Press Didn't Ask Obama About Obamacare Today", "keywords": "barack obama, government shutdown, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "barack obama, government shutdown, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://facebook.com/daveweigel"}, "sailthru.description": "On Sept. 30, the day before the shutdown, the Weekly Standard's great reporter-pundit John McCormack made a short yet complicated argument against Repu ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/08/why_the_press_didn_t_ask_obama_about_obamacare_today/183654675.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d77\"", "article_summary": "McCormack reminded me of that column today after President Obama's lengthy press conference drew no reporter questions on the implementation of Obamacare.\nGlitches occured\u2014all the Slate readers participating in a project to report their \"lives under Obamacare\" failed to log in.\nThe party, he wrote, could expect Obamacare to collapse under its own weight.\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\nRemarkable is... one word RT @BCAppelbaum: Also, it is remarkable that Obama's been going for an hour and no one has mentioned healthcare."}
