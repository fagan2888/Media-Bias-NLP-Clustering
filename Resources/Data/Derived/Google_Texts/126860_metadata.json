Buy this photo T.J. Sullivan, owner of Huggins Insurance in Salem.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to choose insurance policies, farmers can often find themselves considering some uncomfortable questions.\n\n\u201cThe question would be, do they have anyone else who can come in and step in?\u201d asks T.J. Sullivan, owner of Huggins Insurance in Salem, Oregon. \u201cIf they got cancer, and they couldn\u2019t farm, what would that do to their family?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where disability policies come in.\n\n\u201cThe ability to preserve that income while you get healthy is huge,\u201d says Matthew Woodbridge, a producer at Valley Insurance Professionals in Salem. \u201cAll the operating costs that happen day-to-day, you either have to take care of it from home or pay someone else to do it. Disability funds can help maintain that income and keep the business going.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance presents its own challenges \u2014 both choosing an individual policy and figuring out what benefits are required for employees.\n\nWoodbridge helps his clients assess the options based on several questions, including how often they visit the doctor, what they tend to see them about, whether they have any chronic conditions and what clinic access is like in their area.\n\n\u201cEach insurance company has a network of providers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn more rural communities, you don\u2019t want someone to have to drive an hour just to see the doctor.\u201d\n\nIn the case of chronic conditions, he points his clients toward carriers offering specific disease management programs.\n\n\u201cIf someone is diabetic, that can affect their ability to work at their business,\u201d he said, so getting them signed up for one of these programs can be beneficial to them and their farm.\n\nFor larger businesses, there is the issue of providing health coverage to employees.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act sets the standard that if a business has the equivalent of 50 full-time employees, then you need to offer them health insurance,\u201d Woodbridge said.\n\nThere is also a 100 full-time employee threshold \u2014 penalties for not offering insurance go into effect in 2015 for the 100 FTE level and in 2016 for the 50 FTE level.\n\nWoodbridge suggests business owners work with an agent to help navigate through the marketplace and negotiate with carriers.\n\n\u201cWorking with an agent also lets business owners look at all the carriers without having to research each one individually,\u201d he said. \u201cThe agents essentially do all the legwork.\u201d\n\nSullivan pointed out that business owners need to keep an eye on the status of any tax credits they might have in play with the ACA.\n\n\u201cSome farmers have applied for tax credits to afford the price of insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then they might end up having a bumper crop and making more than anticipated and seeing their income go way up.\u201d\n\nIn this case, they would end up having to pay back the tax credit, so he recommended setting some funds aside.\n\nWoodbridge added that one thing business owners and employees should keep in mind is their rights in regards to insurance.\n\n\u201cIn the state of Oregon, you have the right to buy health insurance regardless of legal status,\u201d he said.\n\nIn July 2014, the state approved a permanent administrative rule explicitly stating this.\n\n\u201cUndocumented access and the right to purchase insurance is a critical piece of the puzzle,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capital Press", "description": "When it\u2019s time to choose insurance policies, farmers can often find themselves considering some uncomfortable questions.\u201cThe question would be, do they have anyone else who can come in and step in?\u201d asks T.J.
