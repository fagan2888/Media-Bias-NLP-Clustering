Englewood police diverted a race in honor of a police officer killed in the line of duty after a body was discovered Saturday morning along the race course at Belleview Park, authorities say.

The police department was called about the body found near South Lipan Street and West Chenango Avenue at 6:30 a.m., said Sgt. Brian Cousineau, spokesman for the Englewood Police Department.

“It’s a suspicious death,” Cousineau said. “We’ve got the DA’s office and the coroner involved.”

A person was walking through the park early Saturday when he saw a person who appeared to be in trouble, he said. When police arrived they determined that the person was actually dead, he said.

Cousineau said he could not release details about the victim including the identity, gender or age of the person.

“It’s at a very preliminary stage of the investigation,” he said.

Police cordoned off the area and rerouted a portion of the 5K and 10K Jeremy Bitner Fallen Officer Run, which began and ends at Cornerstone Park.

“The race was altered so it wouldn’t interfere with the crime scene investigation,” Cousineau said.

Officer Bitner was killed May 28, 2012, when he was struck by a vehicle during a traffic stop.
