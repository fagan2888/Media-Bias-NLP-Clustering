PunditFact checks it out.\n\nBy Katie Sanders and Aaron Sharockman\n\nHouse Republican leaders fanned out across the Sunday shows to defend their attempts to overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration through a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe group came armed with the same talking point and a very specific claim.\n\n\u201cThe president chose to use an authority that he said 22 separate times that he didn\u2019t have the authority to do,\u201d Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Meet the Press\u2019 Chuck Todd.\n\n\u201c22 different times,\u201d Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said on Fox News Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe president last November did something that 22 times before he said he wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said on CNN.\n\n\u201cThe president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn\u2019t do what he eventually did,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation.\n\nAre Boehner and others right?\n\nTurns out the number is a bit of a stretch, but the broader point by Boehner and the rest is accurate. We rate Boehner\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nThe source for Boehner\u2019s claim is Boehner himself. After Obama\u2019s post-midterm elections announcement to delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the country for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards, Boehner\u2019s office created a BuzzFeed-style blog post detailing \u201c22 Times President Obama Said He Couldn\u2019t Ignore or Create His Own Immigration Law.\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, the majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress.\n\nFor example, Obama was asked in September 2012 if he would issue an executive action delaying deportation for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that \u201cas the head of the executive branch, there\u2019s a limit to what I can do\u2026 we\u2019re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,\u201d as in parents being deported.\n\nThe following January, Obama was asked why he couldn\u2019t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. \u201cI\u2019m not a king,\u201d he said.\n\nBut other statements on Boehner\u2019s list say something else or aren\u2019t specific to immigration.\n\nIn two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized \u201csigning statements\u201d used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, \u201cI can\u2019t simply ignore laws that are out there,\u201d in response to a question about \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

But he should refrain from the rhetorical flourish of saying Obama said it 22 times.\n\nLater in his interview with CBS\u2019 John Dickerson, Boehner alleged other examples of executive overreach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president of the United States overreaching, and that\u2019s just not on immigration,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cYou know 38 times he made unilateral changes to Obamacare. Many of these, I believe, far beyond his constitutional authority to do so.\u201d\n\nOn this number\u201438\u2014Boehner\u2019s claim rates Half True.\n\nBoehner\u2019s staff pointed us to the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market principles in health care. A Feb. 25 article lists 48 changes to the Affordable Care Act, but only 29 changes were made by the Obama administration.\n\nGalen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner told PolitiFact that the think tank will soon update its unilateral action count to 30, with the administration\u2019s recent decision to reduce cost-sharing. The law originally called for out-of-pocket maximums to be lowered for those between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, but the administration changed this provision to only apply to those between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty level.\n\nShe added that the administration repeated three of the unilateral actions, which would hypothetically bring the count up to 33.\n\nAnd an August 2014 report out of the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan government program, included five additional examples. All of these combined adds up to 38, Turner said.\n\nBut many of the changes are routine, non-controversial and technical in nature, experts told us.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, there have been 12 significant \u201cdelays, extensions\u201d or \u201cother actions taken by the administration.\u201d\n\nThe report says that the most controversial action has been the 2013 decision to delay enforcement of the employer mandate\u2014the requirement that employers with 50 or more employees must offer full-time workers affordable health insurance or pay a penalty\u2014to 2015.\n\nOf Galen\u2019s more comprehensive list, most are technical changes, rather than policy changes, said James Thurber, director of American University\u2019s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.\n\n\u201cMost are insignificant administrative actions by [Health and Human Services],\u201d Thurber wrote in an email to PolitiFact. \u201cThis is common under all presidents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "punditfact"}, "keywords": "Sunday Talk, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201503020004, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Sunday Talk, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Fact-Checking the Sunday Shows: Mar 1", "tags": "entity:event/sunday_talk,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Did Obama say \u201822 times\u2019 that he couldn\u2019t do immigration executive action?
