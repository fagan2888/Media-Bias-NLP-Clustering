But Denham had advocated for the drug during the group's meetings.\n\nThe committee's final report recommended the product's formulation to prevent infections, ProPublica found.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\"Kickback schemes undermine the integrity of medical decisions, subvert the health marketplace and waste taxpayer dollars,\" said Benjamin C. Mizer, acting assistant attorney for the Justice Department's civil division, in a news release announcing the settlement.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, the kickbacks to Denham caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims for ChloraPrep to the government's health care programs. As part of the settlement, Denham will be excluded from participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\n\"Quality and patient safety must drive all medical recommendations,\" said Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. \"Doctors that put profits ahead of this core value must be held accountable.\"\n\nNeither CareFusion nor Denham, who runs the consulting company Health Care Concepts and the research organization Texas Medical Institute of Technology, returned calls for comment.\n\nDenham did not admit to wrongdoing as part of the settlement. He previously denied any wrongdoing, saying his company had legitimate contracts for $11.6 million starting in 2008 with Cardinal Health, the parent company of CareFusion.\n\nDenham had enjoyed star status in the patient safety world until January 2014, when the Justice Department first alleged an improper relationship involving his work with CareFusion. He was beloved by patient advocates, a regular on the conference speaking circuit and produced a documentary with actor Dennis Quaid, whose newborn twins had suffered a medication error.\n\nAfter the kickback allegations, he was removed as editor of the Journal of Patient Safety, where an expert review found conflicts of interest. Denham's downfall has been called the patient safety movement's first scandal.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Chuck Denham, once a leading voice for patient safety, will pay $1 million to settle civil allegations that he took kickbacks to promote a drug company's product in national health quality guidelines, the Justice Department announced Monday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/chuck-denham-patient-safety-advocate-paying-1-million-settle-kickback-case", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/money-bills-feature_3.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Denham allegedly solicited and accepted monthly payments from CareFusion Corp., maker of the antiseptic ChloraPrep, while serving as co-chairman of a National Quality Forum committee in 2009 and 2010.", "title": "Chuck Denham, patient safety advocate, paying $1 million to settle kickback case"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/money-bills-feature_3.gif"}, "description": "Denham allegedly solicited and accepted monthly payments from CareFusion Corp., maker of the antiseptic ChloraPrep, while serving as co-chairman of a National Quality Forum committee in 2009 and 2010.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chuck Denham, patient safety advocate, paying $1 million to settle kickback case"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.propublica.org/article/alleged-patient-safety-kickbacks-lead-to-1-million-settlement", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dda\"", "article_summary": "After the kickback allegations, he was removed as editor of the Journal of Patient Safety, where an expert review found conflicts of interest.\nDenham's downfall has been called the patient safety movement's first scandal.\nDr. Chuck Denham, once a leading voice for patient safety, will pay $1 million to settle civil allegations that he took kickbacks to promote a drug company's product in national health quality guidelines, the Justice Department announced Monday.\nDenham had enjoyed star status in the patient safety world until January 2014, when the Justice Department first alleged an improper relationship involving his work with CareFusion.\nThe nonprofit quality forum in Washington, D.C., reviews evidence and makes recommendations on best practices that are considered the gold-standard by health care providers nationwide."}
