But much like their reaction to the recent report about the Affordable Care Act, they are jumping to conclusions far too quickly. First, there are reasons to be skeptical about the negative employment effect. Many studies find no negative employment effects. A recent report by Demos finds that by stimulating economic growth, a minimum wage could in fact create jobs. After all, a worker for one company is a customer for another. Minimum wage workers struggling to make ends meet are more likely to spend, reviving local economies. This is the argument forwarded by billionaire investment banker Nick Hanauer and economists like Joseph Stiglitz. It has strong theoretical support, as well as empirical support; studies show that poor workers are more likely to spend marginal income than wealthy workers.\n\nPart of the problem is that the CBO relies heavily on simulations, rather than the empirical (observed) effects of the minimum wage. Textbook economics would predict job losses; if you make a good (labor) more costly, you reduce demand for it. But the world doesn\u2019t work like a textbook. Workers being paid more may work harder (economists call this an \u201cefficiency wage\u201d). Workers struggling to make ends meet may not be paid in accordance with their ability, because they can\u2019t credibly threaten to leave their job or unionize (they will simply be fired and replaced). The most famous study on the issue, by David Card and Alan Krueger finds that, \u201cContrary to the central prediction of the textbook model of the minimum wage \u2026 we find no evidence that the rise in New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage reduced employment at fast-food restaurants in the state.\u201d More recently, these findings were replicated empirically by Arindrajit Dube, T. William Lester and Michael Reich.\n\nLooking internationally will not help Republicans. Even the right-leaning Economist magazine has argued that a minimum wage hike in Britain, \u201chas done little or no harm\u201d and instead, \u201cNot only has it pushed up pay for the bottom 5% of workers, but it also seems to have boosted earnings further up the income scale\u2014and thus reduced wage inequality.\u201d The U.S. minimum wage pales in comparison to other developed countries; Australia\u2019s is more than double our own. Historically, too, the current minimum wage is anomalous. Adjusted for inflation, it is far lower than the $10.77 a worker would be making in 1968.\n\nBut even if some minor job losses materialize, raising the minimum wage is still good policy. The data show that 55% of the people making a minimum wage work full-time and their the average age is 35. Many of these workers are struggling under student debt, or the costs of raising children. These are not simply college students working on the side; for many people these jobs are the only source of vital income. For these poor workers, a $3 raise may be the difference between a Thanksgiving Turkey and empty stomachs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When a new CBO report suggested a minimum wage hike could cost jobs, the right pounced.
