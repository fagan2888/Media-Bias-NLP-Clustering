Number 27 was starved and referred to as \u201cthe devil\u2019s child.\u201d\n\nMichaela DePrince, now 20 years old and a star dancer with the Dutch National Ballet company, was number 27.\n\nDePrince, orphaned at age three after rebels killed her father and her mother died of starvation, was abused because of a skin condition called vitiligo. The disease causes skin discoloration or spotting, and was not understood in the small West African village in which she was born. She had only one friend, orphan number 26.\n\nDePrince\u2019s one salvation in those early years came in the form of a dream she discovered by accident, stumbling upon a magazine that had blown through the gate of the orphanage. Just a small child, she saw a picture of a \u201cfairy-like creature,\u201d a white ballerina costumed in a pink tutu.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the joy in her face, I was determined to be happy too,\u201d DePrince says. \u201cAt that point in my life, I decided to be exactly like that lady some day.\u201d\n\nHi everyone, the posters are finally here. They will be available on Amazon in two weeks!!!! #Finally #michaeladeprince #takingflight #jadeyphoto Posted by Michaela DePrince on Sunday, July 26, 2015\n\n\n\nDePrince ripped the page out of the magazine and tucked it into her underwear, having nowhere else to store it.\n\nA teacher, the one woman at the orphanage that showed DePrince compassion, explained the image was a picture of a ballerina. DePrince began practicing dancing on her toes and twirling at the orphanage.\n\nTragedy struck again when DePrince later witnessed the murder of that very teacher. Rebels cut open the pregnant woman\u2019s stomach while a young rebel attempted the same on DePrince\u2019s stomach with a machete.\n\nTraumatized, DePrince survived the attack, the photograph of the ballerina her only remaining source of hope.\n\nAcross the world, the American DePrince family faced their own tragedy, losing three adopted sons with hemophilia to AIDS.\n\nThe DePrinces flew to Africa to adopt again, and found four-year-old Michaela and her best friend, orphan number 26, now called Mia. The family adopted both girls.\n\n\u201cDespite all the hardship and pain that Michaela had endured, she was the spunkiest, and feistiest, though tiniest four year old that I had ever met. She was a very bright and very strong girl,\u201d Michaela\u2019s mother Elaine DePrince says.\n\nIn total, the DePrince family has adopted a total of six orphaned girls in Liberia and Sierra Leone, all victims of raging civil wars. They encouraged all of their children to pursue their passions with equal vigor.\n\n\u201cIt has been a fascinating experience to watch Michaela go from the bedraggled, tough little girl that she was to a beautiful and gracious young woman who is so interested in helping others,\u201d Elaine DePrince says.\n\nHappy Mother\u2019s Day to the best mom in the world! I love you with all my heart! I miss you so much and I can\u2019t wait to see you this summer! ???? Posted by Michaela DePrince on Sunday, May 10, 2015\n\n\n\nWith the support from her parents, Michaela perfected her technique, simultaneously overcoming race and beauty-based stereotypes often associated with ballet.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of sacrifice to enable your children to do this,\u201d Elaine DePrince says. \u201cWe chose the girls over cruises and fancy restaurants.\u201d\n\nThe sacrifices paid off. DePrince won a full scholarship to the American Ballet Theatre in the 2010 Youth American Grand Prix. In 2011, she gained national attention after being profiled in the documentary First Position, a film about dancers.\n\nThen, in 2012 at age 17, she became the youngest dancer at the Dance Theatre of Harlem in New York City.\n\n\u201cWhat I love most about ballet is being able to express my emotions through dance, and to be able to bring others joy through my art,\u201d DePrince says.\n\nToday, along with her position at the Amsterdam-based Dutch National Ballet, DePrince has taught classes at schools in Brooklyn and in South Africa. Recently, she spent time as a volunteer guest teacher in several Southern dance schools in underserved communities.\n\nElaine and Michaela DePrince have also co-authored a book, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina.\n\n\u201cI hope to inspire other young people who have faced adversity, so that they can find a meaning to their lives,\u201d DePrince says. \u201cWhen I talk to groups of young people, I try to advise them to search for a dream and reach for it.\u201d\n\nAs for her dreams, DePrince hopes to one day launch free dance schools in Sierra Leone and the United States for young girls living in poverty.\n\n\u201cBeing adopted by the DePrince family has brought me everything I have in life,\u201d she says, conscious of how her life could have turned out in Sierra Leone if not for the DePrinces. \u201cIt has given me love, hope, and the opportunities to make my dreams come true. From them, I also learned about courage, compassion, and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the greatest lesson DePrince has taken away from her 20 years on earth traces back to those days in West Africa.\n\n\u201cThere is no way that anyone could experience a war and witness all the horror that it brings without gaining a greater respect for life and its possibilities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michaela DePrince was orphaned at age three in West Africa when rebels killed her father.
