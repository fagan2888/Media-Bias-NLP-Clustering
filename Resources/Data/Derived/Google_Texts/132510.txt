An off-duty St. Louis police officer remained in critical condition Saturday after being shot multiple times in his personal vehicle by an unknown assailant.

The shooting occurred near the intersection of Breman Avenue and North 25th Street in North St. Louis just before 4 p.m. Friday, a local NBC affiliate reported.

St. Louis Police Captain Michael Sack said the 28-year-old officer, who has been with the department for four years, is in critical but stable condition. His injuries are believed to be non-life threatening.

“An off-duty officer had been driving down this street in his personal vehicle when he came across an occupant or occupants in another vehicle,” Capt. Sack said in a press conference. “We don’t know what transpired, but the occupant or occupants of that other vehicle opened fire at the officer.”

Capt. Sack said the officer, who was not named, was shot several times in the lower extremities. Investigators did not get a description of the suspect or suspects, because of the officer’s condition. They are looking for a grey vehicle connected in the shooting, the NBC affiliate reported.

“He was struck a number of times,” the police captain added. “He drove a short distance where someone else, then, took over and drove his vehicle. We think it was someone who was not inside the car with him at that time.”

Police said the officer was armed at the time of the shooting, but it is unclear if he fired any shots.
