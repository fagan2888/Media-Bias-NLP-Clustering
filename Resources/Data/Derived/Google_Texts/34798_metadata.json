It is far more radical than that. It means that God is like Jesus.\u201d\n\nIt means that God suffers, God forgives, God fellowships with the poor, God cares for the sick, God loves His enemies.\n\nEven as a lifelong Christian, I struggle with doubts about God. I struggle to make sense of the violence in the world, the violence in the Bible, the violence in my own heart. I don\u2019t have all the answers.\n\nBut even when there\u2019s nothing left to my faith but a little seed of hope, that hope is in the incarnation, in the radical teaching that God loved us enough to become like us, and that when God wanted to show us what he was like, God showed us Jesus.\n\nRachel Held Evans is the author of \"A Year of Biblical Womanhood\" and \"Evolving in Monkey Town.\" Evans blogs at rachelheldevans.com, and the views expressed in this column belong to her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by Rachel Held Evans, Special to CNN (CNN) -- This week we celebrate Christmas, and as a Christian, I want to say I\u2019m sorry.
