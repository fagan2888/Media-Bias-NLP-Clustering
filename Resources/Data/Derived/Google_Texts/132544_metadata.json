The announcement is good news for the President, who has been widely criticized for the horrible launch of the online marketplace healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to bridge the information gap for people who can significantly benefit from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ron Pollack, the Executive Director of Families USA, tells TIME. \u201cToo many people who can benefit enormously are unaware of it.\u201d\n\nFamilies USA, a national nonpartisan nonprofit organization that calls itself \u201cThe Voice for Health Care Consumers,\u201d has been helping journalists find health care stories for decades. They found stories before the ACA was enacted in 2010 to show how the bill could prove beneficial, and have since collected stories of beneficiaries, like the young adult who can now stay on their parents\u2019 health care plan and the consumer with a pre-existing condition who now can buy insurance.\n\nThe unsolicited donation will \u201csignificantly expand\u201d the story bank, which is already over 950 strong, Pollack says, and allow the organization and its partner GMMB, a communications firm, to hire six new positions in Washington, DC. Pollack says that Families USA will be providing new stories for the media and others who are interested \u201cbefore the month is over.\u201d \u201cWe have a bunch of stories that are in the hopper for vetting,\u201d adds Pollack.\n\nOnly in recent months has the insurance exchange registered on the American public\u2019s radar. In early September, barely half (51%) knew that exchanges were going to be available in their state; that has risen to nearly two-thirds (65%), according to a Pew poll released this week. The cost of the website is also unknown: reports have suggested that the cost to taxpayers is anywhere from $70 million to over $350 million.\n\nWhat is known is that the website\u2019s software has had serious problems, from failing to properly set up user accounts to sending duplicate enrollee information to health insurers. The Obama Administration said Wednesday night that it will give Americans who buy health insurance through the new online marketplace an extra six weeks to obtain coverage before they incur a penalty, which is $95 per adult, or 1% of family income, whichever is greater. Those who buy coverage through the exchange will have until March 31, instead of February 15, to sign up for a plan.\n\nContractors who helped build and service healthcare.gov were grilled Thursday before a House committee. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will testify October 30 before the same House panel.\n\nThe federally run health exchange has been criticized for more than just the website. On Thursday the New York Times ran a front-page story on how the exchanges are not encouraging competition in rural areas, leading to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s uneven effect on the cost of insurance premiums. Earlier in the week the Washington Post ran a front-page story on how the network of nonprofit insurance companies, also created to foster competition and lower costs, was in trouble in part due to a lack of government funding.\n\nBut for now, Pollack and the media are mostly focused on the tarnished website.\n\n\u201cHopefully when it gets fixed we\u2019ll have a whole lot more stories to vet,\u201d said Pollack, who has talked with officials from the White House and HHS, including Secretary Sebelius, about the rollout. \u201cThe pool of people that we can work with is smaller than it otherwise would be, but we\u2019re expecting that will grow significantly in the weeks ahead\u201d as the problems are fixed, said Pollack.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Families USA has received a $1 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which it will use to collect and distribute to the media personal stories of those who have benefited from the new health insurance exchange rolled out by the Obama Administration October 1.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/25/families-usa-receives-1-million-grant-to-tell-pro-obamacare-stories/", "type": "article", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/rtr2c2pt.jpg?w=753", "site_name": "TIME.com", "title": "Families USA Receives $1 Million Grant to Tell Pro-ObamaCare Stories | TIME.com"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care,"}, "article_summary": "Only in recent months has the insurance exchange registered on the American public\u2019s radar.\nThe federally run health exchange has been criticized for more than just the website.\n\u201cToo many people who can benefit enormously are unaware of it.\u201dFamilies USA, a national nonpartisan nonprofit organization that calls itself \u201cThe Voice for Health Care Consumers,\u201d has been helping journalists find health care stories for decades.\n\u201cThe purpose is to bridge the information gap for people who can significantly benefit from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ron Pollack, the Executive Director of Families USA, tells TIME.\nFamilies USA has received a $1 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which it will use to collect and distribute to the media personal stories of those who have benefited from the new health insurance exchange rolled out by the Obama Administration October 1."}
