An iPhone reportedly exploded in a Long Island man's pocket giving him second and third degree burns and hospitalizing him in a burn unit for more than a week, reports ABC7.Erik Johnson, the iPhone owner says, "My iPhone blew up. And everybody's answer is 'What?'" The phone was in his pocket on Valentine's Day when it spontaneously exploded, just moments after he arrived at his cousin's wake."I had the phone in my pocket, simple little gesture, bent over to get keys and all I heard was pop. Sssssh smoke coming out," Johnson said. "And just like an instant burn, my leg just starts going on fire, try to get it out, can't get it out. I was literally jumping up and down trying to get the phone out of my pocket, but I think the phone melted my pockets shut so I couldn't get into it and I had to rip my pants off and throw the pants to the side. A couple of people actually said they could smell my body burning."With burns on his inner thigh, he spent 10 days in the burn unit before finally getting back home Tuesday, says ABC7. A nurse visits twice a day to change his bandage.Johnson had a metal case on his iPhone 5c which is now warped and stuck to the phone. There have been times in the past where iPhones have exploded ; however, those usually involved third party chargers. Johnson said he was using an Apple cable for his iPhone and hired Mike Della as his lawyer."Obviously Apple has to take a closer look at what they're putting out in the stream of commerce before they go out and sell these items that could potentially be this dangerous," Della said."I just want my leg back to what it was you know?" Johnson said.Apple told Eyewitness News that it's looking into the case.Take a look at the video below for more details...
