I\u2019m referring to the barrage of negative commentary being levied at the North Port K9 unit. The dogs are indispensable tools that are controlled and constantly trained by sworn, qualified police officers who have volunteered their time and resources to provided additional protection to everyone.\n\nWhen the situation calls for a canine, it\u2019s due to its ability to track the scent of a child or a lost person, to indicate if illegal drugs are present, or to detain and control fleeing individuals who choose not to complying with our officers.\n\nThese K9s are not \u201clet loose\u201d on law-abiding citizens; they are used to de-escalate dynamic, constantly fluid and dangerous situations that place the officer, his dog and the public in harm's way.\n\nSo stop complaining, and be thankful that we have a K9 unit that is highly respected and is on call 24/7 to protect you from those who believe the rule of law and your safety does not matter.\n\nLevko Klos\n\nNorth Port\n\nClimate change not debatable\n\nA recent Herald-Tribune article by Harold Bubil, titled \u201cSpirited debate on climate change,\u201d is an example of the importance of the upcoming election. We voters will choose between candidates who are committed to us, or candidates who are mainly committed to the bottom line of business interests \u2014 profit-making.\n\nI am a capitalist, which I am sure is true of the vast majority of Americans. I believe in free enterprise. so long as profit-taking does not take precedent over the need to protect us.\n\nIn Bubil\u2019s more recent article he referred to his previous column about the choice of developers in Miami to disregard concerns for rising sea levels. That disregard is either born out of ignorance or it is sadly callous and dangerous.\n\nToday, over 97 percent of the climate scientists are in agreement that global warming is occurring at rates never experienced before. There is irrefutable evidence that we would be in a cooling cycle if it were not for our human use of carbon fuels.\n\nGiven the overwhelming consensus by experts, it is incredibly irresponsible to deny this. Scientists admit that, yes, there is a remaining uncertainty in our understanding. The uncertainty today is just how soon places like Miami will be terribly flooded.\n\nIsn\u2019t it remarkable that our Republican Party stands alone on this? Every other country has opposing factions, but they all agree with the scientists on climate change. Please do vote.\n\nBrad Hardin\n\nVenice\n\nRubio's bad judgment\n\nI seriously question the judgment \u2014 and, by extension, the ability to run our country \u2014 of a person who would risk his squeaky clean image for the sake of a convicted drug offender.\n\nMaybe Marco Rubio can\u2019t help the embarrassment of accidents of birth or a relative\u2019s mate selection (his sister marrying Mr. Wrong), but he can help \u201cendorsement without reservation\u201d by not giving it: \u201cSorry, Orlando, but I cannot be associated with you, given your illegal behavior. Now get lost and never contact me again.\"\n\nI do not believe it is too much to ask of those seeking to represent us that they exhibit legal, moral and ethical behavior.\n\nMarco, you\u2019re done.\n\nDavid Timmerman\n\nNokomis\n\nObamacare ideologies\n\nRegarding \u201cMedicaid brawls reflect GOP split,\" an article reprinted from the New York Times that appeared in this paper Dec. 28: I call your attention to the following quote, mostly attributed to Joan Alker of Georgetown University: \"... the divide was 'a reflection of the larger fight in the Republican Party between more pragmatic Republicans, including governors, and the ideological wing of that party that wants to stop Obamacare at all costs.'\u201d\n\nThe \u201cideological wing\u201d referred to understands the huge additional costs of Medicaid expansion, with a heavy financial burden to be the responsibility of the states in the years to come. Yet, at the same time the \u201cideological wing\u201d has seen the studies showing increased emergency room usage in expansion states due to a lack of access to physicians (practices that accept large numbers of Medicaid patients can find themselves in bankruptcy) with dubious health outcome improvements.\n\nYes, the argument from \u201cnon-ideologues\u201d will be that we all pay for uninsured health care one way or another. That\u2019s an argument that might resonate better if not for skyrocketing premiums (for many, taxpayer-subsidized) and deductibles under Obamacare (as referred to by Ms. Alker) despite Medicaid expansion.\n\nSo I ask: Who really are the ideologues and who are the pragmatists?\n\nMichael Shevach\n\nNokomis\n\nLife-saving articles\n\nThank you for publishing the article about the unfortunate death of swimmer Tate Ramsden and the follow-up letter by Yale Emmer (Dec. 31).\n\nTwo of my grandsons are competitive swimmers in New Jersey. I sent the original article to my daughter, thinking that this might be something to be aware of. When I saw the letter, I told her, and she requested that I send it to her so that she can show it to their coach.\n\nIt seems that a few months ago, one of the girls on the team was doing underwater laps and fainted. Fortunately, my grandson and one of the other lifeguards on the team noticed and pulled her out. The letter may explain what had happened.\n\nApparently, this is not unusual. Coaches, swimmers, and parents and lifeguards need to be aware of this phenomenon and take precautions to prevent it.\n\nRuth E.
