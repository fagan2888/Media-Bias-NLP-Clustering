Jim Bridenstine put a former tea party group leader on his office payroll for six months to do a \u201cconfidential\u201d project that cost at least $64,000 in salary payments alone, according to public records and Bridenstine\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nHouse records show the Tulsa Republican\u2019s office paid Dean Clancy nearly $44,000 from late August through the end of 2014 and called him \u201cspecial projects manager.\u201d Sheryl Kaufman, Bridenstine\u2019s press aide, said Clancy was paid another $20,000 this year.\n\nKaufman said Clancy \u201cprovided expertise and oversaw a major legislative analysis and development project of a confidential nature. The work product has not been released.\u201d\n\nClancy also described his work as confidential, and he referred to it as a six-month contract with the congressman. However, House members aren\u2019t allowed to contract with people or companies for tasks related to legislation. Kaufman said Clancy was employed as a full-time staff member.\n\nMembers of Congress are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, so details won\u2019t be available until Bridenstine releases them.\n\nBridenstine, who has been associated with tea party groups since his first campaign in 2012 and has advocated tough measures to cut spending, actually spent more on his congressional office in 2014 \u2014 $1.18 million \u2014 than any of the other four U.S. House members from Oklahoma.\n\nAnd only he and former Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma City, spent more in 2014 than they did the previous year.\n\nThe information is contained in recently released reports that show all five of the Oklahomans spent less than they were allotted for their Oklahoma and Washington offices.\n\nThe allocations vary somewhat but are about $1.3 million a year. That does not include the congressman\u2019s $174,000 salary or the cost of benefits, such as health care coverage. Also, some lawmakers are able to pay top staff members partly through committees on which they serve.\n\nBecause of budget cuts, the allocations are down more than 10 percent since 2011.\n\nHouse records show \u2014 and the five Oklahoma offices confirmed \u2014 that staff members got either raises or end-of-the-year bonuses.\n\n\u201cCongressman Bridenstine\u2019s staff did not receive raises in the fourth quarter; however, supplemental compensation equivalent to about 7 percent of annual compensation was paid,\u201d Kaufman said.\n\nBridenstine hired Clancy in August, and paid him $13,667 for his first six weeks of work and then $10,000 a month for the last three months of the year.\n\nClancy\u2019s resume on his LinkedIn page is that of a three-decade D.C. veteran who has held numerous Capitol Hill and executive branch jobs for Republicans. He also spent time as a lobbyist and more than three years as vice president of FreedomWorks, a group aligned with the tea party movement and its political candidates who advocate for smaller government.\n\nBridenstine was among the tea party conservatives who pushed in 2013 for lawmakers to insist on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act as a condition for funding the government. The impasse between the House and Senate led to a 16-day shutdown.\n\nClancy describes himself as an expert in health care and the federal budget. He wrote a column last year challenging the Republican advocacy of selling health insurance across state lines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican tea party favorite hires \u201cspecial projects manager\u201d for $10,000 a month to work on secret project.
