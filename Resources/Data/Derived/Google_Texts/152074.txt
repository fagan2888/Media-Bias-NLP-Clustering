Graceland radio host Jennifer Meadows talks with Dr. Jerome Huyler on how taxes work, budget deficits and how redistribution hurts, not helps America grow

OXFORD, Miss., Aug. 23, 2015 – Anti-poverty programs that were put in place as a safety net have instead created a cycle of generational dependency we call the welfare state. Government assistance is no longer a temporary condition, but has become a way of life.

At the same time, big government spending has created $18 trillion dollars in national debt and there appears to be no end in sight. Entitlements and government spending are on an unsustainable course.

The easy answer to this problem is to stop spending.

Many will say that America needs tax reform or a balanced-budget amendment. Although these are good ideas, Dr. Jerome Huyler, explains in his book, “The Case Against Welfare,” the best way to correct the problem is to defund Obamacare and dismantle the welfare state. This includes anti-poverty programs, earmarks, business bailouts, farm subsidies and many other entitlements.

Government, in its original intent, was not designed to benefit some at the expense of others.

Thomas Jefferson said,

“The first principle of society is a guarantee of the free exercise of industry and possession of the fruits acquired by it.”

The U.S. Government’s primary responsibility is to protect, not provide for, us. America is the most compassionate nation in the world and, with a thriving economy unencumbered by a myriad of government entitlements and programs, would certainly be more than capable of taking care of its citizens who cannot take care of themselves.
