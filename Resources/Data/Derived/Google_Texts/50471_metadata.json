The administration\u2019s chief complaint was that the CBO had failed to take into account the findings from \u201crecent economics literature.\u201d\n\nIronically, according to an appendix to the report, not only did CBO researchers look at the economic research, they also decided that it was biased and revised their estimates accordingly, in a way favorable to the White House\u2019s position.\n\nRelated: White House Attacks CBO Over Minimum Wage Report\n\n\u201cAccording to some analyses of the minimum-wage literature, an unexpectedly large number of studies report a negative effect on employment with a degree of precision just above conventional thresholds for publication,\u201d CBO analysts write. \u201cThat would suggest that journals\u2019 failure to publish studies finding weak effects of minimum-wage changes on employment may have led to a published literature skewed toward stronger effects. CBO therefore located its range of plausible elasticities slightly closer to zero\u2014that is, indicating a weaker effect on employment\u2014than it would have otherwise.\u201d\n\nTranslated into English, this means that the CBO believes that economics journals are biased toward publishing papers that present evidence that minimum wage increases hurt employment, and are less likely to publish papers that show a weak effect \u2013 or no effect at all. So, when CBO analysts came up with their estimate of how big an effect a minimum wage hike would have on employment, they settled on a smaller impact than they believed economic literature would support.\n\nIn support of their decision, CBO analysts included a link to a paper by economists Hristos Doucouliagos and T. D. Stanley finding that, taken as a whole, \u201cthe minimum wage effects literature is contaminated by publication selection bias.\u201d\n\nRelated: CBO \u2013 Minimum Wage Hike Would Cost $500,000 Jobs\n\nSo if the economic literature on the minimum wage is unreliable, what does that say about the economic literature that informs policymakers\u2019 choices in other areas of research, such as trade policy, unemployment benefits, and immigration, to name a few?\n\n\u201cAs an economist, I hate to say this, but it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d said Leonard Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington and a professor of Public Policy at Syracuse University.\n\nBecause there are significant professional rewards associated with frequent publication, and because economists can mine data and refine models until they produce a suitably counterintuitive result, Burman said, much of the academic literature in economics may well be skewed toward papers that purport to invalidate accepted theories, while those that replicate another researcher\u2019s findings never get put into print.\n\nIt\u2019s a point that other economists have made in the past, and it marks a distinct difference between economics and the hard sciences, where research replicating others\u2019 results is not just valued, but is considered vital to the advancement of knowledge.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to publish the conventional wisdom,\u201d said Burman. Not even, it seems, if it happens to be correct.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office caused a stir Tuesday with its report on the minimum wage, but a little-noticed tweak it made to the data shows that the agency isn\u2019t confident in the academic consensus about the employment effect of hiking low-wage workers\u2019 pay.", "title": "CBO Finds Minimum Wage Research \u201cBiased\u201d", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/19/CBO-Finds-Minimum-Wage-Research-Biased", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04142011_Capitol_Cash_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/19/CBO-Finds-Minimum-Wage-Research-Biased", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04142011_Capitol_Cash_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office caused a stir Tuesday with its report on the minimum wage, but a little-noticed tweak it made to the data shows that the agency isn\u2019t confident in the academic consensus about the employment effect of hiking low-wage workers\u2019 pay.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd641\"", "article_summary": "So, when CBO analysts came up with their estimate of how big an effect a minimum wage hike would have on employment, they settled on a smaller impact than they believed economic literature would support.\nRelated: White House Attacks CBO Over Minimum Wage Report\u201cAccording to some analyses of the minimum-wage literature, an unexpectedly large number of studies report a negative effect on employment with a degree of precision just above conventional thresholds for publication,\u201d CBO analysts write.\nIn support of their decision, CBO analysts included a link to a paper by economists Hristos Doucouliagos and T.
