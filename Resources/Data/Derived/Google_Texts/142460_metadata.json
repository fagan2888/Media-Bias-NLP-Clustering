Dannel P. Malloy.\n\nWhile Democrats ceded control of the U.S. Senate to Republicans and lost the governorships in reliably blue states such as Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois, Malloy was able to withstand the GOP tide. He succeeded, not by drifting toward the center, but by wedding himself to President Barack Obama's agenda -- from raising the minimum wage to passing the toughest gun-control law in the nation. The win has boosted Malloy's stock within the national party and gotten Democrats from all over talking about his future.\n\n\"He's earned his place to have a bigger soapbox, if that's what he wants to have,\" said Jim Dean, chairman of the million-member liberal grass-roots organization Democracy for America.\n\nDean, a resident of Fairfield, is the brother of Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and a 2004 presidential candidate.\n\n\"He has been cited by some progressives like Mayor (Bill) de Blasio, of New York City, as an example of a Democrat who can win by emphasizing progressive themes, while many Democrats who moved in the other direction were defeated,\" said Ronald Schurin, an associate professor of American government and politics at the University of Connecticut.\n\nIn a column in the Huffington Post this week, de Blasio mentioned Malloy's name in the same breath as Minnesota Sen. Al Franken and California Gov. Jerry Brown, as an example of Democrats who stuck to their core values and won.\n\n\"And don't forget Gov. Dan Malloy -- who was written off by so many in his re-election bid in Connecticut, de Blasio wrote. \"Malloy raised taxes so he could invest more in education each year (at a time when other governors were slashing education to close budget gaps). Malloy passed earned sick time and a minimum wage hike. And in his re-election bid, he proudly stood alongside Obama.\n\n\"Malloy not only lived to tell about it on Tuesday, he increased his margin of victory in a rematch with his 2010 Republican opponent.\"\n\nSuch kudos at the end of his first term have caught the governor by surprise.\n\n\"What's funny about this is for most of the past four years, the progressives in Connecticut weren't happy with me because I wasn't progressive enough,\" Malloy, 59, said.\n\nMalloy's public tune about leaving his nest in Connecticut has been and remains: Love the one you're with.\n\n\"I have no intention of floating balloons,\" Malloy said. \"I'll play a leadership role if my colleagues want me. I love being the governor of the state of Connecticut.\"\n\nFellow Democrats say it's only logical that Malloy, who stumped with the president and first lady Michelle Obama the final week of the campaign, is emerging as a player in the national party after surviving the midterm election.\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, Dean said a faction of Democrats are looking for a liberal alternative to Clinton for president to take up the cause of economic inequality as Malloy has in Connecticut with his embrace of a $10.10 hourly minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Let's face it: There's a lot of folks out there that would like to see a primary,\" Dean said. \"I think Malloy's a bit of a hard charger. He's certainly someone who could bring that debate forward.\"\n\nBut even coming off a successful re-election campaign, political experts say running for president like a Joe Lieberman or Chris Dodd would be a leap for the battle-tested Malloy.\n\n\"Well, he was one of the few trees left standing, so that gives him a level of credibility and a stature that he may not have had before,\" Schurin said. \"At the national level, certainly in the presidential (race) there's Hillary Clinton and then there's everybody else. Dan Malloy's name, to my knowledge, has not appeared on any of those lists.\"\n\nSchurin said that's not to take anything away from Malloy's victory against Republican Tom Foley, who was also Malloy's opponent in 2010. Malloy won by 3 percentage points, more than quadrupling his previous 6,400-vote margin.\n\nNed Lamont, who lost the Democratic primary for governor to Malloy in 2010, said Malloy must first improve Connecticut's sluggish economy and address budget deficits before he looks to a higher office.\n\n\"I think we still have to get our fiscal house in order,\" said Lamont, a cable television entrepreneur from Greenwich. \"In order to have a national platform, it's a state that's still got some work to do.\"\n\nThat's not to say that opportunities won't present themselves to Malloy, according to Lamont, who credited his rival with taking ownership of his liberal record.\n\n\"I can see him as a really smart secretary of transportation or housing and urban development,\" Lamont said.\n\nBy intertwining his political fate with Obama, Malloy stood in stark contrast to Democrats elsewhere in the midterm election, including unsuccessful Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who refused to say whether she voted for the president.\n\n\"I think one thing that Dan did right and that a lot of his peers that went down in flames did wrong is he didn't run for the hills when Barack Obama's name came up,\" Lamont said. \"He's your president.\"\n\nOn the endangered species list of the Democratic Governors Association, which poured $3.7 million into the race in Connecticut through a super PAC, Malloy is now being mentioned for the chairmanship of the group.\n\n\"Coming off an Election Day which was just brutal for Democrats across the country, I think it's natural that folks at the national level will be looking at him and to him,\" said Roy Occhiogrosso, Malloy's longtime political strategist. \"To the extent that there are opportunities for him to help move forward a progressive agenda at a national level the way he has moved it forward in Connecticut, I think he'll certainly consider those opportunities.\"\n\nWhile Malloy was mayor of Stamford from 1995 to 2009, for two of those years he served as a trustee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\n\"The notion of Dan Malloy playing a leadership role at the national level is nothing new,\" Occhiogrosso said.\n\nSaid Malloy: \"No one should be shocked that I like to be actively involved.\"\n\nOcchiogrosso emphasized the governor's allegiances are to the Nutmeg State, however.\n\n\"As soon as you take your eye off the ball, that's when you have a problem,\" Occhiogrosso said. \"His eye has always been focused squarely on the ball and on Connecticut.\"\n\nCross-endorsed by the Connecticut Working Families Party, Malloy picked up about 25,000 votes from the liberal faction that is popular with unions.\n\n\"He's definitely a bright spot in the midterm elections,\" said Lindsay Farrell, the party's executive director. \"A lot of Democrats got clobbered this year in large part because voters didn't know what they stood for.\"\n\nSaying he is eager to get back to work on his second term agenda, Malloy spent the week meeting with policy advisers before traveling to Colorado for a meeting of the National Governors Association.\n\n\"With respect to who I am and what I am, that doesn't change,\" Malloy said of his victory. \"I certainly didn't run away from the president. I know who I am.\"\n\nneil.vigdor@scni.com; 203-625-4436; http://twitter.com/gettinviggy", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Malloy raised taxes so he could invest more in education each year (at a time when other governors were slashing education to close budget gaps).
