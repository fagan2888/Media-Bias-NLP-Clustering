MSNBC's Thomas Roberts was very prepared to take on Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) in a Tuesday interview, directly questioning the congresswoman's patriotism.

The two were discussing the looming debt ceiling deadline, and Blackburn was defending House efforts to revise Obamacare, when Roberts let loose.

"Do you hate Obamacare more than you love your country?" he asked.

"I gotta tell you something. I think that comments like that that you are making are just incredibly inappropriate," Blackburn replied, predictably.

On the whole, it was yet another successful effort by an MSNBC host to enrage a member of the GOP.
