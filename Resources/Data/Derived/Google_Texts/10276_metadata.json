Tillotson | Watchdog.org\n\nClosing arguments in the Vergara versus California lawsuit will be heard Thursday.\n\nNine student plaintiffs, sponsored by StudentsMatter, brought suit against the state, alleging several of the state\u2019s education statutes deprived them of their right to a quality education. Students, teachers, experts and other witnesses have spent the past several weeks arguing their case in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nA court decision is expected within the next few months, though the timeline is at the court\u2019s discretion, said Manny Rivera, spokesman for the plaintiffs.\n\nThe suit has been criticized for being funded by David Welch, a Silicon Valley millionaire and founder of StudentsMatter. The state\u2019s teachers unions, including the California Teachers Association, have intervened in the suit. Itself no stranger to money, the CTA spent more than $211 million in elections from 2000 to 2009.\n\nSome watching the court cases have said the legislature, not the courts, is the appropriate place for debates over teacher dismissal \u2014 but in California, reforming education through the Legislature is effectively a lost cause.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t typically believe in litigation. We\u2019re an overly litigious society,\u201d said Larry Sand, a retired California teacher of 24 years and president of California Teachers Empowerment Network. \u201cIf you have no recourse, that\u2019s sort of the last bastion. And here in California, the CTA \u2026 consider the state assembly their house. They assume themselves the fourth branch of government. Courts and litigation seem to be the only way to combat this.\u201d\n\nUnions have often used the courts to stop reformers or overturn school choice programs, and it may make sense for reform proponents to use the same tools, said Frederick Hess, resident scholar and director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. At the same time, he said, the legislature is the proper place for policy debates.\n\n\u201cThere are other people who are more liberal who could file suit and say, \u2018You know what, California\u2019s failing these children because it is not paying teachers twice as much as it currently is. California has to offer universal preschool for all 3 and 4-year-olds. California is not allowed to use testing because that\u2019s going to violate the quality of these kids\u2019 education.\u2019 Essentially, once you kind of start saying to the judges, \u2018You guys get to decide what a quality education requires,\u2019 you\u2019ve taken it out of the legislative process. You\u2019ve removed it from the citizens of California, and now you better hope the judges happen to agree with you,\u201d he said.\n\nHess said he agrees with the substance of the lawsuit \u2014 that the students\u2019 rights are being violated \u2014 but the ideal place for the conversation is the legislature.\n\n\u201cObviously, the makeup of the California Legislature means that such an approach isn\u2019t going anywhere, so it\u2019s partly a question of means and ends. This is why I\u2019m very sympathetic to the lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cRealistically, in that context, it\u2019s probably a question of either you file this lawsuit or you just sit on your hands for a while, as far as your ability to fundamentally change those statutory protections.\u201d\n\nContact Mary C.
