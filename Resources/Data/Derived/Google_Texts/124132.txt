Terrifying video shows the moment CNN anchor Poppy Harlow lost consciousness while speaking on a newscast Monday morning.

Harlow was speaking about a poll showing how satisfied Americans are with progress in “the war on terrorism.”

She said it was “quite a … quite a … turnaround…” when her words became slurred and trailed off into silence. For several seconds, audiences only heard the chilling noise of Harlow breathing.

Moments later, Harlow returned to her seat on air to announce that she had fainted but was feeling much better.

“For all of you on Twitter asking if I’m okay, thank you so much,” Harlow said. “I got a little hot, I passed out for a moment, but I am fine.”

Thank you all for your concern and messages! I am ok! Passed out briefly and am with the doctor now. So thankful to our amazing CNN team. — Poppy Harlow (@PoppyHarlowCNN) December 28, 2015

In 2011, Los Angeles reporter Serene Branson had a similarly terrifying experience during a live shot.

While she started off speaking coherently, she became visibly distressed as her words became increasingly garbled.
