But the questions they raise are hauntingly familiar.\n\nIn the days since Super Typhoon Haiyan swept through the Philippines on Thursday, survivors are frantically searching for lost family members and international aid groups are springing into action.\n\nOfficials say the death toll may rise to 10,000 in the heavily Catholic country. Meanwhile, many people are asking: How should we make sense of such senseless death and destruction? Was God in the whirlwind itself, as the Bible hints, or present only in the aftermath, as people mobilize to provide food, water and shelter?\n\nThese questions may not be new, but we keep asking them, perhaps because the answers remain so elusive.\n\nFor many Americans, a paradox sits at the heart of their thinking about natural disasters. According to a survey taken after 2011's earthquake and tsunami in Japan, most Americans (56%) believe that God is control of everything.\n\nBut more Americans blame hurricanes, earthquakes and other storms on global warming (58%) than on an angry and punishing deity (38%), according to a 2011 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute.\n\n\u201cThese kind of questions about God being in control and there simultaneously being suffering are the kind of things that keep seminarians up at night,\" institute CEO Robert P. Jones said in 2011.\n\n\"They\u2019re thorny theological issues.\"\n\nREAD: Typhoon Haiyan: Survivors in Philippines face grim struggle as death toll rises\n\nThe Bible's Psalm 107 says that \u201cFor (God) commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves thereof. ... He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the water springs into dry ground.\"\n\nBut, as the poll shows, most Americans have moved past the idea that God causes natural disasters, wrote Stephen Prothero, a frequent CNN contributor, in a 2011 column.\n\n\"When it comes to earthquakes and hurricanes, our authorities are geologists and meteorologists,\" Prothero said as he rode out Hurricane Irene on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. \"Most of us interpret these events not through the rumblings of the biblical prophet Jeremiah or the poetry of the Book of Revelation but through the scientific truths of air pressure and tectonic plates.\"\n\nFor atheists, storms like Haiyan are proof that God doesn't exist, author and activist Sam Harris said.\n\n\"Either God can do nothing to stop catastrophes like this, or he doesn\u2019t care to, or he doesn\u2019t exist. God is either impotent, evil or imaginary,\" Harris said after Japan's tsunami. \"Take your pick, and choose wisely.\"\n\nGod may or may not be in withering storms, but many religious leaders say they sense a divine presence in the aftermath, as people across the world mobilize to lend a hand.\n\nRabbi Harold Kushner is one of the most famous names in the realm of theodicy, a branch of theology that tries to explain the unexplainable: why a good God would allow bad things to happen.\n\nAfter Japan's tsunami, Kushner called nature \"an equal-opportunity destroyer,\" making no distinctions between sinners and saints.\n\nBut Kushner, author of the bestselling book \"When Bad Things Happen to Good People,\" said he sees God's hand in the resilience of people whose lives have been destroyed and in the \"goodness and generosity\" of strangers who donate and pray for the survivors.\n\nREAD: How to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan\n\nThat still leaves a tricky question, though: Why do humans suffer, sometimes terribly, in the first place?\n\nThere's no good answer, says the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and best-selling author.\n\n\"Each person has to come to grips with that,\" Martin said. \"It\u2019s not as if some magic answer can be found. But the idea of God suffering along with us can be very helpful.\"\n\nMuslims, on the other hand, see stormy trials as tests from God, said Sayyid Syeed, national director of the Islamic Society of North America\u2019s Office of Interfaith and Community Alliances.\n\n\"Muslims believe that God tests those he loves, and these tragedies also serve as a reminder to the rest of us to remain grateful to God for all our blessings and cognizant that we must support those in need,\" Syeed said.\n\nVietnamese Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh, whose native country remains in Haiyan's path, said such storms remind us that our lives are impermanent and the importance of treasuring each moment.\n\n\"This is the best that we can do for those who have died: We can live in such a way that they can feel they are continuing to live in us, more mindfully, more profoundly, more beautifully, tasting every minute of life available to us, for them,\" Hanh said.\n\nStephen Prothero, Jessica Ravitz and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN) --\u00a0The disasters are always different and often devastating.\u00a0But the questions they raise are hauntingly familiar.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Where was God in the Philippines?", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/11/where-was-god-in-the-philippines/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131111152321-man-shelters-haiyan-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-editor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) --\u00a0The disasters are always different and often devastating.\u00a0But the questions they raise are hauntingly familiar.", "title": "Where was God in the Philippines?"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "asia, atheism, belief, bible, buddhism, christianity, death, ethics, faith, god, islam, judaism, natural disasters, philippines, prayer, book of revelation, haiyan, harold kushner, philippines, public religion research institute, sam harris, tacloban, the rev. james martin, theodicy, thich nhat hanh", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/11/where-was-god-in-the-philippines/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "In the days since Super Typhoon Haiyan swept through the Philippines on Thursday, survivors are frantically searching for lost family members and international aid groups are springing into action.\nAfter Japan's tsunami, Kushner called nature \"an equal-opportunity destroyer,\" making no distinctions between sinners and saints.\nBy Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-editor(CNN) - The disasters are always different and often devastating.\nREAD: Typhoon Haiyan: Survivors in Philippines face grim struggle as death toll risesThe Bible's Psalm 107 says that \u201cFor (God) commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves thereof.\nAccording to a survey taken after 2011's earthquake and tsunami in Japan, most Americans (56%) believe that God is control of everything."}
