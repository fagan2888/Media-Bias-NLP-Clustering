Beyond the local market, the need for health-care workers in a variety of fields shows no signs of easing, according to studies.\n\nHealth care is expected to remain among the fastest-growing industries from 2012 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. As of 2013, there were 16 million jobs in industry.\n\nThis past June alone, health care employment grew by 21,000 jobs, with the biggest gains in ambulatory health care, nursing and residential care, according to the federal agency.\n\nIn 2009, the American Hospital Association\u2019s long-range policy committee examined workforce issues and pointed to key factors creating new demands for health-care professionals, which include scientific advances, reimbursement changes, fewer uninsured patients, broader use of electronic medical records and greater use of ambulatory care.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of the biology and health-related fields corresponds to increasing student interest in those areas,\u201d Michael A. Dauphinais, Ave Maria\u2019s vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty, said in an email. \u201cTogether with our current majors in biology and biochemistry, students will now have a number of areas in which they may concentrate their studies in biological and health areas.\u201d\n\nAve Maria draws students nationally, yet 40 percent come from within the state, he said.\n\n\u201cThe health-related majors at Ave Maria builds upon the strength of the residential campus community, the strong liberal arts core curriculum, and the Catholic mission of the campus,\u201d he said.\n\nHodges\u2019 new master\u2019s degree program will be online and is intended for people already employed in the health care industry who want to enrich their opportunities, said Carlene Harrison, dean of the School of Allied Health.\n\n\u201cThe way we designed the program, there are two tracts all online and all accelerated,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can complete four courses in a semester.\u201d\n\nOne tract is health administration, which will qualify someone in management, organizational behavior and communications, she said.\n\nIn 2012, Forbes magazine ranked the master of science degree in health services administration as one of the top 10 best degrees, where mid-career median pay is $88,580, according to Hodges.\n\nThe second tract is health infomatics, a discipline that enables hospitals, universities and others to determine what to do with data about clinical care and related issues.\n\nSomeone can get a master\u2019s degree in health informatics or they can get a certificate for completing the program if they don\u2019t want a master\u2019s degree, she said.\n\nBesides an ongoing shortage of primary-care doctors due to aging baby boomers and a surge in more people having insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s a widespread shortage for health information professionals.\n\nOne study found the U.S. will be short of 51,000 health information workers by the end of 2014, particularly in rural areas, according to iHealthBeat, part of the California HealthCare Foundation.\n\nThe master\u2019s degree program is a total of 10 courses for 7 and 1/2 weeks, she said.\n\nHarrison said the hope is to enroll 20 students but it is a national recruitment rather than a local focus.\n\nThe bachelor\u2019s degree program in biomedical sciences provides a solid background for future graduate level studies in allied health or biological sciences, according to Hodges.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Hodges, Ave Maria universities offering more degrees in medical field", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/education/hodges-ave-maria-universities-offering-more-degrees-in-medical-field-ep-506639003-337204801.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/166142142_1404326150148_6638083_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "Two Southwest Florida universities are expanding degree programs in medical fields to help address the need for hands-on health care workers, information technology specialists and health care administrators.", "title": "Hodges, Ave Maria universities offering more degrees in medical field"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/166142142_1404326150148_6638083_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Two Southwest Florida universities are expanding degree programs in medical fields to help address the need for hands-on health care workers, information technology specialists and health care administrators.", "site": "@ndn", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hodges, Ave Maria universities offering more degrees in medical field"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd525a\"", "article_summary": "Ave Maria University will offer six new majors this fall, including biology, health science and health science administration.\nThis past June alone, health care employment grew by 21,000 jobs, with the biggest gains in ambulatory health care, nursing and residential care, according to the federal agency.\nThe master\u2019s degree program is a total of 10 courses for 7 and 1/2 weeks, she said.\nHealth care is expected to remain among the fastest-growing industries from 2012 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n<p>Cardiogram and stethoscope</p>By Liz Freeman of the Naples Daily NewsTwo Southwest Florida universities are expanding degree programs in medical fields to help address the need for hands-on health care workers, information technology specialists and health care administrators."}
