For almost 240 years, the american flag has served as our nation's symbol. With June 14th known as Flag Day around the U.S., many came to the Panama City Beach Fleet Reserve Association's flag retirement ceremony to show respect for the stars and stripes, and retire worn flags from all across the area.

After serving in the Navy for 33 years, Tommy Grant says he holds a special place in his heart for the red, white, and blue.

"I know what it took to defend this flag, and this flag to me is freedom," said Grant. "It's freedom, liberty, and it's all for that our forefathers fought for us to get."

Being his second ceremony with the Boy Scouts Troop 317, Alex Hansen says he thinks it's great to give those who haven't participated before a chance to see how flags are properly retired.

"I think its pretty cool how it's also a learning experience for them, so they can learn and pass it down to others that come," said Hansen.

According to Grant, the current way to properly retire a flag dates back all the way to the Civil war. He says the ceremony gave people a chance to show respect for the stars and stripes, and to give worn flags a proper burial.

"You're always looking up towards the heavens, and towards the flag saying, 'Hey I respect that you are here for giving the homage that it needs to have," said Grant. "It's a beautiful thing."

Grant says around 60 to 70 flags were retired today, and anyone can donate worn flags to any local military branch.
