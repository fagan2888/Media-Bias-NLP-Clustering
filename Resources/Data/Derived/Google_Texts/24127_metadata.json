Kolko pleaded guilty May 13 in the middle of a trial in Superior Court in Toms River to aggravated sexual assault, attempted aggravated sex assault, sexual assault and child endangerment.\n\nProsecutors allege the abuse occurred from August 2008 to February 2009 and ranged from fondling to oral sex and stopped when the boy told his father, who confronted Kolko. The boy was 11 when the alleged abuse began. He testified during the trial.\n\nAttorney Alan Zegas told the Asbury Park Press that Kolko, 39, \u201cwas significantly pressured\u201d from the community to plead guilty.\n\nAt the time of the plea, the case was viewed as a potential watershed for the Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Orthodox Jewish community in Lakewood, which had previously been reluctant to bring criminal matters to civil authorities, preferring instead to handle them through rabbinical courts and senior rabbis.\n\nThe victim\u2019s father had initially wanted the case handled within Lakewood\u2019s Orthodox community, asking a senior rabbi to help ensure that Kolko stay away from children and go to therapy. In mid-2009, the father decided to take the case to authorities.\n\nProsecutors had said the boy\u2019s family was ostracized by the community for pursuing the case in state court. The boy\u2019s father, a prominent rabbi, lost his job and the family moved to Michigan.\n\nOn the day of Kolko\u2019s plea, when Judge Francis R. Hodgson asked him if he had received any promises or was threatened or coerced in exchange for his plea, Kolko answered softly that there were things that were \u201cnot part of the court system.\u201d\n\nA judge gave Zegas until the end of the month to file a brief in support of his motion to withdraw the guilty plea. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 17.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Lakewood ex-yeshiva teacher pleads guilty to sexually assaulting boy\n\n\u2022 Sex abuse cases are about children, not religion: Editorial", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','toms-river'", "title": "N.J. yeshiva teacher seeks to pull sex abuse plea", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"N.J. yeshiva teacher seeks to pull sex abuse plea \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/nj_yeshiva_teacher_seeks_to_pull_sex_abuse_plea.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/05/ocean-county-courthouse-toms-riverjpg-63a9adf09faf3e5f.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11197282\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-07T17:01:50Z\", \"author\": \"The Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"toms-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/05/12711352-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Yosef Kolko pleaded guilty in May to abusing the then-11-year-old boy in 2008 and 2009", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  3:43 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/05/ocean-county-courthouse-toms-riverjpg-63a9adf09faf3e5f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njoapnews\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"1828075\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Yosef Kolko pleaded guilty in May to abusing the then-11-year-old boy in 2008 and 2009", "title": "N.J. yeshiva teacher seeks to pull sex abuse plea", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/nj_yeshiva_teacher_seeks_to_pull_sex_abuse_plea.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  1:01 PM", "article_author": "The Associated Press", "Description": "Yosef Kolko pleaded guilty in May to abusing the then-11-year-old boy in 2008 and 2009"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf11\"", "article_summary": "The attorney for Yosef Kolko said he has filed a motion to withdraw Kolko\u2019s guilty plea.\nRELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Lakewood ex-yeshiva teacher pleads guilty to sexually assaulting boy\u2022 Sex abuse cases are about children, not religion: Editorial\nTOMS RIVER \u2014 A former yeshiva camp counselor who pleaded guilty in May to sexually abusing a child is seeking to withdraw his guilty plea and claims he was pressured by his Orthodox Jewish community in Lakewood.\nAttorney Alan Zegas told the Asbury Park Press that Kolko, 39, \u201cwas significantly pressured\u201d from the community to plead guilty.\nProsecutors allege the abuse occurred from August 2008 to February 2009 and ranged from fondling to oral sex and stopped when the boy told his father, who confronted Kolko."}
