At nonprofit hospitals, an unpaid bill either becomes bad debt for the patient or is written off as \u201ccharity care.\u201d Nationally, this adds up to $57 billion in uncompensated care. But a group of researchers argue that the way charity care is given out could be made more efficient.\n\nA new report by The Hamilton Project, an initiative of the Brookings Institution, looks at a proposal to improve the charity-care system in the U.S. Three researchers at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management\u2014David Dranove, Craig Garthwaite, and Christopher Ody\u2014argue that the supply and demand for charity care are not geographically aligned. That is, hospitals with the most resources to offer charity care aren\u2019t in the places where people most need it. In high-income areas, hospitals are better funded and more able to provide charity care. But it\u2019s in the hospitals in low-income areas where the demand is highest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the U.S., nonprofit hospitals provide billions of dollars to cover unpaid care every year.
