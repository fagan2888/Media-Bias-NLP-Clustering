It\u2019s a working-class community alive with the synergy of folks just getting by, grabbing at pieces of joy along the way.\n\nAuthenticity is its culture, particularly compared with other parts of the city being blitzed by gentrification. Like many urban enclaves, financial and social factors complicate residents\u2019 pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe black population in the District is 49.5 percent. The black population in Anacostia is 94 percent.\n\nThe median household income in the District is $64,267. The median household income in Anacostia is $32,262, down by nearly $3,000 in the past two years.\n\nThe D.C. unemployment rate is 7.7 percent. Anacostia\u2019s is 35 percent.\n\nThose statistics distilled into real life mean there are many black people in a relatively small area making a lot less money, if any money at all, than other people in the District, this as rents approach prohibitive figures citywide. The number of apartments and condominiums in the District commanding rents of $1,000 or more per month has doubled in less than 10 years, but cost-of-living increases, for most people, are the stuff of wishful thinking and yet-unanswered prayer.\n\nIt\u2019s a cocktail of stressors that exacerbates the urgency of the need for mental-health care. But the people who need it generally can\u2019t afford it. It\u2019s an issue in Anacostia as much as it is in Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore and other metropolises where too many black people are suffocating under the pressures of being broke.\n\nSatira Streeter, executive director of Ascensions Psychological and Community Services, has been an advocate for mental health in Anacostia for more than 10 years. Because it is a nonprofit entity, Streeter\u2019s organization is a model for making clinical psychology available to communities in urgent need.\n\nMany of her colleagues wouldn\u2019t slide out of bed for the $25 co-pay her office charges clients, much less venture into some of the city\u2019s most economically and socially challenged neighborhoods for that amount of money, and her colleagues have told her as much.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we do that\u2019s different is accept Medicaid and all insurance companies. But if you don\u2019t have insurance, what do you do about your mental-health care?\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a running question since Streeter, a psychologist, founded the practice in 2004 specifically to help African Americans handle the systemic effects of poverty and racism. She\u2019s seen an uptick in clientele since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the so-called Obamacare, which has helped her treat more people for depression\u2014the condition she sees most often\u2014and take on individuals and families. Such care can be life-changing for the people with the insight to seek it and the means to pay for it.\n\n\u201cI had a client just yesterday who said, \u2018Yes, I have insurance, but I can\u2019t appropriate $25 for the co-pay for therapy when I have three children. If I have to make a choice, the mental-health care will have to go, even though I need it.\u2019 They have to make a decision to provide for the physical needs of their families,\u201d Streeter said.\n\nIt\u2019s another unfortunate consequence of financial struggle that feeds the cycle of disadvantage. And yet there is also such a thing as not being poor enough.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/514630605.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "Mental-health care is still lacking for poor communities of color, where the need for it is most urgent.", "title": "Mental-Health Care Still Lacking for Those in Poverty", "url": "http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/11/mental_health_care_still_lacking_for_those_in_poverty", "image": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/514630605.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-16 03:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Mental-Health Care Still Lacking for Those in Poverty", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 110960888944481}, "sailthru.tags": "Culture", "sailthru.description": "<p>Anacostia is a neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C., where life spills unassumingly onto the sidewalks in front of barber shops and cafes, churches and liquor stores, schools and small businesses.
