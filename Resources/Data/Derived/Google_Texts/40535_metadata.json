The book also offers some insight into their divorce, consummated this month with the expiration of their in-network contract.\n\nThe book recounts how Highmark and UPMC enjoyed a long-standing symbiotic and mutually enriching relationship for years and, according to Mr. Brill, how concerns about an antitrust lawsuit by a then-independent West Penn Allegheny Health System led to their breakup.\n\nBut Mr. Brill pays particular attention to UPMC and how the health system bought up area hospitals to create a massive provider network while launching its own health insurance plan to compete with Highmark.\n\nThe goal for UPMC, the author contends, was complete domination of the local health care market. He quotes Mr. Romoff saying the acquisitions \u201cwere just a step-by-step process of controlling the impediments.\u201d\n\nMr. Brill does offer somewhat grudging admiration for how, under Mr. Romoff\u2019s leadership, UPMC has grown into an $11 billion, world-class health system \u2014 a point noted by UPMC spokesman Paul Wood.\n\n\u201cBrill\u2019s idea of [health care] nirvana may already exist right here in Western Pennsylvania, especially when you combine UPMC\u2019s lowest-in-the-country insurance premiums with our well-recognized \u2018top 10 in the nation\u2019 quality care and academic excellence,\u201d Mr. Wood wrote in an email Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing he says is that UPMC is aggressive/\u200bcompetitive \u2026 but wins.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Mr. Brill refers to the health giant as \u201cperhaps the world\u2019s most tough-minded, profit-oriented nonprofit.\u201d\n\nBut while extolling the UPMC model of a dominant dual provider-insurer system designed to hold down costs, Mr. Brill also asks, \u201cDo we want Romoff to have all that power?\u201d\n\nMr. Brill\u2019s recommendation is that we \u201censure that accountability by insisting on tight regulation, mostly through the smarter use of federal antitrust law and state regulatory authority.\u201d\n\nTwo of his suggested regulations would require that every market have at least two provider-insurer health systems and that operating profits be capped at 8 percent. Mr. Wood pointed out that UPMC\u2019s operating margin was 1.7 percent in fiscal 2014 and 1.3 percent in 2013.\n\nAnother proposed regulation would cap a CEO\u2019s salary at 60 times the lowest-paid physician. In that scenario, Mr. Brill writes, Mr. Romoff\u2019s salary would be capped at just over $3 million, which would put him more in line with his counterparts at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and Geisinger Health System in Central Pennsylvania. Mr. Romoff\u2019s total compensation for fiscal 2013 was $6.55 million.\n\nThe author recommended that integrated health systems such as UPMC have a physician at the helm because \u201cthe culture of these organizations needs to be ensured.\u201d\n\nUPMC spokesman Mr. Wood countered, \u201cFew M.D.s, while they clearly understand the medicine and the physician-patient relationship, have the business acumen to run an integrated insurer-provider [health care] system.\n\n\u201cSimply take a look at Highmark \u2026 their last two CEOs have been M.D.s and they\u2019ve failed spectacularly. WPAHS\u2019s last CEO was an M.D. and that didn\u2019t work out so well for WPAHS or him.\u201d\n\nSteve Twedt: stwedt@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1963.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new book by Steven Brill refers to UPMC as \u201cperhaps the world\u2019s most tough-minded, profit-oriented nonprofit.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Pittsburgh\u2019s health care market \u2014 and UPMC health system and its president and CEO Jeffrey Romoff, in particular \u2014 feature prominently in a new book by Steven Brill, the author of a groundbreaking 2013 Time magazine essay on medical bills.
