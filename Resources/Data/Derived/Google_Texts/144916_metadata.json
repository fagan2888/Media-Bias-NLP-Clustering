Uber moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 Lanham Act claim, contending that the safety-related statements were non-actionable puffery and were not disseminated in a commercial context. Uber also moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 California unfair competition law (\u201cUCL\u201d) claim for lack of standing, and moved to strike plaintiffs\u2019 request for restitution under the UCL and California\u2019s false advertising law (\u201cFAL\u201d).\n\nDeclining to put the brakes on the lawsuit in its entirety, the court granted in part and denied in part Uber\u2019s motion. L.A. Taxi Cooperative, Inc. v. Uber Technologies, Inc., 2015 WL 4397706 (N.D. Cal. July 17, 2015).\n\nThe court agreed that some of Uber\u2019s statements were non-actionable puffery. For example, Uber\u2019s claim that it was \u201cGOING THE DISTANCE TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST\u201d was \u201cclearly the type of \u2018exaggerated advertising\u2019 slogans upon which consumers would not reasonably rely.\u201d It would be impossible to measure whether or how Uber was fulfilling this promise. Likewise, Uber\u2019s statement \u201cBACKGROUND CHECKS YOU CAN TRUST\u201d was puffery because it made no specific claim about Uber\u2019s services. The court therefore dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to these non-actionable statements.\n\nOn the other hand, the court did not agree that Uber was merely puffing when it claimed it was \u201csetting the strictest safety standard possible,\u201d that its safety is \u201calready best in class,\u201d that its \u201cthree-step screening\u201d background check process adheres to a \u201ccomprehensive and new industry standard,\u201d or when Uber compared its background check process to the taxi industry\u2019s background check process. These statements were not puffery because \u201c[a] reasonable consumer reading these statements in the context of Uber\u2019s advertising campaign could conclude that an Uber ride is objectively and measurably safer than a ride provided by a taxi . . . .\u201d\n\nThe court also rejected Uber\u2019s argument that, because certain advertising claims were preceded by phrases like \u201cUber is committed to\u201d or \u201cUber works hard to\u201d \u2013 for example, \u201cWe are committed to improving the already best in class safety and accountability of the Uber platform . . .\u201d \u2013 that the advertising claims were merely aspirational and therefore non-actionable. The challenged statements did more than assert that Uber was committed to safety, the court found; they included statements regarding the objective safety and accountability of Uber\u2019s service. A reasonable consumer might rely on such statements, so the court denied Uber\u2019s motion to dismiss in this regard.\n\nThe court found that certain advertising statements Uber made to the media were non-commercial speech and therefore not actionable under the Lanham Act or California state law. These statements were made in response to journalists\u2019 inquiries, and were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the journalists\u2019 independent \u2013 and largely critical \u2013 coverage of Uber\u2019s safety record, which was a matter of public concern. Accordingly, the court granted Uber\u2019s motion and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims relating to these non-actionable statements.\n\nBut the court did find Uber\u2019s statements on ride receipts to be commercial speech. Following a completed ride, Uber emails its customers a receipt that includes a $1.00 \u201cSafe Rides Fee.\u201d Uber explains to customers who click on a link in the receipt that the fee was intended \u201cto ensure the safest possible platform for Uber riders,\u201d that Uber would put the fee towards its \u201ccontinued efforts to ensure the safest possible platform,\u201d and that \u201cyou\u2019ll see this as a separate line item on every uberX receipt.\u201d Uber contended that such statements related to a past transaction, rather than a prospective transaction that Uber sought to induce, and therefore did not amount to commercial speech. The court disagreed, finding that \u201cthe complaint adequately allege[d] that the statements relating to the \u2018Safe Rides Fee\u2019 [were] made for the purpose of influencing consumers to use Uber\u2019s services again.\u201d\n\nOn the California UCL claim, the court found that the taxicab plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not allege that they relied on Uber\u2019s allegedly false or misleading advertising. In dismissing this claim, the court explained that it was declining to join the minority of California federal courts that have permitted UCL claims to proceed where the plaintiff pled potential consumers\u2019 reliance rather than the plaintiff\u2019s own reliance.\n\nFinally, the court found that plaintiffs did not have a viable claim for restitution under California\u2019s UCL and FAL because that remedy is limited to \u201cmoney or property that defendants took directly from [a] plaintiff\u201d or \u201cin which [a plaintiff] has a vested interest,\u201d and the complaint failed to allege that plaintiffs had an ownership interest in Uber\u2019s profits that they sought to disgorge.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California taxicab companies sued Uber for falsely advertising safety of Uber rides and for disparaging safety of taxi rides", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/uber-ordered-to-buckle-litigation-taxicab-plaintiffs-ride-out-part-uber-s-motion-to-", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "type": "article", "description": "A group of California taxicab companies sued Uber in federal court in San Francisco for falsely advertising the safety of Uber rides and for disparaging the safety of taxi rides.
