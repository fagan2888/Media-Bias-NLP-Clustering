Dollar General paid a settlement of almost $19 million to 2,100 female employees for not paying them equal wages.\n\nDemocrats nationally and in races like Georgia\u2019s have pushed the idea that Republicans are not for equal pay and have spoken of the GOP waging a \u201cwar against women\u201d on reproductive and economic policy. It has proven an effective message with female voters. Democrats lost the women\u2019s vote in 2010, and with it control of the House and six Senate seats. Determined not to make the same mistake, they introduced a women\u2019s economic agenda, including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been voted down twice in the Senate by Republicans this year. Republicans argue the bill is a sop to trial lawyers and have introduced their own version, which incentivizes employers to provide equal pay, rather than punishing them on the regulatory side, as the Democrats favor.\n\nNunn is trailing Perdue slightly\u2014by 1.6 percentage points\u2014 in polls, according to an average of Georgia polls by Real Clear Politics. But she\u2019s beating him amongst women, 45% to 33% in a recent CBS/New York Times survey. In order to win, she\u2019ll need to maintain that edge and build on it. Thus the ads hitting Perdue as bad for women.\n\n\u201cWomen understand the negative impact of Obama\u2019s failed policies better than anyone, from losing their doctors due to Obamacare and feeling the effects of Obama\u2019s economy on their hard-earned paychecks,\u201d says Megan Whittemore, a spokeswoman for the Perdue campaign. \u201cDavid absolutely believes in equal pay for equal work. That is the law and he has always supported that. Unlike Michelle Nunn who will make it harder for women to succeed, David will be a strong voice for Georgia\u2019s women and families in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Meanwhile, Perdue has an ad out hitting her as too liberal for Georgia.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Michelle Nunn courts women in a close Senate race", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Michelle Nunn courts women in a close Senate race", "title": "Georgia Democrat Accuses Opponent of Pay Discrimination", "url": "http://time.com/3340709/georgia-senate-race-michelle-nunn-david-perdue/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png"}, "title": "Georgia Democrat Accuses Opponent of Pay Discrimination", "description": "Michelle Nunn courts women in a close Senate race", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "michelle nunn, david perdue, georgia senate race, 2014 midterm elections, war on women", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "michelle nunn, david perdue, georgia senate race, 2014 midterm elections, war on women"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd262a\"", "article_summary": "From the ad\u2019s script:If David Perdue didn\u2019t do right by women at his company, why would he do right for Georgia?\nGeorgia Democrat Michelle Nunn\u2019s Senate campaign is out with a new ad Friday, obtained first by TIME, hitting her GOP opponent David Perdue for pay discrimination when he was CEO of Dollar General.\n\u201cDavid absolutely believes in equal pay for equal work.\nNunn is trailing Perdue slightly\u2014by 1.6 percentage points\u2014 in polls, according to an average of Georgia polls by Real Clear Politics.\nThus the ads hitting Perdue as bad for women."}
