And here\u2019s the basic challenge that will create for Republicans: How can they keep Trump from veering wildly from the straight and narrow path of conservatism?\n\nIt\u2019s going to require constant work. For Republicans, the next six months will be a struggle to constrain Trump\u2019s erratic impulses, and even if they\u2019re mostly successful, it still might not diminish the damage Trump could to do the conservative project.\n\nSome Republicans are already trying to downplay this challenge. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who is currently engaged in an effort to shape his party\u2019s policy agenda for the next decade or two, said this morning that he and other Republicans who care about conservative ideology have nothing to worry about:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed any conflict between his detailed policy proposals and those pushed by Donald Trump on Wednesday, hours after the front-runner sewed up five more states and marched ever closer to locking up his party\u2019s nomination. \u201cThe key for populism, Joe, as you well know because you practiced this, how do you take this populism and connect it to principle so that it\u2019s populism tethered to good principles which give us good solutions, not unprincipled populism and that to me is our value added to this equation,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said in a segment on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Wednesday, referring to co-host Joe Scarborough\u2019s time as a lawmaker representing Florida. Though he did not mention Trump by name and has been magnanimous even in his policy criticisms of Trump in the past, Ryan signaled that no matter Republicans\u2019 standard bearer in November, the party will be \u201ccomfortable\u201d and unify around the platform that he is advocating in Congress. He also described any differences with Trump and other candidates over Obamacare and tax reform as small obstacles, remarking that they share broader agreement on the issues.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Ryan could prove right about this. But the amount of vigilance that will be required from Republicans could itself prove a strain.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing to understand about Trump\u2019s relationship to the conservative policy agenda, and to any agenda at all, is that he just doesn\u2019t care about policy in the least. He has some sincere opinions on some issues, but for the most part, not only has he never thought much about any policy issue one might present him with, there\u2019s almost nothing he thinks about an issue that isn\u2019t subject to revision.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen a particular pattern repeat itself so often. Trump will get asked a question about an issue he obviously hasn\u2019t considered before. He\u2019ll give an answer that doesn\u2019t line up with conservative orthodoxy, because he isn\u2019t aware of precisely what conservative orthodoxy is. Then Republicans will get enraged, the controversy will blow up, and a day or two later \u2014 after he\u2019s had a chance to learn what he\u2019s supposed to say \u2014 he\u2019ll come back and offer a revised version of his position.\n\nThis happened on abortion (where he said women should be punished for having abortions, then said they shouldn\u2019t), on transgender people being forced by the government to use the wrong bathrooms (where he said they should use whatever bathrooms they want, then said the issue should be decided at the state and local level), and on Israel and the Palestinians (where he first said he wanted to be a neutral arbiter, then went to AIPAC and said \u201cThere is no moral equivalency\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians).\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the positions on issues like abortion and guns that he changed before the race began. So if you\u2019re a Republican, that\u2019s about as much as you can hope for. He may not be with you already, but he\u2019s responsive to pressure. Once you tell him that he has strayed, he comes back to the fold.\n\nTo be sure, whenever Trump comes out with a formal policy proposal, it\u2019s right in line with conservative orthodoxy. So for instance, he has repeatedly said we should raise taxes on rich people, much to Republicans\u2019 horror, but when he actually released a tax plan, it featured, guess what, a huge tax cut for the wealthy. The same thing happened on health care: he said some things suggesting there were parts of the Affordable Care Act he liked, but when he released his plan, it could have been lifted from the boilerplate on the issue you\u2019ll find on any Republican candidate\u2019s web site.\n\nToday Trump is going to deliver an address on foreign policy, and while we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be in it, because this is a prepared speech \u2014 which means it was written for him by other people \u2014 I\u2019m almost sure that there will be little if anything in there that Republicans will object to. It\u2019ll talk about how Barack Obama is weak, our enemies don\u2019t fear us, we need to increase military spending, we should tear up the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 all things ordinary Republicans say all the time.\n\nThis is all possible because, to repeat, Trump just doesn\u2019t care about policy. That should make Republicans at least somewhat sanguine about what his presidency would be like. Paul Ryan can deliver him one bill after another written and passed by the GOP Congress, and Trump is likely to say, \u201cSure, whatever\u201d and sign them.\n\nAnd yet, there are some trouble spots for conservatives ahead, signaled by the areas where Trump has in fact gone against conservative orthodoxy. Trade is a big one \u2014 Trump seems to believe that if we increase tariffs on Chinese goods, then everyone in America will have a great job. There have been a few others, like his lack of enthusiasm for cutting Social Security. Then there\u2019s his ban on Muslims entering the U.S., which (while Republican voters support it) GOP elites find vulgar and damaging to the party.\n\nAnd so, in the general election, we may see examples of Republicans like Ryan struggling to pull Trump back into line: when his impulse takes him to a place that\u2019s popular with the electorate, but it\u2019s a place other Republicans don\u2019t want to go. Then they\u2019ll have a much harder time making the case to him that he needs to get back with the conservative program.\n\nOn the other hand, if Trump remains as dreadfully unpopular with the general electorate as he is now, and he goes down to a sweeping defeat, maybe Republicans would be better off if he proves to be an imperfect representative of GOP ideology.
