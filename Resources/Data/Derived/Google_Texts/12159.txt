Sunday morning talking heads

A study in contrasts with polls set to open in 48 hours in Ohio and Florida: John Kasich will hit all five Sunday shows today while Marco Rubio will hit … none, at least according to the schedule as of Saturday morning. I assume that’ll change and he’ll get some face time this a.m. too, if only to keep pace with everyone else. On top of Kasich’s full-court press, Trump is slated for “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation,” “State of the Union,” and “Fox News Sunday” while Ted Cruz is booked for “This Week” and MTP as well. (Carly Fiorina, already one of Cruz’s most prominent surrogates, will pinch hit for him on SOTU.) Maybe Rubio’s better off skipping, though. His hosts would only want to talk about Trump and Chicago, Trump and Florida, Trump and a brokered convention, etc etc, anyway. What’s left to say?

Bernie Sanders will be on various shows this morning, probably also to denounce Trump, but who cares? His odds at the nomination in his own party are probably no better than, say, Cruz’s are in the GOP’s. The full line-up is at the AP.
