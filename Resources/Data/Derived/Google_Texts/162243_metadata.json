Hayworth, he\u2019s facing the prospect of the end of his career once again. This time, it\u2019s against a state senator who\u2019s perfectly content with grifting votes at a Donald Trump rally. McCain\u2019s seat has been targeted by conservative groups for years now to no avail, but this time, it\u2019s a fair question to ask if McCain\u2019s heart is in it anymore. And even if it is: Does anyone even care?\n\nMcCain went from being the leader of the party in 2008 to the poster boy for RINOism almost immediately after, and the right wing was emboldened by his loss to blame his \u2014 and later, Mitt Romney\u2019s \u2014 perceived lack of conservatism for the party\u2019s failure to keep Barack Obama out of the White House. Over the past couple of years he\u2019s been at the forefront of a very public argument with ultraconservatives like Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul for control of the party, and McCain\u2019s tendency to work with Democrats on a few different issues have made him the right wing\u2019s biggest internal enemy.\n\nEven McCain\u2019s military career has, however cynically, come into question of late. Back in July, Donald Trump insulted John McCain by saying he \u201cliked people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d a reference to McCain being a prisoner of war for five-and-a-half years in Vietnam. Bill Kristol swore that this would eventually kill Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign, and the political press questioned whether or not Trump had finally gone too far. Five months later, he\u2019s still here, and still dominating in the polls.\n\nNot leading the polling for president, coincidentally, is Senator Lindsey Graham, whom McCain endorsed to run essentially the same campaign he did in 2008. Graham, a foreign policy hawk who has shown a willingness to compromise with Democrats on issues such as climate change and immigration, didn\u2019t participate in a single one of the main GOP debates, and polled with a quarter of the support that Mike Huckabee has before dropping out of the race in mid-December.\n\nGraham, who\u2019s been embraced as One of the Good Republicans in this primary despite his propensity to want perpetual war with multiple countries at a time, took a shot at a few of the frontrunners in the race in his farewell video, claiming his campaign made \u201cenormous progress\u201d in fighting the \u201cisolationist\u201d wing of his party. Given that Graham essentially ran a campaign that was the spiritual successor to McCain\u2019s two runs \u2014 he was the only Republican to slam Trump from the start \u2014 this is a round rebuke of that brand of conservatism.\n\nVox\u2019s Andrew Prokop argued that Graham\u2019s exit was a big opportunity for either Chris Christie or Marco Rubio to pick up an endorsement for McCain, but with the anti-establishment (and anti-McCain) Trump and Cruz occupying the top two spots in the polling, it\u2019s clear that having the 2008 nominee on your side is more of a liability than an asset at this point. Marco Rubio is the closest thing to a neoconservative with an inkling of a chance to win, but he has greatly downplayed the one time he tried to cooperate with Senators Graham, McCain, and Chuck Schumer on immigration, which has drawn the ire of McCain. (McCain, of course, has no room to talk about waffling on immigration in order to cater to ultraconservative primary voters.)\n\nObviously, this could change with one presidential election where someone from the anti-establishment wing gets roundly rebuked by the electorate, but the truth is that the current incarnation of the Republican Party simply doesn\u2019t have room for people like McCain and Graham anymore. Graham and McCain are not moderate politicians; to be sure, their love of war outpaces nearly anyone else in the Senate. They\u2019re seen, however, as remnants of the neocon years, a period that the Republican Party of today would like to pretend didn\u2019t exist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP nominee just 8 short years ago, John McCain is now fighting off yet another strong primary challenge", "title": "This is the end of John McCain: Why the Arizona senator could finally be facing retirement", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP nominee just 8 short years ago, John McCain is now fighting off yet another strong primary challenge", "title": "This is the end of John McCain: Why the Arizona senator could finally be facing retirement", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/this_is_the_end_of_john_mccain_why_the_arizona_senator_could_finally_be_facing_retirement/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/john_mccain3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP nominee just 8 short years ago, John McCain is now fighting off yet another strong primary challenge", "title": "This is the end of John McCain: Why the Arizona senator could finally be facing retirement", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/john_mccain3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Blest", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, GOP primary, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re seen, however, as remnants of the neocon years, a period that the Republican Party of today would like to pretend didn\u2019t exist.\nGraham and McCain are not moderate politicians; to be sure, their love of war outpaces nearly anyone else in the Senate.\nNot leading the polling for president, coincidentally, is Senator Lindsey Graham, whom McCain endorsed to run essentially the same campaign he did in 2008.\nThis time, it\u2019s against a state senator who\u2019s perfectly content with grifting votes at a Donald Trump rally.\n(McCain, of course, has no room to talk about waffling on immigration in order to cater to ultraconservative primary voters.)"}
