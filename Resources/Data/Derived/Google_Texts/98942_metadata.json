(Andrew D. Sullivan/For The Washington Post)\n\nAs a kid who grew up in violence-racked public housing here, Wanda Verret had no idea what to do when she got pregnant at age 14. She didn\u2019t go to the doctor until her sixth month of pregnancy, smoked cigarettes and dropped out of school. \u201cI was a baby having a baby,\u201d she said.\n\nNow 34, Verret is a little over four months pregnant with her fourth child. Living in a county with one of the nation\u2019s sharpest income divides, she faces all the pressures that so many in this poor city confront: losing a car, no job, a cramped apartment. But she receives plenty of advice on how to have a healthy baby. She\u2019s not smoking. And on a recent morning, she met with a nutritionist, picking up vouchers to buy fruit and vegetables, and went for a sonogram at a clinic. \u201cI definitely do things differently,\u201d she said.\n\nSomething extraordinary is happening to poor pregnant women such as Verret: They\u2019re giving birth to healthier babies. While other economic and health disparities have widened, giving way to huge national debates about inequality, pregnant women at the lowest rung of the nation\u2019s economic ladder are bucking that trend. They have narrowed the gap with wealthier women in the health of their babies.\n\nWhile experts agree that government policy has been critical to boosting the health of poor newborns, the improvements aren\u2019t because of a single policy or administration. Rather, they reflect improved access to care, as well as a complex array of other factors, some not easily within the government\u2019s grasp to change, from pollution to nutrition to violence at home.\n\n\u201cThe whole inequality story has an inevitable feel to it. People have this sort of pessimism about whether it\u2019s possible to do anything,\u201d said Janet Currie, a Princeton University economist who has led research in the field. \u201cI don\u2019t think government policy can take all the credit. But at the same time, there is evidence that our programs for pregnant women have a real impact on well-being.\u201d\n\nBirth certificates do not record information about a woman\u2019s income, so a wide range of researchers use demographic markers such as race, marital status and education as proxies.\n\nIn a recent study on birth weights, a leading indicator of infant health, Currie and a co-author compared black, unmarried, high school dropouts with white, married, college graduates \u2014 two groups statistically on opposite sides of the income scale.\n\nThey found a large disparity, but a shrinking one. The study found that in 1989, one in six babies born to the economically challenged group weighed less than the 51 / 2 pounds doctors consider healthy \u2014 compared with one in 32 babies born to the more advantaged group.\n\nOver the following 20 years, the study found improvements for the less advantaged group, with the odds of having an unhealthy baby falling close to 1 in 8. The rate was essentially unchanged for more advantaged women. Currie also found that even if race is taken out of the equation, birth weights follow the same pattern.\n\nDespite this improvement at birth, there remain big socioeconomic gaps throughout life, and those gaps are even widening at death. The poor suffer from a range of ailments \u2014 diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure \u2014 at much higher rates than the wealthy.\n\nMost strikingly, wealthier Americans don\u2019t just live longer than poor Americans, the gap is increasing. Twenty years ago, a female child who never finished high school was expected to live about two years fewer than a child who finished college. Today, the gap is more than six years, according to data provided by Jay Olshansky, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois in Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe can change things . . . through the resources that a child comes into the world with,\u201d said Anna Aizer, an economics professor at Brown University and Currie\u2019s co-author. \u201cAnd after that, we\u2019ve got 18 more years to make sure they don\u2019t slide back.\u201d\n\nViolence plays a role\n\nThe disparity in birth weights has far-reaching implications at a time when both sides of the political spectrum agree that every child deserves an equal chance at starting out in life, though they disagree on how to achieve that ideal.\n\nResearchers have found that the effects of an unhealthy birth weight often linger for a lifetime, raising the odds of illiteracy, minimizing high school graduation rates and reducing earnings. In this sense, poverty feeds poor health, which helps feed poverty.\n\nStudies exploring why poor women are having healthier babies do not tell a straightforward story, complicating hopes that by simply expanding health insurance it is possible to significantly improve the life chances of poor children.\n\nResearchers have found that Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor that was significantly expanded under the Affordable Care Act, leads women to visit doctors earlier in their pregnancies but has a surprisingly modest impact on babies\u2019 health.\n\nExperts say health interventions alone have had limited impact, in part because poor women face so many other pressures harmful to the health of a fetus, from pollution to stress to violence.\n\nWomen who make less than $25,000 a year, for instance, are\n\n2\u00bd times more likely to be victims of domestic violence, according to research. And being sent to the hospital as a result of domestic violence tends to cost a woman 5 ounces on her infant\u2019s birth weight.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re really interested in improving birth outcomes, we have to look at the situation under which disadvantaged women find themselves \u2014 and that means violence in communities, violence in relationships, and a whole host of other factors,\u201d said Lisa Dubay, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.\n\nResearch has found that the big changes in infant health have come from a mix of policy and social trends.\n\nPrograms such as food stamps and nutritional counseling have led to healthier outcomes. Declining rates in smoking, which is a factor in up to a fifth of unhealthy pregnancies, are thought to be a contributor.\n\nAs are environmental regulations that have limited pollution from power plants. One study found that the installation of EZ-Pass booths in New Jersey and Pennsylvania reduced auto emissions and improved birth weights among women living in the area surrounding the tolls. A study has also suggested that policies that gave authorities less discretion in deciding when to prosecute men accused of domestic violence have helped.\n\nEpicenter of inequality\n\nWanda Verret grew up in P.T. Barnum, a notoriously dangerous public housing complex in Bridgeport. She lived in the shadow of a coal-fired power plant that spewed harmful emissions \u2014 and at the epicenter of the nation\u2019s widening inequality.\n\nBridgeport, one of the biggest cities in Fairfield County, has a poverty rate of nearly 24 percent. Nearby Greenwich, the hedge-fund capital of the world, has a poverty rate of less than 4 percent. By some measures, Fairfield is the most unequal county in the nation.\n\nVerret\u2019s first baby, a boy, was born at under 6 pounds \u2014 she didn\u2019t remember the exact weight \u2014 though she said he was healthy. They were lucky. In the 1990s, the most disadvantaged women in Fairfield County had on average a 14 percent chance of having a low-birth-weight baby. By comparison, the most advantaged women had on average a 2 percent chance of having a low-birth-weight baby.\n\nOver time, a confluence of factors to help poor pregnant women in Bridgeport have healthier babies, from coordination between doctors and nutritionists, to home health visits, to programs in high schools aimed at educating pregnant teens about healthy practices. Under public pressure as the last coal-fired plant in Connecticut, the Bridgeport Harbor Station has even cut down dramatically on emissions.\n\nBy 2010, the rate of low-birth-weight babies born to disadvantaged women, which can be volatile from year to year, fell to 8 percent in Fairfield.\n\nA recent morning spent with Verret shows the level of care that poor pregnant women receive, as well as the continuing challenges they face.\n\nVerret lost her car when she couldn\u2019t afford to pay the municipal registration fee, so she commuted for one hour by bus to a Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program run by Southwest Community Health Center, a network of low-income health clinics in Bridgeport.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar we get we\u2019ve got to manage,\u201d she said. Leaving her three sons at home fills her with anxiety. \u201cThe age of the killing is getting younger.\u201d\n\nStill, Verret recognized that she had to stay focused to make sure she had another healthy baby. She had already forsworn smoking after a doctor recommended she go to a class for pregnant women, where they showed pictures of disfigured babies born to mothers who used tobacco.\n\nNow, on a warm Wednesday morning, she was sitting in the office of a nutrionist at the federally sponsored WIC office.\n\n\u201cDo you drink milk?\u201d asked Annie Ko, the nutritionist.\n\n\u201cOne cup a day,\u201d Verret said.\n\n\u201cYou want to drink three cups of a milk or having three servings of cheese,\u201d Ko told her.\n\n\u201cOkay, I will,\u201d Verret said.\n\n\u201cDo you drink any juice?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot, four cups.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou want to limit your juice, and your soda,\u201d Ko said. \u201cWhat about deli meats, do you eat any deli meat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should cook the deli meat,\u201d Ko said.\n\n\u201cLunch meat?\u201d Verret asked, confused.\n\n\u201cYeah, you should microwave it for 10 to 15 seconds because of the risk of listeria,\u201d Ko said.\n\n\u201cWow, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nAs they wrapped up the meeting, Ko gave Verret $12 worth of vouchers to use at the local farmers market before their next meeting in September. She also got vouchers to buy 22 ounces of milk, 2 pounds of beans or peanut butter, 36 ounces of breakfast cereal, a dozen eggs and other staples.\n\nAfterward, Verret walked across the street to Southwest\u2019s Fairfield Avenue office, a sleek facility that replaced the run-down office that she had been going to her whole life.\n\nIn an examination room, a nurse, entering data into a laptop, asked if she has been taking prenatal vitamins. She needed a refill. Verret was weighed, coming in heavy for her 5-foot-3 frame. But her blood pressure was fine.\n\nAfter more questions, the moment Verret had been waiting for all morning came. Her doctor, Claudia Ortiz, arrived and asked her to climb onto an examination table. Ortiz squeezed blue lubricant on her stomach and turned on the sonogram machine. She moved a wand across Verret\u2019s abdomen. A grainy image of a fetus appeared on the screen to her right.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your baby\u2019s heartbeat,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I have one picture?\u201d Verret said, wanting to hold on to the moment.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d As she printed the photo, Ortiz cleaned the lubricant off Verret\u2019s stomach. Then she showed her the picture. \u201cEverything looks good,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nVerret lingered, gazing at the photo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a worsening wealth gap, several factors have improved birth weights for low income mothers", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zgoldfarb", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Despite a worsening wealth gap, several factors have improved birth weights for low income mothers", "title": "The wealth gap is growing, but poor women see one improvement: Healthier newborns", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-wealth-gap-is-growing-but-poor-women-see-one-improvement-healthier-newborns/2014/07/20/cc672a88-0c4f-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/19/National-Economy/Images/BIRTHINEQUALITY-0061405795266.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Goldfarb"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-wealth-gap-is-growing-but-poor-women-see-one-improvement-healthier-newborns/2014/07/20/cc672a88-0c4f-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business, healthy babies, poor women healthy babies, wanda verret, birth weight", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zgoldfarb"}, "news_keywords": "business, healthy babies, poor women healthy babies, wanda verret, birth weight", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "cc672a88-0c4f-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd152b\"", "article_summary": "Something extraordinary is happening to poor pregnant women such as Verret: They\u2019re giving birth to healthier babies.\nA recent morning spent with Verret shows the level of care that poor pregnant women receive, as well as the continuing challenges they face.\nIn this sense, poverty feeds poor health, which helps feed poverty.\nThey have narrowed the gap with wealthier women in the health of their babies.\nWhile experts agree that government policy has been critical to boosting the health of poor newborns, the improvements aren\u2019t because of a single policy or administration."}
