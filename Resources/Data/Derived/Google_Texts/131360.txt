Marsh & McLennan Agency L.L.C. on Thursday said it has added new wellness promotion and engagement tools to its MarketLink Benefits Administration & Private Exchange.

This wellness platform brings together an online community of MarketLink users that are focused on being healthier, Marsh & McLennan Agency said in a statement. Launched in 2014 to help midsize employers address Affordable Care Act requirements and manage rising health care costs, MarketLink enables participants to design programs around their personal wellness goals, connect with support groups, find health partners, join challenges, and earn rewards, according to the statement.

“The rising cost of health care combined with stringent regulations under the Affordable Care Act is causing many employers to redefine their approach to health benefits,” Sally Prather, Marsh & McLennan Agency's New York-based national employee benefits business leader, said in the statement. “With the new enhanced MMA MarketLink, employers can engage employees for long term health management success without adding additional cost or burden to their human resource team and at the same time potentially reduce medical costs trends.”
