Martini was also taken to the hospital for treatment and was in satisfactory condition as well.\n\nDurkee said it was not known whether authorities were following up on a tip when officers located the mother and her baby.\n\n\"Tulalip [Reservation] is one of the addresses where [Martini] has been known to stay,\" he said. \"We consider her homeless.\"\n\nAn Amber Alert was issued this morning after Martini delivered her infant daughter at an apartment at 4:30 a.m. Friday and was suspected of taking off with the newborn, according to the Amber Alert.\n\nThe infant was suffering from \"life-threatening medical conditions and is in need of medical attention,\" police said.\n\nThe midwife who assisted at the home birth called 911 after the baby girl was having difficulty breathing and her skin turned a grayish color, ABC News' Seattle affiliate KOMO-TV reported. But Martini apparently canceled the request for paramedics and decided to take the baby to a local hospital herself, Mill Creek Police Officer Ian Durkee said.\n\n\"They never arrived at any local hospital, either in Snohomish County or in King County,\" Durkee told KOMO-TV.\n\nInvestigators are looking into criminal charges for the mother, but they first need to get a better understanding of what happened when Martini took off with the newborn, Durkee said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamie Martini, 20, of Mill Creek, Wash., delivered her infant daughter, Annabelle, at her apartment at 4:30 a.m. Friday and is suspected of taking off with the newborn, according to the Amber Alert.", "language": "english", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Amber-Alert-issued-in-Washington-for-day-old-baby-girl-229379041.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jamie+martini.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Jamie Martini, 20, of Mill Creek, Wash., delivered her infant daughter, Annabelle, at her apartment at 4:30 a.m. Friday and is suspected of taking off with the newborn, according to the Amber Alert.", "title": "UPDATE: Day-old Washington girl found safe with mother"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Jamie Martini, 20, of Mill Creek, Wash., delivered her infant daughter, Annabelle, at her apartment at 4:30 a.m. Friday and is suspected of taking off with the newborn, according to the Amber Alert.", "title": "UPDATE: Day-old Washington girl found safe with mother", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Amber-Alert-issued-in-Washington-for-day-old-baby-girl-229379041.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jamie+martini.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "UPDATE: Day-old Washington girl found safe with mother", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Dayold Washington girl found"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9509\"", "article_summary": "A day-old baby girl who police say was taken by her mother just moments after she was delivered was found safe today.\nDurkee said it was not known whether authorities were following up on a tip when officers located the mother and her baby.\nMartini was also taken to the hospital for treatment and was in satisfactory condition as well.\n\"They never arrived at any local hospital, either in Snohomish County or in King County,\" Durkee told KOMO-TV.\nThe infant was suffering from \"life-threatening medical conditions and is in need of medical attention,\" police said."}
