Now, 11 percent of adolescents have a depressive disorder by age 18 \u2014 and a new JAMA study suggests collaborative care is a better way to go about treating it.\n\nCollaborative care is a type of treatment that involves several health care providers engaging with their patients, their patient\u2019s families, caregivers, and otherwise community to provide quality care. In this study, this kind of intervention meant continually reaching out to depressed teens, sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, and the choice to take antidepressants or not while at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle. There were over a hundred teens, ages 13 to 17, at Group Health, in which a portion received collaborative care while others received their usual care involving depression screenings and access to mental health services. And the results showed that after one year, collaborative teens experienced more of a decrease in depressive symptoms.\n\n\"For adolescents, as for adults, depression can make it difficult to seek help and follow through,\" Dr. Laura P. Richardson, lead study author and an affiliate investigator at Group Health, said in a press release. \"That's why it's so important that the care manager reached out to the teens regularly to see whether they were improving \u2014 and met weekly with a mental health specialist supervisor to review how the patients were responding to care.\"\n\nNinety-seven percent of Americans all agree knowing this kind of information is key to making a good health decision, according to the Hospital Quality Outcomes 2014 survey from Healthgrades, a leading online resource for all things health care. Yet 58 percent settle for doctors and specialists that are either a) nearby or b) covered by their insurance.\n\nSure, it\u2019s perfectly understandable (if not necessary) to work within your means, but teens who don\u2019t receive the proper treatment \u2014 something that may not fit that particular criteria \u2014 are at a greater risk for suicide, substance abuse, early pregnancy, and dropping out of school. Healthgrades also found major depressive disorder and anxiety are among the disease with the highest morbidity, which means patients live years suffering from a particular disease.\n\nDoing your homework is what's going to help you make the right decision for your teen. Sometimes, it won't be convenient. But it will be worth it.\n\nIn addition to the comprehensive information available on Healthgrades, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Mental Health America, National Alliance on Mental Illness, and American Psychological Association's Health Center are all great resources for both teens and adults living with depression.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "teen, depression, sees, marked, improvement, collaborative, care, reducing, symptoms, within, 1", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Collaborative care may benefit teen depression more than traditional treatment.", "title": "This May Be The Best Way To Treat Teen Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-depression-sees-marked-improvement-collaborative-care-reducing-symptoms-within-1-year-299780", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/depressed-teenage-girl.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Collaborative care may benefit teen depression more than traditional treatment.", "title": "This May Be The Best Way To Treat Teen Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-depression-sees-marked-improvement-collaborative-care-reducing-symptoms-within-1-year-299780", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/depressed-teenage-girl.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/depressed-teenage-girl.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-26T16:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-26T16:00:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Collaborative care may benefit teen depression more than traditional treatment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2b5\"", "article_summary": "Collaborative care is a type of treatment that involves several health care providers engaging with their patients, their patient\u2019s families, caregivers, and otherwise community to provide quality care.\nThere were over a hundred teens, ages 13 to 17, at Group Health, in which a portion received collaborative care while others received their usual care involving depression screenings and access to mental health services.\nAnd the results showed that after one year, collaborative teens experienced more of a decrease in depressive symptoms.\nNow, 11 percent of adolescents have a depressive disorder by age 18 \u2014 and a new JAMA study suggests collaborative care is a better way to go about treating it.\nYet 58 percent settle for doctors and specialists that are either a) nearby or b) covered by their insurance."}
