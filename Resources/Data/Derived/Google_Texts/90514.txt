BANGKOK, June 19 (UPI) -- Health officials in Thailand have quarantined a man from Oman who was confirmed to have the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, as well as three family members who traveled with him that have not shown symptoms of the virus.

The 75-year-old man is the first confirmed case of MERS in Thailand.

"We advise the public not to panic because the patient and his family members were separated since the beginning," Public Health Minister Rajata Rajatanavin told reporters at a press conference. "Our system is ready and we are monitoring the cases closely."

The man was going to Thailand for treatment for a heart condition. After being admitted to a hospital there for the heart condition, he began to have fatigue and trouble breathing. He's being quarantined at the ministry of health's infectious diseases facility. Officials are identifying all those who came in contact with him.

Thailand is the 26th country where MERS has been reported.
