Welington Castillo, who led off the 10th with a double off Flande, scored the winning run. He had advanced to third on a single by Chris Owings.\n\nRockies manager Walt Weiss said he never intended to walk Pennington to get to another D-Backs hitter.\n\nIn a game full of twists, turns and missed opportunities, one thing stands out about the foundering Rockies: five Diamondbacks pitchers held them to a not-so-grand total of four hits \u2014 just two coming after the first inning. It was another anemic road effort from Colorado\u2019s offense, which has managed just 14 hits combined in the last three games.\n\nThe Rockies not only dropped their third straight game, but also fell to 2-6 on a road trip that could determine if they will become active sellers at the trade deadline at the end of July.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to go through it,\u201d said second baseman DJ LeMahieu, who is 2-for-25 on the current road trip. \u201cEvery team goes through it, but at a time like this, it is frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies took a nearly instant lead when Charlie Blackmon drilled Chase Anderson\u2019s 1-2 pitch over the right-field wall for a 1-0 lead. It was the third time this season Blackmon led off a game with a homer, and the ninth time in his career.\n\nWilin Rosario\u2019s two-run double to score LeMahieu and Troy Tulowitzki, both of whom walked, gave the Rockies a 3-0 lead after their first at-bat.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t last beyond the first inning. Arizona quickly cut the lead to 3-2 on back-to-back doubles off Kyle Kendrick by David Peralta and Paul Goldschmidt, followed by a Jake Lamb triple.\n\n\u201cI felt like we let Anderson settle in after a big first inning and didn\u2019t get much after that,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nThe Rockies were on the verge of taking control in the top of the 10th when Rosario led off with a walk and Nick Hundley put down a perfect bunt for a single. Then pinch-hitter Michael McKenry lined a hard shot off reliever Andrew Chafin \u2014 straight into the glove of Pennington at short, who threw to second to double-up Rosario.\n\n\u201cWe just have to think the tide is going to turn soon,\u201d McKenry said. \u201cWe had some opportunities tonight to score some runs, and we battled and our pitching staff kept us in the game. We just have to capitalize more often. Sometimes the ball bounces your way, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nColorado managed to escape disaster in the ninth. Reliever Scott Oberg issued a leadoff walk to pinch-hitter Nick Ahmed , and then A.J. Pollock laid down a perfect bunt between the mound and third baseman Nolan Arenado. Arenado fielded the ball cleanly, but hesitated throwing the ball to first because the Rockies were late covering the bag.\n\nA groundout to second by Peralta advanced Ahmed to third, and the Rockies intentionally walked the dangerous Goldschmidt to load the bases. But Oberg struck out Yasmany Tomas and induced Lamb to ground out to second, where LeMahieu made a beautiful sliding grab.\n\nFor just the fifth time in 17 starts, Colorado starter Kyle Kendrick did not give up a home run. Even though he squandered an early 3-0 lead, he at least kept the Rockies in the game. The right-hander departed with two outs in the sixth after the Diamondbacks tied the game, 3-3, on a bloop single to left by Lamb, and an RBI single by Pennington.\n\n\u201cObviously things are clicking for us right now, but I like our team,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cI think we have a good team, but we haven\u2019t put it all together. Hopefully we do that soon and make a run at something.\u201d\n\nBy drawing a first-inning walk, Tulowitzki reached base for the 31st consecutive game. His sixth-inning single extended his hitting streak to 16 games. Both streaks are career highs for Tulo, and are the longest active streaks in the majors.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 David Hale (2-3, 5.95 ERA) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Patrick Corbin (season debut), 8:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nThe Rockies acquired Hale in an offseason trade with Atlanta because they wanted a groundball pitcher who wasn\u2019t afraid to pitch to contact. Unfortunately, the right-hander has been unable to keep the ball down in the zone on a consistent basis. The result has been a bushel of home runs allowed, including three at Oakland in the Rockies\u2019 7-1 loss to the A\u2019s on Monday. Hale has allowed 11 homers in 42 innings, and his average of 2.34 homers per nine innings leads the majors among pitchers with at least 40 innings. Corbin, the D-backs\u2019 ace left-hander, will make his first big-league start since having Tommy John surgery March 25, 2014. His last start was Sept. 27, 2013, against the Nationals.\n\nSunday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (5-3, 4.59 ERA) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Rubby De La Rosa (6-3, 4.60), 2:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Angels\u2019 Andrew Heaney (1-0, 1.38) at Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (4-3, 3.67), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Angels\u2019 Matt Shoemaker (4-7, 4.91) at Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (3-3, 4.27), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies held to four hits by Diamondbacks in third straight loss", "title": "Rockies held to four hits by Diamondbacks in third straight loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/03/rockies-held-to-four-hits-by-diamondbacks-in-third-straight-loss/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T23:42:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T23:42:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Rockies 4-3 in 10 innings on a walkoff sacrifice fly to deep left field by Cliff Pennington off reliever Yohan Flande.\nArenado fielded the ball cleanly, but hesitated throwing the ball to first because the Rockies were late covering the bag.\nRockies manager Walt Weiss said he never intended to walk Pennington to get to another D-Backs hitter.\nThe result has been a bushel of home runs allowed, including three at Oakland in the Rockies\u2019 7-1 loss to the A\u2019s on Monday.\nIt was another anemic road effort from Colorado\u2019s offense, which has managed just 14 hits combined in the last three games."}
