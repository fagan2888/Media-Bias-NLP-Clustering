The British 17-year-old was a normal teenage girl until a couple years ago, when she began bleeding from her eyes, ears, tongue, nose, scalp, and even her fingernails.\n\n\u201cIt all started when I was getting headaches and coughing up blood in 2013,\u201d Harvey told Cosmopolitan UK. After rare occurrences of bloodiness for a couple years, in July 2015 she \u201cwent to sleep in the afternoon with a really bad migraine, and when I woke up I looked in the mirror and one side of my face was covered in blood.\u201d\n\nHarvey realized the blood was coming from her eye. And from then on, the seemingly one-off experience became anything but \u2014 it persisted every day for the next week. Then her ears began to bleed as well. Doctors don\u2019t seem to have a clue about what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cAll the doctors I have been to have never seen it before,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cI\u2019m clear of blood disorders, blood cancers, brain tumors, and AVMs [arteriovenous malformations]. My womb, uterus, ovaries, and chest scans were all clear too.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Marnie bleeds up to five times a day, and suffers from nausea and migraines. She called her condition very frustrating, saying that it keeps her from leaving the house.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go to college or get a job or anything, because I feel constantly weak and I can only walk so far without being sick,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just sick of it. I wish someone just knew what it was so I could get my life back to normal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marnie, rae, harvey, bleeds, eyes, ears, fingers, and, other, body, parts, 5, times, day, and, no", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "No one knows why this teen is always bleeding.", "title": "Teen Girl\u2019s Eyes, Ears, And Nose Bleed Nonstop, And No One Knows Why", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/excessive-bleeding-bloody-nose-medical-mystery-378783", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/03/22/marnie-rae.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No one knows why this teen is always bleeding.", "title": "Teen Girl\u2019s Eyes, Ears, And Nose Bleed Nonstop, And No One Knows Why", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/excessive-bleeding-bloody-nose-medical-mystery-378783", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/03/22/marnie-rae.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/22/marnie-rae.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2016-03-22T09:17:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T09:28:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "No one knows why this teen is always bleeding."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m clear of blood disorders, blood cancers, brain tumors, and AVMs [arteriovenous malformations].\n\u201cIt all started when I was getting headaches and coughing up blood in 2013,\u201d Harvey told Cosmopolitan UK.\nMy womb, uterus, ovaries, and chest scans were all clear too.\u201dCurrently, Marnie bleeds up to five times a day, and suffers from nausea and migraines.\nThe British 17-year-old was a normal teenage girl until a couple years ago, when she began bleeding from her eyes, ears, tongue, nose, scalp, and even her fingernails.\nAnd from then on, the seemingly one-off experience became anything but \u2014 it persisted every day for the next week."}
