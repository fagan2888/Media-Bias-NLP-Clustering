The U.S. Supreme Court will rule soon on a key part of the Affordable Care Act. It governs federal subsidies for insurance in states like North Carolina that did not set up their own exchange or marketplace. The result could be disastrous for many low-income Americans and for insurance markets in about three dozen states.\n\nA few years ago, Harlena Harris lost her health insurance after she stopped working to care for her husband, who was battling lung cancer.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even raise his hands or do anything for himself,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to feed him. I kept him clean. I did everything for him.\u201d\n\nAs he got better, her own health deteriorated. The 62-year-old has Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Without insurance, she couldn\u2019t afford her medications.\n\n\u201cWhen I did get to go to the doctor, I was very, very, very ill,\u201d she said. \u201cMy doctor told me that she didn\u2019t know how I was still standing.\u201d\n\nThat doctor\u2019s visit was the first thing Harris did after getting insurance on the Obamacare exchange in 2014. Since then, she\u2019s been doing much better with the help of doctor\u2019s visits and medication.\n\nShe can afford it because of a federal subsidy that leaves her paying about $20 a month for insurance. Across North Carolina, more than 90 percent of people insured through healthcare.gov receive a subsidy.\n\nBut the Supreme Court case King v. Burwell has put those subsidies in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cI think there is a reasonable argument that the statute is ambiguous,\u201d said Neil Siegel, who teaches constitutional law at Duke University in Durham, N.C.\n\nIn one section of the Affordable Care Act, it reads that subsides are available through \u201can exchange established by the state.\u201d But North Carolina and about three dozen other states decided not to establish an exchange. They use the federal healthcare.gov instead.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Public Radio Partnership,States,Syndicate,The Health Law,King v.
