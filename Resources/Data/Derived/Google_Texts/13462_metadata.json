After Marshall Plumlee dunked home Allen\u2019s missed layup with 2.8 seconds left to make it 74-72, Paige iced it with two more foul shots with 1.5 seconds.\n\nJustin Jackson added 13 points and Paige finished with 11 for the Tar Heels, who earned just their second victory at Cameron Indoor Stadium since the Tyler Hansborugh-Danny Green-led group went 4-for-4 here from 2006-09, and their first since 2012.\n\nDuke escaped the Smith Center last month with a 74-73 win after the Tar Heels \u2014 who never could put the Blue Devils away in that one, and paid dearly for it \u2014 had a shot blocked on the game\u2019s final possession to end it.\n\nFor a while, it looked like North Carolina would decide Round 2 much earlier, twice pushing its lead into double figures in the opening half while completely owning the paint \u2014 holding a plus-20 rebounding margin at halftime and outscoring Duke 26-8 in the paint.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No. 8 UNC claims ACC\u2019s top seed, beats No. 17 Duke 76-72", "author": "Joedy Mccreary", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "No. 8 UNC claims ACC\u2019s top seed, beats No. 17 Duke 76-72", "title": "No. 8 UNC claims ACC\u2019s top seed, beats No. 17 Duke 76-72", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/06/no_8_unc_claims_accs_top_seed_beats_no_17_duke_76_72/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/north-carolina-duke-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No. 8 UNC claims ACC\u2019s top seed, beats No. 17 Duke 76-72", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/north-carolina-duke-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "No. 8 UNC claims ACC\u2019s top seed, beats No. 17 Duke 76-72", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "No. 8 UNC claims ACC\u2019s top seed, beats No. 17 Duke 76-72", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "17 Duke 76-72 on Saturday night and lock up the top seed in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament.\nPaige hit two free throws with 8.8 seconds left.\nAfter Marshall Plumlee dunked home Allen\u2019s missed layup with 2.8 seconds left to make it 74-72, Paige iced it with two more foul shots with 1.5 seconds.\nNorth Carolina never trailed and rode its inside game, building a 64-29 rebounding advantage and outscoring Duke 42-20 in the paint.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsDURHAM, N.C.
