Support for equal marriage is at an all-time high, but the sea change in public opinion has done nothing to move the leadership of the Mormon Church on the issue.

Church leaders acknowledged as much this Saturday during the church’s semiannual General Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. Neil L. Andersen, an elder in the the second-highest governing body in the church, told audience members (and listeners streaming the broadcast throughout the country), “While many governments and well-meaning individuals have redefined marriage, the Lord has not.”

Andersen went on to warn of “whirlwinds” that would test many Mormons’ deeply conservative values.

But as Matt Pearce at the Los Angeles Times reports, the church is not immune to change. The church ended the practice of plural marriage in 1890 in order to become a state. It announced, in the late 1970s, that black men could become ordained priests. Both of these doctrines were previously defended as being rooted in “God’s law” — until they weren’t.
