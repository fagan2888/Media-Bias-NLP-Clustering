The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers tease that Aly\u2019s death will shake things up on many fronts this week, and there are some additional shockers on the way. What can viewers expect from the episodes airing during the week of July 27?\n\nShe Knows Soaps indicates that during Monday\u2019s episode, viewers will see Thorne try to wrap his head around Aly\u2019s death while Ivy and Steffy are weighed down by the way things played out on the dark road as Aly died.\n\nViewers have seen that Ivy thinks she knows what happened between Steffy and Aly as she has a video of that deadly moment. While Ivy doesn\u2019t have the full story, Steffy hasn\u2019t been entirely honest about Aly\u2019s final moments either. The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers via We Love Soaps detail that Ivy will see Liam and Steffy growing closer in the wake of this tragedy, and many suspect it will propel her to use the video to try to get Steffy out of the way.\n\nThomas Forrester pops back into town on Monday\u2019s episode. Bold and Beautiful spoilers tease that he will tell Caroline that he\u2019s planning to stick around for a while. His reappearance in town seems to shake up Ridge on both the work and personal fronts, but it seems that Caroline will try to make it clear to Thomas that she\u2019s sticking by Ridge.\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful spoilers reveal that Liam makes his decision between Ivy and Steffy during Tuesday\u2019s episode, and it seems that he\u2019ll likely be sticking with his decision to choose Steffy. Wyatt will be by Ivy\u2019s side as she sorts through her emotions, and the two become even closer as this all plays out.\n\nSteffy will continue to hide some of the details of what happened with Aly, even from Liam. Will Ivy or Wyatt reveal what they know about Aly\u2019s death? It sounds as if this will continue to play out throughout the rest of the summer as Aly\u2019s family vows to figure out what truly happened to her on that tragic night.\n\nAlso ahead this week, Deacon and Brooke will spend some time together, and naturally Quinn gets a bit frantic about this. This trio hasn\u2019t had all that much air time lately, but this tease makes fans wonder if there\u2019s about to be some fresh drama to embrace.\n\nWhen will the full truth about Aly\u2019s death come out? Will it impact any of the romances currently developing among the Forresters and Spencers? How will Thomas\u2019 return shake things up? Fans are anxious to see what comes next as the drama unfolds on The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\n[Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "What is slated to happen on 'The Bold and the Beautiful' in the episodes airing during the week of July 27?", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "What is slated to happen on \u2018The Bold and the Beautiful\u2019 in the episodes airing during the week of July 27?", "title": "\u2018The Bold And The Beautiful\u2019 Drama: Steffy And Ivy Struggle In Wake Of Aly\u2019s Death [Spoilers]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2286932/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-drama-steffy-and-ivy-struggle-in-wake-of-alys-death-spoilers/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jacqueline-MacInnis-Wood-of-The-Bold-and-the-Beautiful.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-27T12:47:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T13:30:49+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jacqueline-MacInnis-Wood-of-The-Bold-and-the-Beautiful.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-07-27T12:47:19+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "the bold and the beautiful,soap opera,tv,entertainment", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jacqueline-MacInnis-Wood-of-The-Bold-and-the-Beautiful.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "What is slated to happen on \u2018The Bold and the Beautiful\u2019 in the episodes airing during the week of July 27?"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6d0\"", "article_summary": "Will Ivy or Wyatt reveal what they know about Aly\u2019s death?\nThe Bold and the Beautiful spoilers tease that Aly\u2019s death will shake things up on many fronts this week, and there are some additional shockers on the way.\nWhen will the full truth about Aly\u2019s death come out?\nBold and Beautiful spoilers tease that he will tell Caroline that he\u2019s planning to stick around for a while.\nWhile Ivy doesn\u2019t have the full story, Steffy hasn\u2019t been entirely honest about Aly\u2019s final moments either."}
