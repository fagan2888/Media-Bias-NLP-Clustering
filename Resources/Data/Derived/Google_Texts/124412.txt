Costumed characters working in Times Square have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after a number of incidents led some to campaign for regulation of their work.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said people working in costumes should be licensed, wrote WSJ’s Mara Gay.

Mr. de Blasio said he was open to legislation being considered in the City Council that would require people dressed up as cartoon characters like Elmo and Spider-Man to display identification as they work in Times Square, hamming it up with the children of tourists before asking for tips, often aggressively. “I think this has gone too far,” Mr. de Blasio said at City Hall. “It needs to be regulated.” The mayor’s comments came after a man dressed as Spider-Man was arrested on charges of assaulting a police officer in an incident that was videotaped. Police have stepped up efforts to enforce quality-of-life laws in Times Square after complaints about the characters’ behavior.

The controversy has also caught the attention of the Times Square Alliance and corporations that own the characters, such as Viacom and Sesame Workshop.

On Wednesday, Reuters photographer Eduardo Munoz spent time with Jorge, an immigrant from Mexico who collects tips from tourists eager to take pictures with the beloved Sesame Street character, Elmo.

The characters tread a fuzzy ground, WSJ’s Andrew Grossman wrote in April last year. “It’s very challenging legally because dressing up in a costume and walking around Times Square is, we believe, a First Amendment-protected activity,” said then-Council Speaker Christine Quinn.
