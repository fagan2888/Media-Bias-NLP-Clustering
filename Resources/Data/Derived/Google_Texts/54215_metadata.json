On the contrary, he said, \u201cWhen a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader. Never. We will survive any hardship in the country \u2014 eat less food, use less electricity.\u201d\n\nThe promise was especially rich coming from Shuvalov who, it\u2019s frequently noted, is the highest-paid member of Putin\u2019s government. Along with his wife, Shuvalov has a personal fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars. They own multiple homes in Russia, as well as residences in London and Austria.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Slap at Putin Provokes Angry Response\n\nShuvalov\u2019s comments came in the context of a pessimistic assessment of the future of the Russian economy. He described the current downturn as worse than the financial crisis the country faced in 2008 and 2009.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nIf Shuvalov is correct\u2014that the Russian people will stand by their man regardless of the sacrifices they have to make\u2014additional sanctions may not be the wisest strategy to convince Putin to pull troops out of Ukraine and stop the aggressive land grab in the west.\n\nAlso on Friday, in an interview with CNBC, Herman Gref, the CEO of Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank, said that the country is likely facing a deluge of loan defaults in 2015, which could trigger a banking crisis. The combination of high inflation, high interest rates, and a ruble that has lost half its value in the past few months will leave many borrowers unable to service existing loans, in turn causing major balance sheet problems for banks.\n\nRussian regulators are already allowing banks to price their assets as though the ruble were worth what it was worth at the end of the third quarter of 2014 rather than at its currently debased value. Otherwise, an untold number of Russia banks would likely be flirting with insolvency.\n\nRelated: Putin Suffers a One-Two Punch on Sanctions and Bonds\n\nShuvalov\u2019s comment about Russians being willing to forego food in support of their president may be overblown, but Vladimir Putin\u2019s popularity among Russians remains high. He has cast the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula as a matter of national identity and Russian pride, so far with considerable success.\n\nHis comments come as fighting in the eastern part of Ukraine has escalated, as have charges that Russia is supplying troops and advanced weaponry to the rebels \u2013 a charge the Kremlin has strenuously denied. Russia originally denied having troops in Crimea, then admitted it once the takeover was complete.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The highest paid official in Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, who owns multiple homes in Russia and Europe, promised that ordinary Russians would \u201ceat less food, use less electricity\u201d in support of Putin.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Rich Pal Says Russians Will Starve for Vlad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/23/Putin-s-Rich-Pal-Says-Russians-Will-Starve-Vlad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01232015_Putin-Matryoshka.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/23/Putin-s-Rich-Pal-Says-Russians-Will-Starve-Vlad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01232015_Putin-Matryoshka.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The highest paid official in Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, who owns multiple homes in Russia and Europe, promised that ordinary Russians would \u201ceat less food, use less electricity\u201d in support of Putin.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc518\"", "article_summary": "Related: Putin Suffers a One-Two Punch on Sanctions and BondsShuvalov\u2019s comment about Russians being willing to forego food in support of their president may be overblown, but Vladimir Putin\u2019s popularity among Russians remains high.\nOn the contrary, he said, \u201cWhen a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader.\nWe will survive any hardship in the country \u2014 eat less food, use less electricity.\u201dThe promise was especially rich coming from Shuvalov who, it\u2019s frequently noted, is the highest-paid member of Putin\u2019s government.\nRussia originally denied having troops in Crimea, then admitted it once the takeover was complete.\nHe described the current downturn as worse than the financial crisis the country faced in 2008 and 2009."}
