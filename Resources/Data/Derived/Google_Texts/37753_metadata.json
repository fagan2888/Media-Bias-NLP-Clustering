Companies must now offer what is called \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d to female workers who pump breast milk while at work.\n\nAmong those praising the change was JoAnne Fischer, Executive Director of the Maternity Care Coalition:\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019ve had some of these rules in place, through the Affordable Care Act, and through the city ordinance, we hear from women every day that they\u2019re not able to breast feed in their workplace.\u201d\n\nFischer says now that it is the law, more education \u2014 of employers and employees \u2014 is needed:\n\n\u201cSo one of our first goals has to be to make sure that women know that they can do this. And they have to help employers (know). Because none of us wants to take our lunch in the bathroom. Neither do babies.\u201d\n\nOfficials \u2014 including the bill\u2019s sponsor, Councilman David Oh \u2014 acknowledge that these workplace protections are already afforded to women under federal law. But supporters say making them explicit in the city code boosts awareness and gives new mothers a venue through which to file a grievance.\n\nViolators would be subject to fines of $2,000 under the city\u2019s Fair Practices Ordinance.\n\nThe new bill defines \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 as unpaid break time, or permission to use existing paid break time or a mealtime, to pump milk.\n\nYou may also be interested in these stories:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mayor Nutter has signed a bill that requires all Philadelphia employers to give workers who are nursing mothers the space and time to pump milk while on the job.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/09/04/nutter-signs-bill-making-it-easier-for-moms-to-pump-breast-milk-at-work/", "image": {"width": 1039, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/nutter-breast-milk.jpg?w=1039", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/nutter-breast-milk.jpg?w=1039", "height": 779}, "type": "article", "description": "Mayor Nutter has signed a bill that requires all Philadelphia employers to give workers who are nursing mothers the space and time to pump milk while on the job.", "title": "Nutter Signs Bill Making It Easier For Moms To Pump Breast Milk At Work"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSphilly", "image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/nutter-breast-milk.jpg?w=1039", "description": "Mayor Nutter has signed a bill that requires all Philadelphia employers to give workers who are nursing mothers the space and time to pump milk while on the job.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nutter Signs Bill Making It Easier For Moms To Pump Breast Milk At Work"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "david oh, joanne fischer, kyw newsradio, kyw newsradio 1060, maternity care coalition, mayor michael nutter, mayor nutter, mike dunn, philadelphia aca information, affordable care act, heard on, local, news, philadelphia, watch + listen", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "david oh, joanne fischer, kyw newsradio, kyw newsradio 1060, maternity care coalition, mayor michael nutter, mayor nutter, mike dunn, philadelphia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac58\"", "article_summary": "Companies must now offer what is called \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d to female workers who pump breast milk while at work.\n\u201cIt is now the law of Philadelphia,\u201d says Mayor Nutter \u2014 who put pen to paper and signed a major change to the city\u2019s Fair Practices law.\nBy Mike DunnPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2013 Mayor Nutter has signed a bill that requires all Philadelphia employers to give workers who are nursing mothers the space and time to pump milk while on the job.\nThe new bill defines \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 as unpaid break time, or permission to use existing paid break time or a mealtime, to pump milk.\nNeither do babies.\u201dOfficials \u2014 including the bill\u2019s sponsor, Councilman David Oh \u2014 acknowledge that these workplace protections are already afforded to women under federal law."}
