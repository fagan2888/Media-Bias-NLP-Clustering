In addition, non-melanoma skin lesions in particular were more likely to be accompanied with itching and pain. \u201cThe study highlights the importance of a simple bedside evaluation for the presence and intensity of pain or itch as an easily implementable tool for clinicians in evaluating suspicious skin lesions,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nSkin cancers like melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma often start out as strange-looking skin lesions. If they\u2019re itchy or painful, it can help patients and doctors better evaluate whether they\u2019re at risk for skin cancer. \u201cPatients sometimes have multiple lesions that are suspicious looking, and those that are itchy or painful should raise high concerns for non-melanoma skin cancers,\u201d Dr. Yosipovitch, Director of the Temple Itch Center, said in a press release.\n\nThe researchers also found that itching was most prevalent in squamous cell carcinoma, followed by basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Pain was also most prevalent in squamous cell carcinoma; in addition, pain and itch often occurred together. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the U.S., and it\u2019s treatable and curable if found early.\n\nAs a result of his research, Yosipovitch hopes that dermatologists will start using a ranking scale for pain and itching when evaluating their patients who have suspicious-looking skin lesions. Being aware of suspicious skin lesions can help you protect yourself from skin cancer and catch any potential signs early enough for them to be treated and cured.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "skin cancer, melanoma, itchy skin", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers have found that skin lesions that are both itchy and painful are more likely to be a sign of skin cancer.", "title": "Itchy, Painful Skin Lesions May Be A Sign Of Skin Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-you-should-be-aware-itchy-painful-skin-lesions-they-might-be-sign-skin-cancer-294650", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/itchy-skin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers have found that skin lesions that are both itchy and painful are more likely to be a sign of skin cancer.", "title": "Itchy, Painful Skin Lesions May Be A Sign Of Skin Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-you-should-be-aware-itchy-painful-skin-lesions-they-might-be-sign-skin-cancer-294650", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/itchy-skin.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/itchy-skin.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-23T18:28:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T15:38:52-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers have found that skin lesions that are both itchy and painful are more likely to be a sign of skin cancer."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda367\"", "article_summary": "Skin cancers like melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma often start out as strange-looking skin lesions.\nBeing aware of suspicious skin lesions can help you protect yourself from skin cancer and catch any potential signs early enough for them to be treated and cured.\nIf they\u2019re itchy or painful, it can help patients and doctors better evaluate whether they\u2019re at risk for skin cancer.\nAccording to the research, about 36.9 percent of skin cancer lesions are linked to itching, and 28.2 percent involve pain.\nThe researchers also found that itching was most prevalent in squamous cell carcinoma, followed by basal cell carcinoma and melanoma."}
