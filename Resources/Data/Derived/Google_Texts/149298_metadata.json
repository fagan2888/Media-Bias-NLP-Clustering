The implication was that the State Dept. was attempting to muzzle a watchdog that has been extremely critical of U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, frequently releasing reports flagging wasteful spending, ineffective programs, fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars. Several times, Sopko has warned that the entire reconstruction effort is failing.\n\nSince then, Sopko has spent the past week raging against the cuts--arguing that the State Department, one of the federal entities his team investigates, has no authority to make staffing decisions for SIGAR.\n\n\"SIGAR is an independent Inspector General and this is an issue of independence,\u201d Sopko said in an email to The Fiscal Times. \u201cJust like we don't let the banks decide the number of banking regulators, the State Department, who we investigate, shouldn't determine our staffing at the Embassy.\u201d\n\nHis argument gained some traction with members of the House Oversight Committee. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) even suggested offering an amendment to maintain the current oversight by SIGAR.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Refuses to Verify $300 Million a Year in Afghanistan\n\nNow, one week later, the State Department is denying that embassy officials ever made such a demand.\n\n\u201cAny assertion that the Embassy Kabul unilaterally ordered SIGAR to make staffing cuts in 2016 is false,\u201d a spokesperson for the State Department said. The official implied that the staffing discussion with SIGAR was \u201cthe beginning of a dialogue on what functions and positions must be kept\u201d as the U.S. winds its role down in Afghanistan.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the conflict, said because SIGAR investigators and auditors live at the Embassy and are protected by the embassy\u2019s security, embassy officials believe they can decide how many people can be there.\n\nMeanwhile, SIGAR maintains that because it is an independent inspector general, its staffing decisions should be made independently, not by an agency it is tasked with investigating.\n\nRelated: 7 Threats to U.S. Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cThe independence of Inspectors General staffing has long been respected by all U.S federal agencies since 1978,\u201d Sopko said. \u201cSIGAR has a staffing plan in place, which is based on the amount of work that needs to get done and not an arbitrary number meted out by the State Department.\"\n\nUnder the discussed 40 percent reduction, Sopko\u2019s staff in Kabul would be scaled back from 42 people to 25 by this time next year. That\u2019s a particularly small crew to oversee dozens of programs costing tens billions of dollars a year.\n\n\u201cWhen we did our audits, we talked to our military, and they basically told us they don't have the bodies to do adequate oversight\u2026. That's why we're doubly concerned\u201d about the potential cuts, Sopko said.\n\nDuring an interview on CSPAN, the IG raised his concerns about State\u2019s assertion that it should be involved in SIGAR staffing decisions.\n\nRelated: Veterans Affairs Makes the Government\u2019s \u2018High Risk\u2019 List\n\n\u201cNow, I have a problem with that. For the State Department, who we investigate, to tell me how many people I need to have in Afghanistan is in direct contradiction of my independence,\u201d Sopko said. \u201cThis is absurd.\u201d\n\nSIGAR was created by Congress in 2008 as an entity independent of any government agency. Unlike most other inspectors general assigned to investigate a specific department, SIGAR is charged with examining all programs relating to Afghanistan reconstruction\u2014be it a Pentagon program or a project funded by USAID or State.\n\nSIGAR\u2019s budget is determined by Congress and its staffing levels are decided by Sopko.\n\nThe U.S. is planning to pump tens of billions of new dollars into Afghanistan reconstruction in the coming year, and SIGAR would be responsible for tracking how the funds disbursed. For at least the next few years,\n\nWashington is expected to spend about $6 billion a year on Afghanistan reconstruction.\n\nWith that much money still flowing into the country, Sopko\u2019s team argues that a staff reduction could be seriously detrimental to the U.S.\u2019s entire rebuilding efforts.\n\nRelated: The U.S. Could Be Paying $2.3 Billion a Year for Afghan Ghost Soldiers\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. reconstruction effort may have declined compared to its high point, Afghanistan is still the largest single recipient of U.S. foreign assistance and is projected to remain the largest single recipient for years to come. In other words, while the troops may be coming home, the checks are still going over there,\u201d Sopko told lawmakers last week.\n\nStill, Sopko said if there isn\u2019t enough work for his staff, he would make cuts. But he made clear that staff reductions should not be the State Department\u2019s decision.\n\nThe confrontation comes just months after President Obama decided to delay the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan for another year. It also is not the first time the watchdog has butted heads with the agencies it oversees.\n\nWhile the administration hasn\u2019t disputed all of SIGAR findings, it occasionally argues that the auditors aren\u2019t accurately portraying their programs.\n\nOfficials from State and USAID told The New York Times last year that responding to SIGAR\u2019s reports takes up too much of their time, slows down their work and ultimately undermines their efforts since the reports yield negative media attention about government waste.\n\nLate last year, the Pentagon and SIGAR clashed over whether information used in an audit on the Afghan National Police Force should be classified. The Pentagon ultimately gave into pressure and unclassified the information so the IG could make it public\u2014but not without a fight.\n\nThe latest scuffle has further inflamed relations between the auditor and the agencies.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A battle for independence seems to be breaking out between the State Department and th", "title": "Is State Dept.
