Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nElectronic cigarette smokers have been enjoying a wide variety of flavors such as Thin Mint, Tootsie Roll, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and gummy bear without the Food and Drug Administration's regulation. The electronic cigarette, also known as an e-cig, was introduced by a Chinese pharmacist to the American market in 2007 and has since caused controversy.\n\nThe unregulated battery-powered device delivers liquid nicotine deep into the users\u2019 lungs, producing the dangerous vapors with unknown health risks. The e-cig industry, which is composed of about 1,500 e-liquid makers in the U.S., reached nearly $2 billion in sales last year and will soon be faced with the inevitable FDA regulation.\n\n\"My favorite flavor is gummy bears because it tastes really good,\" Viviana Turincio, an 8th grade middle schooler from the San Francisco Bay Area, told NPR News.\n\nMiddle school-aged children and high school kids alike are increasingly becoming attracted to the child-like flavors of familiar candy and cookie names. According to the Stanford School of Medicine, e-liquids, which are what fuel e-cigs, are appealing to children and teenagers who are curious to experiment with tobacco products and are disarmed by the deceivingly \u201csafe nature\u201d of smokeless cigarettes. The sweet flavors help mask the bitterness of the tobacco, while the nicotine works to hook teens and create a new generation of addicts.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s not going to change unless companies come in and assert their intellectual property,\u201d said Linc Williams, board member of the American E-liquid Manufacturing Standards Association and an executive at NicVape Inc., which produces liquid nicotine.\n\nGirl Scouts of the USA, General Mills Inc., and Tootsie Roll Industries Inc., are among the many companies that have already sent cease-and-desist letters to liquid nicotine manufacturers that demand them to stop labeling their products with their brand names, or else they\u2019ll take further legal action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the age-old problem with an emerging market,\u201d Williams added. \u201cAs companies go through their maturity process of going from being a wild entrepreneur to starting to establish real corporate ethics and product stewardship, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to continue to see.\u201d\n\nThe companies fear that the brand names they\u2019ve worked hard to establish in people\u2019s minds are going to be tainted with the association of an addictive and harmful substance such as nicotine. Some have even gone as far as to try and stop them from using names that simply attract children, like gummi bears, which aren\u2019t a brand of their own but are a flavor concept many companies use regularly to market for children.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re family oriented. A lot of kids eat our products, we have many adults also, but our big concern is we have to protect the trademark,\u201d said Ellen Gordon, president and chief operating officer of Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. \u201cWhen you have well-known trademarks, one of your responsibilities is to protect [them] because it\u2019s been such a big investment over the years.\u201d\n\nE-cigs are even easier for kids to buy than the traditional cigarette because there\u2019s no federal age restriction put into place. When states like California, try to prohibit sales to minors, they simply purchase from independent sellers on sites like eBay. The vaporized flavor copycats of our childhood favorite Girl Scout cookies, and their favorite Tootsie Rolls, disperse throughout restaurants, malls, and even some classroom when gone unnoticed, which makes them hard to track and even harder to stop.\n\n\u201cUsing the Thin Mint name \u2014 which is synonymous with Girl Scouts and everything we do to enrich the lives of girls \u2014 to market e-cigarettes to youth is deceitful and shameless,\u201d Girl Scouts spokeswoman Kelly Parisi said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "e, cigarettes, anger, candy, and, cookie, makers, infringing, flavor, names", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Candy and cookie companies are threatening electronic cigarette manufacturers to stop using their names to attract children, something they fear may tarnish their brands.", "title": "E-Cigs Are Fighting An Uphill Battle To Use Brand Name Flavors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarettes-anger-candy-and-cookie-makers-infringing-flavor-names-284720", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/electronic-cigarette-companies-threatened-stop-using-candy-and-cookie-names.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Candy and cookie companies are threatening electronic cigarette manufacturers to stop using their names to attract children, something they fear may tarnish their brands.", "title": "E-Cigs Are Fighting An Uphill Battle To Use Brand Name Flavors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarettes-anger-candy-and-cookie-makers-infringing-flavor-names-284720", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/electronic-cigarette-companies-threatened-stop-using-candy-and-cookie-names.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/electronic-cigarette-companies-threatened-stop-using-candy-and-cookie-names.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-05-27T12:55:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T12:55:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Candy and cookie companies are threatening electronic cigarette manufacturers to stop using their names to attract children, something they fear may tarnish their brands."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6ca\"", "article_summary": "Girl Scout Cookies and others are going after e-cig manufacturers to make them stop using their brand names.\nMiddle school-aged children and high school kids alike are increasingly becoming attracted to the child-like flavors of familiar candy and cookie names.\nThe unregulated battery-powered device delivers liquid nicotine deep into the users\u2019 lungs, producing the dangerous vapors with unknown health risks.\nThe electronic cigarette, also known as an e-cig, was introduced by a Chinese pharmacist to the American market in 2007 and has since caused controversy.\nWhen states like California, try to prohibit sales to minors, they simply purchase from independent sellers on sites like eBay."}
