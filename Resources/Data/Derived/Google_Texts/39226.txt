JaRay's parents still don't have all the answers about their daughter's killing, and now they are wondering what's next.

The State Medical Examiner's Office confirmed the worst fear for the family of JaRay Wilson on Tuesday afternoon.

Her parents had been holding on to a bit of hope that the remains found north of the Weatherford airport might not be their daughter's. But that hope was taken away with a positive identification.

"Today is pretty hard, pretty hard to swallow all that," said Rodney Wilson, JaRay's father.

The Wilsons spent the last 14 months working non-stop to find their daughter. Three weeks ago there was a crack in the case when Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics agents found those remains.

"It made me sick to my stomach to think that somebody could be so cruel, not just by doing this but by lying for 14 months," said JaRay's mother, Jara. "What kept us going was knowing that we had to find her and she was still out there somewhere. Now, we don't know what we have to keep going."

The Wilsons still do not have all the answers about their daughter's killing.

Tucker McGee of Weatherford was charged with First Degree Murder in December after an informant came forward and told authorities that he saw McGee shoot JaRay Wilson and bury her body.

Rodney and Jara Wilson have never given up on finding JaRay. They put up thousands of missing persons posters and spreading the word of their daughter's disappearance, making JaRay a household name in Oklahoma. Now those efforts are changing.

"We spent 14 months trying to find her, we'll spend just that much or more trying to put these people away," said Rodney Wilson.

The Wilsons also expressed thanks to all of the supporters they have met during their search efforts, from close friends to total strangers.
