He will replace Rita Scardaci, who retired this month after 10 years as the Sonoma County\u2019s health services director.\n\nThe Department of Health Services, with an annual budget of $247 million and 700 employees, has a broad range of responsibilities, including management of many state and federal programs in the county.\n\nIt also serves as the health provision and policy division for the Board of Supervisors, which has long sought to make Sonoma among the healthiest counties in the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about Sonoma County\u2019s bold vision of becoming the healthiest county in California by 2020,\u201d Betz said. \u201cAnd because the (Board of Supervisors) and the community is so health-driven, we have a shot at being that exemplary.\u201d\n\nBetz has worked 12 years for Solano County, most recently serving as deputy director for Older and Disabled Adult Services.\n\nPreviously, he worked for Contra Costa County, in divisions overseeing family and community services and in the county administrator\u2019s office. He is a board-certified therapist and has practiced in Australia and Germany, in addition to the United States.\n\nBetz is taking over a department that has grown more than 3 percent over the past year and is expected to continue to take on major health care initiatives, including implementing a long-term plan to address the health and housing needs of the county\u2019s growing senior population, expanding mental health services and funding universal preschool countywide.\n\nBetz also is charged with ensuring President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, launched in January 2014, functions as it should locally. Those responsibilities include making sure patients covered under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 including private health care plans and Medi-Cal, California\u2019s low-income health care program \u2014 can access health care services.\n\nThe department has struggled over the past year with several issues, including clearing its Medi-Cal backlog, a primary care physician shortage and several abrupt leadership changes in Animal Services. Betz acknowledged the issues and characterized some as challenges counties across California are grappling with.\n\n\u201cMany of these problems are so big that they cannot be solved by one county alone,\u201d Betz said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working on a regional approach to the continuum of care, so everyone has a medical home and medical care available to them.\u201d\n\nHe is set to start work Oct. 6 and is under a three-year contract. His annual salary is $188,021.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Angela Hart at 526-8503 or angela.hart@pressdemocrat.com.
