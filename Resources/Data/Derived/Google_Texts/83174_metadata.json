He pointed to Clinton's blistering tirade against the ads in a November 1993 speech as the pivotal moment that accidentally elevated insurers' agenda. \"Every time we did a new ad ... we were on the evening news.\"\n\n\"It's one of those things that starts drip, drip, drip \u2014 and then it pours,\" Kahn said. \"It wasn't meant to necessarily have the effect it did.\"\n\nThe demise of their signature health initiative shadowed the Clintons for the rest of their time in the White House, and Hillary Clinton even boasts of the experience these days as one of her liberal bona fides, saying, \"I've got the scars to show for it.\" But much of her success in November may come down to how well she has learned the lessons from that defeat.\n\nKahn said the scenario the industry's campaign created \u2014 start a firestorm with some paid ads, then fuel it with a lot of free coverage \u2014 reminds him of the rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe $20 million ad campaign has become part of Washington lore for its devastating simplicity: A pair of middle-age actors sitting at a kitchen table, fretting about the horrors in store if the Clinton plan creates a government-driven system to control their health care. The middle-aged couple pored over calculators and piles of paper, fretting about the new bureaucratic restrictions, extra costs and lost choices, often finishing with the lament: \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a better way.\u201d\n\nAll the industry wanted, Kahn said, was a seat at the table, even before it began running the ads. But the White House was \"very negative,\" he said, especially Hillary Clinton and top health care adviser Ira Magaziner. In one meeting, Magaziner \"turned off his hearing aid,\" Kahn said.\n\n\"There were many middle grounds we could find, but they didn't look for them and we didn\u2019t stop\" running the ads, he said.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton\u2019s response, he said, further fanned the flames.\n\nThe campaign quickly became a burr in the side of the White House, fighting to save its beleaguered health plan. As anxiety mounted, a Democratic National Committee staffer threatened the actress who played Louise, telling her that if she didn't quit the ads, she'd never work in Hollywood again. And Hillary Clinton was \"getting angrier and angrier,\" Kahn says, culminating in a speech at a convention of pediatricians where she delivered a scathing, unscripted attack on the campaign and the industry that had funded it.\n\n\"They have the gall to run TV ads that there is a better way,\" Clinton said. \"The very industry that has brought us to the brink of bankruptcy because of the way they have financed health care.\"\n\nIt was arguably the most furious attack on a major industry ever made by a sitting first lady, David Broder and Haynes Johnson write in their book \"The System.\" And it drove a damaging narrative that the unelected spouse of the president was overly involved in public policy.\n\nWithin months, the White House health reform effort was on life support \u2014 and Bill and Hillary Clinton were reduced to performing a \"Harry and Louise\" parody skit (written by a \"Saturday Night Live\" writer) at the Gridiron dinner.\n\nThe insurers' attack ads have had an enduring legacy \u2014 they eventually helped shape Democrats' approach to crafting Obamacare and have continued to influence Clinton's health care policy as a candidate. Obama administration officials learned they needed buy-in from the industry to pass a big health reform package, which ultimately meant that Obamacare included compromises that disappointed liberals.\n\nBut in a pair of symbolic reversals, the \"Harry and Louise\" characters were resurrected in 2009 to sing the praises of the Affordable Care Act during its drafting \u2014 and Kahn, too, largely became an Obamacare supporter, though he doesn't hesitate to call out its flaws.\n\n\"I work for hospitals,\" Kahn said, explaining his conversion. \"The best situation for Americans \u2014and for those that hospitals serve \u2014 is for everyone to have [health] insurance.\"\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019s also not taking sides yet between Clinton and Trump.\n\nKahn did say that the government should build on the framework created by the Affordable Care Act, and if Clinton gets elected, that will be her framework too \u2014 while with Trump, we'll go a \"different direction.\" But if Trump wins, he thinks Republicans will maintain the House and the Senate. \"I can't envision him winning without them gaining control. They'll take significant action on health reform.\"\n\nClinton today repeatedly cites her 1990s battle with the insurance industry as proof of her experience fighting for liberal causes. She also uses it to cast Bernie Sanders' government-run, single-payer health care plan as a pure fantasy that powerful Washington lobbies would never allow.\n\nClinton, whose criticism of single-payer during the Democratic primary has stunned liberals who support the idea in principle, has instead advocated incremental reforms to make health insurance more affordable within the current system. Those ideas, which include capping out-of-pocket costs and forcing drug companies to negotiate prices, haven't won much support from the deep-pocketed insurance and pharmaceutical industries, either.\n\nClinton's most recent idea \u2014 resurrecting a \"public option\" and allowing younger Americans to buy into Medicare \u2014 has a wary critic: Kahn.\n\n\"That is a proposal that is misdirected and would be a big mistake,\" Kahn said.\n\nHe has not yet commissioned \"Harry and Louise\" to explain why to voters, though.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The godfather of a classic attack ad weighs in on health reform and the 2016 campaign.", "title": "'Harry and Louise' \u2014 and Hillary", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/harry-louise-and-hillary-clinton-223139", "image": "http://static.politico.com/df/bf/09e930394cb1acfbd3bdad4fded2/20120512-chip3-matthewsobocinski-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The godfather of a classic attack ad weighs in on health reform and the 2016 campaign.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Matt Sobocinski 'Harry and Louise' \u2014 and Hillary The godfather of a classic attack ad weighs in on health reform and the 2016 campaign.\nHillary Clinton.\nChip Kahn, the brains behind the \"Harry and Louise\" campaign, is pictured.\nBut the White House was \"very negative,\" he said, especially Hillary Clinton and top health care adviser Ira Magaziner.\nHe has not yet commissioned \"Harry and Louise\" to explain why to voters, though."}
