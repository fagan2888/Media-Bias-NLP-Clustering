Musician, Destroy Build Destroy Host, and Master Partyer Andrew W.K. is "not an expert on anything except having fun."

In the short monologue above, he explains three simple truths that partying has taught him about money. Here's one of them:

Some people have tried to make me feel guilty about spending money on things they call "frivolous," but the beauty of money is that it is up to you to decide how to spend it. That's the freedom. And there should never be any feelings of regret or sadness when you use your money for joyful experiences. If paying to go on a roller coaster makes me happy, then money really can buy happiness. When we have experiences of joy that last, we're not only investing in our own direct happiness, but the happiness of the world in general.
