Chamber celebrates

health plan anniversary

The Lubbock Chamber of Commerce and FirstCare officials celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the Chamber Employer Health Plan at the Business Expo on Thursday.

During the chamber’s 2006 trade show event, the health insurance plan for chamber members was unveiled.

The plan is designed as an affordable and discounted health plan for job creators to offer their employees, and is a community collaboration between the chamber, FirstCare Health Plans, Covenant Health and University Medical Center Health System.

“We’d like to thank FirstCare for their partnership as well as our members who have supported this plan with their enrollment throughout the past decade,” said Beth Bridges, Lubbock chamber chairwoman.

The Chamber Employer Health Plan had about 5,000 people enrolled in its first six months and 10,000 people enrolled a year later. In its first year, about 20 percent of new enrollees previously had no major medical health coverage.

Today, the plan operates on a private exchange and offers several options that are compliant with Obamacare requirements.
