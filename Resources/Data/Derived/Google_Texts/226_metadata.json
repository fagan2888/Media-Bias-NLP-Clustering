Responding to Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that tie patient satisfaction to reimbursement, hospitals are recruiting chief experience officers (CXOs) to take charge of a patient experience mission that prioritizes the expectations of patients and families. While more CXOs are joining the C-suite, the best person for the role and the potential financial impact are still unclear.\n\nEfforts to discharge happy patients aren\u2019t new, but ACA requirements have fast-tracked patient satisfaction to the top of hospital priority lists. According to the law, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must use Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data and other quality measures to calculate incentive-based payments for hospitals. Beginning in 2015, hospitals not meeting certain score criteria and other standards of care or complying with HCAHPS rules became subject to a Medicare reimbursement penalty of up to 1.5 percent.

We\u2019re doing more analysis of our data, but it seems clear that there\u2019s no turning back from the patient experience,\u201d Wolf says.The potential for improving HCAHPS scores isn\u2019t the only currency for measuring the value of naming a CXO or assigning oversight of patient experience to a hospital executive. Other measures are reflected in the HCAHPS questionnaire, which asks patients to rate communication with providers about medications, discharge instructions and other aspects of their care.\u201cThe No. 1 gap is the breakdown in communication,\u201d Duffy says. She adds that if there is a concerted effort to close that gap, patients may be more likely to adhere to prescribed treatments. In this way, championing the patient experience may impact reimbursement by reducing preventable readmissions.\u00a0\u201c[Satisfied] patients and family members \u2026 tend to look at the survey as a way of saying I can recommend this hospital. \u2026 . As recommendations go up, volumes go up and so do revenues,\u201d says Darlene Cox, MS, RN, Hackensack University Medical Center\u2019s administrator for service excellence.Adding a CXO to hospital administration doesn\u2019t have to be a burden because most facilities already have someone in charge of quality, satisfaction and safety, Duffy says, and the payoff can go beyond common metrics.\u201cThe CXO\u2019s job is not only to improve the patient and their family member experience, but also lead the strategy to create a culture that builds loyalty and engagement of the doctors, nurses and other front-line staff,\u201d she says.While the impact of this strategy on the bottom line may not yet be clear, Brian Carlson, MBA, director of patient access and experience at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says efforts are paying off. \u201cScores are consistently getting better, so that means patients are rating [facilities] higher, which means that we are protecting the reputation of our institutions.\u201d", "creator": "@TriMed_Media", "url": "http://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/practice-management/taking-aim-patient-satisfaction-experience-officers-join-c-suite", "image": {"src": "http://trimed-cms-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/articles/target.jpg"}, "title": "Taking Aim at Patient Satisfaction: Experience Officers Join the C-Suite", "site": "@healthimaging", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "Responding to Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that tie patient satisfaction to reimbursement, hospitals are recruiting chief experience officers (CXOs) to take charge of a patient experience mission that prioritizes the expectations of patients and families.\nWe\u2019re doing more analysis of our data, but it seems clear that there\u2019s no turning back from the patient experience,\u201d Wolf says.\nEfforts to discharge happy patients aren\u2019t new, but ACA requirements have fast-tracked patient satisfaction to the top of hospital priority lists.\nImpact & outcomes\u201cThe patient experience focus is still so new, so it\u2019s too early to tell what the financial impact is or the implications for outcomes.\n\u201cStrategies for improving the patient experience should be of an organization\u2019s own DNA,\u201d she explains."}
