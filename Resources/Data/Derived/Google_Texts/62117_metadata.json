Ham for Hanukah?\u201d Weingarten wrote in a Dec. 2 Facebook post.\n\nThe problem with the union honcho\u2019s Facebook post is that she fell for a ridiculous hoax.\n\nSnopes.com, the vital website specializing in urban legends and Internet rumors, flatly debunked the claim that Walmart is selling hams for Hanukkah \u2014 way back in 2009.\n\nA retailer did offer \u201cDelicious for Chanukah\u201d hams back in 2007. It wasn\u2019t Walmart, though. It was at Balducci\u2019s, a (now-closed) snooty market in New York City, quite close to where Weingarten grew up.\n\nIn addition to her penchant to fall for obvious hoaxes, Weingarten is also living in the technological dark ages. Her Facebook post notes that she used a \u201cBlackBerry Smartphones App\u201d to produce the embarrassing post.\n\nAlso, for the record, \u201cDelicious for Chanukah\u201d hams is controversial because Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday and Jewish people aren\u2019t permitted to eat pork under Jewish dietary laws.\n\nIn addition to libeling Walmart for selling Hanukkah ham, Weingarten has also spent time as the president of America\u2019s second-largest teachers union promoting Obamacare, gay marriage and abortion, observes EAGnews.org.\n\nAfter wasting millions of dollars on losing Democratic candidates in this month\u2019s midterm elections, Weingarten\u2019s union recently banned Coca-Cola and Coke products from its events and facilities because of conspiracy theory-esque claims involving murder, assassination attempts and eight-year-old children wielding machetes.

It is 641 percent higher than the $56,130 annual income of an average elementary school teacher.\n\nThis week the affluent, fancypants labor leader also lamented the plight of teachers who make, on average, about $300,000 less per year than she does in response to a report by the National Council on Teacher Quality.
