Can my insurer charge me a higher premium because I use electronic cigarettes?\n\nA. The rules aren\u2019t clear, but some insurers may try to do so.\n\nUnder the health law, insurers who sell plans on the individual market can take into account only four factors when determining someone\u2019s premium: age, geographic location, family size and tobacco use. People who use tobacco can be charged up to 50 percent more than non smokers.\n\nUnder the rules, use of any tobacco product four or more times a week on average in the past six months could subject someone to the tobacco surcharge.\n\nTen states either prohibit or restrict insurers from applying the tobacco surcharge in the individual market, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nSo are e-cigarettes tobacco products? The battery-powered devices simulate cigarette smoking, producing a smoke-like vapor that usually contains nicotine and flavoring agents.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently proposed regulating e-cigarettes, just as it does regular cigarettes and cigars.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is looking into the use of e-cigarettes and the tobacco surcharge, according to an agency official.\n\nIn a recent review of research on e-cigarettes, researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that, although the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown, they emit potentially harmful substances into the air and can be a source of indoor pollution.\n\nThe researchers also found that e-cigarettes actually reduce the likelihood that people will quit smoking, in contrast to advertising claims that firing up an e-cig will help people kick the habit.\n\nThe potential role of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool has insurance coverage implications too. The health law requires most health plans to cover FDA-approved smoking cessation products and counseling without any out-of-pocket cost to consumers. The federal government recently released guidance clarifying which services and products must be covered.\n\nSince e-cigarettes aren\u2019t FDA-approved for quitting smoking\u2013and in fact are considered by the agency to be tobacco products that warrant regulation like cigarettes\u2014they aren\u2019t covered as a free preventive benefit under the law.\n\nBut more specific guidance may be needed. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act does not specify e-cigarette use for purposes of cessation coverage or tobacco surcharge application,\u201d says Catherine McMahon, policy principal at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cThe lack of clarity may allow health plans to try to add the surcharge for e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nPlease send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column to questions@kaiserhealthnews.org.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
