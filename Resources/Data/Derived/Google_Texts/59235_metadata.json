A Facebook post about this created a lot of attention. The first post came out around 6 a.m. Saturday and the dog was not rescued until around noon on Sunday, meaning it was stuck down there for at least 30 hours.\n\nThe canal runs across Arkansas City and dumps water into the Walnut River. In places the canal is 12 feet deep; currently there is not much water in the canal, but in a few places the water is about four feet in depth.\n\n\"There was just no way to get down to him that was safe where we could get him out and ourselves out as well,\" said Devin Lapaille. She heard about the dog stuck in the canal through the Facebook post. Lapaille coaxed the dog with treats and slices of bologna but could never get him to come to her.\n\nThe dog is a male and appears to be a medium sized black Labrador Retriever. He was wearing a collar, but according to staff at the Cowley County Humane Society, the ID tags were missing.\n\nLapaille said she was frustrated with how long it took to get the dog out of the canal, but was thankful he did finally get out.\n\nThis dog has also raised the question of why the canal is not better fenced off or covered. \"I don't know why they don't put grates over that,\" said Deborah Kimmell, \"something needs to happen because that is a very dangerous situation.\" Kimmell was one of many people trying to get the dog out.\n\nBoth Kimmell and Lapaille recanted stories of people falling in the canal and now would like the city to look into isolating the canal so no people or animals can get into it.\n\nThe dog was taken to the Cowley County Humane Society after he was caught. He was covered in water and had a definite smell, but appeared to be happy in a kennel and out of the canal.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A dog stuck in a canal was freed by police officers and firemen after running loose inside the Arkansas City waterway for over 30 hours.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "A dog stuck in a canal was freed by police officers and firemen after running loose inside the Arkansas City waterway for over 30 hours.", "title": "Dog rescued from Ark City canal after 30 hours", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Dog-rescued-from-canal-after-30-hours-277382651.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/480/027/4800279F478E4209808B44ED5A959900", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DFA/C4B/DFAC4B01DFDE43B5950D28C46321E35B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A dog stuck in a canal was freed by police officers and firemen after running loose inside the Arkansas City waterway for over 30 hours.", "title": "Dog rescued from Ark City canal after 30 hours", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Dog-rescued-from-canal-after-30-hours-277382651.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Thumbnail+Dog+At+Pound+Closeup.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Dog rescued from Ark City canal after 30 hours", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Dog rescued from Ark City"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc4f\"", "article_summary": "She heard about the dog stuck in the canal through the Facebook post.\nA dog in Arkansas City had quite a bit of the community worried as it ran loose inside an open drainage system.\nThe dog somehow managed to get down a canal, but could never find his way out.\nThe first post came out around 6 a.m. Saturday and the dog was not rescued until around noon on Sunday, meaning it was stuck down there for at least 30 hours.\nThe canal runs across Arkansas City and dumps water into the Walnut River."}
