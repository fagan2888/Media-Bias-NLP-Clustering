For example, we heard that the jobless claims for June were lower than they\u2019ve been in 40 years. Take it from someone who remembers 1975 \u2014 it was a long time ago. The job market is finally looking up. And we also found out that Medicare is on stronger footing than anyone could have imagined just a few years ago. Kevin Drum at Mother Jones wrote it up:\n\nTen years ago, Medicare was a runaway freight train. Spending was projected to increase indefinitely, rising to 13 percent of GDP by 2080. This year, spending is projected to slow down around 2040, and reaches only 6 percent of GDP by 2090. Six percent! That\u2019s half what we thought a mere decade ago. If that isn\u2019t spectacular, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nDrum points out that this is largely being driven by the fact that medical costs overall have slowed dramatically. This is due to a number of factors, but one of the most significant has to be the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cuts to provider payments, which you will certainly recall had the Republicans whirling like tops with claims that President Obama was planning to turn the elderly into Soylent Green \u2014 or submit them to ghoulish \u201cdeath panels\u201d at the very least. It was one of the primary motivating factors that drove the white elderly Republican base to invade town hall meetings by the hundreds and storm the voting booths in November of 2010 to decimate the Democratic congressional majority.\n\nAds like these ran all over the nation:\n\nRepublicans have run similar ads in every election since. Indeed, it\u2019s their most potent argument against Obamacare. And there\u2019s been every reason to believe that the Republicans would use this message again in 2016. After all, the Medicare constituency is their bread and butter, and they are, quite reasonably, protective of the program. They may selfishly not want anyone else to have health care but they damned sure want to make sure that seniors have the program. In case anyone hasn\u2019t noticed, the elderly have a lot of health problems. It has always made perfect sense for the GOP to demagogue any and all changes to the program.\n\nThis represented a very dramatic change in the demographic make-up of the two parties. Since their inception in the New Deal and Great Societies, Social Security and Medicare had made loyal Democratic voters out of the elderly. They were fiercely protective of the programs and the Republicans were caught by the trap their ideology forced them into. Ronald Reagan\u2019s GOP may have looked congenial to many older people \u2014 but they knew that he wanted to end the programs that made it possible for them to live with dignity in their old age. So when they heard his famous recording railing against Medicare \u2014 in which he said,\u201done of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine. It\u2019s very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project, most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can\u2019t afford it\u201d \u2014 it sounded abstract and irrelevant to their very practical needs. (Not to mention obtuse; a medical program is a humanitarian project.) It\u2019s likely that many of them were just as staunchly anti-communist and anti-statist as Reagan, but few were willing to die prematurely to make that particular political point.\n\nIn the late 1980s, when a virulent strain of deficit fever invaded the swamps around the nation\u2019s capital, the government raised premiums on Medicare to provide some new coverage that many people didn\u2019t need and which didn\u2019t cover the one thing they need need, long term care. Seniors rebelled and they rebelled vociferously:\n\nThis summer\u2019s bitter struggle over the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 has damaged the credibility of one of the nation`s largest lobbies, both in Congress and among the 28 million members of the American Association of Retired Persons. From his retirement home in Las Vegas, Daniel Hawley, a 64-year-old former airline pilot, has helped organize the stunning grass-roots protest that has shaken AARP and pushed this largest expansion of Medicare benefits to the brink of congressional repeal. \u201cThey thought retired people were sitting around doing their ceramics and their little aerobics classes in senior centers and wouldn\u2019t give any fight,\u201d said Hawley. \u201cWell, they found out differently.\u201d\n\nIndeed they did. This infamous (and hilarious) video of seniors chasing the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means committee perfectly captures the power the medicare constituency has over the U.S. Government:\n\nThey repealed the law in November 1989.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bush has begun insisting that Medicare needs to be \"phased out.\" Not only is that wrong, it's also toxic VIDEO", "title": "Jeb Bush is flirting with disaster: Why his latest anti-Medicare fearmongering could sink his campaign", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bush has begun insisting that Medicare needs to be \"phased out.\" Not only is that wrong, it's also toxic VIDEO", "title": "Jeb Bush is flirting with disaster: Why his latest anti-Medicare fearmongering could sink his campaign", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/24/jeb_bush_is_flirting_with_disaster_why_his_latest_anti_medicare_fearmongering_could_sink_his_campaign/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/jeb_bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bush has begun insisting that Medicare needs to be \"phased out.\" Not only is that wrong, it's also toxic VIDEO", "title": "Jeb Bush is flirting with disaster: Why his latest anti-Medicare fearmongering could sink his campaign", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/jeb_bush.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Jeb Bush, Medicare, The Republican Party, The Republican Primary, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Kevin Drum at Mother Jones wrote it up:Ten years ago, Medicare was a runaway freight train.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Jeb Bush, Medicare, The Republican Party, The Republican Primary, Video, News, Politics NewsIt\u2019s been a good week for economic reports.\n(Not to mention obtuse; a medical program is a humanitarian project.)\nAnd we also found out that Medicare is on stronger footing than anyone could have imagined just a few years ago.\nThey were fiercely protective of the programs and the Republicans were caught by the trap their ideology forced them into."}
