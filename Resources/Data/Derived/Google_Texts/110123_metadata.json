John Kitzhaber and lawmakers found solace in an unrelated success \u2014 a massive hike in enrollment in the Oregon Health Plan.\n\nOHP is Oregon\u2019s Medicaid program, and as hundreds of thousands of people became newly eligible last year under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, most of them signed up. In the first year, enrollment was 73 percent higher than anticipated, according to data from the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nThe bill will be soon be coming due, however, as the state begins sharing the costs. The Affordable Care Act said the federal government would cover 100 percent of medical costs only until 2017, when its share would begin dropping to 90 percent.\n\nThe enrollment\n\nA 2013 report commissioned by the state projected that 222,700 people would take advantage of the expanded Medicaid access in its first year, 2014. The final tally was much higher: 386,000 people.\n\nThe increase was likely due in part to a simplified \u201cfast-track\u201d enrollment process that federal officials approved for Oregon, though several other states also saw enrollment exceed expectations. Oregon got permission to use income information already on file through other public assistance programs, providing a quick and easy way for many eligible people to sign up. And as Cover Oregon failed to work, the Kitzhaber administration aggressively promoted the fast-track option. The administration hoped to boost Medicaid enrollment numbers to make up for the paltry enrollment in private insurance through Cover Oregon.\n\nThe costs\n\nThe 2013 report estimated the Medicaid expansion would cost the state $217 million in the 2017-19 biennium, the first full two-year budget cycle in which the state begins shouldering some of the costs.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority now projects it will cost $369 million, about 70 percent more.\n\nBy 2020, Medicaid\u2019s share of the total state budget is projected to grow from the current 6.2 percent to nearly 10 percent.\n\nThe figures assume the federal government doesn\u2019t change the state\u2019s share of the price tag and that Oregon doesn\u2019t take other actions to reduce the cost of Medicaid, such as reducing payments to doctors.\n\nHow to pay\n\nOregon gets a big chunk of Medicaid funding from a tax on hospitals. The tax is matched by federal dollars, some of which ultimately flows back to hospitals for treating Medicaid patients. Increasing the tax could help cover part of the budget shortfall, said Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, co-chair of the Legislature\u2019s budget committee.\n\nUltimately, Devlin said, Oregon needs the improving economy to get more people off the Medicaid rolls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALEM \u2014 Amid the collapse of Cover Oregon, the state\u2019s failed health insurance enrollment website, then-Gov.
