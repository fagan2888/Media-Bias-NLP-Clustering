A new analysis also shows that 44 percent live in areas served by two or more ACOs. The figures come from new research by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, based on the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 announcement of the latest class of ACOs approved to participate in Medicare\u2019s ACO programs. The latest round of approvals in January brings the total of Medicare ACOs to 426, up from 368 in January 2014 and 134 in 2013. Oliver Wyman has identified an additional 159 ACOs, bringing the estimated total to 585, an increase of 12 percent from the previous year. \u201cOne of the key reforms in the Affordable Care Act is creating Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs, are groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers that have agreed to work together to give their Medicare patients better coordinated, high quality care,\u201d according to the CMS blog at the time of the last announcement in January. \u201cTo the extent that they succeed in providing more effective and efficient care, they can share in the savings to the Medicare program. Interim financial results for 114 ACOs that began work in 2012 show that they generated $128 million in savings for the Medicare trust fund in the first year \u2014while maintaining high quality patient care.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, initial results from an independent evaluation of 23 Pioneer ACOs, which are those that have more experience with coordinated care, show that they saved the Medicare program $147 million in their first year of operation.\u201d Despite well-publicized departures from Medicare\u2019s Pioneer ACO Program, the concept appears to now have taken hold and is becoming a driving force in better care for Medicare patients. Key findings: \u25cf About 5.6 million Medicare beneficiaries, or about 11 percent of total Medicare beneficiaries, now receive their healthcare from ACOs participating in Medicare\u2019s ACO programs. \u25cf These organizations also provide care to 35 million non-Medicare patients, about 6 percent more than last year. \u25cf ACOs collectively serve between 49 and 59 million U.S. residents, or between 15 and 17 percent of the population. \u201c The slowdown we\u2019re seeing in the growth of ACOs was almost inevitable, given the pace of change of the past two years,\u201d says Niyum Gandhi, a partner in Oliver Wyman\u2019s Health & Life Sciences practice and one of the firm\u2019s experts on ACOs. \u201cThe next big spurt will be more in effectiveness and sophistication than it will be in growth in numbers of ACOs.\" Gandhi also cites that the changes to the rules that CMS proposed this past winter, especially the Next Generation ACO model, could give ACOs the boost they need to compete more aggressively. \u25cf The full report is available here. \u25cf More about Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) \u25cf More on the map of ACO coverage \u25cf A list of all ACOs in the U.S. at Medicare. \u25cf About Oliver Wyman - Oliver Wyman reports to be a global leader in management consulting.
