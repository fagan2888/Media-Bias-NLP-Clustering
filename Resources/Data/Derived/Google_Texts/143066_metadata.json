It was the climax of a decade-long mission to study a 2.5 mile wide lump of dust and ice known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It marked the end of a 4 billion-mile journey that Rosetta and its sidekick craft, Philae, made together to reach the comet.\n\nCold blast\n\nDenver's temperatures nosedived to 16 degrees yesterday. The previous record low of 19 degrees was hit in 1916. CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen reports on how more records could tumble as temperatures fall below zero in an area bracing for more miserable cold.\n\nLame ducks\n\nThe 113th Congress returns to Washington today to wrap up business in its lame-duck session. The Senate has few days left with a Democratic majority, time likely to be further abbreviated by a week off for Thanksgiving and two weeks off for Christmas. Here's what they'll be racing to finish, according to CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes and CBS Capitol Hill reporter John Nolen.\n\nDark Money\n\nTransparency in government is being lost because of court decisions that have made campaign financing a free-for-all. Correspondent Cordes reports that the midterm elections this month were the most expensive in history, and $145 million came from anonymous donors. Thanks to a series of recent court decisions, certain nonprofit groups are no longer required to list names of donors. So no one knows who's buying what in Washington.\n\nAwkward APEC\n\nWhenever you have so many world leaders gathered together, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane observes, the sometimes strained relationships can play out in any number of ways and could be summed up as -- awkward!\n\nNo time for love\n\nThere are nearly 250-million single adults in China, and that's upset the traditional family-centered culture. Correspondent Doane reports that moms, dads -- even grandparents -- have become self-appointed matchmakers. Many say their kids were completely unaware that they were out spouse-hunting on their behalf.\n\nChina in the Comoros\n\nWhy is China, an economic powerhouse, so interested in a tiny, impoverished, politically unstable African nation? The Chinese are paving roads, building schools, mosques, government buildings, an airport, a center to facilitate tourism and even homes -- for politicians. Local TV and radio stations were designed and built by China, and four Chinese government-run television channels now pipe programming from Beijing directly into Comorans' homes.\n\nObamacare 2015\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act set to start enrollment for its second year on Saturday, some unpleasant surprises may be in store for some.\n\nGenetic disorder to Ebola cure?\n\nChris Hempel has spent the last eight years fighting for the lives of her twin girls. Both have Niemann-Pick Type C, an incredibly rare hereditary disease. But one thing Hempel never imagined was that her family would end up in the middle of some of the most promising scientific research on Ebola.\n\nAccused murderer's account\n\nJoseph McStay, 40, vanished along with his wife, Summer, 43, and their two sons, Gianni, 4, and Joey, 3, from their Fallbrook, Calif. home in February 2010, launching what San Diego sheriff's investigators called their most extensive missing-persons search ever. Patrick McStay, Joseph's father, told \"48 Hours\"' Crimesider Monday that he had many phone conversations over the years with the man now accused of killing his son's family -- regarding his son's disappearance. Patrick McStay says the last time he spoke with Chase Merritt was in January or February of this year, when he called Merritt after reading in the media that Merritt was writing a book.\n\nEating armed\n\nSeveral national chains, including Chipotle and Target, strongly discourage customers from bringing guns onto their premises, even if it's legal in the state. But a Louisiana restaurant is taking the opposite approach. CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann reports on a grill where they're offering discounts to gun-toting customers.\n\nFinal service\n\nIn July of 2007, Lt. Justin Fitch was deployed -- and depressed -- in northern Iraq. Fitch got counseling, recovered, and served a second deployment in Iraq. But in May of 2012, he was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. Correspondent Strassmann reports on how Fitch plans to spend whatever time he has left helping other soldiers.\n\nBrand on Brand\n\nWatch the actor, comedian and author open up like never before in the latest installment of the \"CBS This Morning\" Emmy-nominated series, \"Note to Self.\" Brand offers advice to his younger self on surviving the drugs that nearly destroyed him, and the perks and pitfalls of fame.\n\nTop News\n\nWorld\n\nObama: U.S. - China climate change accord \"historic\"\n\nObama, China's president unveil flurry of accords\n\nDisappointing news on drug war in Afghanistan\n\nIndia rushes to help women amid medical scandal\n\nPolitics\n\nRepublicans win Senate race in Alaska\n\nWhich global figure gave the most to the Obamas?\n\nU.S.\n\nArrest in slaying of vet as he left homecoming party\n\nRemains of Ice Age infants uncovered in Alaska\n\nCarol Ann Susi, voice of Mrs. Wolowitz on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" dies\n\nMoneyWatch\n\nAmericans rekindle their love of big cars\n\nCan doubling down on food stamps boost nutrition?\n\nHealth\n\nPlaying video games may make you smarter\n\nPlea for more healthcare workers to treat Ebola in Africa\n\nNurses strike to protest Ebola preparedness", "article_metadata": {"description": "Historic try to land spacecraft on comet; awkward moments among world leaders at economic summit in Beijing; how 250 million single adults look for love", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-nov-12-2014/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/12/27c92d3f-8a1f-4f74-a779-060fe071ff9f/thumbnail/1200x630/6bdab1a92a46c2f499b84c587489834c/spc.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Historic try to land spacecraft on comet; awkward moments among world leaders at economic summit in Beijing; how 250 million single adults look for love", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, Nov. 12, 2014"}, "twitter": {"description": "Historic try to land spacecraft on comet; awkward moments among world leaders at economic summit in Beijing; how 250 million single adults look for love", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, Nov. 12, 2014", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-nov-12-2014/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-nov-12-2014/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-nov-12-2014/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/12/27c92d3f-8a1f-4f74-a779-060fe071ff9f/thumbnail/1200x630/6bdab1a92a46c2f499b84c587489834c/spc.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-nov-12-2014/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-nov-12-2014/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd602c\"", "article_summary": "Here's what they'll be racing to finish, according to CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes and CBS Capitol Hill reporter John Nolen.\nCBS News correspondent Barry Petersen reports on how more records could tumble as temperatures fall below zero in an area bracing for more miserable cold.\nCBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann reports on a grill where they're offering discounts to gun-toting customers.\nBrand on BrandWatch the actor, comedian and author open up like never before in the latest installment of the \"CBS This Morning\" Emmy-nominated series, \"Note to Self.\"\nCorrespondent Cordes reports that the midterm elections this month were the most expensive in history, and $145 million came from anonymous donors."}
