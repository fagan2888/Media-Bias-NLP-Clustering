Credit: Wonderlane, CC BY 2.0\n\n(Reuters Health) - When doctors are asked to perform virginity testing, they should refuse because it\u2019s not medically necessary and may cause psychological harm, some U.S. ethicists argue.\n\nThese pelvic exams are done in many parts of the world to determine suitability for marriage. But doctors shouldn\u2019t agree to these exams because they violate three core ethics of the profession \u2013 protecting patient welfare, respecting women\u2019s autonomy, and promoting justice - a group of ethicists wrote recently in an essay the Lancet.\n\n\u201cVirginity testing does not protect and promote the health of female patients; virginity testing is therefore completely incompatible with each of these three principles of professional ethics in obstetrics and gynecology,\u201d said Laurence McCullough, an ethics and health policy researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a co-author of the essay.\n\nThe exam can be painful or make women feel humiliated or degraded, McCullough added by email.\n\n\u201cThere is no net clinical benefit and (a) preventable risk of biopsychosocial harm,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nIn the test, which is often called a \u201ctwo-finger\u201d test, the doctor does an internal vaginal exam to feel the hymen, a thin membrane that some cultures believe remains intact until women have sexual intercourse.\n\nSome women, however, may be born without a hymen, and the membrane can also rupture or stretch from activities like sports or using a tampon.\n\nMany human rights organizations have condemned virginity testing as inhumane and unethical. The World Health Organization has said \u201cthere is no place for virginity (or `two-finger\u2019) testing; it has no scientific validity.\u201d\n\nStill, the practice persists in many parts of the world, including India, Turkey, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Indonesia and South Africa. It may be done out of a cultural or religious belief that the test can ensure women are virgins until marriage.\n\nVirginity tests have also been done in other situations to ensure, for example, that women are virgins when they enter the military. Tests have also been performed when women are accused of moral crimes or have run away from home.\n\nIn South Africa, the tests fell out of use but then became more common again with the rise of the AIDS epidemic, said Louise Vincent, a researcher in virginity testing and other women\u2019s reproductive health issues at Rhodes University in South Africa who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nIn the context of AIDS, in a country where many very young women report that their first sexual experiences aren\u2019t consensual, the specter of virginity tests can potentially serve as a deterrent against unwanted sexual advances, Vincent, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\n\u201cIt is all very well for high-minded westerners to preach justice and autonomy of the person, but these ethical principles have no efficacy in the context I describe,\u201d Vincent added. \u201cHere for a young girl to say to an insistent man `I can\u2019t, I have to get tested next week by the elder women\u2019 can act as a rare instrument to resist in a context in which such means are often absent.\u201d\n\nEven in these circumstances, though, the tests are unethical for doctors to perform, McCullough said.\n\n\u201cThere are no situations in which the female patient can be considered better off by having virginity testing performed,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1RKPrhc The Lancet, online December 22, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "should, doctors, agree, do, virginity, tests", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "When doctors are asked to perform virginity testing, they should refuse because it\u2019s not medically necessary and may cause psychological harm, some U.S. ethicists argue.", "title": "Should Doctors Agree To Do Virginity Tests?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/should-doctors-agree-do-virginity-tests-369714", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/15/virginity-test.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When doctors are asked to perform virginity testing, they should refuse because it\u2019s not medically necessary and may cause psychological harm, some U.S. ethicists argue.", "title": "Should Doctors Agree To Do Virginity Tests?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/should-doctors-agree-do-virginity-tests-369714", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/15/virginity-test.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/15/virginity-test.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-15T14:46:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T14:46:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "When doctors are asked to perform virginity testing, they should refuse because it\u2019s not medically necessary and may cause psychological harm, some U.S. ethicists argue."}, "article_summary": "When doctors are asked to perform virginity testing, they should refuse because it\u2019s not medically necessary and may cause psychological harm.\nVirginity tests have also been done in other situations to ensure, for example, that women are virgins when they enter the military.\n\u201cThere are no situations in which the female patient can be considered better off by having virginity testing performed,\u201d McCullough said.\nCredit: Wonderlane, CC BY 2.0(Reuters Health) - When doctors are asked to perform virginity testing, they should refuse because it\u2019s not medically necessary and may cause psychological harm, some U.S. ethicists argue.\nMany human rights organizations have condemned virginity testing as inhumane and unethical."}
