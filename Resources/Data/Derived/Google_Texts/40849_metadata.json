Straddling the middle were independents, 52% of whom thought the tax burden of the top 1% could be higher.\n\nMeanwhile, another 25% made up the Goldilocks contingent. They said the top 1% pay \"about the right amount\" in taxes.\n\nQuiz: Do you have what it takes to be rich?\n\nAnd another 19% said they pay too much.\n\nThe truth about taxes, of course, is that what's considered too much, too little or just right is a subjective, political judgment.\n\nThe facts about the top 1% -- at least according to the latest data from the IRS and related analysis-- are these:\n\nIt took at least $389,000 of adjusted gross household income (AGI) in 2011 to rank above the other 99% of U.S. tax filers. Of course, AGI doesn't include tax-exempt income, which can be substantial for the wealthiest households and lower the taxes they pay as a percent of their overall income.\n\nRelated: How much income do you need to be happy?\n\nAs a group, the top 1% earned nearly 19% of all AGI reported that year, but they paid 35% of all federal income taxes, which was about 2 percentage points less than the year before.\n\nAnd many in the top 1% faced a higher tax bill starting in 2013 thanks to measures in the fiscal cliff deal and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong them:\n\nThe top income tax rate rose to 39.6% from 35%.\n\nItemized deductions were restricted at high income levels.\n\nThe Medicare tax rose on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples)\n\nAnd, for the first time, investment income -- including capital gains, dividends and interest -- could be subject to the Medicare tax.\n\nSomething else that's becoming clear about the top 1% of tax filers?\n\nMembership can be fleeting. That's because a sizeable number of households are catapulted into the group thanks to one-time events, such as the exercise of stock options or sale of a business.\n\nRead the full CNN/ORC poll results", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "top 1% , taxes, income, tax burden, CNNMoney American Dream poll, AGI, capital gains, dividends, interest, tax-exempt, IRS, Medicare, fiscal cliff", "title": "Do the top 1% pay enough taxes?", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/pf/taxes/top-1-poll/index.html", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "type": "article", "description": "More than half of people surveyed in the CNNMoney American Dream poll say the top 1% pay too little in taxes, while 25% say they pay the right amount.
