But before you take that for gospel, here are a few facts to consider.\n\nIn the fight over increasing the minimum wage, Republicans\u2014who oppose the boost to $10.10 an hour\u2014have received an assist from the Congressional Budget Office. According to a report released this afternoon, a minimum wage increase of the kind proposed by Democrats would reduce employment by 500,000 jobs.\n\nUnlike the storm over Obamacare\u2019s job losses\u2014which were caused by a drop in the supply of labor\u2014this is a product of lower demand. With higher wages in effect, says the CBO, employers are less likely to hire.\n\nOn the other end, however, are the 16.5 million Americans who would receive higher wages as a result of an increase to the minimum wage, as well as the 900,000 Americans (out of 45 million) who would be lifted out of poverty. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s possible that\u2014by increasing the income of so many workers\u2014you offset the immediate job losses. To wit, here is the Economic Policy Institute with an analysis of the minimum wage and its impact on employment:\n\nBased on the economic multiplier effect that results from putting additional income in the hands of lower-income workers, raising the minimum wage will likely have a modest but positive impact on job creation, leading to an additional 85,000 net new jobs when fully phased in.\n\nLower-income earners spend their income more immediately, more completely, and more locally, than do higher income earners, and therefore generate more economic activity. Increasing the wages of 27.8 million workers by $35 billion over the phase-in period generates an additional GDP impact of $22 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, while there\u2019s enough research on the minimum wage to support any assertion, the large majority of results are clustered around the conclusion that raising the wage has little to no effect on employment. Barring a massive increase, odds are good that you won\u2019t lose anything by boosting the minimum wage.\n\nI should also say that this gets to why\u2014as far as raising incomes is concerned\u2014the minimum wage isn\u2019t the greatest option. An expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit\u2014to raise payments and include single, childless workers\u2014could increase incomes without the hit to the labor market. Indeed, a combination of the two policies\u2014a larger EITC and higher minimum wage\u2014could substantially boost incomes and provide enough stimulus to the economy to completely outweigh the adverse effects.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402182044, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "A new congressional report says that the minimum wage will kill jobs.
