If a mom wants to send her newborn, staff members often have to ask why and then fill out paperwork explaining the reason.\n\nThe number of U.S. hospitals applying for the baby-friendly certification has gained momentum since 2010, when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services incorporated the practices into federal goals. And the hospital measures are in keeping with the latest research about the significant health benefits of breast-feeding.\n\nBut for some mothers, this new push to breast-feed feels like the old one of decades ago, when zealous \u201clactivists\u201d were accused of trying to guilt other women into abandoning the bottle.\n\nThat\u2019s the impression Lisa Stone got after delivering her daughter in December at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Va. She had decided not to breast-feed because of frequent travel for her job with a nonprofit group.\n\n\u201cYet right after my daughter was born, they were ripping open my gown and trying to set the baby up to breast-feed. It was really uncomfortable,\u201d the 30-year-old said.\n\nMandeep Virk-Baker, at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Maryland with her husband and daughter Hera, said she appreciated the hospital\u2019s baby-friendly practices.\n\nSo much so that Stone asked to be released a day early. \u201cI certainly think if you want to have your baby next to you all night, and that makes you feel better, you should have that choice,\u201d she said. \u201cMy problem was feeling like I was forced into that position.\u201d\n\nSo far, 199 U.S. hospitals, of more than 3,000, have been certified as baby-friendly, said Trish MacEnroe, executive director of Baby-Friendly USA. About 700 hospitals nationally are implementing the standards \u2014 though not always smoothly.\n\nIn an emotional debate carried out recently on a parent e-mail discussion group in Alexandria, some mothers said they loved Inova\u2019s emphasis on and help with breast-feeding, while others said they felt unduly pressured by staff.\n\n\u201cThe staff and physicians here have taken great pride at being advocates for mothers who want to breast-feed,\u201d said Patricia Schmehl, vice president and administrator of Inova\u2019s Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cPeople are very passionate about this. Does it move from passionate to overzealous? It may have.\u201d\n\nPush is worldwide\n\nThe U.S. push toward encouraging breast-feeding at hospitals is an outgrowth of the global Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, launched in 1991 by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund in response to research showing the health benefits of breast-feeding. Breast-fed babies have lower rates of diabetes, childhood leukemia, sudden infant death syndrome and other illnesses. The WHO maintains that breast-feeding will help cut child deaths from malnutrition, which is now responsible for nearly half of all deaths of children younger than 5.\n\nTo become certified, a hospital must adopt 10 practices that research has shown to promote breast-feeding, including skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant within the first hour of life and rooming in 23 out of 24 hours a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that moms sleep better when the baby\u2019s in the nursery,\u201d said MacEnroe, whose organization has been designated by WHO to certify U.S. hospitals. \u201cResearch shows that moms sleep better when babies are closer to them.\u201d (Some moms involved in the debate beg to differ.)\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s goal is to have 80 percent of new moms breast-feeding initially, 60 percent of moms continuing to breast-feed at six months and 34 percent for a year \u2014 the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nThe guidelines also call for decreasing the share of newborns who receive formula within the first two days of life from 24 percent in 2006 to 14 percent in 2020.\n\nEconomic dividing line\n\nIn 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, 79 percent of moms began to breast-feed, but 49 percent continued at six months and 27 percent after a year. The biggest disparities fall along socioeconomic lines, with higher-income mothers exclusively breast-feeding.\n\nAlthough the baby-friendly movement has been growing, in 2007, 2.9 percent of all U.S. births were in baby-friendly facilities, HHS reports. Its goal is 8.1 percent by 2020.\n\nNew mothers\u2019 acceptance of the practices appears to be in the execution \u2014 for example, how well they\u2019re educated about the health benefits and how smoothly staff members guide breast-feeding \u2014 without appearing to push. Some mothers said they felt blindsided. Some had given birth in the past few years and didn\u2019t understand why procedures were changing.\n\nBeth Groves, interim clinical nurse manager of the Mother Baby Unit at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md., said that despite the focus on breast-feeding, staff members are taught to respect mothers\u2019 choices. And many of the same practices that promote breast-feeding also promote bonding.\n\n\u201cOur aim is not to make anyone feel guilty,\u201d Groves said. \u201cThere is no right or wrong in motherhood.\u201d\n\nMandeep Virk-Baker, 33, said that without the baby-friendly procedures at Shady Grove, she would not have been able to start breast-feeding. As a nutrition scientist at the National Institutes of Health, she desperately wanted to nurse her baby.\n\n\u201cI had all the book knowledge in the world, but no practical knowledge, and at first, it was really frustrating,\u201d said Virk-Baker. \u201cWe had to learn together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "WASHINGTON &mdash; At the growing number of hospitals in the United States that are certified as &ldquo;baby-friendly,&rdquo; the naked, often unbathed infant is put on the mother&rsquo;s bare chest within the first hour of birth.", "title": "'Baby-friendly' hospitals aren't making all mothers happy", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/baby-friendly-hospitals-aren-t-making-all-mothers-happy/275828511/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141116298896077.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141116298896077.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON &mdash; At the growing number of hospitals in the United States that are certified as &ldquo;baby-friendly,&rdquo; the naked, often unbathed infant is put on the mother&rsquo;s bare chest within the first hour of birth.", "title": "'Baby-friendly' hospitals aren't making all mothers happy", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/baby-friendly-hospitals-aren-t-making-all-mothers-happy/275828511/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141116298896077.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141116298896077.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "WASHINGTON &mdash; At the growing number of hospitals in the United States that are certified as &ldquo;baby-friendly,&rdquo; the naked, often unbathed infant is put on the mother&rsquo;s bare chest within the first hour of birth."}, "article_summary": "Mandeep Virk-Baker, at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Maryland with her husband and daughter Hera, said she appreciated the hospital\u2019s baby-friendly practices.\nAlthough the baby-friendly movement has been growing, in 2007, 2.9 percent of all U.S. births were in baby-friendly facilities, HHS reports.\nAnd the hospital measures are in keeping with the latest research about the significant health benefits of breast-feeding.\n\u201cMy problem was feeling like I was forced into that position.\u201dSo far, 199 U.S. hospitals, of more than 3,000, have been certified as baby-friendly, said Trish MacEnroe, executive director of Baby-Friendly USA.\nThe number of U.S. hospitals applying for the baby-friendly certification has gained momentum since 2010, when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services incorporated the practices into federal goals."}
