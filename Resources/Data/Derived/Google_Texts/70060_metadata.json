(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Mark J. Terrill/AP)\n\nAs the leading Republican presidential candidates rant and rave about deporting 11 million immigrants, fighting some kind of world war against Islam, implementing gimmicky tax plans that would bankrupt the nation and other such madness, keep one thing in mind: The party establishment brought this plague upon itself.\n\nThe self-harming was unintentional but inevitable \u2014 and should have been foreseeable. Donald Trump and Ben Carson didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Fully half of the party\u2019s voters didn\u2019t wake up one morning and decide for no particular reason that experience as a Republican elected official was the last thing they wanted in a presidential candidate.\n\nThe insurrection that has reduced Jeb Bush to single-digit support while Trump and Carson soar is nothing more than the understandable reaction of the jilted. Republican leaders have spent the years of the Obama presidency inflaming GOP base voters with extreme rhetoric and wooing them with empty promises. The establishment won its goal \u2014 electoral gains in Congress and many statehouses \u2014 but in the process may have lost the party.\n\nUnrest was brewing among true-believer conservatives even before Barack Obama took office as the first African American president. George W. Bush had angered the base with his budget-busting expenditures for Middle East wars and a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare. What had happened to the party\u2019s commitment to fiscal responsibility?\n\nThe last straw for many came when the financial crisis hit in 2008 and Bush, in his final days, won authorization of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program \u2014 a massive bailout for the big Wall Street banks. It was a wholesale violation of conservative principles that helped inspire the birth of the tea party movement.\n\nAfter filing to run in the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary, candidate Ben Carson attempted to clarify statements he made the day before likening refugees fleeing violence in Syria to \"rabid dogs.\" (Reuters)\n\nWith the economy still in crisis, Obama took actions that further riled conservatives: pushing through Congress a messy economic stimulus package and rescuing General Motors and Chrysler. And then the president turned to health care, ultimately winning passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe GOP saw a golden political opportunity. Rather than work with Obama toward compromise, Republicans positioned themselves as implacable foes of the president and all he stood for.\n\nAs the tea party increasingly came to demonize Obama for being an alleged Muslim or socialist \u2014 and even to delegitimize him because he was supposedly born in Kenya \u2014 the Republican establishment shamefully played along despite knowing that none of this rubbish was true.\n\nThe result was a sweeping victory in the 2010 election. Republicans captured the House by electing dozens of tea party-backed candidates who came to Washington with revolution on their minds.\n\nExperienced GOP politicians who should have known better allowed this insurgency to push the party into a series of showdowns with Obama that Republicans could not possibly win. Having told the base that great things could be accomplished by shutting down the government or threatening default on the national debt, the establishment had to say, in effect, never mind.\n\nVoters began to realize that they\u2019d been had. The Republican leadership talked a good game at election time, but never delivered.\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that 51 percent of Republican voters (according to the Real Clear Politics poll average) say they favor Trump, Carson or Carly Fiorina, none of whom has ever held public office? Or that another 11 percent support Ted Cruz, whose career in the Senate has consisted of vehemently opposing his own party\u2019s leaders as a bunch of weak-kneed quislings?\n\nWhat Donald Trump is doing and saying as a presidential candidate is not who we are as a country, says The Post's Jonathan Capehart. (Tom LeGro/The Washington Post)\n\nIf you add it up, roughly 6 of 10 GOP voters tell pollsters they reject any candidate the Republican establishment likes. That amounts to a party in open revolt.\n\nThere are those in the Republican establishment who look at prior elections and predict that the outsider candidates will eventually fade. There are those who believe the fear of terrorism, post-Paris, will lead voters to choose safety over adventure. Perhaps this is something other than whistling past the graveyard, but that\u2019s what it sounds like to me.\n\nAre voters who have been on the raucous, anything-goes Trump bandwagon for months going to fall meekly in line behind someone such as Bush or Marco Rubio? It gets harder and harder to imagine such a thing.\n\nMeanwhile, the whole field is being pulled so far to the right on issues such as immigration and taxes that any of the likely nominees will have a hard time winning the general election. This is a fine mess the Republican Party has gotten itself into, and we won\u2019t know until the early primaries whether there\u2019s any hope of a way out.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
