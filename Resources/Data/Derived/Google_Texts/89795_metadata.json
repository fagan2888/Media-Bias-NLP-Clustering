Some were outlaws, some were lawful. Some gave all, all gave some; but none wanted to give at all. They were Americans who dared to stand against the infinite rapacity of government. Their victories were slight and fleeting; their defeats harsh and punishing. But their names come down to us with honor, and now one of those names is Al Sharpton.\n\nThe tale of his millions of dollars in unpaid taxes is, like many things about Sharpton, hair-raising. It would cause MSNBC to cancel Sharpton\u2019s show, were the Lean Forward network inclined to hold its on-air talent to any standards of intellectual honesty or personal bearing. But there can be no doubt: For sheer rebel-yelling, law-nullifying, sovereign-citizen opposition to big government, the tea party (not just what Sharpton calls the \u201cracist and homophobic\u201d modern version but the Boston Harbor originals) has nothing on Al Sharpton.\n\nThe author of the 1996 memoir Go Tell Pharaoh and the 2003 presidential campaign trial balloon Al On America tells the New York Times he is working to pay down some of his $4.5 million in state and federal liens for unpaid taxes. There is not much evidence to support this claim (the newspaper points out that his debt to the state of New York has actually increased in recent years), and Sharpton\u2019s apparent attempt to position himself as an unwitting tax rebel just won\u2019t fly. Every tax deadbeat is a de facto tax protester.\n\nPersonal tax shirkers like Sharpton are indeed more direct in their attack on the state than lawful protesters such as Jarvis (creator of California\u2019s 1978 Proposition 13 and spiritual head of the anti-tax movement that was crucial to Ronald Reagan\u2019s election) and Gregory (whose landmark 1935 case Gregory v. Helvering turned on the right to minimize income-tax liability). Law-abiding political and legal foes of excessive taxes (who are included here not to disparage them but to make Sharpton\u2019s Rothbardian view of the state more clear) merely argue for justice. Tax evaders engage in real civil, or criminal, disobedience, attempting to deprive the state of access to their personal property \u2014 which (in the state\u2019s view) rightfully belongs to the state.\n\nSo Sharpton, a Baptist clergyman who claims to have been first ordained in a Pentecostal church at the age of 10, is not just looking for ways to skate on his public (and less forgivably, private) bills. He is laying claim to a history that includes the original cause of American independence and characters as vivid as Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher whose 20-year dispute over payments to the federal government flared into an armed standoff in the Silver State this spring. Since before there was a United States of America, Americans have been refusing to give their property to the government.\n\nIt is unclear how much pride Sharpton takes in having established his anarcho-capitalist credentials \u2014 though with the Rev it\u2019s always smart to assume he feels a great deal of pride about everything he does. The squalid circumstances that the Grey Lady insists on reporting in detail are of a type most grown men would be ashamed to own. Russ Buettner reports how Sharpton faced financial challenges after a court ordered him to pay damages to a government official Sharpton defamed during his Tawana Brawley rape hoax:\n\nHe said he did not have enough money to pay all at once, and after years of a slow trickle of money from wage garnishments, Mr. Sharpton was forced to testify under oath about his finances. He said he had no assets, save for a watch and a ring. Everything else, including some of his suits, was owned by a for-profit business, Revals Communications, he said. He testified that he put nearly all of his $73,000 in take-home pay from the National Action Network into Revals, which in turn paid many of his expenses, including his daughters\u2019 private school tuition and some of the rent on his house. Even though state law prohibits nonprofits from making loans to officers, Mr. Sharpton said National Action Network had also once lent him money to cover his daughters\u2019 tuition. During the deposition, Mr. Sharpton coyly suggested he was not really sure who owned the Brooklyn house where he lived with his wife and two daughters. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t checked the deed,\u201d he said. In fact, Mr. Sharpton knew his landlord, Bishop E. Bernard Jordan, quite well. Mr. Sharpton had performed the wedding ceremony of Mr. Jordan\u2019s daughter at Zoe Ministries, the Upper West Side church where Mr. Jordan is the pastor. Mr. Jordan, who makes millions of dollars a year offering prophecies about his followers, and his wife, Debra, had been among only three couples to give the maximum allowable amount to Mr. Sharpton\u2019s 1997 mayoral campaign, records show.\n\nWhere Sharpton\u2019s tax revolt really gets tricky, however, is in his relationship with NBC-Universal. As the host of MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation, the Big Apple firebrand is professionally obligated to support a type of redistributionist, big-government politics that won\u2019t sit with principled anti-tax behavior. Fellow tax rebels such as the actor Wesley Snipes (who was already a favorite of small-government movie fans thanks to his portrayal of villain Simon Phoenix in the libertarian classic Demolition Man) have acted consistently with their beliefs. Snipes grounded his refusal to pay income taxes in principles such as Larken Rose\u2019s popular \u201c\u00a7 861\u201d theory and an old idea that the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was not properly ratified. These concepts have never borne legal weight (Snipes was acquitted on all felony charges but still ended up serving two years of a three-year sentence for misdemeanor charges of failing to file a tax return), but adherents seem to be sincere in their beliefs.\n\nOther protesters, such as one-time Fugees front woman Lauryn Hill, have been equally forthright. \u201cI shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term \u2018make the IRS whole\u2019 . . . make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities,\u201d Hill wrote in 2013. \u201cThe entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?! Who has made recompense for stealing, imposing, lying, murdering, criminalizing the traumatized, taking them against their wills, destroying their homes, dividing their communities, \u2018trying\u2019 to steal their destinies, their time, stagnating their development, I could go on and on.\u201d\n\nYou can doubt the basis of Snipes\u2019s theories, or dismiss Hill\u2019s insinuation that a phenomenally successful entertainer from above the Mason-Dixon Line is entitled to compensation for historical suffering. Even legitimate anti-tax activists can be questioned. Good-government types make long and articulate arguments that California\u2019s Prop 13 (which capped increases in property taxes) produced anti-libertarian outcomes by favoring the landed classes and centralizing education budgeting in Sacramento. (California voters, on the other hand, like Prop 13 just fine and have consistently voted to expand its protections while defeating all attempts to roll back the law.) Gregory v. Helvering, though it produced a gem of tax wisdom, is also controversial. \u201cAny one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible,\u201d Judge Learned Hand wrote in a celebrated circuit court ruling. \u201cHe is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one\u2019s taxes.\u201d But even this chestnut sticks in the throats of pro-tax zealots who equate the non-crime of \u201ctax avoidance\u201d with the recognized crime of tax evasion and demonize \u201cBenedict Arnold CEOs\u201d for trying to minimize their tax hit.\n\nAll of these arguments proceed from a principle, however; and it appears to be the opposite of any principle MSNBC, or for that matter Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, stands for. NAN urges members to sign up for the Affordable Care Act and lobbies for increased student-loan subsidies. MSNBC wants government action to destroy mankind\u2019s primary source of energy and has made a long-term campaign of ending wealth inequality \u2014 and the network\u2019s preferred means toward that goal don\u2019t appear to include deregulation or ending the Federal Reserve. It is impossible to square any of these positions with not paying your taxes.\n\nThe inconsistencies in his position probably won\u2019t hurt Sharpton. His detractors are unlikely to be surprised, while his supporters are immune to evidence against him. An insatiable sponge and grifter who landed in a court battle with his psychic buddy Bishop Jordan and even ended up having \u201cfriends\u201d pay the defamation damages he owed, Sharpton isn\u2019t the ideal figurehead for a new tax rebellion either.\n\nThen again, history never gives us perfect heroes, and over the years American tax revolt has frequently mixed real ideological concerns with outright criminality. Leaders of the so-called Whiskey Rebellion in the 1790s were probing an important question: whether the Revolution\u2019s tongue-twisting slogan \u201cTaxation without representation is tyranny\u201d was a denunciation of public seizure of private property in most cases or merely an objection to being taxed while having no voice in Parliament. They opposed an excise that predominantly hit small, rustic westerners and was crafted by Alexander Hamilton with a sophistry worthy of Jonathan Gruber \u2014 featuring incentives for early compliance, breaks for big distillers and an overarching goal of consolidating and codifying a private industry. They lived in a region where George Washington owned vast tracts of speculative real estate and had a strong incentive both to scatter local owners and to make a public demonstration of federal power.\n\nBut they were also a dangerous mob. In his history The Whiskey Rebellion, William Hogeland describes the pseudonymous or composite character Tom the Tinker, a \u201cjoyously violent\u201d leader whose primary victims were not federal revenue agents but other distillers tempted to comply with the feds. \u201cYou might find a note posted on a tree outside your house, requiring you to publish in the Gazette your hatred of the whiskey tax and your commitment to the cause; otherwise, the note promised, your still would be mended,\u201d Hogeland writes. \u201cTom had a macabre sense of humor and a literary bent: \u2018mended\u2019 meant shot full of holes or burned.\u201d In his own published writings Tom \u201cwas always sorry to have been forced, by someone\u2019s waywardness, to pay a visit. But nobody was exempt from his service, he reminded his readers. He asked his victims to imagine his fires making the hills give light to the vales.\u201d\n\nIn The Whiskey Rebellion: Frontier Epilogue to the American Revolution, Thomas P. Slaughter goes further, describing the violent abuse of a tax collector by a group of tax rebels. After destroying his belongings and paperwork, the crowd forced him to \u201ccurse his commission of office,\u201d stamp on his own personal effects and denounce his government employers, before turning on him physically:\n\nThe crowd still was not content that the tax man, the excise, and state authority had met with sufficient humiliation. So, they cut the hair off one side of [William] Graham\u2019s head. They braided the other half in an unsightly and mocking manner, cut a hole in the cock of his hat, and fixed it sideways on his head with the pig-tail protruding from the hole. Then the mob exposed Graham to what were perhaps lewd \u201cmarks of ignominy.\u201d . . . Unfortunately for the tax collector, communal sport with him as victim was not yet over. Indeed, the mob dressed his horse \u201cin such a manner as to disfigure\u201d it, and then paraded Graham back and forth across the three frontier counties in which he was supposed to collect the excise. Celebrants gaily but purposefully forced Graham to trudge through the mud to stills he had intended to visit in his official capacity, halting at each for a raucous ceremony and a \u201ctreat\u201d of alcohol. At each stop they insulted Graham further and forced him to participate in the festivities.\n\nWith their veiled threats, mob agitation, mistreatment of interlopers and stentorian rhetoric, the tax rebels could almost be described as engaging in Sharptonian antics \u2014 with the important caveat that fewer people died in the Whiskey Rebellion than in just one of Sharpton\u2019s riots. Two or three rebels were killed in a shootout at the home of big distiller John Neville in 1794. Nobody was murdered, and the rebellion dispersed peacefully after a 13,000-man militia, led part of the way by President Washington himself, marched into western Pennsylvania to put the uprising down. By comparison, Sharpton\u2019s anti-Semitic 1995 protest against Freddie\u2019s Fashion Mart in Harlem ended when one of Sharpton\u2019s followers shot and killed seven innocent people before burning the store down.\n\nBut who knows? His 2013 book The Rejected Stone: Al Sharpton and the Path to American Leadership is an ode to Sharpton\u2019s many reinventions, from street-corner screamer to beloved elder statesman partying at the White House with Jay-Z and the president. Why not add \u201ctax rebel\u201d or even \u201cdoomsday prepper\u201d to his portfolio? These would at least be consistent with his actions, which have made Sharpton\u2019s contempt for the state\u2019s taxing authority absolutely clear.\n\nWelcome to the barricades, Rev.\n\n\u2014 Tim Cavanaugh is news editor of National Review Online.

He testified that he put nearly all of his $73,000 in take-home pay from the National Action Network into Revals, which in turn paid many of his expenses, including his daughters\u2019 private school tuition and some of the rent on his house. Even though state law prohibits nonprofits from making loans to officers, Mr. Sharpton said National Action Network had also once lent him money to cover his daughters\u2019 tuition.\n\nDuring the deposition, Mr. Sharpton coyly suggested he was not really sure who owned the Brooklyn house where he lived with his wife and two daughters. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t checked the deed,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Sharpton knew his landlord, Bishop E. Bernard Jordan, quite well. Mr. Sharpton had performed the wedding ceremony of Mr. Jordan\u2019s daughter at Zoe Ministries, the Upper West Side church where Mr. Jordan is the pastor. Mr. Jordan, who makes millions of dollars a year offering prophecies about his followers, and his wife, Debra, had been among only three couples to give the maximum allowable amount to Mr. Sharpton\u2019s 1997 mayoral campaign, records show.\n\n\nWhere Sharpton\u2019s tax revolt really gets tricky, however, is in his relationship with NBC-Universal. As the host of MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation, the Big Apple firebrand is professionally obligated to support a type of redistributionist, big-government politics that won\u2019t sit with principled anti-tax behavior. Fellow tax rebels such as the actor Wesley Snipes (who was already a favorite of small-government movie fans thanks to his portrayal of villain Simon Phoenix in the libertarian classic Demolition Man) have acted consistently with their beliefs. Snipes grounded his refusal to pay income taxes in principles such as Larken Rose\u2019s popular \u201c\u00a7 861\u201d theory and an old idea that the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was not properly ratified. These concepts have never borne legal weight (Snipes was acquitted on all felony charges but still ended up serving two years of a three-year sentence for misdemeanor charges of failing to file a tax return), but adherents seem to be sincere in their beliefs.\n\n#page#Other protesters, such as one-time Fugees front woman Lauryn Hill, have been equally forthright. \u201cI shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term \u2018make the IRS whole\u2019\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities,\u201d Hill wrote in 2013. \u201cThe entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?! Who has made recompense for stealing, imposing, lying, murdering, criminalizing the traumatized, taking them against their wills, destroying their homes, dividing their communities, \u2018trying\u2019 to steal their destinies, their time, stagnating their development, I could go on and on.\u201d\n\nYou can doubt the basis of Snipes\u2019s theories, or dismiss Hill\u2019s insinuation that a phenomenally successful entertainer from above the Mason-Dixon Line is entitled to compensation for historical suffering. Even legitimate anti-tax activists can be questioned. Good-government types make long and articulate arguments that California\u2019s\u00a0Prop 13 (which capped increases in property taxes) produced anti-libertarian outcomes by favoring the landed classes and centralizing education budgeting in Sacramento. (California voters, on the other hand, like Prop 13 just fine and have consistently voted to expand its protections while defeating all attempts to roll back the law.) Gregory v. Helvering, though it produced a gem of tax wisdom, is also controversial. \u201cAny one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible,\u201d Judge Learned Hand wrote in a celebrated circuit court ruling. \u201cHe is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one\u2019s taxes.\u201d But even this chestnut sticks in the throats of pro-tax zealots who equate the non-crime of \u201ctax avoidance\u201d with the recognized crime of tax evasion and demonize \u201cBenedict Arnold CEOs\u201d for trying to minimize their tax hit.#ad#\n\nAll of these arguments proceed from a principle, however; and it appears to be the opposite of any principle MSNBC, or for that matter Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, stands for. NAN urges members to sign up for the Affordable Care Act and lobbies for increased student-loan subsidies. MSNBC wants government action to destroy mankind\u2019s primary source of energy and has made a long-term campaign of ending wealth inequality \u2014 and the network\u2019s preferred means toward that goal don\u2019t appear to include deregulation or ending the Federal Reserve. It is impossible to square any of these positions with not paying your taxes.\n\nThe inconsistencies in his position probably won\u2019t hurt Sharpton. His detractors are unlikely to be surprised, while his supporters are immune to evidence against him. An insatiable sponge and grifter who landed in a court battle with his psychic buddy Bishop Jordan and even ended up having \u201cfriends\u201d pay the defamation damages he owed, Sharpton isn\u2019t the ideal figurehead for a new tax rebellion either.\n\nThen again, history never gives us perfect heroes, and over the years American tax revolt has frequently mixed real ideological concerns with outright criminality. Leaders of the so-called Whiskey Rebellion in the 1790s were probing an important question: whether the Revolution\u2019s tongue-twisting slogan \u201cTaxation without representation is tyranny\u201d was a denunciation of public seizure of private property in most cases or merely an objection to being taxed while having no voice in Parliament. They opposed an excise that predominantly hit small, rustic westerners and was crafted by Alexander Hamilton with a sophistry worthy of Jonathan Gruber \u2014 featuring incentives for early compliance, breaks for big distillers and an overarching goal of consolidating and codifying a private industry. They lived in a region where George Washington owned vast tracts of speculative real estate and had a strong incentive both to scatter local owners and to make a public demonstration of federal power.\n\nBut they were also a dangerous mob. In his history The Whiskey Rebellion, William Hogeland describes the pseudonymous or composite character Tom the Tinker, a \u201cjoyously violent\u201d leader whose primary victims were not federal revenue agents but other distillers tempted to comply with the feds. \u201cYou might find a note posted on a tree outside your house, requiring you to publish in the Gazette your hatred of the whiskey tax and your commitment to the cause; otherwise, the note promised, your still would be mended,\u201d Hogeland writes. \u201cTom had a macabre sense of humor and a literary bent: \u2018mended\u2019 meant shot full of holes or burned.\u201d In his own published writings Tom \u201cwas always sorry to have been forced, by someone\u2019s waywardness, to pay a visit. But nobody was exempt from his service, he reminded his readers. He asked his victims to imagine his fires making the hills give light to the vales.\u201d\n\nIn The Whiskey Rebellion: Frontier Epilogue to the American Revolution, Thomas P. Slaughter goes further, describing the violent abuse of a tax collector by a group of tax rebels. After destroying his belongings and paperwork, the crowd forced him to \u201ccurse his commission of office,\u201d stamp on his own personal effects and denounce his government employers, before turning on him physically:\n\n\nThe crowd still was not content that the tax man, the excise, and state authority had met with sufficient humiliation. So, they cut the hair off one side of [William] Graham\u2019s head. They braided the other half in an unsightly and mocking manner, cut a hole in the cock of his hat, and fixed it sideways on his head with the pig-tail protruding from the hole. Then the mob exposed Graham to what were perhaps lewd \u201cmarks of ignominy.\u201d\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately for the tax collector, communal sport with him as victim was not yet over. Indeed, the mob dressed his horse \u201cin such a manner as to disfigure\u201d it, and then paraded Graham back and forth across the three frontier counties in which he was supposed to collect the excise. Celebrants gaily but purposefully forced Graham to trudge through the mud to stills he had intended to visit in his official capacity, halting at each for a raucous ceremony and a \u201ctreat\u201d of alcohol. At each stop they insulted Graham further and forced him to participate in the festivities.\n\n\nWith their veiled threats, mob agitation, mistreatment of interlopers and stentorian rhetoric, the tax rebels could almost be described as engaging in Sharptonian antics \u2014 with the important caveat that fewer people died in the Whiskey Rebellion than in just one of Sharpton\u2019s riots. Two or three rebels were killed in a shootout at the home of big distiller John Neville in 1794. Nobody was murdered, and the rebellion dispersed peacefully after a 13,000-man militia, led part of the way by President Washington himself, marched into western Pennsylvania to put the uprising down. By comparison, Sharpton\u2019s anti-Semitic 1995 protest against Freddie\u2019s Fashion Mart in Harlem ended when one of Sharpton\u2019s followers shot and killed seven innocent people before burning the store down.\n\nBut who knows? His 2013 book The Rejected Stone: Al Sharpton and the Path to American Leadership is an ode to Sharpton\u2019s many reinventions, from street-corner screamer to beloved elder statesman partying at the White House with Jay-Z and the president. Why not add \u201ctax rebel\u201d or even \u201cdoomsday prepper\u201d to his portfolio? These would at least be consistent with his actions, which have made Sharpton\u2019s contempt for the state\u2019s taxing authority absolutely clear.\n\nWelcome to the barricades, Rev.\n\n\u2014 Tim Cavanaugh is news editor of National Review Online.

Some were outlaws, some were lawful. Some gave all, all gave some; but none wanted to give at all. They were Americans who dared to stand against the infinite rapacity of government. Their victories were slight and fleeting; their defeats harsh and punishing. But their names come down to us with honor, and now one of those names is Al Sharpton.\n\nThe tale of his millions of dollars in unpaid taxes is, like many things about Sharpton, hair-raising. It would cause MSNBC to cancel Sharpton\u2019s show, were the Lean Forward network inclined to hold its on-air talent to any standards of intellectual honesty or personal bearing. But there can be no doubt: For sheer rebel-yelling, law-nullifying, sovereign-citizen opposition to big government, the tea party (not just what Sharpton calls the \u201cracist and homophobic\u201d modern version but the Boston Harbor originals) has nothing on Al Sharpton.\n\nThe author of the 1996 memoir Go Tell Pharaoh and the 2003 presidential campaign trial balloon Al On America tells the New York Times he is working to pay down some of his $4.5 million in state and federal liens for unpaid taxes. There is not much evidence to support this claim (the newspaper points out that his debt to the state of New York has actually increased in recent years), and Sharpton\u2019s apparent attempt to position himself as an unwitting tax rebel just won\u2019t fly. Every tax deadbeat is a de facto tax protester.#ad#\n\nPersonal tax shirkers like Sharpton are indeed more direct in their attack on the state than lawful protesters such as Jarvis (creator of California\u2019s 1978 Proposition 13 and spiritual head of the anti-tax movement that was crucial to Ronald Reagan\u2019s election) and Gregory (whose landmark 1935 case Gregory v. Helvering turned on the right to minimize income-tax liability). Law-abiding political and legal foes of excessive taxes (who are included here not to disparage them but to make Sharpton\u2019s Rothbardian view of the state more clear) merely argue for justice. Tax evaders engage in real civil, or criminal, disobedience, attempting to deprive the state of access to their personal property \u2014 which (in the state\u2019s view) rightfully belongs to the state.\n\nSo Sharpton, a Baptist clergyman who claims to have been first ordained in a Pentecostal church at the age of 10, is not just looking for ways to skate on his public (and less forgivably, private) bills. He is laying claim to a history that includes the original cause of American independence and characters as vivid as Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher whose 20-year dispute over payments to the federal government flared into an armed standoff in the Silver State this spring. Since before there was a United States of America, Americans have been refusing to give their property to the government.\n\nIt is unclear how much pride Sharpton takes in having established his anarcho-capitalist credentials \u2014 though with the Rev it\u2019s always smart to assume he feels a great deal of pride about everything he does. The squalid circumstances that the Grey Lady insists on reporting in detail are of a type most grown men would be ashamed to own. Russ Buettner reports how Sharpton faced financial challenges after a court ordered him to pay damages to a government official Sharpton defamed during his Tawana Brawley rape hoax:\n\n\nHe said he did not have enough money to pay all at once, and after years of a slow trickle of money from wage garnishments, Mr. Sharpton was forced to testify under oath about his finances.\n\nHe said he had no assets, save for a watch and a ring.
