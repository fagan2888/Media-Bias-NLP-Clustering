Instead, this former European Capital of Culture is now widely regarded as one of Britain\u2019s most lively and stylish urban destinations. It boasts the best shopping experience in the U.K. outside of London and is home to a variety of annual festivals celebrating everything from rock music and comedy to literature and the arts.\n\nOnce regarded as \u201cThe Second City of the British Empire,\u201d it remains a well-preserved example of Victorian excess and enlightenment, offering numerous museums and art galleries, of which more than 20 are free to visit.\n\nThe city is easy to get around. Many of the attractions are within walking distance of each other or can be reached by the city\u2019s unique subway system known fondly as the Clockwork Orange. Opened in 1896, it is the third-oldest metro system in the world after London and Budapest, and has only one circle line serving 15 stations, with a train every four minutes at peak times.\n\nCITY CENTER\n\nThe streets of this 800-year-old city are paved with history built upon the profits of shipbuilding, Caribbean sugar and American tobacco and cotton.\n\nGlasgow was designated U.K. City of Architecture and Design in 1999, and even a brief walk through its streets will reveal the legacy of renowned architects and designers, such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Alexander \u201cGreek\u201d Thomson among others.\n\nNumerous monuments and statues honor leading scientists, inventors, poets, politicians and war heroes throughout the city. The most popular is that of the Duke of Wellington outside the Gallery of Modern Art, but the statue is rarely seen without a traffic cone on its head. What started as a joke by students more than 40 years ago is now an almost permanent symbol of Glaswegian humor. When the city council tried to raise the statue higher to stop the prank, a public protest attracted tens of thousands of supporters calling for the cone to stay.\n\nRIVERSIDE MUSEUM\n\nOne of the most modern city attractions is the Riverside Museum on the banks of the Clyde.\n\nDesigned by Zaha Hadid, this iconic building, which was voted 2013 European Museum of the Year, has more than 3,000 exhibits showcasing a variety of \u201cClyde-built\u201d trams, trains and cars \u2014 built when the waterfront was home to a major industrial center. The museum also includes three reconstructed streets showing Glasgow as it would have been between 1895 and 1930.\n\nVisitors are encouraged to climb aboard many of the exhibits, including the U.K.\u2019s only floating Clyde-built sailing ship, which is permanently moored outside the museum.\n\nHUNTERIAN MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY\n\nThe Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery at the University of Glasgow is the oldest museum in Scotland, dating back more than 200 years.\n\nUsed extensively for academic research but also open to the public, the collection features a host of artifacts ranging from an entire section of the wall built by Romans in Scotland in the second century to scientific instruments used by some of the world\u2019s greatest scientists and objects from Captain Cook\u2019s voyage across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Art Gallery is home to one of the world\u2019s greatest collections of work by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, including the reassembled interior of his former Glasgow home. It also houses paintings by famous artists such as George Stubbs and James McNeill Whistler.\n\nNECROPOLIS\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind something a little more macabre, the Necropolis is well worth a wander.\n\nRegarded as one of the most significant cemeteries in Europe, the immense Victorian monument garden covers 37 acres overlooked by Glasgow Cathedral. It provides a stunning elevated view of the city. As the final resting place of more than 50,000 people \u2014 many of them notable \u2014 it boasts amazing stories and gothic monuments. Well-informed volunteer guides offer free walking tours, or visitors may explore on their own.\n\nBOTANIC GARDENS\n\nFounded initially in 1817, the internationally renowned Botanic Gardens in the heart of the West End of Glasgow provides an oasis of calm and respite.\n\nExplore more than 50 acres of formal gardens, woodland walks and architecturally impressive glasshouses filled with an array of temperate and tropical plants from around the world. Open from 7 a.m. to dusk every day, the gardens, with free admission, are within a walking distance of Byers Road, a vibrant and cosmopolitan area of the city, with cafes, bars and some of Glasgow\u2019s most popular restaurants.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "5 for free: Glasgow, Scotland, has gardens, museums", "title": "5 for free: Glasgow, Scotland, has gardens, museums", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/15/5-for-free-glasgow-scotland-has-gardens-museums/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140515__20140518_E9_TR185FREEGLASGOWp2.jpg", "height": 549}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140515__20140518_E9_TR185FREEGLASGOWp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T16:48:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:10:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b1b\"", "article_summary": "GLASGOW, scotland \u2014 The image of Scotland\u2019s largest city as a hard and dirty industrial center is long gone.\nHUNTERIAN MUSEUM AND ART GALLERYThe Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery at the University of Glasgow is the oldest museum in Scotland, dating back more than 200 years.\nThe Art Gallery is home to one of the world\u2019s greatest collections of work by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, including the reassembled interior of his former Glasgow home.\nThe museum also includes three reconstructed streets showing Glasgow as it would have been between 1895 and 1930.\nBOTANIC GARDENSFounded initially in 1817, the internationally renowned Botanic Gardens in the heart of the West End of Glasgow provides an oasis of calm and respite."}
