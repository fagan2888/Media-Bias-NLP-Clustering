The Eggplant, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nFor some people, hunger is an inconvenience, a slight bother. For others, it\u2019s an all-consuming distraction, which makes accomplishing other tasks improbable and responding peaceably to other people impossible. Now, a new study from Plymouth University\u2019s Cognition Institute suggests the simple act of playing Tetris can stop food cravings in their tracks.\n\nHunger is indeed a biological response: We feel hungry because the hormone ghrelin is in short supply, alerting our brains that our stomach needs nutrients. But even though our stomachs are the ones making noise, it\u2019s really our brains that tell us whether we should eat or not. After all, it\u2019s the signals in our brain that motivate action. And since we humans have a limited amount of attention we can devote to a particular emotion or sensation, in this case, having too much fun makes us forget we\u2019re hungry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to really want to eat or make love, if that\u2019s possible right now,\u201d David Kavanagh of Queensland University of Technology, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study, told Discovery News. \u201cBut it\u2019s a torture if you can\u2019t. So, if we can help people deal with craving \u2014 blunt it a bit, or give them some time out \u2014 it can not only help them stay in control, but it may make them feel a bit better as well.\u201d\n\nAs the research team points out, Tetris\u2019 effects aren\u2019t limited specifically to food cravings, and likewise, Tetris isn\u2019t the only highly demanding, fun task that can suppress cravings. But the effect of craving reduction, be it sex or food or smoking, is characterized by one overarching principle, which the team has dubbed their Elaborated Intrusion Theory (EIT).\n\nWhat\u2019s Going On Up There?\n\nBasically, the human brain can only concentrate on select number of stimuli at a given time, and often, just one. Recall the Three Stooges trying to squeeze through a tiny door all at the same time. None can get in because they\u2019re all wedged between the other two. The same relative process happens when you\u2019re confronted with multiple cognitive tasks. Your brain may receive ghrelin\u2019s signals, which tell you you\u2019re hungry, but when a storm of brightly colored shapes needs to be oriented in a certain way, and in a certain amount of time, hunger slides to the back burner. Fundamentally, EIT suggests that desire can be actively controlled by the presence of intruding imagery.\n\nTo conduct their study, the team recruited subjects to either play a game of Tetris or sit in front of a computer loading screen. Experimenters took note of the subjects\u2019 natural cravings (that is, without the influence of food present) before and after their assigned task. Those who played Tetris reported cravings that were 24 percent weaker compared to the other group, suggesting to the team that EIT was at play. Subjects were forced to picture the incoming shapes, which made less \u201croom\u201d for the images of food they\u2019d held before. Essentially, their brains were too busy to be hungry.\n\nIn reality, this seems backward. Normally it\u2019s when we\u2019re hungry that we can\u2019t concentrate on what it is we should be doing. \u201cWhat this and some other recent studies do, is flip this around,\u201d Kavanagh explained. \u201cIf craving interferes with other tasks, what about using other tasks to interfere with craving? And if craving is linked to imagery, what about using another task that requires similar limited cognitive space \u2014 like this game.\"\n\nPrior research has upheld this phenomenon, such as a 2009 study conducted by Plymouth researcher Jackie Andrade. Andrade found that doodling \u2014 the aimless, freeform scribbling that otherwise seems like written daydreaming \u2014 actually improves people\u2019s ability to concentrate. Andrade\u2019s study showed that people taking information over the phone were 29 percent better at recalling that info when they doodled in the process.\n\nDaydreaming, like hunger pangs in the latest study, served as the distracting image. So when another process stood in, distraction abated and performance soared \u2014 just something to think about the next time hunger strikes and food is nowhere to be found. \u201cThis study is important,\u201d Kavanagh remarked, \u201cin that it uses desires that are just naturally occurring, and shows that the idea still works.\u201d\n\nSource: Skorka-Brown J, Andrade J, May J.
