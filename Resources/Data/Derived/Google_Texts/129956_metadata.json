According to Yahoo, Vice President Joe Biden talked with CNN about the events following his diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIf Beau resigns, there\u2019s nothing to fall back on,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI said, \u2018But I worked it out. Jill and I will sell the house. We\u2019ll be in good shape.'\u201d\n\nIt was then while Joe Biden and President Obama were eating that Obama cut in.\n\nSo Much for Obamacare \u2013 Joe Biden Says He Almost Lost His Home During Son\u2019s Illness https://t.co/42fK8c73io pic.twitter.com/WHCNXkfqkx \u2014 Say No to the TPP (@kencampbell66) January 12, 2016\n\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t sell that house. Promise me you won\u2019t sell the house. \u2026 I\u2019ll give you the money. Whatever you need, I\u2019ll give you the money. Don\u2019t, Joe. Promise me.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a special bond between these two men that act as an example to Americans and people everywhere. Obviously, Joe Biden was battling with the emotional rigors of losing a son, and he made sure to let Obama know how he was doing every day.\n\n\u201cHe was the only guy other than my family I confided [with] all along in everything that was going on with Beau, because I felt a responsibility to do that so that he knew where I was \u2014 my thinking,\u201d he said.\n\nBeau was posthumously awarded The Albert Schweitzer Leadership Award in November of 2015, and Obama made sure to emphasize the character of Joe Biden\u2019s son as he gave the eulogy speech during the funeral.\n\nJoe Biden says Obama offered to personally give him money to help out when the vice president's son became sick https://t.co/oEsQkZw7kb \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) January 12, 2016\n\nCNN reported on the speech last June, where Obama said \u201cBeau Biden brought to his work a mighty heart, he brought to his family a mighty heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeau Biden was an original. He was a good man, a man of character, a man who loved deeply and was loved in return.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe, you are my brother, and I am grateful every day you have got such a big heart, and a big soul, and those broad shoulders. I could not admire you more,\u201d Obama said as he looked directly at his friend and running partner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the eulogy he delivered for Beau,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBecause of his son\u2019s death, Joe Biden decided to not run for president in 2016, even though he very much wanted to.\n\n\u201cThere is no timeline for the grieving process,\u201d Biden said last fall. \u201cThe process doesn\u2019t respect or much care about things like filing deadlines or debates and primaries and caucuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the family and I have worked through the grieving process, I\u2019ve said all along what I\u2019ve said time and again to others: that it may very well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president. That it might close. I\u2019ve concluded it has closed.\u201d\n\nTonight, President Obama gives his last state of the union address. It will be a much different speech than most, focusing more on his own legacy and how optimistic he is for the future.\n\nJust checked in with @POTUS \u2026 you're not going to want to miss tonight's speech at 9p ET. Should be pretty sweet: https://t.co/5IUcMtBsiP \u2014 Denis McDonough (@Denis44) January 12, 2016\n\nWhen President Obama leaves the White House this year, it\u2019s a certainty that he and Joe Biden will remain close for the rest of their lives.\n\n[Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joe Biden is no stranger to tragedy, and as his son Beau fought brain cancer at 46, President Obama offered the Vice President financial help.
