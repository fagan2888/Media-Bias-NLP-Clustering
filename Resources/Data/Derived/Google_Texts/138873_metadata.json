The 57-year-old, who suffers from kidney disease drummer, has played with some the greats including Koko Taylor, Otis Rush and Mighty Joe Young.\n\n\"Dr. Dan has helped me in every way possible,\" he said. \"Medical, financial and spiritual. Any way he can find to help you, he will.\"\n\nJones added that \"I hear a lot of people say 'we have to save the blues music' but Dr. Dan says 'Hell, we have to save the blues musicians.\"\n\nThe group tends to consist of mostly middle-aged African-Americans who wait until the last minute to deal with their health issues. Many end up spending whatever modest nest-eggs they have on serious health problems.\n\nOr they just die.\n\n\"Most of them didn't have any coverage at all and no burning desire to get it,\" said Marty Salzman, a Chicago attorney who has managed legends including Buddy Guy and the late Junior Wells. \"When they get sick, they end up in trouble and with very few exceptions, they eat only greasy, fatty foods. And they drink too much and smoke too much.\"\n\nFurther, he added, \"they have very little motivation to want to change their habits unless a guy like Dr. Dan can straighten them out by putting the fear of God \u2013 or death -- into them.\"\n\nThe numbers are pretty grim. According to a 2013 study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 26% of African-American adults have no health coverage at all, as compared to 15% of the white population. (The rates of non-coverage are even higher for Hispanics and American Indians).\n\n\"People of color face persistent and significant disparities in health coverage that contribute to poorer health access and outcomes and unnecessary costs,\" the report noted.\n\nAccording to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African-Americans have lower life expectancies and higher incidences of maladies including cancer, heart disease and diabetes than other races in the U.S. While the gap has gradually been narrowing and the Affordable Care Act has potential for cutting it further, it remains stark.\n\nIvankovich and some other medical colleagues are hoping to change that.\n\nDr. Janice Johnston is a family physician in Phoenix and a board member of the Memphis-based Blues Foundation.\n\n\"We try to help blues musicians and their families with medical expenses and funeral expenses,\" she said. Part of that involves urging preventative care and helping people work through a confusing maze of varying costs so they get the most for their money.\n\nFor instance, she noted that an MRI at a hospital might run $3,000 while one performed at a free-standing facility could be as little as $400.\n\nToo often Johnston said, \"if you have to pay cash and don't pay right away, you will end up paying twice as much.\"\n\nShe helps sponsor \"outreach events\" at various blues festivals, urging musicians to get screened for diabetes, cholesterol levels and other warning signs.\n\n\"We want to reach them prior to their having a crisis,\" she said. \"Recognizing diabetes early could mean not spending tens of thousands of dollars on care.\"\n\nFor Ivankovich, who came to Chicago as a five-year-old, it's about trying to bring an up note to the Chicago blues community.\n\n\"Growing up here as an immigrant, I see a part of the city most people never see,\" he said. \"The Blues has done a lot for Chicago, like bringing in tourism. That was built on the backs of these musicians and very little ever comes back to them.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1EdmrUQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "CHICAGO \u2013 Blues are the best medicine: musician, surgeon helps Chicago's aging blues stars", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "CHICAGO \u2013 Blues are the best medicine: musician, surgeon helps Chicago's aging blues stars", "title": "In Chicago, a spoon full of blues help the medicine go down", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/15/blues-medical-doctor-dan-health/23389379/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CHICAGO \u2013 Blues are the best medicine: musician, surgeon helps Chicago's aging blues stars", "title": "In Chicago, a spoon full of blues help the medicine go down", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6680326e47287fe4d3e3c928f2dd0deae3c4c4bf/c=0-0-1360-1360&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Diabetes", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Diabetes", "title": "In Chicago, a spoon full of blues help the medicine go down", "author": "William Spain, Special for USA TODAY", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2bec4d5e118117c75caf8d724387e371193bf875/c=0-0-1360-1813/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eea059fccd9845d3e4e652527509e5be7de591e2/c=0-0-1360-1360/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ececd368a3c1d6887baec68a8b63d9dcd559a8c8/c=0-0-1360-1023/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4820a3c9e2bcba7531e39d28ec38cca14ace2b88/c=0-100-1360-868&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-15T15:24:48.467000-05:00", "shorthed": "Surgeon helps Chicago's aging blues stars", "articleid": 23389379, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c4d1b50eea87c4a750507d71accbb698c1bdf53e/c=0-100-1360-868/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b4a88ecd8aea8791453afb12d178c21402a1a31/c=109-0-1256-2048/local/-/media/2015/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635594582114851505-drdan2.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Dr. Daniel \"Chicago Slim\" Ivankovich jamming with the Chicago Blues All-Stars (Photo: Aaron Porter)CHICAGO \u2013Few things give Daniel Ivankovich more satisfaction than responding to what might be called \"Code Blues.\"\nFor Ivankovich, who came to Chicago as a five-year-old, it's about trying to bring an up note to the Chicago blues community.\nBrian Jones is the drummer for the Chicago Blues All-Stars.\n\"That was a very, very dark time for me, but the solution was blues music,\" he said.\nJones added that \"I hear a lot of people say 'we have to save the blues music' but Dr. Dan says 'Hell, we have to save the blues musicians.\""}
