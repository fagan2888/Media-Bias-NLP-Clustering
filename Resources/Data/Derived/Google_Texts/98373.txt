Submit photos for the Inspiration Gallery 2016

Taking photos of your events may be second nature or perhaps a last-minute thought. Maybe you receive photos to help market your business from partner photographers or brides. Any of these photos represent not only the work you do, but the ideas your company comes up with on a daily basis.

Now is the time to begin collecting these types of photos of your best event to submit to Rental Management for consideration to be part of the Inspiration Gallery 2016.

Events selected will be featured at The Rental Show 2016, on display for those attending the American Rental Associationâ€™s 60th anniversary celebration at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta on Feb. 21-24, as well as during the Events & Tents workshop scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 20, 2016.

The Inspiration Gallery is a way to showcase event ideas, with a collection of images from event rental stores. Each year, the gallery portrays a snapshot of what party and event rental companies accomplish each year, from small, intimate weddings to large-scale galas and festivals, including tabletop designs, tented events and draped venues.

If you are proud of your work and what you and your staff members were able to pull off, send in your best photo and a description to be considered for the Inspiration Gallery 2016.

Submissions should have a vertical, 300-dpi photo in jpg format, about 8 in. by 10 in. in size and a description including:
