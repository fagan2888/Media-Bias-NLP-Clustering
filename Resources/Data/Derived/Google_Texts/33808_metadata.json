(See story.)\n\nKarmanos growth plans\n\nIn the 15 months since the merger took place \u2014 using $78 million pledged by McLaren as part of the acquisition \u2014 Karmanos has been hiring cancer researchers, renovating operations and completing plans on inpatient and outpatient expansions, said Gerold Bepler, M.D., CEO of the National Cancer Institute-accredited institute.\n\n\n\nAt least $20 million will be used for research to hire scientists and their teams, Bepler said. So far, Karmanos has hired four scientists and plans to hire 16 more, along with several dozen senior or midlevel investigators and technicians.\n\n\n\nDuring the past year, Karmanos also more than doubled the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials, to 211 during 2014 from 90 in 2013.\n\n\n\nKarmanos plans to add three clinical trials this year to 19 underway to capitalize on the greater patient access. In addition, the institute supports more than 700 cancer research programs with Wayne State University.\n\n\n\nBepler said Karmanos also has upgraded equipment and renovated its infusion center and inpatient clinics.\n\n\n\n\"At the end of the year, we plan to look at our ambulatory network\" in Southeast Michigan, he said. Karmanos has two outpatient centers in Farmington Hills and a joint venture in Monroe.\n\n\n\nTo provide uniformity, Bepler said, Karmanos has been certifying each McLaren hospital cancer center in Karmanos' treatment protocols, quality-of-care index and more than 350 common care plans. McLaren also is developing a common electronic health record for oncology, working with Elekta Ltd. and its software called Mosaiq.\n\n\n\n\n\nInflux of outpatient care\n\nAs technology and screening improve, cancer care is moving more into the outpatient arena, said Theodore Lawrence, M.D., director of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\n\nUM, which operates more than 40 outpatient centers, recently opened satellites with cancer services in Brighton and Northville to expand its reach closer to Detroit as well as west of Ann Arbor, Lawrence said.\n\n\n\n\"The strategy of seeing more inpatients in Ann Arbor is not going to happen,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor example, UM outpatient visits have increased at an average 3 percent clip annually in the past decade and totaled 102,300 in 2014. In 2000, that number was 56,800.\n\n\n\nAs part of its expansion, UM has created a statewide radiation oncology network with affiliations with MidMichigan Health in Midland and Traverse City-based Munson Medical Center to collaborate on all cancer programs.\n\n\n\n\"We have been trying harder to form more partnerships statewide for at least the last five years,\" said Lawrence, a radiation oncologist who took over the cancer center this year. \"I do want to accelerate this, anything we can do with cancer consistent with the health system's overall strategy.\"\n\n\n\nAt MidMichigan, for example, \"We attend tumor boards with them, conduct genetic counseling, do video conferences and collaborate on quality initiatives,\" Lawrence said. \"A small fraction of their patients come here for consultation, and we do their bone marrow or liver transplants.\"\n\n\n\nThe UM network also includes community affiliations with seven hospitals to co-manage radiation oncology programs. UM specialists coordinate care and, in some cases, refer to the cancer center, he said.\n\n\n\nThe hospitals are Allegiance Health, Jackson; Alpena Cancer Center; McLaren Greater Lansing; Metro Health Village, Wyoming; Providence Assarian Cancer Center, Novi; Providence Cancer Center, Southfield; and VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System.\n\nBeaumont's cancer plan\n\nDavid Wood, M.D., Beaumont's chief medical officer, said Karmanos will help improve McLaren's cancer services and increase care coordination within the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. John's cancer plans\n\nBob Hoban, St. John Providence's senior vice president of strategy and centers of excellence, said that historically, St. John hasn't competed with Karmanos.\n\n\n\n\"We compete a little bit with McLaren\" in Mt. Clemens, Hoban said. \"So far, we haven't seen any strong moves by Macomb in the cancer area.\"\n\n\n\nLast year, St. John's six cancer centers and nine infusion centers had 4,000 new cancer cases generating $160 million in net revenue, an amount that has been increasing over the past several years, Hoban said.\n\n\n\nSt. John's outpatient cases grew 10 percent last year, with inpatient behind at a 3 percent growth rate, he said.\n\n\n\nTo enhance cancer screening, another new emphasis for St. John is genetic therapy. The health system has hired two geneticists and a genetic counselor. It also recently began a molecular pathology program to provide laboratory support to identify specific mutations in cancer tumors.\n\n\n\n\"This is a major growth area,\" Hoban said.\n\n\n\nHoban also said the St. John system is standardizing protocols through the St. John Providence Oncology Network to treat patients in consistent ways using best clinical practices and multidisciplinary teams.\n\n\n\nOne of St. John Providence's new areas of emphasis in cancer care has been developing the program under contract at Crittenton Hospital Medical Center. Last year, St. John took over Crittenton's program.\n\n\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325.
