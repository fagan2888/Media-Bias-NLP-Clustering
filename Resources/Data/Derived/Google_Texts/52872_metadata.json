They are credited with stopping an attack on board a train bound for Paris, Aug. 21, 2015.\n\nRelatives of the three Americans who tackled and disarmed a gunman on a European train say they are proud of the men and relieved they weren't killed during those chaotic moments onboard a high-speed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.\n\nTony Sadler says his son, Anthony Sadler, called him to tell him what happened. He says he was stunned and then relieved his 23-year-old son was not injured or killed.\n\nSadler and two Sacramento-area friends, Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos, helped subdue the man carrying a handgun and an assault rifle.\n\nThe gunman slashed Stone several times with a box cutter. His mother, Joyce Eskel, tells the San Francisco Chronicle her son called her from the hospital and told her that the gunman also tried to shoot him twice but the weapon didn't work.\n\nEskel says \"he's always been a hero to me. Now he's an actual hero.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Relatives of the three Americans who tackled and disarmed a gunman on a European train say they are proud of the men and relieved they weren't killed during those chaotic moments onboard a high-speed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Relatives-proud-of-3-Americans-who-subdued-gunman-on-train-322603732.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/france+train+heroes.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Relatives of the three Americans who tackled and disarmed a gunman on a European train say they are proud of the men and relieved they weren't killed during those chaotic moments onboard a high-speed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.", "title": "Relatives proud of 3 Americans who subdued gunman on train"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Relatives of the three Americans who tackled and disarmed a gunman on a European train say they are proud of the men and relieved they weren't killed during those chaotic moments onboard a high-speed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.", "title": "Relatives proud of 3 Americans who subdued gunman on train", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/national/headlines/Relatives-proud-of-3-Americans-who-subdued-gunman-on-train-322603732.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/france+train+heroes.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Relatives proud of 3 Americans who subdued gunman on train", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Relatives proud of 3 Americans, who subdued gunman on train"}, "article_summary": "Relatives of the three Americans who tackled and disarmed a gunman on a European train say they are proud of the men and relieved they weren't killed during those chaotic moments onboard a high-speed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.\nSadler and two Sacramento-area friends, Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos, helped subdue the man carrying a handgun and an assault rifle.\n(L-R) Undated photos of Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler.\nThey are credited with stopping an attack on board a train bound for Paris, Aug. 21, 2015.\nTony Sadler says his son, Anthony Sadler, called him to tell him what happened."}
