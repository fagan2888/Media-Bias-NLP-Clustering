Northern Colorado will get the higher totals, he said.\n\nAnother wave of snow on Wednesday will bring 3 to 6 inches of snow to the high country, he said.\n\nThat is on top of generous snowfall amounts over the weekend, when up to 21 inches of new powder fell in Routt County. Winter Park received 8 inches and Crested Butte received 19 inches of new snow over the weekend, Kalina said.\n\nThe Denver metro area could get a dusting of new snow Tuesday morning with no measurable amounts of accumulation, he said.\n\nThe high temperature will drop to 43 degrees on Tuesday and it will remain in the 40s until Friday, when the high temperature is expected to rise to the 50s again.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or @kirkmitchell or denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mild weather in Denver; mountains to get more snow", "title": "Mild weather in Denver; mountains to get more snow", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/mild-weather-in-denver-mountains-to-get-more-snow/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160118__CD16FEATURES_BL26772xp1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160118__CD16FEATURES_BL26772xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-18T06:56:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:13:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The high temperature will drop to 43 degrees on Tuesday and it will remain in the 40s until Friday, when the high temperature is expected to rise to the 50s again.\nDenver will be cloudy and mild with the high temperature climbing above 50 degrees Monday.\nIt should also be a pretty nice evening in the mountains for an altogether different reason: more snow expected for ski resorts.\n\u201cIt should be a pretty nice day,\u201d said Jim Kalina, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.\nWinter Park received 8 inches and Crested Butte received 19 inches of new snow over the weekend, Kalina said."}
