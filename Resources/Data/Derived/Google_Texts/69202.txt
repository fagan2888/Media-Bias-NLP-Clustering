Watch President Obama's Interview with YouTube creators live on Thursday, January 22 at 5:00 p.m. ET on WhiteHouse.gov/Live and YouTube.com/WhiteHouse.

Every year since 2010, we’ve invited people around the country to ask President Obama their questions after his State of the Union address. You’ve asked about everything from the economy, to immigration reform, to the Affordable Care Act... and even suggestions on baby names.

After President Obama addresses the nation on Tuesday, January 20, he’s once again turning to YouTube to discuss the policies laid out in the speech and answer your questions. This continues efforts by the President and his administration to speak directly to the American people online, and we're always looking for new ways to do just that.

That's why, this year, we’re trying something a little different:

We’re inviting a handful of YouTube creators to the White House to talk with the President in person, and you can watch it all live on Thursday, January 22. YouTube creators Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank Green will interview President Obama about the issues care they most about and what they’re hearing from their audiences.

What do you want the creators to ask the President? Follow the White House on YouTube, then use #YouTubeAsksObama on your social media channels -- some of your questions may be asked during the interview.

Make sure you tune in to our enhanced State of the Union on January 20 at 9 p.m. ET. Start asking your questions now, and then watch the YouTube interview live at 5p.m. ET on Thursday, January 22 to find out if your questions were asked.
