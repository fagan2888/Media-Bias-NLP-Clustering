Taliban Leader Who Orchestrated Pakistani School Attack Makes Fresh Threats A student from Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan, is led by aid workers after the Dec. 16 attack by members of Taliban-Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTTP). Screen shot from NBC News The top-ranking leader of the Taliban faction that claimed responsibility for last month’s mass slaughter of 153 people, many of them children, at the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan, has taken to the Internet to warn that his group is prepared to strike again. On Tuesday, word emerged that Taliban-Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTTP) chief Maulana Fazlullah had issued a 12-minute video in which he threatened the lives of more children of military officers in retaliation for attacks on his group, as NBC News reported that day: “Every action has a reaction. Killing of people or shedding blood is not our wish but if you target our people irrespective of their age, then we would also hit your people. You killed many of our prisoners and remember we would not spare you‎,” he said. —Posted by Kasia Anderson More Below the Ad Advertisement Square, Site wide Get truth delivered to
