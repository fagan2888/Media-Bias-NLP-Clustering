Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that \u201ca treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.\u201d\n\nDue to Sovaldi\u2019s $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid programs had already announced that they\u2019re funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California\u2019s is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is \u201cencouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.\n\nHealth insurer WellPoint (WLP) chimed in Friday with concerns about new hepatitis C drug costs, said executive Ken Goulet.\n\nBiotech Stocks Cheaper\n\nGilead\u2019s (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.\n\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), whose sole drug, Soliris, goes for upward of $400,000 a year, tumbled 8%. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which also sells an expensive hepatitis C drug called Incivek, retreated 5%.\n\nBiogen Idec (BIIB), which has a costly multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, lost 8%.\n\nIBD\u2019s top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 4.5%.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV), which will likely come out with a rival and possibly cheaper rival to Sovaldi later this year, initially rallied Friday, but closed down a fraction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Gilead caught a cold and the rest of the market caught pneumonia,\u201d said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Opportunity Fund .\n\nSovaldi A Bargain?\n\nAnalysts, for the most part, advised staying calm. Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that \u201cpricing discussions could generate headline \u2018concern,\u2019 but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they\u2019re curing patients and improving society. \u2026 HCV is an important public health issue (like HIV was) and validates the significance of this market.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a client note that she\u2019d spoken to Gilead officials and they were already making their case that Sovaldi is actually a bargain.\n\n\u201cA liver transplant related to HCV costs up to $250,000 and another $50,000 each year for meds so that the person does not reject the liver,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGilead has co-pay programs in place (in which) the out-of-pocket cost is as low as $5.\u201d\n\nISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex\u2019s Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year. Sovaldi\u2019s cure rate is also much higher than Incivek\u2019s, so the cost \u201cper cure\u201d is even better, he said in a webinar Friday.\n\nDems Seek \u2018Public Shaming\u2019\n\nSchoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a \u201cpublic shaming\u201d not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.\n\n\u201cThis letter is a \u2018bank shot\u2019 that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi,\u201d Haines wrote.\n\nSuch a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a large nonprofit with a history of criticizing Gilead over its HIV drug pricing, recently turned its fire on Sovaldi.\n\n\u201cGilead\u2019s latest display of out-of-touch greed comes on the heels of the company\u2019s January pricing its new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), at $1,000 per pill \u2026 1,100% more than Gilead\u2019s most expensive AIDS drug, Stribild,\u201d the AHF said in a Feb. 4 press release.\n\nAll this has played out as biotech stocks have hit a lull the last few weeks, after a bull run not seen since the 1990s, leading some to fear that the party may be over. Vandeventer says that while biotechs are a \u201chigh beta group,\u201d this is probably just a correction. After all, he points out, drug prices have been a political football since the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be completely unexpected that these kinds of issues come to the fore periodically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of investing in health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Biotech stocks sold off hard Friday as Wall Street blamed a letter by several House Democrats asking Gilead Sciences to justify the price of its hepatitis C", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Biotech stocks sold off hard Friday as Wall Street blamed a letter by several House Democrats asking Gilead Sciences to justify the price of its hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi.
