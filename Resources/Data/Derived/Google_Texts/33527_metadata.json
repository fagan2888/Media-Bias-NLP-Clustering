Still reeling from recent mine shutdowns, the state legislature has set aside Jan. 31 as a \u201cday of prayer for coal miners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a higher power to change the hearts and minds of those who want to destroy Appalachia.\u201d\u2014Roger Horton, Citizens for Coal\n\nOn Sunday, a congregation of pastors, businessmen, and lawmakers will seek divine intervention in one of the nation\u2019s hardest-hit coal economies. Doubtless, though, many will ask for deliverance from what they consider a man-made crisis.\n\n\u201cWest Virginia\u2019s absolutely in dire straits,\u201d Roger Horton, president of Citizens for Coal, the organization that spearheaded the prayer effort, said in an interview Wednesday with The Daily Signal. \u201cThe point we\u2019re trying to stress is that we need a higher power to change the hearts and minds of those who want to destroy Appalachia.\u201d\n\nThe legislators and businessmen who gathered at the 43rd annual West Virginia Coal Symposium here seem to agree and likely will pray that God change Washington.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the problem comes from President Obama and his EPA\u2019s war on coal,\u201d state Senate President Bill Cole, a Republican, told The Daily Signal.\n\nCole, who also serves as lieutenant governor and is running for governor, argues that the increased cost of new regulations has priced coal out of the market, persuading consumers to use other energy sources and pushing miners out of their jobs.\n\nAn Avalanche of Layoffs\n\nWhether he\u2019s right or not, there\u2019s plenty to pray about in the Mountain State.\n\nThe first three weeks of January witnessed an avalanche of layoffs, leaving almost 2,000 coal miners permanently out of work by some estimates. And just recently, one of the largest producers in the state, the now bankrupt Alpha Natural Resources, announced its own bad news. In July, the company will cut another 900 jobs.\n\nBut even as the boom in natural gas continues to put new pressure on coal, many West Virginians blame government regulation, not the market, for the downturn.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the past seven years have brought new regulations on coal mining and, critics say, a host of new costs. Now the industry is bracing for the latest and most sweeping regulation issued unilaterally by the EPA: the Clean Power Plan.\n\nThe rule requires states to cut carbon emissions by 32 percent before 2030 and gives them until Sept. 6 to submit their plans to do it.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan is a key component of Obama\u2019s effort to execute the global climate agenda struck last month in Paris. Proponents say the international compact will substantially clean up the environment by encouraging renewable fuels. Opponents say it will bankrupt the coal industry by imposing new regulations.\n\n\u201cWhen coal goes away, it\u2019s devastation and poverty in the worst form,\u201d @BillColeWV says.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cole told The Daily Signal that communities in his district are still recovering from existing rules.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve closed down power plant after power plant and destroyed our own market for coal,\u201d the Senate president and lieutenant governor said. \u201cWhen you get into those southern coal communities, when coal goes away, it\u2019s devastation and poverty in the worst form.\u201d\n\nFates Intertwined\n\nCole points to the \u201cghost towns\u201d in West Virginia\u2019s McDowell County. Once the leading coal-producing region in the nation, the county ranks as one of the poorest in the country. Without mining, the median household income peaks just above $22,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just individual counties that are hurting. The coal market is tightly intertwined with West Virginia\u2019s financial health. Fossil fuel provides more than half of the government\u2019s business income tax and adds billions to the state\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIn recent years, as the coal market shifted, West Virginia lost its footing further. The Associated Press reports that the state expects a budget deficit of $284 million for 2016 and another $466 million in 2017.\n\nWest Virginia House Speaker Tim Armstead, a Republican, attributes part of that funding gap to \u201cthe devastating ripple effect\u201d of every mine shutdown.\n\n\u201cEvery time we see a mine close,\u201d Armstead told The Daily Signal, \u201cour men and women are put out of work. That not only impacts them and their families, but it influences all the businesses in that community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis over-regulation has stifled production [and] put our people out of work,\u201d @ArmsteadWV says.\n\nAnd although both of the state\u2019s top lawmakers credit their congressional delegation to Washington for bringing attention to the issue, they say the Obama administration has turned a deaf ear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that this over-regulation has stifled production [and] has put our people out of work. They recognize that,\u201d Armstead said of the administration.\n\nRather than attending the Paris climate summit last year, the House speaker said, he wished \u201cObama would visit West Virginia instead.\u201d\n\n\u2018Get Out of the Lord\u2019s Way\u2019\n\nBill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said Obama is making good on promises.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s simply done what he\u2019s wanted to do,\u201d Raney said Wednesday, referring to remarks Obama made as a presidential candidate in 2008. \u201cHe said he was going to bankrupt the industry when he was running [for president], and that\u2019s what he\u2019s set out to do.\u201d\n\nThe administration continues to \u201ccircumvent Congress\u201d with executive action and an unaccountable Environmental Protection Agency, the coal association president said.\n\nCongress last month tried to halt the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan using the Congressional Review Act. They failed when Obama vetoed their resolution of disapproval aimed at voiding the new rule.\n\nWest Virginia is among 27 states that have mounted a legal challenge to the Clean Power Plan, arguing that without congressional approval, the rule amounts to \u201ca power grab.\u201d\n\nNow before the District of Columbia Circuit Court, that case will be decided this summer but is expected to come before the U.S. Supreme Court sometime in 2017.\n\nAlthough Raney said \u201cgoing to court is now our only recourse,\u201d he also sees another last option for coal producers fearful of new regulation: prayer.\n\n\u201cIf we have enough sense to get out of the Lord\u2019s way, he often provides a path for us,\u201d Raney said. \u201cCertainly he must be aware of the suffering that\u2019s going on and of how deeply its cutting in the coal fields.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe vast majority of the problem comes from President Obama and his EPA\u2019s war on coal,\u201d Senate President Bill Cole, a Republican, told The Daily Signal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThe vast majority of the problem comes from President Obama and his EPA\u2019s war on coal,\u201d Senate President Bill Cole, a Republican, told The Daily Signal.", "title": "West Virginia Turns to Prayer as Obama\u2019s 'Clean Power' Looms", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160127_CoalPrayer_Wegmann.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-28T00:13:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KGjFdl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThe vast majority of the problem comes from President Obama and his EPA\u2019s war on coal,\u201d Senate President Bill Cole, a Republican, told The Daily Signal.", "title": "West Virginia Turns to Prayer as Obama\u2019s 'Clean Power' Looms", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160127_CoalPrayer_Wegmann.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "coal/Oil", "published_time": "2016-01-27T20:10:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T00:13:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Clean Power Plan is a key component of Obama\u2019s effort to execute the global climate agenda struck last month in Paris.\nCHARLESTON, W.Va.\u2014There\u2019s little separation between church and the fossil fuel industry in West Virginia\u2019s coal country.\nNow the industry is bracing for the latest and most sweeping regulation issued unilaterally by the EPA: the Clean Power Plan.\nWest Virginia House Speaker Tim Armstead, a Republican, attributes part of that funding gap to \u201cthe devastating ripple effect\u201d of every mine shutdown.\nIn recent years, as the coal market shifted, West Virginia lost its footing further."}
