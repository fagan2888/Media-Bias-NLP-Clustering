Chairman of the Fisher House Foundation, Ken Fisher, discusses the Hero Miles program with CNBC's Dina Gusovsky. During Military Appreciation Month, Fisher is asking every traveler to donate 1,000 of their miles to replenish the Hero Miles programs that is in danger of running out.

Commercial real estate magnate Ken Fisher has made millions for himself and investors. However, the billionaire says he actually prefers to use his housing market expertise to help others, specifically military members and their families.

Fisher is senior partner of Fisher Brothers, a real estate development firm based in New York. That aside, he tells CNBC his main source of pride is serving as CEO of Fisher Houseâ€”or as he likes to call it, "The Ronald McDonald House for soldiers."

Fisher House builds and provides housing for families of injured military personnel through a public-private partnership with government agencies like the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Because family members of wounded warriors often have to travel to be close to a military hospital or VA facility, the housing is walking distance from the area where family members are receiving care. Fisher House is one of several organizations, such as the Wounded Warriors Project, that seek to help meet the needs of former soldiers.
