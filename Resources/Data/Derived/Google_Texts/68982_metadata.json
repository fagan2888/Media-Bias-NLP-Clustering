He and four other investors found out after they committed to the location and put a couple hundred thousand dollars into the property that the size of the grease trap won\u2019t accommodate the 203-seat restaurant they envisioned, he said.\n\nIt was perplexing because fire code would have allowed for that many seats, including 45 on an outside patio. But Seacoast Utility Authority told McCorison the location is only allowed 157 seats because of the grease trap, he said.\n\nIncreasing the capacity would require \u201cripping up the whole back area\u201d of the restaurant and road of the mall, he said.\n\nManhattan Beach Grill would have replaced RA Sushi next to Yard House.\n\n+ Allen Eyestone Downtown at the Gardens in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida on June 5, 2015.
