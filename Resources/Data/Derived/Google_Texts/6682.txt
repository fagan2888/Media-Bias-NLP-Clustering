The Center for Medical Progress released a trailer Friday for its “Human Capital” series featuring previously unseen video after a judge lifted a temporary restraining order that had barred the group from releasing the footage.

The video captures StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer talking about intact fetal cadavers.

“Oh yeah, if you had intact cases, which we’ve done a lot, we sometimes ship those back to our lab in its entirety,” Dyer says.

“Tell the lab it’s coming and you open the box, oh God,” Dyer adds as she laughs.

StemExpress and Planned Parenthood face multiple congressional and state investigations into the financial nature of their relationship. StemExpress recently announced that it has severed ties with Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider.

Profiting from the sale of fetal human organs is illegal in the United States. Spokesmen for StemExpress and Planned Parenthood have denied there is a financial benefit from their “tissue donation” program.

StemExpress secured a temporary restraining order against the Center for Medical Progress, which withheld footage of Dyer until today’s decision. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Joanne O’Donnell said the group had a First Amendment right to show the footage.

A spokesperson for the Center for Medical Progress in a statement that “the video, full conversation footage, and transcript will be published shortly.”

California-based StemExpress released a statement expressing disappointment with the judge’s ruling.

“StemExpress disagrees with the court’s conclusion today that a preliminary injunction is not an appropriate remedy in this case and is considering options, including an appeal.”
