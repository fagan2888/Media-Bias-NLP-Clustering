Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized congressional Republicans on MSNBC's \u201cThe Ed Show\u201d Friday, calling them hypocritical for refusing to extend emergency unemployment benefits, even though they did so five times during the Bush administration.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just an enormous amount of politics here,\u201d Sanders told host Ed Schultz. \u201cWhen Bush was president, Republicans voted for five extensions of emergency unemployment without any offsets. That was when Bush was president. Obama is president, it becomes a different story.\u201d\n\nSanders also accused the GOP of legislating without empathy for the 1.3 million American workers who lost their long-term unemployment insurance in December.\n\n\u201cWhat these guys want to do is pretend, I believe, that they\u2019re concerned about these 1.3 million workers,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat it means in terms of rent, or a cell phone, or your ability to get a job. That is something our Republican colleagues are not thinking about at all.\u201d\n\n\"So what they are talking about now are quote unquote offsets,\" he continued. \"Not under Bush, but now they want it under Obama, and what these offsets will be is taking money from Peter to help pay Paul. What they want to do is cut the Affordable Care Act. They want to cut health insurance. These guys have been vicious about cutting food stamps. They want to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. They want to cut any and all programs which benefit the working families of our country. That\u2019s what they want to do now. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve always wanted to do.\"\n\nGene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, echoed these sentiments at last Tuesday\u2019s White House press conference, saying there was no precedent for House Republicans\u2019 demand that an extension in unemployment insurance be paid for by spending cuts.\n\n\u201cFourteen of the last 17 times in 20 years that it\u2019s been extended, there\u2019s been no strings attached,\u201d Sperling told reporters. \u201cAll five times -- all five times that the previous President Bush extended emergency unemployment benefits, there was no pay-for strings attached and the unemployment rate was lower each of those five times than it is today.\u201d\n\nA staunch advocate for expanding government programs like Social Security and Medicare, Sanders proposed raising revenue by closing tax loopholes for American corporations instead of stifling existing social programs.\n\n\u201cWhen one out of four corporations in this country, including some very very wealthy ones, and profitable ones, don\u2019t pay a nickel in federal income taxes, you think we can raise some revenue there?\u201d Sanders asked Schultz. \u201cDo you think we can raise revenue when we\u2019re losing a hundred billion every year because corporate America is stashing their money in the Cayman Islands?\u201d\n\nSanders warned congressional Republicans that \u201cthey\u2019re going to be hurt politically ... if they don\u2019t help these 1.3 million Americans.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Extreme GOP Platform Positions Extreme GOP Platform Positions\n\n1 of 8 Abortion Ban With No Rape Exception What the 2012 Republican platform draft says: Republicans Romney's position: Romney Obama's position: Obama Republicans oppose abortion in all cases with no exceptions for rape or incest.Romney opposes abortion but supports exceptions for rape and incest.Obama supports the Democratic Party platform, which states that abortions should be legally available in accordance with Roe v.
