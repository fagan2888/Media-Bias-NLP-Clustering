The survey also found that web portals, secure text messaging and electronic medical records were the most important tools within ACOs that helped achieve effective communication among stakeholders.\n\nDirect communication is not only more efficient, it can eliminate harmful hospital noise, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the survey results (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospital reduces damaging noise with direct communication technologies\n\nCommunication technology vital to boosting patient experience\n\nReduce noise to improve OR communication, prevent errors\n\nHospitals rank alarm fatigue as top patient safety concern\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "As care coordination gains popularity in the healthcare industry, especially within\u00a0accountable care organizations, healthcare leaders must ensure their teams of doctors, nurses and staff use the most efficient communication processes possible to protect their patients and organizations' bottom lines.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As care coordination gains popularity in the healthcare industry, especially within\u00a0accountable care organizations, healthcare leaders must ensure their teams of doctors, nurses and staff use the most efficient communication processes possible to protect their patients and organizations' bottom lines.", "title": "Hospitals waste $11 billion a year on inefficient communication", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-waste-11-billion-year-inefficient-communication/2014-07-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations,Care Delivery,Electronic Medical Records,Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management,Patient Admissions,patient transfers,Text Messaging", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce989\"", "article_summary": "Of the three work processes analyze, survey results revealed:Admitting one patient took roughly 51 minutes, 33 of those minutes wasted due to inefficient communication, costing each hospital about $728,000 and the industry $4.67 billion a year.\nTransferring a patient to another facility takes roughly 56 minutes, 35 of which are wasted because of inefficient communication, costing each hospital about $754,000 and the industry $4.83 a year.\nThe survey found hospitals' and health systems' workflows wasted a significant amount of time because of inefficient pagers and a lack of secure text messaging, which cost $1.75 million per hospital and more than $11 billion industry-wide.\nCoordinating an emergency response team takes about 93 minutes, and on average 40 of those minutes were wasted because of inefficient communication, which translates into a $265,000 loss per hospital and the industry $1.7 billion per year.\nDirect communication is not only more efficient, it can eliminate harmful hospital noise, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
