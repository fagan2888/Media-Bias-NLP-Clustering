To justify these limits, the Obama Health Care Law\u2019s architects relied on the faulty premise that foreign health care systems cost less while delivering superior care. In effect, the administration sees other governments spending less money per person, and it would certainly like to see that same trend in America. But what does the British experience of such rationing teach us about the effect on human lives?\n\nAccording to the Cooper piece,\n\nOnly 83.1 per cent of patients were seen in four hours at major A&Es in the week before Christmas \u2013 the worst week on record\u2026. Latest figures show that in December, nearly 39,000 sick patients were forced to wait on trolleys for up to 12 hours after a decision to admit them to hospital \u2013 three times as many as last year.\n\nThe evidence that less money means worse care is not limited to British emergency services. Americans surpass European survival rates for common cancers. [1] Studies show that breast cancer mortality is 52 percent higher in Germany than in the United States, and is 88 percent higher in the United Kingdom. Prostate cancer mortality is 457 percent higher in Norway, and 604 percent higher in the U.K.\n\nIndeed, if one adjusts for two simple factors, deaths from homicide, which are much higher in the U.S. than in other nations, and transportation accidents, the U.S. has the highest life expectancy in the world.

You can read more on this here. A Congressional Budget Office report issued last April confirms that exchange plans are restrictive. What\u2019s worse, this is by design.\n\nRarely reported in the mainstream media is an Obamacare provision under which exchange bureaucrats must exclude health insurers who offer policies deemed to allow \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d health care spending by their policyholders.\n\nUnder the Federal health law, state insurance commissioners are to recommend to their state exchanges the exclusion of \u201cparticular health insurance issuers \u2026 based on a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium increases.\u201d The exchanges not only exclude policies in an exchange when government authorities do not agree with their premiums, but the exchanges must even exclude insurers whose plans outside the exchange offer consumers the ability to reduce the danger of treatment denial by paying what those government authorities consider an \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d amount.\n\nThis means that insurers who hope to be able to gain customers within the exchanges have a strong disincentive to offer any adequately funded plans that do not drastically limit access to care. So even if you contact insurers directly, outside the exchange, you are likely to find it hard or impossible to find an adequate individual plan. (See documentation at www.nrlc.org/medethics/healthcarerationing.)\n\nWhen the government limits what can be charged for health insurance, it restricts what people are allowed to pay for medical treatment. While everyone would prefer to pay less\u2013or nothing\u2013for health care (or anything else), government price controls prevent access to lifesaving medical treatment that costs more to supply than the prices set by the government.\n\nWhile Obamacare continues to roll out in 2015, it is important to continue to educate friends and neighbors about the dangers the law poses in restricting what Americans can spend to save their own lives and the lives of their families.
