Kazmiersky read his verdict Friday.\n\nTerrell said the ordeal was \u201cpretty embarrassing\u2019\u2019 especially because he had to sit down and explain it to his 15-year-old son \u201cLittle Dave\u2019\u2019who is now a freshman at Loyola Academy High School when word of his Aug., 2013 arrest hit every news station in town.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things\u2026You\u2019ve got to be a man when something happens,\u2019\u2019 Terrell said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important than being a good parent and being there for him in every way.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen asked if he thinks his name has been cleared, Terrell was ambivalent.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t worry about that. I mean I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t care because that\u2019s a lie,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cI can only keep living and walk with my head up, and you know, being a parent. There\u2019s certain things that you can\u2019t worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very relieved,\u2019\u2019 said Terrell\u2019s attorney, Stuart V. Goldberg said Saturday of Terrell\u2019s reaction to the verdict.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018You saved my life,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Goldberg recalled Terrell telling him after the bench trial ended and he was found not guilty of manufacturing cannabis with intent to deliver, a felony. He was also charged with battery to police, a misdemeanor charge for which Terrell was also cleared.\n\nTerrell is now focusing on going back to college and finishing his degree, according to Goldberg.\n\nKazmiersky, who presided over the bench trial, announced his verdict Friday at the Leighton Criminal Court building.\n\nGoldberg said he made a motion to dismiss the grand jury indictment against Terrell about a month ago and demanded a trial. Goldberg contends there was no proof that Terrell possessed marijuana and that the injuries an officer received were not caused by Terrell.\n\n\u201cThey had absolutely no facts other than a video showing him entering the building with two other men, one man carrying a black duffle bag,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg said.\n\nThat bag contained marijuana and Goldberg said prosecutors argued that Terrell\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u2019\u2019 at that apartment, plus him allegedly holding the door closed when the police tried to come in, were not enough to tie him to the charges, Goldberg said.\n\nGoldberg said they there was no \u201cscientific testing\u2019\u2019 of the contraband or the duffle bag to see if they had Terrell\u2019s fingerprints on it.\n\nPolice say the officers were responding to a call of people smoking marijuana around 1:30 p.m. Friday Aug. 16 when they found Terrell and two others in an apartment in the 3900 block of South Calumet Avenue in the Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nTerrell was drafted by the Bears in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft, arriving from the University of Michigan. He played four seasons with the Bears as a Wide Receiver and one game with the Denver Broncos in 2005, finishing his career with 128 receptions and 9 touchdowns.\n\nTerrell was separately charged with domestic battery in April of 2012 but the charge was dismissed later that year after the witness did not appear in court, records show.\n\nTerrell said that though it was difficult to have to explain what happened to his son, he hopes his son will learn from it and he tried to impress on teen the value of opportunities that you are given and the importance of doing everything you can to keep those opportunities.\n\nTerrell said he misses the gridiron but after Friday\u2019s verdict he\u2019s going forward with \u201clife after football.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get back to my daily hustle, my daily grind,\u2019\u2019 said Terrell who renovates buildings to find affordable housing for people, a project he hopes to land a reality TV gig from.\n\n\u201cNothing was as exciting as playing for the Bears,\u2019\u2019 Terrell said. \u201cNothing was more exciting than leaving the game after winning.
