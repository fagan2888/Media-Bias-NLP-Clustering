They face monumental changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act and the challenges of an aging population.\n\n\u201cHospitals are trying to reduce their costs in whatever way they can because reimbursement is being ratcheted down,\u201d says Ernie Anderson, a Boston-area startup advisor and former healthcare executive. \u201cThey have to be able to do things less expensively.\u201d\n\nOne area of growing importance is efficiently managing the supply of sterile injectable drugs\u2014crucial products that have been in short supply the past few years.\n\nThat was the impetus for starting ConsortiEX, a software startup with roots in both Massachusetts and Wisconsin. The company developed an ordering and tracking system for sterile injectable compounds, which include antibiotics and intravenous drips, says Anderson, a ConsortiEX advisor who holds stock in the company.\n\nAnderson\u2014formerly the vice president of pharmacy for the 11-hospital system Steward Health Care in Boston\u2014envisions ConsortiEX helping such healthcare organizations coordinate orders and shipments of sterile injectable drugs from a shared warehouse that makes the products for the member hospitals. And if there\u2019s, say, a recall on any of the drugs, ConsortiEX\u2019s software will know where the product was sent, Anderson says.\n\n\u201cI think for major health systems across the country, I think this is something that\u2019s come along in the right place, at the right time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it is definitely a need that exists out there for health systems.\u201d\n\nThe company was formed in May 2013 in response to a request from the University of Wisconsin Health\u2019s pharmacy department in Madison, WI, which sought a safer way to distribute sterile injectable compounds to other state hospitals, according to a Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) press release.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of steps in sterile compounding, and most of them are fragmented,\u201d ConsortiEX co-founder and CEO Neal Long says. His company\u2019s software \u201cdocuments, manages, and tracks all the elements in the compounding process.\u201d\n\nConsortiEX wasn\u2019t formed specifically because of the scarcity of sterile injectable drugs, but \u201cone of the problems we\u2019re going to help these hospitals solve is how to manage their shortages,\u201d Long says.\n\nThe company\u2019s headquarters are in Andover, MA, where Long lives, but most of its 16 employees and advisors are in the Milwaukee area, he says. The Milwaukee team includes several former Marquette Electronics and GE Healthcare employees who are currently working from their homes. Long says he worked for Milwaukee-based Marquette Electronics (later known as Marquette Medical Systems) for 13 years, which the former GE Medical Systems (now GE Healthcare) acquired in 1998. Long has also held executive positions with Philips and Draeger, and has co-founded two startups, he says.\n\nConsortiEX has raised $300,000 in seed capital from investors in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, Long says. The company recently graduated from the MassChallenge summer accelerator in Boston, and now is poised to set up its own office and expand, he says.\n\n\u201cMassChallenge has opened up a lot of connections to service providers, potential partners, and potential investors,\u201d Long says.\n\nConsortiEX is scouting physical spaces in \u2026 Next Page \u00bb\n\nJeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.
