It is too early in the investigation to say if a bullet shattered a car window, leading to the injury of a driver on Saturday, said Arapahoe County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Julie Brooks.

The driver was traveling eastbound on East Arapahoe Road near South Potomac Street in Centennial when his driver-side window shattered as he was accelerating away from a stoplight, public information officer Julie Brooks said.

The driver was able to drive himself to the hospital.

“His dad later located what appeared to be a bullet inside the car,” Brooks said. “It appeared be a low-velocity glass break.”

Investigators were unable to inspect the car at the location where the window broke, because the driver went to the hospital for treatment of abrasions, Brooks said on Sunday.

“We don’t even know if it was a shooting,” she said.

The incident was reported to law enforcement around 11:10 a.m. Saturday, Brooks said.

A task force was created last May to investigate four apparently random shootings in Northern Colorado that killed two and wounded one.

Brooks said she didn’t believe the Northern Colorado Task Force has joined in the investigation.

The Arapahoe County investigation is ongoing, Brooks said.
