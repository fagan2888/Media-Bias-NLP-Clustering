and mimicry by young spectators - as he embarked on what would prove to be a cracking summer of bowling.\n\nThe handlebar moustache, reminiscent of fast bowler Dennis Lillee's, seemed to herald a return to form for Johnson, who was ridiculed for his performance in the 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes series.\n\nWith little kids sporting black texta-taches and homemade handlebars from Daily Telegraph cut-outs watching on, Johnson bowled like a demon.\n\nAs Australia nudged towards a 5-0 series whitewash, Johnson scored himself a place in history with 37 wickets, a record for the most wickets by an Australian fast bowler in a five match Ashes series.\n\nMichael Clarke's \"broken arm\" comment seemed like a sledge come true when Mitchell Johnson delivered what was almost literally a cracking delivery, striking the foot of Stuart Broad.\n\nThe seam bowler and handy batsman left the field under the shadow of a possible broken bone in his foot.\n\nBut X-rays later revealed no breakage.\n\nLuckily for England, a bruised Broad would be cleared to return to the field to bat and, later, in the final test in Sydney, would save his team from a humiliating follow on as Australia marched towards its 5-0 victory.\n\nBut first Australia had to celebrate winning the Ashes back from England, and in Perth the defeat of our greatest cricketing adversaries was by a decisive 150 runs.\n\nThe final wicket to win the series was that of sledger Jimmy Anderson.\n\nVictory was sweet.\n\nNo sooner has Australia humiliated England, their own spin bowler Graeme Swann sensationally announced his retirement - effective immediately - from all forms of the game.\n\nThe 34-year-old had been one of several underperforming players in the English squad.\n\nIn his parting moments he took a swipe at players who were \"up\" themselves, and then delivered a defeatist assessment of his team.\n\n\"I came to Australia in the hope of winning our fourth Ashes series on the trot but that's now impossible,\" Swann told UK newspaper The Sun.\n\n\"So it's time for someone else to buckle in and enjoy the ride. I could have made myself available for the last two Tests and maybe had a bit of a send-off from the Barmy Army.\n\n\"But that's no reason to hang on for two more games. I like to be the centre of attention - but for the right reason by winning games of cricket.\"\n\nThey came, they saw, they applauded.\n\nThe biggest crowd in cricketing history - a final total of 91,092 spectators, including a beaten but unbowed barmy army - flocked to the MCG for day one of the fourth test.\n\nThat was 292 more than the 90,800 who watched Australia battle the West Indies on February 11, 1961, during a hugely popular and successful tour.\n\nThe MCG is the birthplace of Test cricket; the first match was played there in March 1877, when Australia beat England by 45 runs.\n\nEngland again struggled at the crease, and Mitchell Johnson duly delivered a blistering attack.\n\nFor the television audience watching on, the first summer of the absence of the legendary commentary line-up following Tony Greig's death and Richie Benaud's car accident was somewhat ameliorated by the return of Bill Lawry to the commentary box at the MCG.\n\nAmid whispers of his impending retirement, Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin returned to cricket and at the SCG he carried his young daughter, Mia, onto the fabled field.\n\nThirteen months after Mia had been diagnosed with the childhood cancer, neuroblastoma, and Haddin had given up cricket to care for her, he returned.\n\nHaddin credited his second coming as an Australian cricketer to the perspective offered by his daughter's battle against cancer.\n\nAnd his sparkling return to form - rescuing Australia several times by sticking at the crease after the collapse of the top order - sets him up to satisfy a fervent desire to play on until at least the 2015 World Cup and then the defence of the Ashes in England that year.\n\nHaddin appeared to enjoy the special moment with Mia after what he and his wife, Karina, had been through with her.\n\nSix years after his wife, Jane, died of breast cancer and eight years after his own retirement from Test cricket as a fast bowler, Glenn McGrath scored a ton of a different sort with the charity named in his wife's honour raising enough money to hire the fund's hundredth breast care nurse for cancer sufferers.\n\nAnd perhaps the greatest Ashes image goes to that of former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke skolling a beer in a crowd of \"Richie Benauds\" at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nIn the absence of the great commentator, fans including dozens of Richies wearing silver wigs and carrying foam microphones, gathered at the SCG.\n\nIt was day two and with cameras trained on the Richies, Hawkie, schooner in hand, suddenly hove into view for TV viewers.\n\nThe 84-year-old downed his ale in about ten seconds.\n\nIn 1955, while a student Oxford, Hawke set a world record by downed 2.5 imperial pints (1.4 l litres), or a yard glass of ale in 11 seconds.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff",
