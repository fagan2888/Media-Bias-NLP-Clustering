King says drivers should also be ready.\n\n\"You may be out on the roads and not realize you're out on ice so please drive carefully.\"\n\nAs a reminder Wichita snow plows only hit the main street routes, meaning many neighborhoods will not be touched.\n\nPREVIOUS STORY:\n\nWichita street crews will be on call this weekend for the possibility of winter weather.\n\nCrews have been working on bridges and overpasses. All sixty plows will be deployed before the storm arrives. \"We'll continue to monitor the forecast you know with this far out and this much variation with models we're prepared in even extreme events but I think the wind is going to be one of those things that's going to be more severe. As far as upper 50 mile an hour gusts is what they're talking about, \" said Public Works Director Alan King.\n\nWith thousands expected on the road, King suggests everyone take it slow on the roads, particularly on elevated roadways.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Crews have been working on bridges and overpasses.
