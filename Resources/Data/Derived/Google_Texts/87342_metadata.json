Underhill said the Fairfield County Medical Association and the Hartford County Medical Association showed that the removal of 2,250 doctors from the UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage network could cause irreparable harm.\n\nThe injunction prohibits the health insurer from dropping any of the associations' doctors from the network, from notifying patients of any of those terminations for 2014, and from removing those doctors \u2014 810 primary care physicians and 1,440 specialists \u2014 from its directories for next year.\n\nMark Thompson, executive director of the Fairfield County Medical Association, said the injunction will keep those 2,250 doctors in the network for 2014. \"This will lock those patients in with their doctors for another year,\" he said.\n\nA UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman on Friday said she could not speculate on whether the doctors would be in the network for the entire year.\n\nUnitedHealthcare is the largest private Medicare insurer in Connecticut.\n\nSoon after the ruling was made public Thursday, company spokesman Terence O'Hara said in an email: \"We respectfully disagree with the court's preliminary ruling and intend to appeal immediately. We believe the court's ruling will create unnecessary and harmful confusion and disruption to Medicare beneficiaries in Connecticut.\"\n\nConnecticut Attorney General George Jepsen on Friday hailed the ruling.\n\n\"This decision confirms my view that these terminations \u2014 unprecedented in scope \u2014 offend public policy and threaten irreparable harm to patients whose relationships with their doctors are at risk of disruption,\" Jepsen said in a written release.\n\n\"United's lack of transparency for both physicians and patients has been of great concern,\" Jepsen said. \"I urge United to abide by the court's decision and its clear contractual obligations to all affected physicians, not just those who are members of the Fairfield and Hartford County Medical Associations. Its failure to do so will only compound the confusion United has already caused to thousands of vulnerable Connecticut patients and prospective Medicare Advantage enrollees, who deserve much greater care and respect.\"\n\nLast month, the state's congressional delegation wrote to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which determines whether an insurer's network is adequate for patients, with their concerns about the situation with UnitedHealthcare. The center, which could restore the doctors to the network, has not responded to the letter.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news, business, mobile", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-thecourant", "description": "Doctors associations and public officials on Friday celebrated a federal judge's decision to block UnitedHealthcare from cutting thousands of doctors from its Medicare Advantage network in 2014.The...", "title": "Cutting Doctors: Judge Stops UnitedHealthcare From Cutting Doctors", "url": "http://articles.courant.com/2013-12-06/news/hc-united-health-care-doctors-1206-20131206_1_unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fairfield-county-medical-association-patients", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52a1ec04/turbine/hc-united-health-care-doctors-1206-20131206-001/600/600x446", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 115228168554095}, "description": "Doctors associations and public officials on Friday celebrated a federal judge's decision to block UnitedHealthcare from cutting thousands of doctors from its Medicare Advantage network in 2014.The"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04eb\"", "article_summary": "\"This is setting a precedent,\" said Dr. Robin Oshman, president of the Fairfield County Medical Association.\nDoctors associations and public officials on Friday celebrated a federal judge's decision to block UnitedHealthcare from cutting thousands of doctors from its Medicare Advantage network in 2014.\nMark Thompson, executive director of the Fairfield County Medical Association, said the injunction will keep those 2,250 doctors in the network for 2014.\nUnitedHealthcare is the largest private Medicare insurer in Connecticut.\nA UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman on Friday said she could not speculate on whether the doctors would be in the network for the entire year."}
