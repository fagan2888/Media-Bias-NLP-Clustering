And why are A-list brands such as Land Rover, Charles Schwab, Samsung, Verizon, Canon, Guinness, Porsche and BMW snatching them up?\n\nThe Avalanche product weaves an ad into a content carousel on a publisher\u2019s website. Think of a squared off section of a site highlighting several editorial stories with images\u2013and one of these images is an ad. If a reader mouses over an Avalanche ad, the advertiser\u2019s image expands over the content hub.\n\nThe ads can fetch a higher price tag because they are tucked in among the publisher\u2019s own content and more likely to catch a reader\u2019s eye than an easily overlooked standard display ad. It comes a bit closer to mixing advertising with editorial without being intentionally deceptive.\n\nAvalanche is the brainchild of VMG founder Chris Batty, who formerly worked in digital sales at Gawker Media and CNET. During those tenures, Mr. Batty said he saw how the display ad market was becoming commoditized. Publishers were on the lookout for better, more visual ad products but didn\u2019t want to constantly produce brand new custom treatments.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the world where publishers live,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the world of brand advertising, everything is \u2018never been done before.\u2019 And there\u2019s all this investment in ad tech, but nobody is thinking about these systems for brands. So we thought we can help publishers take control of user experience and their own destiny.\u201d\n\nMr. Batty said that 230 Avalanche campaigns have been run to date. The company worked with just four publishers in 2013, and that number jumped to 30 last year.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A small Brooklyn startup is quietly building out a roster of publishing partners and paying advertisers for its so-called Avalanche ads, which are woven in among highlighted story images on a pubilsher's site and expand when moused over.", "title": "Why Big Brands and Top Web Publishers Love This Stealth Digital Ad Startup", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/03/19/why-big-brands-and-top-web-publishers-love-this-stealth-digital-ad-startup/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HM260_travel_G_20150318162059.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Why Big Brands and Top Web Publishers Love This Stealth Digital Ad Startup", "description": "A small Brooklyn startup is quietly building out a roster of publishing partners and paying advertisers for its so-called Avalanche ads, which are woven in among highlighted story images on a pubilsher's site and expand when moused over.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Mike Shields", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "A small Brooklyn startup is quietly building out a roster of publishing partners and paying advertisers for its so-called Avalanche ads, which are woven in among highlighted story images on a pubilsher's site and expand when moused over.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-03-19T18:13:13-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/03/19/why-big-brands-and-top-web-publishers-love-this-stealth-digital-ad-startup/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-3082", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A small Brooklyn startup is quietly building out a roster of publishing partners and paying advertisers for its so-called Avalanche ads, which are woven in among highlighted story images on a pubilsher's site and expand when moused over.", "title": "Why Big Brands and Top Web Publishers Love This Stealth Digital Ad Startup", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/03/19/why-big-brands-and-top-web-publishers-love-this-stealth-digital-ad-startup/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HM260_travel_G_20150318162059.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-3082", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-23T14:23:39-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09bb\"", "article_summary": "If a reader mouses over an Avalanche ad, the advertiser\u2019s image expands over the content hub.\nThe Wall Street JournalA small Brooklyn startup is quietly building out a roster of publishing partners and paying advertisers that would be the envy of many in digital media.\nAvalanche is the brainchild of VMG founder Chris Batty, who formerly worked in digital sales at Gawker Media and CNET.\nThe Avalanche product weaves an ad into a content carousel on a publisher\u2019s website.\nPublishers were on the lookout for better, more visual ad products but didn\u2019t want to constantly produce brand new custom treatments."}
