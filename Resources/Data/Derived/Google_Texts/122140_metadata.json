Jim Matheson, D-Utah Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah\n\ncharging fees for providing or verifying prescriptions\n\nspecifying from where clients must buy medications as a condition for receiving a prescription\n\nrequiring clients to sign a waiver relieving the doctor of liability in the case of any problems with a prescription filled elsewhere\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to have the issue out there and have people talk about it,\u201d Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, told the VIN News Service in an interview this week. \u201cEven if the legislation were never to pass, I think consumers should be aware that they should at least ask for a prescription.\u201dMatheson originally introduced the legislation in 2011. That bill, HR 1406, expired in the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Health Subcommittee when the legislative session ended in early 2013. Matheson reintroduced the legislation on Feb. 10. Now given the bill number HR 4023 , it again has been assigned to the Energy and Commerce Committee.The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) opposes the proposed law, calling it \u201cburdensome and unnecessary.\u201d\u201cClients already have the flexibility to fill a prescription at their veterinary clinic or off-site at a pharmacy of their choice,\u201d the trade organization states in a legislative alert to members. \u201cThe AVMA is supportive of a client\u2019s right to choose where they have their prescription filled.\u201dMatheson disputes the assertion that clients already can obtain veterinary prescriptions. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d he said.Not a current pet owner himself, Matheson said he was made aware of the issue by a former staff member who was his legislative director. The staffer told him she\u2019d paid a veterinarian $43 for medication that her dog would need monthly. When she discovered the same medication was available at a nearby drugstore for $18, she asked the veterinarian for a prescription. Matheson said the veterinarian charged her a prescription-writing fee of $5.Matheson said he\u2019s heard similar stories from other pet owners. He also said he\u2019s spoken with pet owners who were unaware that they may request a prescription from their veterinarians.The legislation would require veterinarians to provide prescriptions whether requested or not. In addition, it would prohibit:\n\nDr. Ashley Morgan, assistant director of the AVMA Governmental Relations Division, acknowledged that there may be instances of veterinarians declining to provide prescriptions, but not enough to justify a law.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur understanding and belief is that it\u2019s not a pervasive problem,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe AVMA's Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics states that a veterinarian should honor a client's request. If there are veterinarians not providing prescriptions, hopefully they have a medical or ethical reason for doing it and are communicating that to the client.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe AVMA maintains that requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions as a matter of routine, even if a client chooses to purchase medication at a clinic, is an \u201cundue regulatory and administrative burden.\u201d It adds: \u201c\u2026 some medications are only available through a veterinarian; in those cases, it is unnecessary for the client to have a copy of the written prescription.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe AVMA also argues that the proposal encroaches on the jurisdiction of states, which regulate the veterinary and pharmacy professions. About 84,000 veterinarians belong to the AVMA.\n\n\n\nMatheson said there is no reason that veterinarians can\u2019t follow the same practice as physicians in writing prescriptions to be filled by pharmacists. \u201cIn the case of human doctors, they can\u2019t dispense medication,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a decision that that is a conflict of interest. I\u2019m not raising that issue right now (for veterinary medicine), but I could.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow far the legislation will progress in the time remaining in this legislative session is a question. Govtrack.us, an online legislative tracking tool maintained by the government-transparency company Civic Impulse, LLC, gives the bill zero chance of being enacted, based upon the small proportion of bills that historically have made it out of committee.\n\n\n\nThe legislative session officially ends Jan. 3, 2015, but Morgan said that in election years such as this, little activity typically occurs after June. All House seats and one-third of Senate seats are up for election in November. Morgan added, however, that a groundswell of support for the legislation could create momentum for lawmakers to act before the session closes.\n\n\n\nMatheson is not running again. Asked whether he would work on the pet prescription issue after he retires from Congress, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be doing after this year.\u201d\n\n\n\nCo-sponsoring the legislation is another Utah congressman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who is seeking re-election. His press secretary, M.J. Henshaw, could not say whether Chaffetz would reintroduce the legislation in the next session if it doesn\u2019t progress this year. \u201cI can\u2019t necessarily talk toward the future, but it\u2019s something he\u2019s been interested in,\u201d Henshaw said.\n\n\n\nChaffetz\u2019s interest lies in supporting free-market competition and giving consumers greater choice, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe feel that it\u2019s better \u2026 for the consumer to let them make the choice, instead of letting regulations make the choice,\u201d Henshaw said.\n\n\n\nTold that some would equate legislation to regulations, Henshaw responded only, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe earlier version of the bill had five other co-sponsors from both parties. Whether some or all will renew their support is unknown. Inquiries by the VIN News Service to their offices were not answered.\n\n\n\nBeyond Capitol Hill, supporters of the original bill include Wal-Mart, which promotes the availability in its pharmacies of human drugs sometimes prescribed for pets. A Wal-Mart spokesman told the VIN News Service in 2011 that the company \u201csupports efforts that give our customers a say where they purchase medicines and enables them to save money on the same items commonly prescribed to individuals, such as insulin and antibiotics, so even their pets can live better.\u201d\n\n\n\nMorgan of the AVMA said Wal-Mart approached her organization in 2010, before the bill was introduced, to express its support of the legislation and request the AVMA\u2019s backing. The AVMA declined.\n\n\n\nWal-Mart did not respond to a VIN News Service inquiry this week about its involvement with the legislation.\n\n\n\nMatheson said Wal-Mart did not ask him to create the bill. \u201cI know they\u2019re supportive of it, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been closely working with me. They weren\u2019t involved in writing the legislation, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 They\u2019ve come into my office and said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I think we wrote the bill ourselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nMatheson compares the Fairness to Pet Owners Act to the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act of 2003, which he co-sponsored. The contact lens law requires eye doctors to provide patients with prescriptions enabling them to purchase their lenses elsewhere.\n\n\n\nA beneficiary of that law is 800 Contacts, which calls itself the \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Contact Lens Store.\u201d Based in Utah, 800 Contacts ranks as Matheson\u2019s fourth biggest campaign donor since his election in 2000.\n\n\n\nWal-Mart Stores also has been a consistent donor to Matheson, as it has to numerous legislators in both parties. Contributing $65,000 of the $13.4 million raised during the congressman\u2019s career, Wal-Mart ranks 12th among Matheson donors, tied with the Laborers Union and National Association of Home Builders.\n\n\n\nAnother organization publicly supporting the Fairness to Pet Owners Act is Advocacy for Pets and Affordable Wellness. APAW describes itself as \u201ca national coalition of pet owners and advocates dedicated to promoting the health and well-being of America\u2019s pets and empowering pet owners everywhere to demand affordable, quality health care and medicine for their animals.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn its website, which focuses on the proposed legislation, APAW has a page titled \u201cWhere to buy meds\u201d that displays the logos of 26 retail supermarkets and pharmacies. The stores are, or are owned by, Wal-Mart, Albertson\u2019s, Kroger, Bashas\u2019 and Brookshire Brothers. Also in the listing is one online pharmacy, PetCare Rx.\n\n\n\nThe page does not list several other retail chains that promote their sales of veterinary medications, including Costco, Target and Walgreens. Also not included are online veterinary pharmacies such as Drs. Foster & Smith and PetMed Express.\n\n\n\nPetMed Express CEO Mendo Akdag has told the VIN News Service that his company is not involved with the proposed legislation, and confirmed recently that that remains the case. \u201cWe are a spectator,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe APAW website does not name the members or leaders of its coalition. An article published by Yahoo! Shine dated April 17, 2013, identifies the founder as Barbara Trulio, operator of a petsitting and dog-walking service in Huntington Beach, Calif. Reached by telephone, Trulio told the VIN News Service that she no longer is actively involved with the organization due to health issues in her family. She said the coalition\u2019s management was \u201chanded off\u201d to a public relations company, Formula PR, in San Diego, which she said is paid by members of the coalition. Trulio referred further questions to Stephanie Proos at Formula PR.\n\n\n\nProos, in turn, said Formula PR no longer is working with the coalition. APAW\u2019s current spokesperson is Jenny Gilcrest at Scout-PR. Speaking Friday afternoon, Gilcrest said the coalition includes politicians, veterinarians, retailers, product companies and shelter groups. She said she would provide more details soon.\n\n\n\nAsked about APAW, Matheson said he is unfamiliar with the organization.\n\n\n\nThe Fairness to Pet Owners Act, if passed, would give the job of enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission. Prompted by the bill\u2019s original introduction in 2011, the FTC began studying the world of veterinary drug distribution and held a public workshop on the topic in October 2012.\n\n\n\nOne confounding aspect of the pet drug industry is the gray market through which most retail outlets and online veterinary pharmacies ostensibly obtain their supplies. Secretive secondary channels that comprise the gray market developed as a consequence of policies by most pharmaceutical companies to sell veterinary drugs only to licensed, practicing veterinarians. The companies maintain that having veterinarians sell their products helps ensure that pet owners are instructed in safe and proper use.\n\n\n\nThe veterinary community deems the gray market an illegitimate and unreliable supplier of drugs and therapeutics. However, the issue is clouded by the fact that some veterinarians participate in the gray market by selling product to brokers. Pharmaceutical companies, too, have been accused of facilitating gray-market sales.\n\n\n\nA separate issue is the potential for retail pharmacists, who largely are untrained in veterinary pharmacology, to make mistakes when filling veterinary prescriptions. Veterinarians across the country have reported, mostly anecdotally, instances of pharmacists deliberately changing dosages or providing inappropriate drug substitutes out of ignorance.\n\n\n\nMatheson said he is aware of the problem. \u201cI think that is worrisome,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cand I think pharmacists ought to follow the prescription that they\u2019re given.\u201d\n\n\n\nMatheson also said he was aware of the FTC study of the issue and would have liked to have seen the commission\u2019s findings before reintroducing the legislation. But not knowing when that might be, he said, he decided not to wait.\n\n\n\nStephanie Wilkinson, the FTC lawyer who organized the conference on pet drugs, confirmed that the agency is considering issuing a report synthesizing staff research, workshop testimony and public comments but could not say when.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.vin.com/images/VNS_avatar_2015.png", "type": "website", "description": "Congressman heading toward retirement reintroduces bill"}, "fb": {"admins": 1082106638}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d6b\"", "article_summary": "The Fairness to Pet Owners Act, if passed, would give the job of enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission.\nAnother organization publicly supporting the Fairness to Pet Owners Act is Advocacy for Pets and Affordable Wellness.\nMatheson said the veterinarian charged her a prescription-writing fee of $5.Matheson said he\u2019s heard similar stories from other pet owners.\nA separate issue is the potential for retail pharmacists, who largely are untrained in veterinary pharmacology, to make mistakes when filling veterinary prescriptions.\nThe companies maintain that having veterinarians sell their products helps ensure that pet owners are instructed in safe and proper use."}
