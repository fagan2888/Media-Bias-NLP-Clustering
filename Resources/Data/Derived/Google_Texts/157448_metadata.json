Latinos are 8 percent of government workers, Asians are 5.8 percent, Native Americans are 2.1 percent and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders are .40 percent of federal employees. People of color are 37 percent of the U.S. population, a figure projected to grow to 43.3 percent as soon as 2025 and 57 percent by 2060.\n\nFederal workers considered non-essential to the functioning of government were instructed not to report for work as of Tuesday, the first day of the new fiscal year, because Congress failed to pass a permanent or interim budget in time to prevent a federal shutdown, the first in nearly two decades.\n\nThe impasse came as a result of the Republican-controlled House's desire to tie any budget measure to defunding the Affordable Care Act, the major provisions of which went into effect Tuesday. Democrats, for their part, refuse to consider any such approach.\n\nThe longest federal shutdown lasted 21 days, from Dec. 16, 1995 to Jan. 6, 1996. In the past, furloughed federal workers received retroactive pay for the time they were out. But there is no assurance that would happen this time.\n\nMembers of Congress are exempt from furloughs.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "When the government shutdown on Tuesday, a whole bunch of federal employees were told to stay home.
