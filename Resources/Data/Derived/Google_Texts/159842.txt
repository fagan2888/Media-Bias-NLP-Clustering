Dallas police have arrested an off-duty officer on charges of public intoxication, assault and criminal mischief outside a concert venue.

Dallas County jail records show Sr. Cpl. Frank Della was being held Sunday on $500 bond. Online jail records did not list an attorney for the 43-year-old officer, who was arrested following an altercation around midnight Saturday.

A police report said a witness saw Della pick up a traffic barrier and throw it at a vehicle, causing about $500 in damage. The incident happened near Gexa Energy Pavilion, where several country music stars had performed.

Della has been put on administrative leave pending an internal affairs review.
