Clater Kaye Theatreworks trains students in the full spectrum of the entertainment industry. They offer classes in dance - tap, ballet, lyrical, ballroom - and drama. Kids today have many choices of extracurricular activities.\n\nWith seven of her nine children still living at home, Lori Anne Whitman relies on a bouquet of gel pens to track who needs to be where at what time on a color-coded calendar. For this \u00fcber-organized parent, the daily whirl starts when a succession of after-school buses bring home twins Allison and Kristen (first grade, pink), then Jason (third grade, orange), followed by Jennifer (seventh grade, purple), Kevin (ninth grade, fluorescent lime), and Brian (12th grade, red).\n\nOnce they\u2019ve helped themselves to snacks, Ms. Whitman kicks off the first round robin of drop-offs: orange to a tutor, red to tennis, lime to soccer. Then back home, where she reads with the twin pinks before whisking them off, along with purple, to Clater Kaye Theatreworks. CKT, as it appears on Whitman\u2019s calendar, crams a smorgasbord of dance, voice, and drama classes into a nondescript building on Highway 127 in Hickory, N.C. Having carpooled with a friend from her public school, the seventh child, Danielle (10th grade, sky blue), is already there when her mother walks in.\n\nGone are the days when \u201cchildren pretty much just played unsupervised in the afternoon,\u201d says Fay Lidji, a family therapist in Dallas, who sees families struggling under unprecedented pressures. \u201cIt used to be, if you were affluent, you might have a piano lesson once a week,\u201d she says. \u201cBut today the kids go from 7:30 in the morning till about 6:30 at night with different kinds of activities.\u201d\n\nRecommended: 1912 eighth grade exam: Could you make it to high school in 1912?\n\nWhile parents have long been juggling the demands of work with the desires for a family life, personal development, and just plain fun, now they find themselves also managing something else \u2013 the work-life balance of their children. As perhaps the most overscheduled generation in history, kids today are often involved in multiple activities after school, and parents, as the choreographers of their children\u2019s pursuits, struggle with seemingly impossible demands on their time and pocketbooks.\n\nFor both sides, questions loom: Are kids today too busy? Does all the frenetic activity do any good? How do families cope with the extracurricular crush?\n\nAs parents scramble to deliver what might be called the after-school one-two punch \u2013 making sure children stay safe and exposing them to new experiences \u2013 they provide glimpses into the changing structure of family life and what children need to succeed as adults.\n\nSome, like Whitman, stitch together many different activities, while others find a single-venue after-school program. Either way it costs time, money, and energy.\n\nParents do all this because they hold high hopes for their children. A 2013 report from the National Center for Education Statistics reveals just how high parents\u2019 aspirations are for their kids. Only 1 percent of the country\u2019s more than 26 million sixth- through 12th-graders have parents who believed their children would fail to complete high school. Most (65 percent) have parents who say they expect them to get a college degree. Another 37 percent \u2013 almost evenly spread across economic and racial lines \u2013 have parents who expect them to earn a professional or graduate degree.\n\nBut fulfilling those expectations can come at a high cost.\n\n\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1\n\nTo a large degree, how well children will ultimately do in school \u2013 and even later in life \u2013 depends on what they do after the last class bell rings. Studies repeatedly show that if kids are going to derail \u2013 whether by joining gangs; trying drugs, alcohol, or sex; or committing crimes \u2013 it is most likely to happen between 3 and 6 p.m. At the same time, a large and growing body of research demonstrates that children and teenagers who engage in nonacademic after-school activities tend to have a better attitude about their studies and better grades.\n\nThe good news is that the number of latchkey kids has been dropping, most likely because families have more options from which to choose. There are, for example, more than 2,800 United States Youth Soccer Clubs as well as countless school and unaffiliated sports teams. Tutoring and afternoon educational services have exploded. From Scouts to 4-H Clubs, chess teams to archery classes, workshops in museums to church-sponsored activities, the choice of specialized activities is staggering.\n\nSimilarly, more and more after-school programs have opened since the federal government recognized in the 1990s that working families needed help, says Jen Rinehart, vice president of research and policy at the Afterschool Alliance. Even those kids with, say, a grandparent making sure they stayed safe \u201cwere missing out on learning opportunities that other families could make happen,\u201d Ms. Rinehart says. As a result of public investments, nearly one in four families today has a child attending an after-school program.\n\nThese figures do not include such innovative initiatives as the reading mentorship program at Homework Hotline in Nashville, Tenn. Twice a week for 30 minutes, a tutor and a third-grader read to each other by phone. Is this as good as meeting face to face? Assuredly not, says Alison Forte at the hotline. But the telephone\u2019s flexibility reaches kids who otherwise would have nothing. One boy told a tutor he was on a bench in Wal-Mart, book and phone in hand. While Mom shopped, they read.\n\nThe bad news is that, despite headlines proclaiming American children are overscheduled, the numbers reveal that many hanker for more scheduling. Not surprisingly, the proportion of kids going to afternoon lessons, clubs, and sports rises dramatically with a family\u2019s income, according to data from the US Census Bureau. At the same time, the Afterschool Alliance reports that, for every child enrolled in an after-school program, there are two others whose parents would sign them up, if they could only find one that was affordable and accessible. Although free programs exist, there aren\u2019t enough to meet the overwhelming demand.\n\nStudies also indicate that the cost of after-school activities places a disproportionately greater burden on families in lower-income brackets. Given the country\u2019s widening income gap, many experts worry that poorer children will have even fewer opportunities.\n\nJust how hard all this juggling of finances and schedules is on parents is impossible to measure, but a study published in December 2006 by the nonprofit research firm Catalyst provides a useful, if indirect, indication. Catalyst found that what it calls PCAST \u2013 Parental Concern about After-School Time \u2013 costs US businesses between $50 billion and $300 billion per year in lost productivity because of stress, disruptions, and low morale. Most significant, PCAST cuts \u201cacross gender, race/ethnicity, and rank, from factory floor to executive suite.\u201d\n\n\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1\n\nA high school sophomore, Hannah Kevitt has been taking dance lessons since she was 5 years old. She started at a small studio in her hometown of Hickory, N.C., and by the time she was 9, she was desperate to sing and act, too. So her parents enrolled her in classes at Clater Kaye Theatreworks, whose directors they met at church. Modern dance, ballet, voice, drama, tap, jazz \u2013 Hannah did it all, and as time went by, attending school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. felt like an onerous chore; homework, a torture.\n\nShe was a good student, but what she wanted was to perform. Soon, says her mother, Lynne Kevitt, \u201cit was just unrealistic to think she could be at school from 8 o\u2019clock in the morning to 2:45-3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, then come home and go straight to Clater Kaye and still manage homework and everything else.\u201d\n\nThe family made a change. Since seventh grade, instead of catching the school bus, Hannah climbs the stairs to her room after breakfast. Surrounded by collages of snapshots, snow globes, and a collection of playbills clipped to a wall-mounted bedspring, Hannah logs into her classes at the Alpha Omega Academy, an accredited online Christian institution.\n\nSo far, the pros of home-schooling outweigh the cons. With tuition about one fourth that of the private Christian school she used to attend, home-schooling frees up resources to pay for after-school classes for Hannah as well as for her sister, Rebekah, who has discovered a love for backstage work. With 40 hours of CKT classes \u2013 35 now for Rebekah \u2013 plus rehearsals, performances, auditions, and choreographing for competitions, home-schooling also frees up another rare commodity: time.\n\nHannah \u201cgoes to school\u201d seven days a week and is usually done by lunchtime. This gives her a little downtime \u2013 what many experts are now hailing as necessary \u201cnothing time\u201d \u2013 before she heads to CKT. The Kevitts sometimes worry about Hannah falling behind in schoolwork, but \u201cwhere her passion is, where her talent is,\u201d Ms. Kevitt says, \u201cit\u2019s in pursuing her career.\u201d\n\nThe family knows there\u2019s no guarantee Hannah will tread the boards on Broadway. But they also know that no one ever does without first devoting countless hours to mastering the craft. And they believe the training will not be wasted. As Hannah puts it, \u201cwhat they teach me at Clater Kaye is not just about theater, but about life, how to approach things.\u201d\n\nShe is not alone in thinking this, according to sociologist Hilary Levey Friedman. For her 2014 book, \u201cPlaying to Win: Raising Children in a Competitive Culture,\u201d Dr. Levey Friedman interviewed almost 100 parents, mostly middle and upper-middle class, who structured their family life and budget around soccer leagues, chess tournaments, and dance competitions. They did this not because they wanted their children, who were still in elementary school, to become professionals in these fields.\n\n\u201cWhat they want and what they\u2019re instilling,\u201d she says, \u201cis the culture that\u2019s going to help their children become investment bankers and consultants and lawyers and doctors and all of that.\u201d\n\nShe calls this \u201cCompetitive Kid Capital,\u201d which includes internalizing the importance of winning, rebounding after a loss, performing under scrutiny and within time limits, and generally succeeding under stress. It\u2019s not only on the soccer field or in the classroom that this will benefit them, Levey Friedman says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be in college, in graduate school, it\u2019s going to be to pass the bar exam or to keep getting some sort of certification.\u201d It also applies to their future work life, for no matter the job, she adds, there is \u201cthis element of constantly being judged, constantly proving your worth, constantly being critiqued and acquiring more credentials.\u201d\n\n\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1\n\nChris Cazell, a father waiting in the CKT lobby, knows how frenetic \u2013 and focused \u2013 kids have to be today. \u201cIt\u2019s not like when I grew up when you did a little bit of this and a little bit of that,\u201d he says. \u201cIf kids want to excel in an activity today, they get left behind if they don\u2019t start to focus by age 10, no later than 12. Maybe,\u201d he speculates, \u201cwhat has changed is our expectation that they excel.\u201d\n\nAs children enter middle school and then high school, the demands of academic work and the pressure of excelling in extracurricular activities, plus the dynamics of friendships, can act like \u201ca big pressure cooker,\u201d Ms. Lidji says. The load often splinters the family unit into a collective of adults and kids who interact more \u201clike housemates than a family,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey\u2019re all coming and going, and they don\u2019t see themselves as a unit.\u201d\n\nIn more extreme cases, a child acts out \u2013 steals money, mouths off, becomes belligerent, sometimes even threatens suicide. \u201cA lot of times the kid is saying \u2018I need you to hear me,\u2019 \u201d says Catherine Garcia-Brake, a social worker with Gwinnett Social Services in Atlanta. \u201cAnd the parents usually listen.\u201d\n\nThis is key because, in Lidji\u2019s experience, \u201cit\u2019s not so much fixing the child at all; it\u2019s really tweaking the family\u201d so that they can be more cohesive, and they can help each other put things in perspective. \u201cThat takes being intentional,\u201d she says, \u201cand that takes time, together.\u201d\n\nThe Boyds in Nashville, for example, early on instituted a list of \u201cnonnegotiables.\u201d Over the course of a week, fourth-grader Joey Boyd will attend Engineering for Kids, play on a sports team, take piano lessons, and sometimes voice lessons, too. His father, Samson Boyd, hopes Joey will keep a foot in multiple camps. \u201cMusic is always welcome, and sports,\u201d he says, provide a physical workout and teach important skills \u201cother than book smarts.\u201d He cites the usual pluses of leadership, teamwork, and \u201cmaking on-the-spot decisions\u201d along with another advantage: \u201cThe ultimate goal would be for him to achieve a sports scholarship that will help him pursue any field of study he chooses.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, however, Joey is squeezed between extracurriculars and a crushing load of homework \u2013 far more than Mr. Boyd remembers ever having himself. So one nonnegotiable is time spent outside, whether playing with neighborhood kids on the weekend or, on weekdays, chasing his dad in a game of tag while Mom cooks dinner. Which leads to another family must: \u201ceating together with no TV, no electronics, just conversation,\u201d says Boyd.\n\nThe US Census Bureau tracks shared family meals as a way to measure the well-being of children, because \u201cthis has always shown up as a strong indicator of parental engagement,\u201d explains Lynda Laughlin, a family demographer at the federal agency. Looking at data collected from 1996 through 2011, she found that some 67 percent of school-age children regularly had dinner with a parent. She points out that this proportion does not vary significantly with income levels or family makeup, whether a child lives with married parents or in a single-parent home.\n\nWhat the census numbers do not reveal, however, is whether \u201cyou are eating in the car or sitting at the table,\u201d says Ms. Laughlin. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask about the quality of the meals.\u201d\n\nJudging from the experience of many parents, the setting may not always be as important as just carving out time. For parents ferrying children to and from activities, says Lidji, car rides can prove a valuable tool. \u201cYou\u2019re not having eye contact. You\u2019re looking forward. You\u2019re in a confined space with a beginning and an end,\u201d she says, \u201cand it provides an opportunity to talk about things that are difficult face to face with an open-ended time frame.\u201d\n\nWhitman discovered this when her oldest first faced sex education in elementary school. \u201cHe was still riding in the back seat of the car, and he asked me all sorts of questions, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about him seeing the look of horror or embarrassment on my face,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\nThey had a great conversation, so when her next son was at the same stage, she stopped by his room. All she got were monosyllabic answers to her questions. Right, Whitman thought. Out came her gel pens. Soon, her boy found himself alone on a ride with her. Instead of one-word answers, they had a meaningful exchange, and she has since engineered one-child rides as often as possible.\n\n\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1\n\nDoris Ellington of South Bronx, N.Y., has found a way to create more meaningful time with her three children, too. During the week, the most time Ms. Ellington, a working mother, has to spend with her 11-year-old twins and 6-year-old daughter is at the end of the day at home.\n\nBut now that the children attend the after-school program of the Phipps Neighborhoods Cornerstone Center at Soundview Houses, all she has to do in the evening is check the twins\u2019 homework and read with the youngest. Then, after the nightly bathing ritual, the family still has an hour to relax together before bedtime.\n\nEllington considers herself fortunate, because Cornerstone is close by and free. And her kids love it. They are among the 60 students, kindergartners through middle-schoolers, who start arriving after school at 2:30 p.m. in wave after chattering wave.\n\nOver the next two hours, they do homework, research on the Internet, and play board games. Then they head into an elective where high-schoolers in Cornerstone\u2019s Youth Council and Young Men\u2019s Initiative often help run things. Depending on the day, it might be a poetry jam, math jeopardy, sports, or \u201carchitecture,\u201d in which kids figure out how to build a model of their dream car or house. One afternoon, some excitedly split off to rehearse a fashion show. While one teenager works the music from a laptop, kids of all ages strut, whirl, march, slink, and sometimes, to show off, drop into the splits. They share the same music, but the choreography has a personal flourish. It is easy to see why Cornerstone has 41 names on its waiting list.\n\nEllington\u2019s friends who don\u2019t have access to good, affordable after-school programs, she says, \u201chave other siblings picking their children up for them or they have a mother helping them out\u201d with transportation and homework. The older the children, the harder it gets. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this neighborhood for years,\u201d Ellington adds, \u201cand the teens out here, they just stay in the streets.\u201d\n\nAfter-school programs increasingly focus on providing enrichment, role models, access to computers, and homework assistance. Ellington has seen 11-year-old Delvin blossom from a shy child into a confident showman.\n\nBut Levey Friedman worries that isn\u2019t always enough. Without also learning to compete, she says, children will be at a disadvantage compared to \u201cthe upper-middle class kids who are developing these skills and being able to balance demands on their time and the pressure to perform.\u201d Again, Ellington is fortunate. Delvin\u2019s twin, Danaisha, has discovered a talent for volleyball and plays on the team against other centers.\n\nBack at the Clater Kaye Theatreworks in North Carolina, Whitman is ready to head out on the day\u2019s last round of color-coded pickups. As she leaves the lobby, she admits the frantic schedule leaves her little time for herself. Her husband travels frequently for work, so it is mostly up to her to deliver the one-two after-school punch. But it\u2019s worth it. The kids\u2019 full schedule \u201cdoesn\u2019t leave them any time to get into trouble \u2013 a bored mind will find something to do, and it\u2019s not always positive,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd,\u201d she adds, with a smile, \u201cI like to see them happy, engaged, and excelling at things.\u201d\n\nExperts like Rinehart and Laughlin hope more and more families find ways to be able to say the same.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "3dccee880bb226e2c2578fcc2f387a19", "sailthru.author": "Lee Lawrence", "description": "Today's young people are more overscheduled than at any time in history.
