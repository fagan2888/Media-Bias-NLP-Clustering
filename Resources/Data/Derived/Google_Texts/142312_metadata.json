Photo courtesy of Flickr, Mike Mozart\n\nPanera Bread, best known for its artisan sandwiches, soups, salads, and most notably the baked goods and breads from its bakery, is taking a greater stake in its customers\u2019 health. The restaurant franchise, nearly 2,000 chains strong, announced its menu items will include more plant-based proteins. More and more research demonstrates the benefits a meat-minimized diet could provide, and with the World Health Organization\u2019s recent announcement of the carcinogenic dangers of processed meat, now may be a better time than ever to seek out nutrients from plants.\n\n\u201cWe know that guests are increasingly seeking plant-based proteins for personal health reasons and/or to reduce their environmental impact,\u201d said Sara Burnett, Panera\u2019s director of wellness and food policy, in the press release. \u201cTo that end, we have been adding plant-based proteins like edamame and organic quinoa to our pantry of ingredients.\u201d\n\nPanera has carved out a reputation in the restaurant-chain industry as a dietary innovator. Its creativity has led to a wide variety of ingredient experiments, including stone ground breads, an increase of nuts and seeds, and healthy fats such as avocados.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first national chain that I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s ever said that,\u201d said Josh Balk, senior food policy director for the Humane Society of the United States, according to Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely significant.\u201d\n\nIn June 2015, Panera announced it was embarking on a mission to remove 150 artificial additive ingredients, along with expanding its menu to new customizable and transparent items, by 2016. Panera\u2019s menu is adaptable for all types of diet, whether you're vegan, vegetarian, gluten-conscious, or looking to bulk up on protein.\n\n\u201cIf you look at us as your ally in wellness, we\u2019re not making a stake in eating protein is better than another or being gluten-conscious is good or bad,\u201d Panera Bread head baker Tom Gumpel told Medical Daily back in June when we taste tested their new menu items. \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying that you can use us through our current pantry\u2019s huge subset of ingredients.\u201d\n\nCutting meat and finding protein in plants is one of the ways Panera gets creative. Encouraging Americans to choose a diet with less meat and more plant-based foods will reduce chronic and preventable diseases that account for 75 percent of all health care costs, according to a recent letter written by 700 leading doctors, dietitians, and public health experts.\n\n\u201cA diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health-promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nEating Vegetables for Protein:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "panera, bread, promotes, plant, based, diet, customers, how, eat, protein, without, meat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Panera Bread may be a trailblazer when it comes to promoting plant-based diets as a restaurant chain.", "title": "Panera Bread Wants You To Eat More Plant-Based Proteins", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/panera-bread-promotes-plant-based-diet-customers-how-eat-protein-without-meat-360456", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/05/panera-bread.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Panera Bread may be a trailblazer when it comes to promoting plant-based diets as a restaurant chain.", "title": "Panera Bread Wants You To Eat More Plant-Based Proteins", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/panera-bread-promotes-plant-based-diet-customers-how-eat-protein-without-meat-360456", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/05/panera-bread.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/05/panera-bread.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-11-05T16:14:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-05T16:14:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Panera Bread may be a trailblazer when it comes to promoting plant-based diets as a restaurant chain."}, "article_summary": "Vegetarian diets are becoming more popular, and Panera Bread wants to be a leading franchise in the trend.\nThe restaurant franchise, nearly 2,000 chains strong, announced its menu items will include more plant-based proteins.\n\u201cTo that end, we have been adding plant-based proteins like edamame and organic quinoa to our pantry of ingredients.\u201dPanera has carved out a reputation in the restaurant-chain industry as a dietary innovator.\nPanera\u2019s menu is adaptable for all types of diet, whether you're vegan, vegetarian, gluten-conscious, or looking to bulk up on protein.\n\u201cWe know that guests are increasingly seeking plant-based proteins for personal health reasons and/or to reduce their environmental impact,\u201d said Sara Burnett, Panera\u2019s director of wellness and food policy, in the press release."}
