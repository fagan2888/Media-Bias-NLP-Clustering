I look forward to working with the Governor to further conservative principles in the great state of Georgia,\u201d said GYR Chair Meagan Hanson.\n\nAmong the issues discussed were the Savannah port project\u2019s positive impact on growing trade opportunities with Latin American countries, the negative consequences of the Affordable Care Act on young Americans, and the importance of electing strong conservatives to all levels of public office.\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasure to spend time with our next generation of Republican leaders.
