For the restaurant industry, getting a peek into likely trends for 2015 provides some insight into the type of menu items that could give them smash successes in the year ahead\u2014or a glimpse of the staggering challenges they\u2019re left to overcome.\n\nNo matter which trends actually stick, there is at least one thing operators can be optimistic about: The economy is improving. The U.S. economy surged ahead 5 percent during 2014\u2019s third quarter, the strongest three-month period since 2003. That followed a 4.6 percent jump the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the National Restaurant Association\u2019s (NRA) Expectations Index, which measures operators\u2019 six-month outlook for same-store sales and other measures, stood at 102.1 in November, down only slightly from October\u2019s 102.5, its highest level since 2007. Anything over 100 represents expansion among the RPI\u2019s key metrics.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect national bakery chains to mill grain in house, but maybe there\u2019s a specialty sandwich or specialty bread made from the products of a local grain network.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, consumers remain concerned about their personal finances. An NRA survey found that nearly seven in 10 adults say they are holding back on spending, demonstrating the degree to which the Great Recession influenced their psyches.\n\n\u201cThe impact is still very real for many consumers,\u201d says NRA chief economist Bruce Grindy in an email. \u201cI do think their mindset is improving, though, and this will translate into more liberal spending habits as they become more confident in their own personal financial situations.\u201d\n\nThe NPD Group, a market research firm, projects that restaurant traffic will increase 1 percent in 2015, an improvement over a flat 2014 guest count.\n\n\u201cWe have to recognize consumers needs are changing, and we have to stay in tune with these changes in order to drive traffic,\u201d says Bonnie Riggs, senior restaurant analyst for NPD. \u201c[But] as much as things change, they are going to stay the same, because the pillars of good business still apply.\u201d\n\nTo help you stay in tune with those changes, we\u2019ve combed through industry predictions and talked with experts to come up with the nine trends that will make the biggest mark on the quick-service industry in the year ahead.\n\n1. Mobile technology affects everything\n\nThe technology focus for restaurants has made big strides toward mobile platforms. New developments can be seen in ordering, marketing, loyalty programs, and payment. Developers are increasingly combining these applications into a single solution, adding an additional layer of convenience that is important to limited-service restaurants.\n\nIn the U.S., mobile payments are expected to triple to nearly $9 billion in 2015, according to digital marketing firm eMarketer.\n\nJustin Massa, founder and chief executive of Food Genius, a food industry data and insight firm, says the industry can expect to see mobile innovations of all different kinds in 2015. Some will be similar to Starbucks\u2019 app, which integrates mobile ordering and the brand\u2019s loyalty program; others will be like Taco Bell\u2019s, which lets consumers customize orders, pay via mobile, and save favorite items. Many will be linked to Apple Pay. Whatever the form, \u201cthe opportunity for restaurants to capture the data of consumers is a treasure trove for them,\u201d Massa says.\n\nThe advice for restaurant owners from most experts is to take the plunge\u2014or else.\n\n\u201cLots of operators, especially smaller ones, have no idea how rapidly the tech world has already changed,\u201d says Michael Whiteman, president of consulting firm Baum + Whiteman, in an email. \u201cThey should start investigating now so they\u2019re not irrevocably behind the curve.\u201d\n\n2. Do-it-yourself health\n\nWhile fads may come and go, healthy eating\u2014especially the do-it-yourself style\u2014is here for the long haul. And 2015 will see customers\u2019 expectations for DIY health climb even higher.\n\n\u201cThere are people heavily into gluten-free, who care about [genetically modified organisms], who want low-fat or organic items, but there is no consensus about what is a healthy diet,\u201d says Rita Negrete, senior editor at market research firm Technomic. Still, she says, \u201cmore people really are trying to eat more healthfully, and that becomes an issue for restaurants in an era of shrinking menus.\u201d\n\nHealth-minded consumers often gravitate to places like Subway, Panera Bread, and Chipotle Mexican Grill that allow them to customize their orders, thus choosing their own healthful options. This extends to vegetarians and vegans, who are not only seeking healthier foods, but also have animal rights on their minds.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unclear is whether certain items are really better for you. But what\u2019s clear is we think they\u2019re healthier,\u201d Massa says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see how healthful [menu items] really are at the end of 2015, when menuboards are required to carry calorie counts.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally released its requirements for posting calories to menuboards in November, nearly five years after the requirements had been passed with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nHoyt Jones, president of Jersey Mike\u2019s Subs, says the company\u2019s experience posting calories to menuboards is that consumers are more conscious of the calories, but aren\u2019t likely to make any significant changes in their habits.\n\n\u201cPeople already tended to eat a little healthier,\u201d he says, noting that more consumers today choose chicken as a protein than ever before. The chain is also testing gluten-free bread and snacks \u201cfor people who can\u2019t or won\u2019t eat gluten.\u201d\n\n3. Looking to Gen Z\n\nIf you think Millennials are bold in their food selections, take a look at their successors, Generation Z.\n\n\u201cKids today are much more adventuresome when it comes to eating, and more willing to try new things,\u201d NPD\u2019s Riggs says. \u201cWhen they get past six years of age, they don\u2019t want to order from a kids\u2019 menu, but from a regular menu.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s palates are considerably more sophisticated than they were a couple decades ago, says Annika Stensson, the NRA\u2019s senior manager of research communications. \u201cThey\u2019ve had more exposure through their parents, who make up the first generation to dine out on a daily basis,\u201d she says. \u201cThat has trickled down to the kids\u2019 space.\u201d\n\nGen Z members still like pizza, chicken, and pasta, but today are looking for variations on those themes, says Sharon Olson, executive director of the Culinary Vision Panel, which looks at culinary trends. For example, they might be interested in ordering chicken teriyaki or chicken parmesan. \u201cBeing able to choose different condiments and toppings make eating a safe adventure,\u201d she says.\n\nYounger diners also want heightened experiences, louder music, and kinetic visuals.\n\n\u201cThis is the first true digital generation, so they are even more impatient than Millennials,\u201d Technomic\u2019s Negrete says. \u201cFast service is critical for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Every time a new year gets under way, there\u2019s a combination of promise and anxiety, a very real hope that better days are ahead mixed with uneasiness about what issues or problems may be lying in wait.
