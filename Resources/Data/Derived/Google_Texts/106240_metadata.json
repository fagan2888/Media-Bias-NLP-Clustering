Dan Sullivan, like other Republicans in Congress, is on a two-day retreat in Hershey Penn. Speakers include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Jay Leno. Meanwhile, Sullivan Chief of Staff Joe Balash provided APRN a status report at the senator\u2019s office.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nIt\u2019s not the typical Senate office. To get there, you go past the polished marble of the Senate office buildings and down to the basement, to a tunnel that connects two buildings. In the tunnel, across from a supply room, next to a freight elevator, you\u2019ll find a doorway that leads to Sullivan\u2019s office suite: four windowless rooms, some with cinder-block walls. A few other freshmen senators are on the same hallway.\n\nBalash, who officially became chief of staff barely more than a week ago, says he\u2019s not bothered by the surroundings.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re fine. They\u2019re right on Capitol Hill. They\u2019re indoors. They\u2019re not the portable buildings some (Senators) have been saddled with in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re pleased.\u201d\n\nThe bunker-like rooms are just temporary. But it may be a while before they get out of that basement, because a new senator can\u2019t just take the office vacated by his predecessor. A more senior senator might want it. That swap would leave a different office empty, and again, seniority determines who can call dibs. Sullivan is dead last in seniority, so he has to wait out a lot of office swaps.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019ve told us to expect to be here until June,\u201d Balash says, \u201cbut based on how long it took them to get computers, it\u2019s probably more like August.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he expects to have 30 staffers in Washington, but it\u2019ll have to wait until after the move.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have enough desks here to fully round out the staff. So for now we\u2019re going to be asking people to do more than one job, \u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nThe seven current staffers in the D.C. suite do all have computers now. They have phones. Business cards are on the way.\n\nMeanwhile, Sullivan has co-sponsored his first bills, one approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, another to improve mental health care for veterans.\n\nThe official website is still a work in progress. Balash says they\u2019re planning to integrate software on the website to help them handle data from constituent messages.\n\n\u201cAs we get contacts and inquiries from the public, from the public, it\u2019s all going through a single system so that we track and make sure we understand and are monitoring what it is people care about, what topics are hitting on particular news cycles, that sort of thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThey\u2019ve hired a legislative director, one of the top positions on a Senate staff. He is Peter Henry, who previous worked for Missouri senators. Balash says Henry has never been to Alaska.\n\n\u201cWe needed, and recognized the need, for a person to come into our leg director spot who\u2019s from the Senate, of the Senate, a creature of the Senate, and Peter\u2019s been working in the Senate for 10 years,\u201d said Balash.\n\nBalash, like the new senator, is a former state commissioner of Natural Resources. He has no congressional experience, so he says Henry is just what they needed, and he added, Henry plans to visit the state next month.\n\nThe other big hire is Amanda Coyne, co-founder of the Alaska Dispatch website and, until she stopped a few days ago, a popular blogger on Alaska politics. Coyne will be Sullivan\u2019s speechwriter and a senior advisor. Balash says Coyne can present a different perspective to the staff.\n\nIn particular, what we were seeking was somebody who would prevent us from suffering from an echo chamber.\n\nAs he sees it, Coyne rode Sullivan hard in her blog, on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, which she favors. Back in October, Coyne wrote that Sullivan displayed a \u201cfundamental lack of understanding of health care\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear interested,\u201d although at other times she had a lot of praise for the candidate, too.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is Amanda is just a phenomenal writer,\u201d Balash said, \u201cand bringing the communications skill set to bear on his job of communicating with Alaskans, with the public, is something that will help him do a better job, help Alaskans understand what he\u2019s doing, why he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nHe says Coyne will start in February.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "U.S. Sen.
