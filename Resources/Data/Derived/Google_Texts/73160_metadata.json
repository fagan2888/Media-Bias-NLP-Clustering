If funding is cut, dependency will rest on non-government and private contributors. The fallacy surrounding Planned Parenthood is that it only performs abortions. Yet abortions account for 3 percent of its medical services. The other services they provide to our community \u2014 such as STI/STD testing and treatment, contraception, and cancer screening and prevention \u2014 are extremely beneficial and essential. In the society we live in today, contraception is a necessity for most people. The best way to reduce the need for abortion is to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies.\n\nThe advantages of abortions for the individual and for society outweigh the disadvantages. One interesting speculation was made by Professor John Donohue of Stanford Law School and Steven Levitt. As summarized in \"Nothing Is Sacred: Economic Ideas for the New Millenium\" by Robert J. Barro, \"children who were not born would have been disproportionately likely to grow up in poverty and on welfare with a young and poorly educated single parent. Because these factors are known to breed crime, the children not born would have been prime candidates to be criminals 15 to 25 years later. Hence, the absence of these children contributes to the drop in crime rates since 1991.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlanned Parenthood contributes to our community more than we think. The taboo surrounding sex and anything relating to that is outdated and needs to be embraced rather than concealed. The more educated our society is about reproductive health, the less likely unintended pregnancies and STI/STDS will occur. Cutting funding for this vital health service will only have negative repercussions.\n\nKaitlynn Boardman\n\nLongmont", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/letterstotheeditor/ci_29114618/kaitlynn-boardman-planned-parenthood-is-good-society", "modificationDate": "2015-11-14T13:35:54-0700", "sailthru.section": "Letters to the Editor", "endDate": "2025-11-13T17:16:13-0700", "description": "The misconceptions surrounding the services Planned Parenthood provides women and men are misguided at best, dangerously illogical at worst.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29114618:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-15T01:34:19-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/letterstotheeditor/ci_29114618/kaitlynn-boardman-planned-parenthood-is-good-society", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "The misconceptions surrounding the services Planned Parenthood provides women and men are misguided at best, dangerously illogical at worst.", "title": "Kaitlynn Boardman: Planned Parenthood is good for society"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The misconceptions surrounding the services Planned Parenthood provides women and men are misguided at best, dangerously illogical at worst.", "title": "Kaitlynn Boardman: Planned Parenthood is good for society", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/opinion/letterstotheeditor/ci_29114618/kaitlynn-boardman-planned-parenthood-is-good-society", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-15T01:34:19-0700", "sailthru.title": "Kaitlynn Boardman: Planned Parenthood is good for society", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-11-14T13:36:34-0700", "news_keywords": "opinion editorial editorials letters editor Longmont Times Call"}, "article_summary": "The misconceptions surrounding the services Planned Parenthood provides women and men are misguided at best, dangerously illogical at worst.\nThe fallacy surrounding Planned Parenthood is that it only performs abortions.\nForty-one percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue comes from government health services, grants and reimbursements.\nThe more educated our society is about reproductive health, the less likely unintended pregnancies and STI/STDS will occur.\nThe best way to reduce the need for abortion is to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies."}
