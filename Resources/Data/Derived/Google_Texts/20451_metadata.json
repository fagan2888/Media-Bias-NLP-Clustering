Each year, protests, marches, lectures and other events to mourn their ancestors\u2019 dispossession are held in Palestinian communities across Israel.\n\nYet, since 2011, Israeli legislation has made mourning the Nakba publicly difficult for Palestinians and others in Israel. The \u201cNakba Law\u201d authorises Israel\u2019s finance minister to revoke funding from institutions that reject Israel\u2019s character as a \u201cJewish state\u201d or mark the country\u2019s Independence Day as a day of mourning.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAlthough the Nakba Law has yet to be technically implemented, human rights groups and activists say it has a dangerous deterrent effect and is meant to intimidate Palestinians and others who view Israel\u2019s establishment as a day of mourning for Palestinians.\n\nAmong those who could be potentially affected by the Nakba Law is Zochrot, an Israeli non-governmental organisation that aims to keep the memory of the 1948 events alive and promotes the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees.\n\n\u201cWithout actually implementing the Nakba Law, [the law] has been used as an excuse to limit freedom of expression. It has a chilling effect,\u201d said Sawsan Zaher, lawyer at Adalah.\n\n\u201cThe Nakba Law is part of an atmosphere to suppress the Nakba narrative and a discussion of the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees,\u201d Liat Rosenberg, director of Zochrot, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThese are right-wing, anti-democratic efforts [that] continue to create an atmosphere of fear and suppress this issue from the public discourse.\u201d\n\nBack in February, Yona Yahav, mayor of the central Israeli city of Haifa, withdrew municipal funding for a Zochrot film festival about the Nakba. The event was scheduled to be held at the local cinema the week before Israel\u2019s Independence Day, marked this year on April 23, but it was cancelled in the end.\n\nRead the rest of the story at Al Jazeera.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although the Nakba Law has yet to be technically implemented, human rights groups and activists say it has a dangerous deterrent effect and is meant to intimidate Palestinians and others who view Israel's establishment as a day of mourning for Palestinians.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Patrick O.
