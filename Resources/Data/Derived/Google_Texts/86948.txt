A feeling of change is in the air at one local church.

Calvary Assembly of God Church in Meridian celebrated its 50th anniversary Saturday. Instead of focusing on themselves, the church chose to host a community outreach event. Hamburgers, watermelons, and more was served at the gathering that included over 100 people ranging from actual members of the church to various members of the community and other surrounding churches.

"It's very important for the churches to let the different communities know that we still exist, we're still here, and we still love them, the community, and want them to come out and be a part of us. That's the only way we're going to change the situation that we're living in, is to start changing the people," pastor Jerry Jackson says.

Special guest speaker Bob Wilborn is also a part of the event.
