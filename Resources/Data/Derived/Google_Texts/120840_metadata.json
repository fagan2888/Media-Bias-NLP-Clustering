This increased mindfulness could improve decision-making and overall quality of care, potentially lowering the infection rate.\n\n\"Getting our medical professions to slow down and pay attention can have a big impact on patient safety--and their own lives as well,\" says Ring.\n\nPatients benefit in other ways as well. Psychological support from mindful nurses has been shown to decrease patient pain and stress during hospital procedures, FierceHealthcare has reported. Patients who received mindfulness intervention with nurses telling them to imagine a safe place during cardiac ablation report they experienced less pain than those who received no mindfulness intervention.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read Ring's article\n\n- check out the Tufts study (.pdf)\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNurse mindfulness can decrease patient pain, stress during procedures\n\nMindful physicians have more satisfied patients\n\n5 ways to reduce hospital-acquired infections\n\n1 in 25 patients acquire hospital infections", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although hospitals follow recommended guidelines to reduce\u00a0hospital-acquired infections, a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0columnist\u00a0says they will never work until healthcare providers try another approach: Mindful meditatio", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although hospitals follow recommended guidelines to reduce\u00a0hospital-acquired infections, a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0columnist\u00a0says they will never work until healthcare providers try another approach: Mindful meditatio", "title": "Can meditation lower the rate of hospital-acquired infections?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/can-meditation-lower-rate-hospital-acquired-infections/2015-02-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital infection control,hospital-acquired infections,infections,meditation,mindful physicians,mindfulness,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction,Tufts University,Washington Post", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b1d\"", "article_summary": "Although hospitals follow recommended guidelines to reduce hospital-acquired infections, a Washington Post columnist says they will never work until healthcare providers try another approach: Mindful meditation.\nMeditation can help healthcare providers keep a \"moment-by-moment awareness [of] thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment,\" Ring says.\nPsychological support from mindful nurses has been shown to decrease patient pain and stress during hospital procedures, FierceHealthcare has reported.\nTo learn more:- read Ring's article- check out the Tufts study (.pdf)Related articles:Nurse mindfulness can decrease patient pain, stress during proceduresMindful physicians have more satisfied patients5 ways to reduce hospital-acquired infections1 in 25 patients acquire hospital infections\nPreventable infections contracted during hospital stays kill as many Americans as AIDS, breast cancer and car accidents combined, according to a new study by Tufts on unnecessary deaths."}
