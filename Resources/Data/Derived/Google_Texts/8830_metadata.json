He switched from violin to guitar between songs, occasionally lending his voice to the mix as well.\n\nOn its face, Herrada\u2019s \u201csecond life\u201d as a musician looks a lot different from his day job as health equity coordinator for health insurer PacificSource Community Solutions. But the way he sees it, his music is not only related, but an extension of what he does for PacificSource, which administers care for Central Oregon\u2019s Medicaid population, people under the Oregon Health Plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about giving,\u201d he said.\n\nAt PacificSource, Herrada makes sure the doctors and other providers who treat minority groups \u2014 Latinos, Native Americans, people who are homeless or LGBT individuals \u2014 truly understand the cultures of those groups.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like in music: When he\u2019s trying to reach a specific outcome with a melody, he\u2019ll work for hours \u2014 even days or months \u2014 until he gets it right. Why? To communicate something to other people.\n\nIn both cases, \u201cYour actions are building communication with other people instead of damaging other people\u2019s interests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do when you\u2019re a musician is that people will leave the room.\u201d\n\nBuilding communication\n\nAfter nearly four years in Bend, Herrada has had a big impact on locals\u2019 access to health care and on how they\u2019re treated once they\u2019re in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nBefore assuming his role at PacificSource two years ago, he worked at the nonprofit Latino Community Association, where he helped Latino individuals and families learn about the health care resources available to them, including enrolling them in health insurance if they were eligible.\n\nUnless people are permanent residents for five years or citizens, they don\u2019t qualify for OHP or tax credits to help buy private health insurance, said Brad Porterfield, executive director of the Latino Community Association.\n\n\u201cMost of our adult immigrant parents don\u2019t qualify,\u201d he said.\n\nUndocumented immigrants are eligible, however, for a program that covers the cost of emergency medical expenses. Their U.S.-born children also likely qualify for the Oregon Health Plan. The problem is, lots of Latino parents are under the misconception that signing up for such programs \u2014 and, in so doing, revealing information about themselves \u2014 will get them deported. Porterfield said Herrada has made strides in dispelling that myth.\n\nPorterfield said he could tell in Herrada\u2019s time at the Latino Community Association how much seeing immigrants\u2019 struggles affected him.\n\n\u201cHe got kind of choked up talking about how much the families suffer here in certain ways, just not being eligible for a lot of things and having their immigration status hanging over their heads,\u201d he said.\n\nWorking toward equity\n\nAt PacificSource, Herrada\u2019s role is to ensure the specific health care needs of all minority groups are met \u2014 and not just ethnic minorities. His work extends to, for example, military veterans and seasonal workers, those who live in other states but come to Oregon temporarily for work.\n\nIt\u2019s a role he\u2019s well-suited for, given his inclusive personality and previous work at the Latino Community Association.\n\n\u201cThe (Affordable Care Act) has opened many doors for many people,\u201d Herrada said, \u201cbut not all communities came to the same place. That\u2019s where the concept of equity makes a difference. Some people need a little more help.\u201d\n\nLupus, for example, tends to be deadlier for Native American women because it\u2019s diagnosed later, making it more difficult to treat, Herrada said.\n\n\u201cIn that case, what we need to decide is appropriate strategies to reach these communities and let them know about the risk of this and try to get them diagnosed earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nDiabetes also tends to strike minority groups at higher rates, a problem Herrada said he\u2019s trying to learn more about and eventually design strategies to solve.\n\nHe\u2019s also trying to alleviate a major barrier to health care for Latino patients who don\u2019t speak English: the dearth of medical interpreters in Central Oregon and providers\u2019 lack of understanding about how to use them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a serious problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the patient doesn\u2019t understand the directions or the importance of the diagnosis, then you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nHerrada works as a medical interpreter at Volunteers in Medicine in Bend, a clinic that provides free care for individuals who don\u2019t have insurance. He also serves as a board member for Mosaic Medical, a federally qualified health center that serves a large proportion of the region\u2019s Oregon Health Plan population.\n\nScott Johnson, Mosaic\u2019s board chair, said Herrada has provided the board important connections to not only the Latino community, but to other underserved groups in the area.\n\n\u201cWe need people on the board who can give us insight and really help us understand, \u2018What do we need to do to be able to communicate and receive people in a way that they want to come back and get care?\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at giving us that insight and helping us be more proactive so that there is less barriers to people getting the help that they might need.\u201d\n\nA musical upbringing\n\nHerrada grew up in Puebla, Mexico, a city southeast of Mexico City in a valley surrounded on all sides by mountains and volcanoes.\n\nHe comes from an artistic family: piano music and singing were commonplace in his childhood home. Today, his sister works as a painter and sculptor.\n\nThe violin was his favorite instrument in high school. He said he\u2019d spend \u201chours and hours\u201d practicing.\n\nWhen Herrada was 15, the musician and teacher who would become his mentor took him to several communities across Mexico to learn about local styles of music and speech. They stayed with locals, riding horses and learning about their instruments.\n\nMexico City\u2019s chamber orchestra awarded him a grant that allowed him to study violin in Mexico City for two years, between 1984 and 1986. He spent the next two years traveling throughout Europe performing with the Mexican band Tierra. The group performed in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. In addition to Spanish, his native language, Herrada is fluent in English and French and speaks some Italian and German.\n\nHerrada earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in music and master\u2019s degree in musicology and ethnomusicology from l\u2019Universite de Montreal. He also earned a master\u2019s degree in art history and Novohispanic Art at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in 2008.\n\nBefore moving to the U.S. in 2010, Herrada worked in a number of social service positions in his hometown in Mexico. From 1998 to 2008, he worked as a music professor and supervised the social service programs at the Universidad de las Americas-Puebla.\n\nThat university reminds Herrada of Bend, in a way: an oasis in the middle of a desert.\n\n\u201cYou have a very rich university in the high desert mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s green, there\u2019s grass, surrounded by a lot of poverty and communities that are like 500 years ago: no electricity or water.\u201d\n\nThe head of the university knew Herrada was concerned about the surrounding areas and directed him to bring his students there to teach people about art, music, theater and sports. Herrada\u2019s team set up facilities with libraries and other activities.\n\n\u201cThe results were amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn one town, they grouped together a team of young kids to play soccer.\n\n\u201cThey were very bad,\u201d Herrada said, laughing. \u201cThey were really very bad.\u201d\n\nLuckily, though, one of Herrada\u2019s students was a talented player. He coached the students and helped boost their confidence. In the end, the team became state champions.\n\n\u201cOnly because they understood they could win,\u201d Herrada said. \u201cWe just provided the ball and the connections to make it happen.\u201d\n\nThat work wasn\u2019t just for the people living in those communities. He wanted to instill in his students a sense of empathy.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a lawyer or whatever profession to become somebody who is going to prey on society,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want someone who is going to serve and you have this only if they can reflect.\u201d\n\nBefore beginning his job at the Latino Community Association in 2013, Herrada worked as a flamenco guitarist under the name Miguel de Alonso. Alonso is the name of Herrada\u2019s 17-year-old son. In Mexico, it\u2019s common for musical performers\u2019 stage names to include the names of family members, Herrada said.\n\nLike his father, Alonso, a student at Bend High School, started playing the violin early, at just 4 years old.\n\nDespite all he\u2019s accomplished, Herrada said he can\u2019t take credit on his own. He was merely ready when opportunity appeared, prepared by great mentors.\n\n\u201cI have good friends that have taught me love, understanding and communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just learning. It\u2019s not me.\u201d \u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a recent Saturday night, diners at a Mexican restaurant in downtown Bend were treated to lively ethnic music: guitar and clarinet played a sultry melody over a rhythmic drum beat.
