That was precisely one dollar below VA\u2019s charging limit for purchase cards.\n\nWhen word reached Congress about the $54,435,743 worth of prosthetics bought under such odd circumstances over two years \u2014 the subject of an inspector general investigation announced Monday \u2014 lawmakers demanded details. But they were told there was no documentation.\n\nVA officials had prepared to tell Congress that the records had been destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, according to previously undisclosed records, until a senior adviser in the Secretary\u2019s office pointed out that the timing was wrong and the excuse wouldn\u2019t hold up.\n\nThe Bronx case was one of several acquisition practices Jan R. Frye described in an internal memo to Secretary Robert McDonald that accused the VA of mismanaging how its buys medical care and supplies for veterans.\n\nVeterans Affairs improperly spent $6 billion annually, senior official says\n\n\n\nFrye, deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics, described a culture of \u201clawlessness and chaos\u201d at the Veterans Health Administration, the massive health-care system for 8.7 million veterans. He said the agency has been spending at least $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules to pay for medical care and supplies, wasting taxpayer money and putting veterans at risk.\n\nPurchase cards are an appropriate way to acquire supplies or medical care that costs up to $3,000, Frye testified at a House hearing in May. But above that limit, the cards can be used for payment only if there is a certified invoice linked to a properly awarded contract. He said he suspected that the thousands of prosthetics put on cards in $24,999 increments was a sign that contracting staff was trying to get around writing contracts.\n\nHouse members berate VA over billions in alleged improper spending\n\nThe Bronx case tipped Frye off to a wider use of purchase cards he said run afoul of federal rules. During an 18-month period that ended last year, he documented that up to $1.2 billion in prosthetics were bought with cards and without contracts, he testified.\n\nActing Inspector General Richard Griffin, responding to a request from New York Rep. Kathleen Rice, a Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, is now looking into the prosthetics purchases as part of a wide-ranging review of Frye\u2019s allegations. McDonald, after reading the 35-page memo, referred the contents to the agency\u2019s watchdog.\n\nVA officials had received an inquiry from Congress in September 2012 about the Bronx payments, but a letter signed by former secretary Eric Shinseki did not go out until July 2013. The agency had prepared to say that the records had been transferred to VA\u2019s medical center in Manhattan, where they were destroyed in Hurricane Sandy, documents obtained by The Post show.\n\nVA admits it has no contracts in place for billions spent on veterans\u2019 medical care\n\n\n\nBut in reviewing the claim that the records had been destroyed, a senior adviser in Shinseki\u2019s office was skeptical. \u201cGemma \u2014 this isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d the adviser wrote in an e-mail obtained by The Post.\n\n\u201cThe [congressman\u2019s] letter was dated 26 Sept and the storm was 28 October. Yet we talk about visits in December 2012 and again in January. Not clear why we didn\u2019t figure out in December that we lost the records and had to go back in January,\u201d he wrote in April 2013.\n\n\u201cThis is not cleared.\u201d\n\nRice said in a statement Monday, \u201cThe damage caused by Superstorm Sandy was devastating and far-reaching, but the claim that all of these documents were destroyed strikes me as all too convenient and must be substantiated. We need to know exactly what happened to the documents, how and why this money was spent without written contracts, and who is accountable.\u201d\n\nThe letter that finally went to Congress, signed by Shinseki, said simply:\n\n\u201cNo contract files exist\u201d and \u201cthere is no evidence of full and open competition\u201d for the prosthetics bought in the Bronx.\n\nThis article was published originally in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The payments couldn\u2019t help but catch the attention of the top procurement official\u00a0at", "title": "Here\u2019s One Shocking Way the VA Wastes $6 Billion a Year of Taxpayer Money", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/16/Here-s-One-Shocking-Way-VA-Wastes-6-Billion-Year-Taxpayer-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06222014_Veterans_Affairs_Building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/16/Here-s-One-Shocking-Way-VA-Wastes-6-Billion-Year-Taxpayer-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06222014_Veterans_Affairs_Building.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The payments couldn\u2019t help but catch the attention of the top procurement official\u00a0at", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Purchase cards are an appropriate way to acquire supplies or medical care that costs up to $3,000, Frye testified at a House hearing in May.\nThe payments couldn\u2019t help but catch the attention of the top procurement official at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nHe said the agency has been spending at least $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules to pay for medical care and supplies, wasting taxpayer money and putting veterans at risk.\nDuring an 18-month period that ended last year, he documented that up to $1.2 billion in prosthetics were bought with cards and without contracts, he testified.\nVA admits it has no contracts in place for billions spent on veterans\u2019 medical careBut in reviewing the claim that the records had been destroyed, a senior adviser in Shinseki\u2019s office was skeptical."}
