The poster features six Datsuns beneath a golden desert sunrise. \u201cThe dawn of a new era,\u201d its tagline reads.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for all of about three months before the principal investor pulled his money out and went home,\u201d said Lloyd Wayne Reece, president of the Las Vegas Electric Vehicle Association.\n\nThree decades later, electric vehicle sales, though growing, still represent a small fraction of total car sales in the United States. The new era Lectra Motors promised has not dawned.\n\nBut in fits and starts, tinkerers, dreamers and entrepreneurs in the valley have retrofitted, manufactured and assembled electric batteries for the road, the skies, the military and medicine.\n\nThese are a few of the valley\u2019s power players in the electric car business.\n\nLOCAL MOTORS\n\nPhoenix-based Local Motors, which has a hub downtown, is pursuing an alternate manufacturing approach. The company offers a 3-D-printed car, the Strati, which features an electric engine that can take it 62 miles on one charge.\n\nIt takes 44 hours to print the car, Local Motors officials say, and the company plans to reduce production time to 24 hours. The goal is to have the car cleared for the road by 2016.\n\nThe downtown Las Vegas microfactory employs two full-time staffers and additional employees during peak seasons. The location, which includes a retail space, soon will house a large-scale 3-D printer.\n\n\u201cLas Vegas is an important hub for the future of electric vehicles, and we\u2019re glad to be a part of it,\u201d spokesman Adam Kress said.\n\nWithin the next 10 years, the company hopes to open 100 microfactories around the globe.\n\nXTREME GREEN ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n\nXtreme Green Electric Vehicles Inc. runs a 50,000-square-foot factory in North Las Vegas specializing in rugged vehicles. The company has clients in the United States and internationally, in South Africa, Saudi Arabia and a number of South American countries.\n\n\u201cWe are rapidly working on expanding our overseas presence because they seem to really understand the value of our electric vehicles,\u201d founder and CEO Neil Roth said.\n\nRoth started his company in the valley because he lives here. But Nevada is a good place to do business \u2014 the leasing conditions and tax incentives are beneficial, he says.\n\nRoth, who praised Gov. Brian Sandoval\u2019s administration for its focus on creating jobs and diversifying the economy, will travel with the governor to Poland this summer on a trade mission.\n\nFor now, XTreme focuses exclusively on manufacturing outdoor utility vehicles, ATVs and service vehicles for police departments, park services and universities. Not only are the vehicles electric and green, but keeping them running is cheaper than gasoline, he said. For every $1,000 spent on gas, Roth said, only about $10 is spent on electric.\n\nBy producing ATVs and utility vehicles, Xtreme has carved out a steady niche for itself. But the company hasn\u2019t reached the point of branching out into consumer products.\n\n\u201cWe need to expand and create the cash flow we need to go into that business,\u201d Roth said.\n\nMIMS MOTORS\n\nTalk to Eric Mims, CEO of Mims Motors, for five minutes, and he will present in detail his vision to market an electric car to the masses.\n\nMims claims to have developed a two-seater prototype that can travel, on a single charge, more than three times the distance of the Tesla Model S, which achieves a range of 270 miles.\n\nMims said recently his company was $2.1 million and 48 weeks away from being able to put cars on the road and up for sale. The company still is raising funds but is taking pre-orders on its website.\n\nK2 ENERGY\n\nIn Henderson, K2 Energy manufactures rechargeable lithium iron phosphate batteries, which K2 officials say are safer than the lithium-ion batteries favored by Tesla. Lithium-ion batteries can explode.\n\n\u201cWhen you have troops involved, or in a medical situation, you want the safest batteries on the market,\u201d marketing director Lysle Oliveros said.\n\nNine years ago, K2 started with about four employees and a couple of card tables. It since has grown to include about 65 employees.\n\nK2 doesn\u2019t specifically focus on cars, but Oliveros says the company\u2019s batteries are in a lot of vehicles \u2014 including retrofitted older hybrids and many cars produced by high-end manufacturers.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to justify breaking into the consumer market when many mainstream manufacturers get batteries at a discount, Oliveros said.\n\n\u201cThe margins on most cars are really, really low,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sustain that market, especially if the demand isn\u2019t super high.\u201d\n\nCurrently, K2\u2019s batteries are in major airline jets, power scooters and the Navy\u2019s electromagnetic railgun, a projectile launcher. And the firm is open to expanding its portfolio.\n\n\u201cWe will always have an eye on electric vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cAlways. Right now, the dream is to be completely electric, but the lifestyle is not ready for that.\u201d\n\nHOBBYIST VEHICLES\n\nThen there are the Las Vegas Valley tinkerers.\n\nBob Brandys, a member of the Las Vegas Electric Vehicle Association for five years, took a page from Christopher Lloyd\u2019s character in \u201cBack to the Future\u201d and retrofitted a DeLorean with a lithium-ion battery. Brandys said he chose the DeLorean for its fiberglass body and its \u201ccoolness factor.\u201d (Tesla borrowed DeLorean\u2019s vertical-opening doors for its Model X.)\n\n\u201cIf you make an electric vehicle, you want it to look futuristic,\u201d Brandys said.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Brandys has participated in the DeLorean Car Show, transporting his car as far as Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to show it off.\n\nBut even Brandys concedes that retrofitting a classic car like the DeLorean doesn\u2019t make sense for most consumers. Unlike most drivers who turn to electric vehicles to save on gas, Brandys rebuilt his car as a hobby. He calls it a \u201cgrown-up toy\u201d and admits it isn\u2019t very useful for driving long distances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a real functional electric vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\nIf drivers plan their day well, they can get around Las Vegas without needing to charge their vehicles, said Reece, of the Las Vegas Electric Vehicle Association. But longer distances remain a challenge.\n\nHe said the primary challenge for electric vehicles over the past several years has been convincing the American public to give up their gas guzzlers.\n\nLarry Gareffa wants to play a role in raising awareness about electric cars. He brings his \u201865 electric Mustang, nicknamed \u201cSparky,\u201d to First Friday, where he said about 1,000 people swing by each month to chat about it.\n\n\u201cMy thing is to get the word out to the ordinary people who might want to convert one of their cars into electric or buy an electric car,\u201d Gareffa said.\n\nReece, who taught a class last month at the College of Southern Nevada about converting gas engines to electric engines, said the governor should work to offer credits to consumers for going electric, especially given the $1.3 billion tax abatement the state gave to Tesla.\n\n\u201cWe have very few, if any, concessions on purchasing an electric car,\u201d Reece said. \u201cSince we\u2019re building the battery here, it would be nice to promote the industry.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Vegas Sun, http://www.lasvegassun.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long before Tesla announced plans to build a $5 billion electric battery factory near Reno, a local group for years had been tracking the quiet rev of the electric car industry in and around the valley.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Long before Tesla announced plans to build a $5 billion electric battery factory near Reno, a local group for years had been tracking the quiet rev of the electric car industry in and around the valley.", "title": "Race is on to make the best electric car in the valley", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/25/race-is-on-to-make-the-best-electric-car-in-the-va/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/25/ea82e96fb041f6207c0f6a7067006878.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/25/ea82e96fb041f6207c0f6a7067006878.jpg", "description": "Long before Tesla announced plans to build a $5 billion electric battery factory near Reno, a local group for years had been tracking the quiet rev of the electric car industry in and around the valle", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Race is on to make the best electric car in the valley"}, "Author": "DANIEL ROTHBERG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dc5\"", "article_summary": "XTREME GREEN ELECTRIC VEHICLESXtreme Green Electric Vehicles Inc. runs a 50,000-square-foot factory in North Las Vegas specializing in rugged vehicles.\nThese are a few of the valley\u2019s power players in the electric car business.\n\u201cWe have very few, if any, concessions on purchasing an electric car,\u201d Reece said.\nThree decades later, electric vehicle sales, though growing, still represent a small fraction of total car sales in the United States.\n\u201cMy thing is to get the word out to the ordinary people who might want to convert one of their cars into electric or buy an electric car,\u201d Gareffa said."}
