BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Kathy Bates calls herself “an old lion.”

The actress says she also plays one in the big-screen comedy “Tammy,” in theaters this weekend. Bates portrays Lenore, a successful entrepreneur who figuratively slaps sense into the film’s lovable loser of a titular character (Melissa McCarthy).

The 66-year-old “Misery” Oscar winner tells us more:

___

AP: I must admit I’m surprised to find you in this movie. You’ve done a few light comedies, such as Adam Sandler’s “The Waterboy.” But we’re used to seeing you in dramas.

Bates: I’d heard they (the creative team of McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone) wanted me for a part. I didn’t know what part. I told my agent, “I will play a giraffe with green spots, whatever they say.” (Laughs.)

AP: What was the appeal of McCarthy?

Bates: Even when she gets outrageous, when she gets on the most ridiculous jaunts and puts a bag on her head and all of that, you go with it, because it’s real. It’s grounded in reality. You almost believe, “Hey! I’d do that, too.”

AP: As Tammy and her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) careen out of control on their road trip, and in life, Lenore sets them both straight. She’s a role model.

Bates: I think of Lenore as an old lion. It’s taken her many years to create her business, to have a life for herself and (partner) Susanne (Sandra Oh). They met in college and I think they came out when it was very difficult for lesbians to be accepted.

AP: (The gay-cinema historian) Vito Russo would have loved that Lenore is incidentally gay. Her sexuality isn’t the point of the character.

Bates: What I love about the way we are portrayed in the film is that Susanne and Lenore are a normal, healthy couple, which says, “You can’t legislate who you love.”
