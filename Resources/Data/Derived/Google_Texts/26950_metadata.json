The struggle continues as state governments look to take back power they claim is rightfully theirs through a process called nullification.\n\nAlthough the application of the concept has started to take off more recently, the idea itself dates back to the late 1790s, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison penned the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, opposing the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nToday, a number of nullification bills have popped up in states across the country that addressing a wide range of issues.\n\nMultiple states, including Washington, Arizona, New Hampshire and Tennessee, have introduced legislation that bar state workers from cooperating with the National Security Administration\u2019s domestic spy program. Some bills, such as HB1533 in New Hampshire, even make it a Class-A misdemeanor if state employees are caught violating the proposed law.\n\nIn other states, such as Montana and Missouri, nullification bills have either been passed or introduced that refuse to recognize gun-control requirements made by the federal government. In 2009, Montana passed the Firearms Freedom Act, which prohibited federal regulations of guns manufactured within the state\u2019s borders. A federal appeals court struck down the act in August, citing the commerce clause.\n\nA host of states are challenging President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Indiana just introduced HB1406, which resists the enforcement of ACA guidelines. The Hoosier State joins South Carolina, Oklahoma and Georgia in doing so.\n\nSo, why all the recent outrage from the states? That question is debatable.\n\nGeoffrey Skelley, a political analyst with the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, says major legislation, such as the ACA, often creates tension and \u201cstrident disagreement.\u201d Skelley said he believes it\u2019s actually \u201chealthy\u201d because it \u201cforces us to have conversations about these issues.\u201d\n\nStill, others, such as Michael Maharrey of the Tenth Amendment Center, say it\u2019s the federal government overstepping its bounds. \u201cWe have an unlimited federal government today,\u201d said Maharrey. \u201cWe seem to let the federal government decide what its own powers are.\u201d\n\nThe Tenth Amendment Center is a nonprofit organization that is helping lead the charge in support of nullification.\n\nMaharrey points out that not all nullification bills take the same form. Some bills rely on the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine, meaning states simply don\u2019t enforce federal regulations. Others come from the idea of interposition, which tend to focus on making it illegal to comply with federal laws.\n\nBut the biggest question surrounding nullification is whether it\u2019s constitutional? Multiple rulings by the Supreme Court have upheld the federal government\u2019s power over the states.\n\nFor constitutional scholars such as Ilya Somin of the George Mason University School of Law, it all depends on how you define nullification.\n\n\u201cNot enforcing the law is perfectly constitutional, \u201csaid Somin. \u201cCreating laws that make it illegal to follow federal rules is not.\u201d\n\nSomin says if the federal government wants to enforce its rules, they will have to find the resources to do it themselves or better incentivize the states with more funding.\n\nThe biggest victory to date for nullifiers comes out the federal government\u2019s ban on marijuana. The Supreme Court ruled in the 2005 case of Gonzales v. Raich that the federal government can criminalize cannabis through the commerce clause.\n\nSince that ruling, more than 20 states have looked past the federal definition and legalized marijuana in some form, primarily for medical purposes. In November 2012, residents in Washington and Colorado voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\nVictories like these leave Maharrey hopeful for the movement\u2019s future. \u201cPeople will tell you this will never work, but it will win over time,\u201d said Maharrey. \u201cWhen the popular will is there, the federal government can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\n\nYou can contact Adam by emailing him at aulbricht@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The battle for power between states and the federal government has been raging since the ink was still wet on the freshly signed U.S. Constitution.
