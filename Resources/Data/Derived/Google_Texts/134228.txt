BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) — Matt Kenseth has the early lead at Bristol Motor Speedway, where rain is disrupting a Sprint Cup race for the second time this season.

The start to Sunday’s race was delayed nearly two hours. NASCAR dried the track in about 45 minutes, but drivers got in only 124 laps before rain forced a delay again.

The Feb. 23 season-opening Daytona 500 was stopped by rain for almost six hours before resuming for a frantic finish won by Dale Earnhardt Jr. before midnight.
