Like so many with the virus, she had felt constant fatigue. \"Now, I feel so much better. I'm in the gym. I'm eating.\"\n\nCarver said she doesn't know how she acquired hepatitis C, which is most common in the U.S. among baby boomers exposed before testing for the virus was developed in the early 1990s. Her best guess is that she might have been exposed from a blood transfusion during an operation, or when she got a tattoo, years ago.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "As debate rages over costly drugs like Gilead's Solvadi, patients caution: Treatment is priceless.", "news_keywords": "Hepatitis C, Solvadi, Gilead, health care, treatments, pharmaceuticals, high cost drugs", "author": "Bertha Coombs", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "As debate rages over costly drugs like Gilead's Solvadi, patients caution: Treatment is priceless.", "title": "For patients, costly hepatitis C cure is priceless", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/23/for-sovaldi-patients-expensive-hepatitis-c-cure-is-priceless.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/05/23/101700633-121224911.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As debate rages over costly drugs like Gilead's Solvadi, patients caution: Treatment is priceless.", "creator": "@BerthaCoombs", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/23/for-sovaldi-patients-expensive-hepatitis-c-cure-is-priceless.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/05/23/101700633-121224911.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "For Sovaldi patients, expensive hepatitis C cure is priceless", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Biotech and Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Pharmaceuticals, Health Care, US: News, Gilead Sciences Inc, Johnson & Johnson, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-05-23T09:33:05-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Biotech and Pharmaceuticals", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T11:48:29-0400", "tag": "Johnson & Johnson"}, "pageNodeId": 101700435, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9af3\"", "article_summary": "At the center of the debate over costly drugs is a hepatitis C treatment that costs $84,000.\nGilead's blockbuster drug Sovaldi has become a lightning rod in the debate over rising specialty drug prices.\nCarver said she doesn't know how she acquired hepatitis C, which is most common in the U.S. among baby boomers exposed before testing for the virus was developed in the early 1990s.\nFour weeks into treatment with Sovaldi, 55-year old Michelle Carver of New York said she feels better than she has in years.\nThe one thing is indisputable, for patients the drug works remarkably well."}
