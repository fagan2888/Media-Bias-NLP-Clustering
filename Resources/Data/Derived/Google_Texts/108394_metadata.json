The following year she decided to add the cotillion and debutant program.\n\nVincent said the debutant program is open to girls in Columbia high schools and will teach them the different social skills \u2014 like proper self image, manners and confidence \u2014 that will take the young women into adulthood.\n\n\"After the six months of preparation it cumulates into the cotillion; that's where they'll be able to show Columbia \u2014 their friends, family and community leaders and members \u2014 what they've learned,\" Vincent said.\n\nRashaya Miller, 19, was crowned last year's debutante queen and has come back to help with the future debutantes. Miller said during her time in the debutante program, besides learning how to curtsey and waltz, she also learned about sisterhood and the importance of teamwork. \"The most memorable experience was having your loved ones and friends come out and actually have some growth to show for,\" Miller said.\n\nMiller added she hopes to one day be a leader in a program like Ladies PASS, just like Vincent.\n\nKiona Hughes, 18, is a senior at Hickman High School. She had seen Vincent, who also goes to her church, working with other girls in her school, so one day she got up the courage to talk to Vincent and became involved with the debutant program. \"I'm learning about myself and how to get out of my comfort zone. Me doing the cotillion is a big step to build my confidence,\" Hughes said.\n\nChataqua Redmond, 14, a freshman at Hickman, said she's most excited for the ball where she and the other girls will get to wear white ball gowns and opera-length gloves. However, she said she's also learned a lot through the workshops. \"I've learned how to be mature about different situations and what I can do to better myself,\" she said.\n\nAlyssia Thorpe, 16, from Rock Bridge High School was one of the few girls who chose the poorly wrapped presents at the beginning of the workshop. Thorpe's gift was filled with makeup. Of the experience, Thorpe said she's learned how to dress like a lady. She said she used to wear sweatpants to school every day, but now she makes more of an effort to dress up.\n\nNine girls are in this year's debutante program.\n\nThe girls will be presented to society on April 6 at the Tiger Hotel.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"description": "When Erin Vincent asked her debutantes-to-be to pick a gift from the stack on the table, most of the girls went for the packages that were expertly wrapped.", "creator": "@karspory", "image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/73/c73674b0-6ac4-11e3-9254-0019bb30f31a/52b66fec72367.preview-800.jpg"}, "title": "Debutante program teaches social skills", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "When Erin Vincent asked her debutantes-to-be to pick a gift from the stack on the table, most of the girls went for the packages that were expertly wrapped.", "title": "Debutante program teaches social skills", "url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/debutante-program-teaches-social-skills/article_2b706f26-6aca-11e3-817d-10604b9f6eda.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/73/c73674b0-6ac4-11e3-9254-0019bb30f31a/52b66fe9f00e9.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C666", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "culture,education,erin vincent,ball gown,debutante", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "When Erin Vincent asked her debutantes-to-be to pick a gift from the stack on the table, most of the girls went for the packages that were expertly wrapped."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1980\"", "article_summary": "The following year she decided to add the cotillion and debutant program.\nOf the experience, Thorpe said she's learned how to dress like a lady.\nKiona Hughes, 18, is a senior at Hickman High School.\n\"After the six months of preparation it cumulates into the cotillion; that's where they'll be able to show Columbia \u2014 their friends, family and community leaders and members \u2014 what they've learned,\" Vincent said.\nThree years ago, Vincent was mentoring girls one day a week at Hickman High School."}
