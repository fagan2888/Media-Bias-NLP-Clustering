(The Wolf Cam, though, was our idea, but it didn\u2019t fly.)\n\nThis one was about the governor\u2019s proposal to reform property taxes, and the criticism of his plan seemed to be that he would replace property taxes with something else, raising other taxes. In that way, the criticism seemed to be that the governor didn\u2019t have some kind of magic wand that he could wave and make property taxes disappear, replenishing the state\u2019s coffers with money from the revenue fairy or something.\n\nIt was kind of dull. These things are. But at one point in the report, state Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County, appeared on screen to say that the governor\u2019s proposal was \u201cthe largest socialist redistribution plan I\u2019ve seen in Harrisburg.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\nIt seemed like an odd thing coming from Grove. He doesn\u2019t have a lengthy history of saying dumb things for the sake of rousing the rabble and arousing the tea party people who seem to believe that the very existence of government is a socialist plot to contaminate our precious bodily fluids. (That role, of course, is the domain of state Sen. Scott Wagner, R-York County, who can\u2019t seem to go a week without saying something dumb.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrowing the word \u201csocialist\u201d out there is like throwing a Christian into a lions\u2019 den. It\u2019s red meat for the base.\n\nIt gets thrown around a lot, mostly in reference to President Obama, because it would be considered bad form to constantly point out that the president is a black man. It\u2019s not like the president has done anything that could be considered socialist. He hasn\u2019t partially nationalized the big banks to protect them from failing; that was the last president, who wasn\u2019t called a socialist.\n\nConservatives always point to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as an example of socialism, when, in fact, it is based on ideas that conservatives came up with themselves to reform health care using the existing insurance industry. (The mandate was a conservative idea, too, in case you were wondering.)\n\nSo, in a way, \u201csocialist\u201d is the new black.\n\n(See what I did there?)\n\nBack to Wolf.\n\nGrove was saying that the governor is pushing \u201csocialist redistribution,\u201d which makes absolutely no sense. Yes, the governor wants to make sure that urban school districts are funded at fair levels. Urban school districts, like York city\u2019s, are broke and have little chance of recovering unless they get some money. Sure, the Legislature talks about other reforms and the brilliant idea of handing the job of educating kids over to invisible hand of the free market and the variety of hucksters and grifters who push that notion. But the bottom line is the bottom line. They need money.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201csocialism.\u201d It\u2019s called \u201cgoverning,\u201d which seems to be a foreign concept among the Mayberry Machiavellis that populate Harrisburg. Still, I was struck by this notion that Tom Wolf is a socialist.\n\nYou could look at his life and career objectively and come away with the opposite conclusion.\n\nHe took over his family business and nurtured it into a huge enterprise, leaving to serve in the Rendell administration as revenue secretary. In 2009, when the collapse of the housing market threatened the existence of his family business, he returned to the business and saved it. His business provides good jobs. It is dedicated to American manufacturers, creating jobs in this country and not Indonesia or China.\n\nHis business makes money. Lots of money.\n\nIf anything, he\u2019s capitalist.\n\nBy contrast, take a look at Seth Grove\u2019s professional career. His official bio only lists government work, and he was serving as chief of staff for Rep. Keith Gillespie, R-York County, when he ran for the Legislature in 2008. There was no mention of private sector employment.\n\nSo there\u2019s that.\n\nBut still, Grove may be on to something.\n\nSocialism is bad. We all know that. I mean, look at some of the terrible things that could be considered socialism, right here, in the land of the free. Social Security. It even has \u201csocial\u201d in its title. Medicare. Unlike Obamacare, Medicare is a government-run health insurance system. The Interstate Highway System. Socialism on a huge scale.\n\nAnd Wolf may be a socialist? The horror.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nVladimir Ilyich Ulyanov could have been considered a socialist. Actually, he was a Marxist, which is different in that it mandates nationalization of all private industry and property, but still, to a lot of people, it\u2019s the same thing.\n\nUlyanov was best known as Lenin, one of the founders of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which later evolved into the Soviet Union. He championed universal health care, free public education and civil rights for women. But \u2014 there\u2019s always a \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 he was also responsible for the oppression and executions of political opponents and creating a nation that crushed the governed, until it collapsed under its own weight. So there\u2019s that. (The Russian people are now happily governed by an oligarchy, a gaggle of kleptocrats whose over-arching philosophy of government is based on theft. Russians just can\u2019t seem to catch a break.)\n\nAnyway, Lenin and Tom Wolf.\n\nLenin was bald.\n\nTom Wolf is bald.\n\nLenin had a beard.\n\nTom Wolf has a beard.\n\nAnd think about this: You never see Wolf and Lenin at the same place at the same time.\n\nSure, Lenin\u2019s been dead for nearly 90 years. But still...\n\nReally makes you think.\n\nOr not.\n\nThat solves it.\n\nSeth Grove was right.\n\nMike Argento is a columnist for The York Daily Record, a sister newspaper of The Mercury.
