The increase in outpatient spending was driven almost entirely by price increases because associated changes in utilization were minimal, according to the study.\n\nChanges in physician-hospital integration were not associated with significant changes in inpatient spending, the authors said.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospital-physician-integration-driving-medical-prices-jama-study-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/patient-giving-doctor-money-feature-_1.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found higher healthcare prices for outpatient care linked to the financial integration between physicians and hospitals.", "title": "Hospital-physician integration driving up medical prices, JAMA study says"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/patient-giving-doctor-money-feature-_1.png"}, "description": "A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found higher healthcare prices for outpatient care linked to the financial integration between physicians and hospitals.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hospital-physician integration driving up medical prices, JAMA study says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found higher healthcare prices for outpatient care linked to the financial integration between physicians and hospitals.&#13; Financial integration between physicians and hospitals helps providers meet the challenges of new payment models and may enhances their bargaining power, according to JAMA Internal Medicine, a publication of JAMA.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The study found that over the four years, physician-hospital integration increased by a mean of 3.3 percentage points, with considerable variation across the metro areas.\nA new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found higher healthcare prices for outpatient care linked to the financial integration between physicians and hospitals.\nChanges in physician-hospital integration were not associated with significant changes in inpatient spending, the authors said.\nDuring this time, there was a mean increase of $75 per enrollee in annual outpatient spending, and a 3.1 percent increase in outpatient spending in 2012, according to the study.\nThe increase in outpatient spending was driven almost entirely by price increases because associated changes in utilization were minimal, according to the study."}
