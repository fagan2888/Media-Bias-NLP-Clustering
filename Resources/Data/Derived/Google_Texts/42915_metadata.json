Since 1960, the percentage of American households with a married couple raising their own children has dropped from 37 to 16 percent, while fewer than half of children today are living with heterosexual parents in their first marriage.\n\n\u201cFamilies are changing,\u201d said Liza Mundy, the director of New America\u2019s Breadwinning and Caregiving Program, and \u201cwill continue to change\u201d in ways that reflect a greater sense of social and cultural freedom of choice. Meanwhile, however, \u201cour social policies are still rooted in the ideas of 1960s.\u201d Institutions of government need to evolve \u201cto acknowledge the changes that have taken place in the family and to update and coordinate the social policies that serve families,\u201d said Mundy at a recent New America event.\n\n\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s a disconnect between today\u2019s lived experience and today\u2019s policies. So, she asked, how can government build effective social policy across a range of issues facing real-life multi-generational families\u2014rather than cookie-cutter caricatures from the 1960s?\n\nPresident Obama has attempted to answer that question with his recently released 2016 Budget, which aims to \u201chelp America\u2019s hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change.\u201d Now, the question on the table for Mundy and her fellow discussants is: will the proposal \u2013 which includes efforts to expand access to childcare and early learning, workforce training, and tax credits \u2013 achieve that lofty goal?\n\nOne facet of the budget stood out for most of the panelists, and made them optimistic: its focus on collaboration across federal, state and local government agencies and institutions.\n\nJohan Uvin, Acting Assistant Secretary in the Office of Career Technical and Adult Education in the Department of Education , singled out the Performance Partnership Pilot\u2014in which tribal, city, state governments can pool resources to create holistic strategy to reach out to disconnected youth\u2014as well as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which contains what he described as a \u201cnumber of specific changes that I believe will lead to more holistic policy-making at the state and local levels.\u201d Mary Alice McCarthy, a senior policy analyst for New America\u2019s Higher Education Initiative, echoed Uvin\u2019s optimism about programs in Obama\u2019s budget that call for greater cooperation between the federal government and municipal or state governments.\n\nPointing specifically to three proposals from the Obama Budget\u2014the Department of Education\u2019s America\u2019s College Promise program, the Department of Labor\u2019s Registered Apprenticeship programs, and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Network of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes\u2014McCarthy emphasized their collaborative nature. She praised the President\u2019s budget proposal overall for posing this question: \u201cWho else needs to be part of this conversation outside the federal government to build family-centered social policy?\u201d\n\nAccording to McCarthy, everyone needs to be at the table\u2014workers, employers, and government. The National Network of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, for example, is \u201cbuilding partnerships among businesses, educational institutions and local government agencies to support development of advanced manufacturing hubs\u201d in cities where the \u201cerosion of the manufacturing sector\u2026has put a strain on families.\u201d Having all these stakeholders in the conversation about social policy, said McCarthy, would reflect the interconnectedness of what real families need: affordable higher education, secure and predictable pathways into employment, and more good jobs.\n\nThese holistic approaches to policy resonated with Laura Bornfreund, deputy director of New America\u2019s Early Education Initiative, who pointed to the President\u2019s proposed expansion of Head Start, with its \u201cwhole-child focus,\u201d and federal Pre-School Development Grants, which contain provisions that encourage states to provide full-day kindergarten as well. She also cited the Promise Neighborhoods, modeled after the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone, in which the Department of Education supports partnerships with local organizations and nonprofits to provide services and specifically seeks to \u201cbreak down agency \u2018silos\u2019\u201d to implement solutions to community challenges.\n\nJustin King, policy director of the Asset Building Program, agreed that inter-agency cooperation is key to pushing forward the aspects of the President\u2019s budget proposal that promote financial stability for families while modernizing government\u2019s understanding of what a family is: \u201cThere\u2019s a critical role for government to play in supporting household economic stability and supporting the ability [for families] to save across the big picture.\u201d That role, said King, must include support\u2014such as the Automatic IRA proposal\u2014for low-income families to save money for emergencies and retirement. When it comes to giving families help to save, said King, \u201cthe effort is there, the will is there, the resources are there, but it\u2019s just not always applied with care. And it\u2019s not always targeted to the families that need the most help, that are striving for a better life.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s budget proposal may be fruitful fodder for discussion, but it\u2019s still only a blueprint for the future. As Uvin put it, this budget is \u201can important vehicle for advancing ideas,\u201d but \u201cthere are other things that we can do and need to do and that we have done.\u201d He concluded that it\u2019s \u201cessential\u201d for government to create \u201cflexible\u201d policies for families and to \u201cengage external stakeholders from the get-go, so that the continuation of critical policy innovations is not exclusively dependent on whether there is the political leadership that is present to advance them.\u201d\n\nHaving opened with a question, Mundy concluded with one as well: how do you make policy without privileging one kind of family? By focusing attention where the \u201copportunity gaps are greatest,\u201d said Uvin, \u201cfrom cradle to career.\u201d\n\nJane Greenway Carr is an ACLS Public Fellow and Contributing Editor at New America.
