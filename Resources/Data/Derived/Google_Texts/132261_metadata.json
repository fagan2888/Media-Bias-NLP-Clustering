Considering this and many other Sanchez votes not included in your list, Sanchez is not the best choice to serve as U.S. senator.\n\nI am shocked that the Register editors would support Sanchez, and it speaks volumes for how significantly the political stance of the editors have shifted over time.\n\nKevin A. Capps\n\nCorona del Mar\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWe need a Southern Californian to replace Barbara Boxer in the Senate \u2013 and we have an experienced congresswoman as a candidate. Loretta Sanchez has worked hard for her constituents \u2013 and for California \u2013 for 20 years. She knows how the system works \u2013 and can and will work with other senators to solve our serious national issues.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein will undoubtedly complete her distinguished career soon \u2013 that would be the opportunity for Kamala Harris to run to represent Northern California.\n\nI am not a Democrat, but will be voting for Loretta Sanchez in June ... and hopefully again in November.\n\nMary G.
