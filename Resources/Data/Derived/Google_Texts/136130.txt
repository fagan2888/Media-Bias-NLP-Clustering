Among the 500-plus pages of health plan guidance issued this week by the Department of Health and Human Services were the latest rules on employer-sponsored health plan out-of-pocket limits.

On page 332 of the document, entitled "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017," the out-of-pocket limits are set for 2017. The new maximums are $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for family insurance. Those were the levels recommended earlier by HHS and represent an increase from the current $6,850/$13,700 maximums.
