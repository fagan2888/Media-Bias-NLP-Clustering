But he did not mince words when it came to criticizing economic activity that he saw as encouraging other problems in society. For example, he criticized the arms trade harshly and the \u201cshameful and culpable silence\u201d of those that let it continue.\n\n\u201cWe have to ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood,\u201d he said.\n\nFrancis has not shied away from criticizing capitalism and finance in the past, arguing that pursuit of economic gains above all else contributes to society\u2019s ills. In his \u201cLaudato Si\u201d encyclical, released in May 2015, he chastised the growth of finance, making the case for a more equal distribution of wealth rather than a \u201cwinner take all\u201d system.\n\n\u201cFinance overwhelms the real economy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy itself the market cannot guarantee integral human development and social inclusion.\u201d\n\nFrancis acknowledged Thursday that pushing for more equitable economic treatment will run into powerful opposition, but he urged lawmakers to make it a priority.\n\n\u201cI do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Francis urged lawmakers to ensure that all Americans are boosted by their policies.", "description": "Francis urged lawmakers to ensure that all Americans are boosted by their policies.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Francis urged lawmakers to ensure that all Americans are boosted by their policies.", "title": "Pope Francis: Politics cannot be 'slave' to economy, finance", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/254788-pope-francis-politics-cannot-be-slave-to-economy-finance", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/popecongress.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/254788-pope-francis-politics-cannot-be-slave-to-economy-finance", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-24T11:21-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-24T11:21:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/254788-pope-francis-politics-cannot-be-slave-to-economy-finance", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Francis urged lawmakers to ensure that all Americans are boosted by their policies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pope Francis: Politics cannot be 'slave' to economy, finance"}, "dcterms.title": "Pope Francis: Politics cannot be 'slave' to economy, finance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5c2\"", "article_summary": "Francis went on to say that business itself is not bad and actually can serve a critical social role by providing economic opportunity.\nFrancis has not shied away from criticizing capitalism and finance in the past, arguing that pursuit of economic gains above all else contributes to society\u2019s ills.\n\u201cFinance overwhelms the real economy,\u201d he wrote.\nBut he did not mince words when it came to criticizing economic activity that he saw as encouraging other problems in society.\n\u201cI do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort,\u201d he said."}
