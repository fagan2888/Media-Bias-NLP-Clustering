Sioux Falls, SD

Adam Weischedel and his wife are expecting a newborn this month, and only had two smoke alarms in their northwest Sioux Falls home. That changed with a knock at their door.

A group of health and safety volunteers ranging from the American Red Cross and the city's Fire Rescue collaborate for the second Growing Resilient project. They're visiting more than 1,000 homes near Hayward Elementary School, mounting free smoke alarms, giving blood pressure checks and educating homeowners on disaster prevention.

As a soon-to-be father, Weischedel says he feels better knowing his home is now safer with five smoke alarms.

"Indeed, was not even aware that you should have a smoke detector in every bedroom, not just common areas. Learned that today," Weischedel said.

Across the country during the last year, fire deaths rose 15 percent. That includes 18-year-old Tylor Kostrzewski, who passed away in a recent Mitchell fire. As the American Red Cross explains, preparedness isn't something to take for granted. Across the country, almost two-thirds of home fire fatalities happened because the house lacked a functioning smoke alarm. So volunteers took to the streets.

"Go in and have conversations about the fire problem, about preparedness, you know we know that only in the last two years only 33 percent of the population have done any form of preparedness," Tony Burke, community chapter executive of the Sioux Falls office of the American Red Cross said.

Last year, this project visited the neighborhood around Whittier Middle School, installing over 120 smoke alarms.

Growing Resilient is an ongoing project that isn't limited to KELOLAND, with more than 218 locations across the country launching similar projects. Nationwide, the American Red Cross hopes to install roughly five hundred thousand smoke alarms. For rural areas, the need is certainly there.

"A lot of our smaller communities are at high risk as well, so we're not stopping," Burke said.
