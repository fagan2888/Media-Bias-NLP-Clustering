It is the Senate\u2019s plan to cover up to 1 million of Florida\u2019s low-income uninsured residents by accepting billions of dollars in Medicaid expansion money under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGardiner\u2019s letter, released around noon Monday, urges Medicaid Director Justin Senior to send federal officials the Senate\u2019s FHIX plan right away to meet the guidelines set down by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nWithout expanded coverage, Gardiner wrote, \u201cthe state may not be successful\u201d in its quest for the LIP funds. The LIP program, part of a 2005 waiver, expires June 30.\n\nIt would be a surprise if Gardiner\u2019s request were granted. The Medicaid program, part of the Agency for Health Care Administration, answers to the governor\u2019s office. And Gov. Rick Scott, like the Florida House, currently opposes taking the Medicaid expansion money.\n\nThe ensuing stalemate over the federal money has prevented the House and Senate from reaching an agreement on the budget, which needs to be on legislators\u2019 desks on Tuesday in order to end the session on time this Friday.\n\nLast week, the House suggested using $600 million in state tax revenue to fill part of the LIP gap for hospitals. But the Senate rejected that on the grounds that no additional uninsured people would be covered and it would forfeit billions of dollars in federal funds available to Florida.\n\nIn the memo, Gardiner reminded Senior that CMS provided guidelines for Florida to follow if it wants more LIP money. They were outlined in an April 14 letter to Senior from the CMS official in charge of Medicaid, Vikki Wachino.\n\nGardiner said the proposal for continued LIP funding that Senior sent to CMS covered some of the guidelines but not others.\n\nThe most important omission, he said, was that Florida Medicaid was still proposing using LIP money to cover hospital costs for patients who would already have had their costs covered through health insurance if the state had expanded Medicaid.\n\nIn other words, the CMS guidelines said a state shouldn\u2019t request federal money for something that would not be needed if the state used money already available.\n\nCarol Gentry is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
