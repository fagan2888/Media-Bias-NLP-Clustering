Thanks to a fast-growing field known as telemedicine, that worry may become a thing of the past.\n\nLutheran SeniorLife, a faith-based nonprofit in Pennsylvania that runs senior living communities, has found that by having frail, elderly residents wear a sports watch\u2013like health monitoring device that is part of a system called the MobileCare Monitor, nurses' aides can respond quickly if there's a fall. The secure, FDA-cleared system, sensing the fall, instantly sends a text message to the aide's smartphone and an alert to a Web-based interface called a CareStation.\n\nThe MobileCare Monitor is made by AFrame Digital, a Reston, Va.\u2013based firm that is among many players now entering the booming field of telemedicine. Medical providers in this niche use data sent from one site to another via wireless tools, two-way video, smartphones and other electronic forms of transmission to take care of patients and keep tabs on their condition.\n\nGlobally, the telemedicine patient-monitoring market grew from $4.2 billion in 2007 to more than $10 billion in 2012, according to a report from Kaloroma Information, a publisher of medical market research with offices in Rockville, Md., and New York City. The U.S. alone claims nearly half that number\u2014$4.1 billion in 2012\u2014and its share is expected to soar to $8.7 billion by 2017.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The multi-billion-dollar telemedicine industry is helping doctors monitor senior patients remotely, allowing more of them to live independently.", "author": "Elaine Pofeldt, Special to CNBC.com", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The multi-billion-dollar telemedicine industry is helping doctors monitor senior patients remotely, allowing more of them to live independently.", "title": "Telemedicine keeps seniors out of nursing homes", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/13/telemedicine-keeps-seniors-out-of-nursing-homes.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/01/07/101317060-168166137r.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The multi-billion-dollar telemedicine industry is helping doctors monitor senior patients remotely, allowing more of them to live independently.", "title": "Telemedicine keeps seniors out of nursing homes", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/13/telemedicine-keeps-seniors-out-of-nursing-homes.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/01/07/101317060-168166137r.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Whats Working, Whats Working, Special Reports, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-01-14T08:00:00-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Whats Working", "modified_time": "2014-01-14T08:01:29-0500", "tag": "Special Reports"}, "pageNodeId": 101316376, "news_keywords": "telemedicine, Obamacare, seniors, health care, nursing homes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ee9\"", "article_summary": "The MobileCare Monitor is made by AFrame Digital, a Reston, Va.\u2013based firm that is among many players now entering the booming field of telemedicine.\nThanks to a fast-growing field known as telemedicine, that worry may become a thing of the past.\nMany Americans live in fear that an elderly parent will fall at home and get hurt without anyone there to help.\nThe U.S. alone claims nearly half that number\u2014$4.1 billion in 2012\u2014and its share is expected to soar to $8.7 billion by 2017.\nGlobally, the telemedicine patient-monitoring market grew from $4.2 billion in 2007 to more than $10 billion in 2012, according to a report from Kaloroma Information, a publisher of medical market research with offices in Rockville, Md., and New York City."}
