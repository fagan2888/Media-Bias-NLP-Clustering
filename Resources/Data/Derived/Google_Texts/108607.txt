Julie Burton created all the costumes for the musical.

Union High School's production of, "Shrek, The Musical," opened on Wednesday. It's a huge production with more than 100 kids on stage, some having more than one costume. And one lady was responsible for them all.

"I started in the beginning of the summer," said Julie Burton, who created all the costumes for the production.

She said she loves it; that it's like giving each character an identity, "Helping that character come to life on stage," Burton said.

There are places that rent costumes for particular shows, but then there are problems with fit and color, so she did them all herself.

"I looked at pictures. I looked at pictures on the Internet, I figured out how to make stuff."

Perhaps the one she's most proud of is the costume for Lord Farquad. To emphasize the character's shortness, the actor who plays him walks on his knees.

"The reason his cape is so long is 'cause it has to cover up his feet in the back," said Burton. "He's got these fake funny legs that connect in these holes. Then it connects around his waist. He's got gloves, he's got a head piece that matches his shirt."

And that's just one, seems like a tremendous amount of work.

"That's what theater is, you work all this time for four shows," Burton said.

But the memories for the actors, the audience and the costumer will last long after everything is put away.

Shrek the musical runs at Union High Wednesday through Saturday and tickets are available online.
