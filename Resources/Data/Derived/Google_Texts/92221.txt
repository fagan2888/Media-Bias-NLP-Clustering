Economic mobility may be stagnant for many Americans, but physical mobility is gaining traction. A host of new products designed to fit in your pocket or a backpack are available to make life on the move a whole lot easier and more enjoyable.

Inside the tent, the material reflects the occupant’s body heat for protection from the cold – and when reversed, the material reflects solar heat for a cool interior.
