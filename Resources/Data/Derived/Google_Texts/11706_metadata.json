It made it easier for the invited tailgaters, and perhaps even a few crashers, to find the location near Nevada\u2019s Mac kay Stadium on Saturday afternoon.\n\nMark and his wife, Karen, a University of Denver graduate, are the parents of Rams senior left tackle Ty Sambrailo, and they have attended most of CSU\u2019s games, both home and away, the past two seasons. Because they live along the Northern California coast, in Watsonville, they could drive to Reno this time \u2014 spending Friday night at their second home at Kirkwood Mountain ski resort and then coming over to Reno on Saturday.\n\nThe Sambrailos were expecting about 40 friends and fellow parents of CSU players to ultimately show up to eat, socialize and prepare for the 4-1 Rams\u2019 late Saturday night Mountain West meeting with the Nevada Wolf Pack. The family contingent also included Ty\u2019s brother, Erik, also a CU grad, and sister, Kiersten, a former volleyball player at Oregon State.\n\nThe top experience as visiting fans?\n\n\u201cAlabama was off the charts, probably the best,\u201d Mark Sambrailo said of the Rams 31-6 loss in Tuscaloosa last season. \u201cThere were 100,000 people, we came in as 40-point underdogs and they were welcoming Mac (Jim McElwain) and Karen (McElwain\u2019s wife) back. We got invited more places to have a beer or a piece of steak. It was shear the sheep, and if we were the LSU Tigers or Auburn, it might be a little different.\u201d\n\nSaid Karen Sambrailo: \u201cThere has not been a bad experience. Not one.\u201d\n\nEven Saturday, a mix-up meant the Sambrailos had to scramble for a spot in the tailgating lot next to the campus post office, and Reno fans offered space to the Rams\u2019 contingent.\n\nThe Sambrailos didn\u2019t go to the Rams\u2019 first out-of-state game this season, at Boise State, because Ty was hurt and out of the lineup, so Mark extended his duck hunt. But they went to the Rams\u2019 win at Boston College and stayed over an extra day, attending the Yankees-Red Sox game at Fenway Park on the final day of Derek Jeter\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cWe were walking out of the stadium, Boston lost, and a guy goes, \u2018Hey, Rams, come over here, have a beer!\u2019 \u201d Mark said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn that down. That\u2019s the kind of hospitality we\u2019ve seen, that we\u2019ve so much enjoyed. And we\u2019re going to miss this camaraderie with the other parents.\u201d\n\nSaid Karen: \u201cIt\u2019s been awesome, just meeting all the other families and with the sense of community. And we\u2019ve got to watch Ty develop the relationships that are going to be life-long.\u201d\n\nTy originally was a CU fan, too, but when the Buffaloes stalled about offering him a scholarship \u2014 and that offer might never have come \u2014 he jumped on CSU\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be a Buff originally, and CU in the (Dan) Hawkins regime just didn\u2019t give him the offer, and CSU had,\u201d Mark said. \u201cHe had a week to make a decision, and he said, \u2018Dad, the Rams want me and the Buffs are dragging their feet and I\u2019m going to be a Ram.\u2019 So that\u2019s what he did. And it\u2019s been the best fit you could ever find. It\u2019s just been amazing.\u201d\n\nAt 6-foot-5 and 315 pounds, Sambrailo is the only returning starter on the CSU line and is a bona fide NFL prospect. That\u2019s especially surprising considering he was so lean when he was young, he was an elite ski racer and still can do flips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom. It\u2019s very surreal that he\u2019s accomplished what he has,\u201d Mark said. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted to be a D-I player; that\u2019s what he went for and he got it. \u2026 He\u2019s got this fire, he\u2019s a late bloomer, he\u2019s got a lot of upside. And I want to thank (line coach) Pat Meyer, who\u2019s now with the Chicago Bears. Pat saw something in Ty, and that back flip they saw on film, that helped. Pat saw some upside. Ty was big and learning.\u201d\n\nNext year, the tailgates might be outside an NFL stadium.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sambrailo family loving traveling to watch son play for CSU Rams", "title": "Sambrailo family loving traveling to watch son play for CSU Rams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/11/sambrailo-family-loving-traveling-to-watch-son-play-for-csu-rams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141011__Ty-Sambrailop1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141011__Ty-Sambrailop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-11T20:00:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:18:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAlabama was off the charts, probably the best,\u201d Mark Sambrailo said of the Rams 31-6 loss in Tuscaloosa last season.\nIt was shear the sheep, and if we were the LSU Tigers or Auburn, it might be a little different.\u201dSaid Karen Sambrailo: \u201cThere has not been a bad experience.\nThe family contingent also included Ty\u2019s brother, Erik, also a CU grad, and sister, Kiersten, a former volleyball player at Oregon State.\nMark and his wife, Karen, a University of Denver graduate, are the parents of Rams senior left tackle Ty Sambrailo, and they have attended most of CSU\u2019s games, both home and away, the past two seasons.\n\u2026 He\u2019s got this fire, he\u2019s a late bloomer, he\u2019s got a lot of upside."}
