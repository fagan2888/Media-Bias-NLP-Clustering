Denver police are working an armed robbery that is possibly linked to a nearby carjacking in southwest Denver on Saturday evening.

The armed robbery took place at 5th Avenue and Bryant Street, police said.

Denver police spokesman Tyrone Campbell did not know what building at the intersection was robbed.

No one was injured during the incident, Campbell said.

The suspect, who was armed with a black handgun, then fled southbound from the area.

A nearby carjacking around the same time is likely linked to the robbery, Campbell said.

The vehicle taken was a gray 2001 Dodge Charger with a license plate number of 697XNK.

The suspect is described as a five feet eight inches tall man wearing a red hoodie and jeans.

“There were two separate events,” he said. “This is still an evolving scene.”
