Also, he added, the data reflect only the final six months of 2013, when AHN switched to calendar year reporting, and do not include the hospitals\u2019 improved performance in the first six months of 2014.\n\nOf UPMC\u2019s six local hospitals, only UPMC Mercy recorded a negative operating margin (negative 4.13 percent) and all five of its hospitals in outlying areas were in positive territory.\n\nBut more than half of the other northwest hospitals, including Ellwood City (negative 9.93 percent) and Sharon Regional (negative 4.17 percent), saw expenses outpace revenue.\n\nWhy would this happen when more people have insurance?\n\nDenis Lukes, chief financial officer for the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania, said there are a number of reasons, starting with the Affordable Care Act itself.\n\nMany people\u2019s insurance plans, whether through their employer or the federal marketplace, now carry high deductibles. As a result, he said, people might face a $5,000 or $10,000 outlay on \u201ctheir first trip to the emergency room\u201d that they can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nThose newly eligible for medical assistance also may be seeking care they\u2019d been putting off until they got insurance, Mr. Lukes said, and medical assistance covers only about 30 percent of the hospital\u2019s cost for outpatient care.\n\nThose factors \u2014 combined with declining Medicare payments and added federal requirements, such as buying and maintaining electronic medical records \u2014 all have put pressure on hospitals\u2019 bottom lines that Mr. Lukes said threatens their ability to reinvest in their facilities or even maintain some clinical services.\n\n\u201cThe changes in the last five years have been somewhat draconian from a Medicare perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act did nothing that reduced the cost of health care. What they\u2019ve really done is reduce payments to providers and said, \u2018You guys figure it out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSteve Twedt: stwedt@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1963.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most notable Pittsburgh-area hospitals with negative operating margins were West Penn in Bloomfield and Forbes in Monroeville.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "The federal Affordable Care Act enabled millions of previously uninsured Americans to get health coverage, but a new report says Pennsylvania hospitals still provide lots of care they aren\u2019t getting paid for.
