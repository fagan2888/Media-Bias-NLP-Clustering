He took part in the Charleston-Lowcountry Region Antique Automobile Club of America car show June 24 in Summerville.\n\nA lagging early turnout at the AACA car show gave Norma Callahan a rare treat, time to relax in the shade behind the driver\u2019s seat of her vintage 1964 Chevrolet Corvair.\n\n\u201cI usually register the people. I didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said.\n\nCallahan, who also brought a 1967 Corvair hardtop that advertises the monthly show at Car Pros Plaza in Summerville, can be forgiven for taking a break just this once.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 85 years old,\u201d she said.\n\nThe car enthusiast was among a fairly sparse group to take part in the Charleston-Lowcountry region of the Antique Automobile Club of America show on June. Another day of 90 degree temperatures on top of the threat of rain in Dorchester County reduced the numbers, although a few more cars and show goers trickled in later in the 6-8:30 p.m. event.\n\nThe club changed its show venue to the Summerville locale last month and drew 40 vehicles. The June 24 count was maybe half that many. But the cruise-up didn\u2019t lack for variety.\n\nJamie and Sunny Britt arrived in a 2011 Nissan 370Z Nismo, the brand\u2019s high performance marque. Jamie Britt said the special label attracted him to the car. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a Nismo, a rarity, only 600-700 made it to the States. I don\u2019t see many on the road,\u201d he said. His wife Sunny Britt had a slightly different take on why they bought that exact model. \u201cWhen we were looking, I liked this the best,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nBob \u201cPops\u201d Turner parked his white 1964 Chevelle 300 two-door with 355-cubic-inch engine toward a corner of the plaza\u2019s parking lot. He said the four-speed manual transmission shows off at least one high-end feature, aftermarket Ridler brand wheels.\n\nAcross the way, Sangaree car buff Jim Roettger displayed his red 1985 Corvette sports car. \u201cI love Corvettes,\u201d he said. The tweaked engine gets 25-30 extra horespower, he said, while acknowledging, \u201cMy speed days are over.\u201d\n\nRoettger, an active member of the AACA chapter, says the show\u2019s new spot at the corner of Old Trolley and Miles roads \u201cshould work out, especially based on last month.\u201d\n\nAmong the stragglers to the mid-week show was a work-in-progress 1959 Ford Galaxie with a vintage 1974-75 front license plate from Chihuahua, Mexico.\n\nNearby, Ernie Drutjons and his wife Carol listened to period music beside their pristine 1935 Ford Phaeton. \u201cI don\u2019t attract people,\u201d Drutjons deadpanned. \u201cThe car does.\u201d\n\nOne of the earlier arrivals, Bobby Sarine presented his 2012 Mustang GT500. \u201cI\u2019ve had Mustangs from Vietnam (days in the \u201960s). That\u2019s when I bought my first one.\u201d\n\nSarine, of Summerville, said he\u2019s had seven of the Ford pony cars in all. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun car to drive,\u201d he said.\n\nReach Jim Parker at 937-5542 or jparker@postandcourier.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Antique auto club chapter looks to build following at new Summerville site, \r\nAutomotive,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A lagging early turnout at the AACA car show gave Norma Callahan a rare treat, time to relax in the shade behind the driver\u2019s seat of her vintage 1964 Chevrolet Corvair.", "title": "Antique auto club chapter looks to build following at new Summerville site", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150704/150709663/antique-auto-club-chapter-looks-to-build-following-at-new-summerville-site", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150704/PC2107/150709663/AR/0/AR-150709663.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150704/PC2107/150709663/AR/0/AR-150709663.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lagging early turnout at the AACA car show gave Norma Callahan a rare treat, time to relax in the shade behind the driver\u2019s seat of her vintage 1964 Chevrolet Corvair.", "title": "Antique auto club chapter looks to build following at new Summerville site", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150704/PC2107/150709663/AR/0/AR-150709663.jpg?201507050022", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150709663}}, "keywords": "Antique auto club chapter looks to build following at new Summerville site , \r\nAutomotive", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T22:19:58Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T00:22:00Z", "author": "Jim Parker"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A lagging early turnout at the AACA car show gave Norma Callahan a rare treat, time to relax in the shade behind the driver\u2019s seat of her vintage 1964 Chevrolet Corvair."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd00a\"", "article_summary": "His wife Sunny Britt had a slightly different take on why they bought that exact model.\nHe took part in the Charleston-Lowcountry Region Antique Automobile Club of America car show June 24 in Summerville.\nJamie and Sunny Britt arrived in a 2011 Nissan 370Z Nismo, the brand\u2019s high performance marque.\nThat\u2019s when I bought my first one.\u201dSarine, of Summerville, said he\u2019s had seven of the Ford pony cars in all.\nThe club changed its show venue to the Summerville locale last month and drew 40 vehicles."}
