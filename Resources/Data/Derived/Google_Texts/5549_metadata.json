The four talented mop-tops from Liverpool were a sociological phenom. \u201cPop musicians of their generation can rule the world,\u201d Graham Nash said in the \u201860s as a member of the Hollies; while Dick Cavett, who interviewed both John Lennon and George Harrison, says today, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine our world without the four.\u201d\n\nHere are seven significant ways the Beatles changed America:\n\n1. We Became a Guitar Nation. When the Beatles played to more than 73 million viewers on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d on February 9, 1964, America swooned for the charming Brits who delivered an irresistible blend of British skiffle and American pop, rock, and R & B, serving it up with a wink and a shake of their shaggy hair.\n\nThe British Invasion \u2013 from the tepid Dave Clark Five, to the edgy Animals, to the menacing (by comparison) Rolling Stones \u2013 soon followed. Suddenly, every kid in America picked up a guitar as bands sprung up in basements and garages.\n\n\u201cBefore the Beatles, there were groups that played together,\u201d says Bryan Cumming, a vocalist with the WannaBeatles, a tribute band. \u201cBut the Beatles made the experience so exciting that it changed the cultural perception of what a band is. The Beatles had an overwhelming influence on young people\u2019s thinking \u2013 but they were so eclectic and energetic that a lot of older people embraced them, too.\u201d\n\n2. We Rediscovered Joy. The Beatles lifted the country out of a numbing grief over the Kennedy assassination, which happened just two-and-a-half months before the Fab Four arrived. \u201cAfter JFK\u2019s assassination in 1963, the Beatles were the only thing that made 1964 bearable,\u201d remembers pop artist Tommy James (of \u201cMony Mony\u201d and \u201cCrimson and Clover\u201d fame). \u201cThey also caused my generation to take a much deeper look at what was happening in the world,\u201d says James, one of many, along with Dick Cavett, who\u2019s taking part in a charity event this weekend called \u201cNYC Fab 50: Celebrating the Music of the Beatles.\u201d\n\n3. We Changed Our Hair. The crew cut ruled before the Beatles, or men wore their hair combed back. \u201cAt most of their early U.S. press conferences, more questions pertained to their hair than their music,\u201d says Richard Courtney, co-author of Come Together: The Business Wisdom of the Beatles. The Beatles\u2019 do was much longer, combed down over the forehead but barely touching their ears.\n\n\n\nAs the Beatles grew their hair longer, society followed. \u201cOnly with Michael Douglas\u2019s Gordon Gecko and the L.A. Lakers\u2019 coach Pat Riley did society return to the Brylcreem look,\u201d says Courtney. The Beatles also ushered in fashion changes with their collarless, Pierre Cardin designed suits \u2013 overseen by manager Brian Epstein. Penny loafers and boat deck shoes gave way to Cuban-heeled Beatle boots, and by 1966 Carnaby Street\u2019s \u201cmod\u201d look ruled as the fashion world began marketing to teens as never before.\n\n4. We Felt Anglo Envy. England\u2019s image changed from old and stodgy to the hippest on the planet, with London now a cultural mecca. \u201cBefore the Beatles, England looked to America for a lot of its music,\u201d recalls Ken Douglas, who became a sought-after disc jockey in the \u201860s largely on the strength of his British accent. \u201cThen with the Beatles, everything British was all the rage.\u201d That love affair continues. \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d anyone?\n\nRelated: Why Downton Abbey's Servants Had It Better Than Today's Minimum-Wage Workers\n\n5. We Enjoyed a Musical Renaissance. Popular music was transformed as the Beatles turned from simple songs of romantic pursuit (\u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d) to complex, experimental, long-form songs and concept albums (\u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d). \u201cEvery artist during the \u201860s was chasing the Beatles in one way or another\u2013their sound, their songs, and lyrics,\u201d says Tommy James.\n\nBefore the Beatles, recording artists rarely wrote their own material, but the Fab Four inspired many. \u201cJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney taught Keith Richards and Mick Jagger how to write songs,\u201d says Courtney. New instruments appeared on pop records, too, as George Harrison\u2019s sitar awakened America to Indian music. \u201cI\u2019m Cuban born,\u201d adds the WannaBeatles\u2019 drummer, David Toledo, \u201cand when I listen to the Beatles, I hear the Latin influences. \u2018I Feel Fine\u2019 has a Caribbean groove, and there are so many songs \u2013 \u2018And I Love Her,\u2019 \u2018Til There Was You \u2013 where they used congas and Latin percussion.\u201d\n\n6. We Experienced a Social Uprising. As their clothing and hairstyles became more extreme \u2013 the Beatles were sporting facial hair as early as 1966 \u2013 many bohemian behaviors and anti-establishment habits matched those of the counterculture, including smoking dope and hallucinogenics. The group's songwriting, too, reflected this, as it became psychedelic at times.\n\n7. Our Creativity Blossomed. The Beatles\u2019 music synchronized an explosion of creativity and awareness, from pop art to spiritualism. When they sang \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do that can\u2019t be done\u201d in \u201cAll You Need is Love,\u201d we believed it \u2013 and chased that. \u201cThe \u201860s saw a revolution \u2026 in a whole way of thinking,\u201d John Lennon once remarked. \u201cThe Beatles were part of the revolution, which is really an evolution, and is continuing. We were all on this ship \u2013 a ship going to discover the New World. And the Beatles were in the crow\u2019s nest.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Beatles\u2019 arrival on the shores of America 50 years ago is almost impossible to und", "title": "The Beatles: 7 Ways the Fab Four Changed America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/07/Beatles-7-Ways-Fab-Four-Changed-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02072014_Beatles_JFK.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/07/Beatles-7-Ways-Fab-Four-Changed-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02072014_Beatles_JFK.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Beatles\u2019 arrival on the shores of America 50 years ago is almost impossible to und", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8039\"", "article_summary": "The Beatles\u2019 arrival on the shores of America 50 years ago is almost impossible to underestimate \u2013 it changed practically everything.\nThe Beatles\u2019 music synchronized an explosion of creativity and awareness, from pop art to spiritualism.\n\u201cBut the Beatles made the experience so exciting that it changed the cultural perception of what a band is.\nThe Beatles lifted the country out of a numbing grief over the Kennedy assassination, which happened just two-and-a-half months before the Fab Four arrived.\n\u201cBefore the Beatles, there were groups that played together,\u201d says Bryan Cumming, a vocalist with the WannaBeatles, a tribute band."}
