BOSTON (AP) - In Massachusetts, it’s not just the treetops that are glistening this holiday season. It’s also the jewelry that’s being dropped in Salvation Army’s red kettles.

The charity says donors dropped wedding and engagement rings into a kettle in Weymouth, south of Boston. And a bracelet, diamond ring and diamond pendant were contributed in the central city of Fitchburg.

Both donors asked that the items be sold to help the poor and addicted.

The latest gifts come after a widow gave her wedding rings in memory of her husband, and another widow redeemed them with a gift of $21,000. Then an Australian woman who recently moved to Boston gave a diamond cross pendant.

Salvation Army Major David Davis said Wednesday that the organization is “overwhelmed by all that has taken place.”
