David Vitter and Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards, pulled no punches, attacking each other\u2019s records from the get-go. No topic was deemed off-limits in the unscripted debate before a packed crowd at the Press Club of Baton Rouge forum.\n\nVitter criticized Edwards for running a campaign \u201cbuilt on a myth that he\u2019s some sort of a conservative\u201d who is in favor of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and has low scores from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nEdwards, meanwhile, called Vitter a \u201cpolitical schoolyard bully for two decades\u201d who is unfit for office. \u201cHe is dishonest, he is lying, and he ought to do better. He ought to know better,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nSubstantial policy discussion took a backseat to flashy issues in the beginning, with early questions focusing on endorsements, negative ads and Vitter\u2019s long-hovering prostitution scandal from 2007.\n\nEdwards touted his recent endorsement from Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne as proof that he can work across party lines. However, Vitter claimed his campaign benefited in a way from the endorsement, receiving a wave of phone calls from those angry voters almost immediately.\n\n\u201cWell I felt really good about Jay\u2019s endorsement until I just found out it was really good news for Sen. Vitter,\u201d Edwards joked.\n\nWhile negative ads have been particularly ugly during this contest, the local TV spots took an even more drastic turn at the end of last week. The Edwards campaign released a spot accusing Vitter of taking calls from prostitutes while missing votes that honored slain troops.\n\nThe ad has been criticized both for featuring photos of Arlington National Cemetery and for showing an older picture of Edwards in an Army uniform. The Vitter campaign has circulated a letter from retired Brig. Gen. George P. Cole Jr. saying military regulations prohibit its members from wearing uniforms for campaign ads.\n\nEdwards said he would remove the Arlington image but would not back down from the Army picture because it is an old image and he did not re-wear it for the spot.\n\nVitter, though, said the letter from Cole is enough for Edwards to take the ad down.\n\n\u201cHe cited the regulation that he helped enforce during his career. You just said that was a subterfuge, that was a lie on his part. I think that\u2019s offensive,\u201d Vitter said. \u201cHis letter speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nVitter couldn\u2019t escape the accusations from the ad. Faced with pointed questions about his past, Vitter was about as forthright as he has been during this campaign about his \u201cserious sin\u201d admission from 2007. The senator said he \u201cfailed my family 15 years ago\u201d and has worked to regain the trust of voters ever since his admission. It\u2019s a theme he also hits on in a new TV ad that acknowledges the scandal.\n\n\u201cI know that sincere answer is not going to be good enough for my political opponents,\u201d Vitter said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not going to be good enough for the great majority in the press. But I\u2019m heartened that it has been good enough to my family.\u201d\n\nEdwards, though, said the issue isn\u2019t about forgiveness of sins. He said it\u2019s about Vitter missing key votes while calling prostitutes, as accused in the ad.\n\n\u201cHis performance of his public duties were compromised as well,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nAfter a series of tense questions and answers, the two candidates were finally able to wade into serious policy debates.\n\nBoth men said they would call special sessions to address the state\u2019s budgetary woes. For higher education, both agreed low funding levels were a concern, but Vitter said college and universities need to streamline their services in order to develop even more cost savings.\n\nVitter hammered Edwards over a recent speech at Southern University during which, Vitter claims, Edwards spoke about \u201creleasing\u201d 5,500 prisoners in an effort to reduce the state\u2019s high prison population. Edwards responded that his speech was more about setting up anti-recidivism programs and creating court alternatives like pretrial diversion and specialty courts to reduce the population.\n\nBut the debate steered back into odd territory when a question was raised about private trackers, or political operatives who are enlisted to follow candidates around and film them in case they say or do anything that could harm their campaigns.\n\nThe question was a veiled reference to an incident right before the primary election, in which a private investigator with ties to the Vitter campaign was accused of filming a private conversation between Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand\u2014a longtime Vitter foe\u2014and a prominent Edwards supporter.\n\nVitter dismissed the incident and said nothing improper or illegal happened, noting that he has been \u201ctracked\u201d for years. Edwards, however, said the issue was in no way \u201cjust silly\u201d and that it amounted to \u201cNixonian\u201d tactics.\n\nEarly voting has already begun for the Nov. 21 runoff and ends Saturday.\n\n\u2014Robert Stewart", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baton Rouge Business Report", "description": "Louisiana\u2019s last two gubernatorial candidates slugged it out today in their first forum since their intense primary election, trading body blows on all topics ranging from tax and spending policy and education to private trackers and prostitutes.
