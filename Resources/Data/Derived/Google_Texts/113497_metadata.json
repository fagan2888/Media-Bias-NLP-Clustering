But there was one topic he could not push aside \u2013 Ebola.\n\nThe past week\u2019s jarring Ebola developments have put a spotlight on the president\u2019s management skills just as he was earning praise for acting militarily against Islamic militants.\n\nIn recent months, Obama caught criticism for going golfing immediately after speaking about the beheading of an American, and for attending a fundraiser after an airliner was shot down in Ukraine. This time, as the Ebola threat hit home in America, the president suddenly cleared his schedule, canceling travel and appearances to consult with Cabinet members and talk with world leaders about how to contain the epidemic.\n\nBy Friday, he had named a point man for the U.S. response just as the clamor for an Ebola \u201cczar\u201d was nearing fever pitch.\n\n\u201cThey are resisting their usual impulse to hunker down and wait it out,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid who has in the past consulted with the White House. \u201cThis time they\u2019ve decided to switch gears if only because it hasn\u2019t worked in the past.\u201d\n\nThe week began with the news that a nurse in Dallas had become the first known case of Ebola being transmitted within the United States. By week\u2019s end, a second nurse had been diagnosed, and the hunt for possible exposures expanded from Texas to Ohio, from multiple domestic airline flights to a cruise ship denied a port-of-call in the Caribbean.\n\nWhite House officials say the president\u2019s approach this time reflected the unfolding, real-time developments that needed ongoing decisions to help reassure an increasingly alarmed public. Seeing the issue spiral, White House press secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged \u201cshortcomings\u201d in the federal response and Obama himself had to call on his government to react in \u201ca much more aggressive way.\u201d\n\nStill, that didn\u2019t stop the second guessing, even within his party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m greatly concerned \u2026 that the administration did not act fast enough responding in Texas,\u201d Rep. Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat in a tight Senate contest, said during a congressional hearing on Ebola.\n\nAt the same time, the crisis seemed to narrow to a single political point of debate: Should the U.S. impose a travel or visa ban on people from the three West African nations bearing the brunt of the epidemic.\n\nObama said he was not \u201cphilosophically opposed\u201d to the idea, but that in practice it would be counterproductive, driving travelers underground and hindering screening of potential Ebola carriers. Still, polls showed the idea had popular appeal.\n\nRepublican Senate candidates began challenging their opponents to take a stand. And on Friday, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina issued her own call for a temporary travel ban.\n\nObama\u2019s appointment of Ron Klain, Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s former chief of staff, as the administration\u2019s Ebola point man drew its own round of partisan criticism. Several Republicans complained that the lawyer and Democratic insider had no public health experience.\n\n\u201cThree weeks before an Election Day, and Republicans are seeking to score political points? Stop the presses!\u201d Earnest said dismissively of the critics.\n\nStill, the week\u2019s developments had been disturbing.\n\nThe Liberian man who died in Dallas from Ebola after traveling to the U.S. had infected two nurses, one of whom flew to Ohio and back before being diagnosed with the disease. Officials could not explain how the nurses became exposed, and the list of potential contacts with the second nurse grew after officials discovered she may have had symptoms before traveling.\n\n\u201cThe trust and credibility of the administration and government are waning as the American public loses confidence each day with demonstrated failures of the current strategy,\u201d said GOP Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, chairman of a House subcommittee that held a hearing on the government\u2019s response.\n\nManley and other Democrats say a weak response would feed into a Republican view that government is unmanageable and that scandals such as those at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Internal Revenue Service, and the botched launch of healthcare.gov last year prove Democrats are not fit to be in charge.\n\nWhen Obama postponed a campaign trip to Connecticut for Wednesday for vulnerable Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy and canceled a speech on women and the economy in Rhode Island for the next day, he may have given up opportunities to project a strong party message.\n\nBut he also couldn\u2019t be accused of abdicating responsibility for the Ebola response.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's an issue that President Obama can no longer push aside.
