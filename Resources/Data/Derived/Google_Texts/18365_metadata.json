Photo: Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation. He is on Twitter: @drewaltman.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders describes his health-care proposal as a Medicare-for-all, single-payer plan. The plan, however, would not expand the current Medicare program but replace it, along with Medicaid, private insurance, and other programs with what might be described as a Medicare-like, government-run single-payer plan. New polling shows why Mr. Sanders\u2019s label works well politically in the primary campaign: Among Democrats, the term \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d generates a much more enthusiastic reaction than does \u201csingle-payer.\u201d With this discussion still mostly at the stage of broad concepts and messaging, language matters.\n\nAs the chart above shows, the latest Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll found that 53% of Democrats were \u201cvery positive\u201d about Medicare-for-all, compared with 21% who felt that way about a \u201csingle-payer national health-care system.\u201d A separate 37% are \u201csomewhat positive \u201d about the term \u201csingle-payer.\u201d Medicare-for-all elicits the strongest positive reaction. About the same percentage were \u201cvery positive\u201d about the term \u201csocialized medicine\u201d as single-payer. Medicare is a famously popular and well-known program, and associating any universal coverage plan with it makes that idea more popular.\n\nThe current debate about single-payer is a discussion of ideas, concepts, and terms that are generally popular with Democrats. There has been coverage in the media and discussion among some experts of the details in Sanders campaign\u2019s outline of his single-payer plan, but a national debate about single-payer legislation\u2013similar to the debate the country had about the Affordable Care Act\u2013would be an entirely different animal. Major topics include how to finance such a system, who wins and who loses, and how to transition from the current system. That broader debate, of course, would engage independents and Republicans, many of whom are far less enamored of single-payer. A partisan debate would also follow should the more incremental approaches to expanding coverage further, such as those favored by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, be on the table.\n\nA lot remains fluid in the presidential contest. But the primary campaign so far has made clear the value of labels and messaging, whether applied to candidates (\u201cJeb Bush is low-energy\u201d) or health plans (\u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d).\n\nALSO IN THINK TANK:\n\nWill Poor Health Status in the South Be an Issue in 2016 Primaries?\n\nBernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Medicare for All\n\nBehind the Challenges to Universal Health Coverage", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Drew Altman: The primary campaign so far has made clear the value of labels and messaging, whether applied to candidates (\"Jeb Bush is low-energy\") or health plans (\"Medicare for all\").", "title": "Medicare-for-All vs. Single Payer: The Impact of Labels", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/25/medicare-for-all-vs-single-payer-the-impact-of-labels/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MT732_Health_P_20160224211621.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Medicare-for-All vs. Single Payer: The Impact of Labels", "description": "Drew Altman: The primary campaign so far has made clear the value of labels and messaging, whether applied to candidates (\"Jeb Bush is low-energy\") or health plans (\"Medicare for all\").", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Drew Altman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Drew Altman: The primary campaign so far has made clear the value of labels and messaging, whether applied to candidates (\"Jeb Bush is low-energy\") or health plans (\"Medicare for all\").", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-02-25T10:06:10-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/25/medicare-for-all-vs-single-payer-the-impact-of-labels/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-61468", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Drew Altman: The primary campaign so far has made clear the value of labels and messaging, whether applied to candidates (\"Jeb Bush is low-energy\") or health plans (\"Medicare for all\").", "title": "Medicare-for-All vs. Single Payer: The Impact of Labels", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/25/medicare-for-all-vs-single-payer-the-impact-of-labels/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MT732_Health_P_20160224211621.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-61468", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-02-25T03:33:04-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca634\"", "article_summary": "Photo: Kaiser Family FoundationDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nSen.
