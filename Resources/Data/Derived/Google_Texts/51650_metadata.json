During a pre-strike rally, she called the mayor \u201ca liar and a bully.\u201d Emanuel returned her contempt, shouting \u201cFuck you, Lewis!\u201d during a tense private meeting. Lewis recently filed papers to raise money for a possible run against the man she labeled \u201cthe murder mayor,\u201d because of Chicago\u2019s high crime rate, and she has a pledge of $1 million from the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nIf Lewis wins, or even mounts a credible campaign, she will become the most prominent labor leader in America. In that role, she\u2019ll be an appropriate successor to John L. Lewis, Jimmy Hoffa and Walter Reuther, those crusty avatars of mining, trucking and manufacturing. As an African-American, a woman and a professional (she has a sociology degree from Dartmouth), Lewis is the face of the 21st century unionism, which has been transformed from a movement devoted to protecting the safety and livelihoods of blue-collar workers to a stronghold of white-collar liberalism.\n\nOver the past 30 years, labor has been feminized, professionalized, politicized and regionalized. In the 1970s, Archie Bunker, a loading dock foreman, was a staunch unionist. Today, his son-in-law, grad student Mike Stivic, would be the union member.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most unionized job category is \u201ceducation, training and library occupations\u201d at 35.4 percent. That\u2019s a field dominated by women, many with master\u2019s degrees. (In fact, the Center for Economic and Policy Research predicts that by 2020, a majority of union members will be women.) Meanwhile, in manufacturing, the macho vocation that gave birth to the modern labor movement, the unionization rate has plummeted from 30 percent in 1983, around the time the term \u201cRust Belt\u201d entered the popular consciousness, to 9.4 percent today. Workers in manufacturing are now less likely to be unionized than the workforce as a whole. During those three decades of deindustrialization, the United Auto Workers\u2019 membership dropped from 1.2 million to 390,000. That\u2019s mainly due to robots replacing line workers, and the loss of market share to foreign manufacturers. Because when those foreign manufacturers build plants in the United States, they build in the South, a region hostile to unionism.\n\nEarlier this year, the UAW tried to organize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Despite the tacit support of the company, which needed an independent union to form a European-style works council, the UAW lost the election, 712-626. Before the vote, the anti-union faction, which called itself Southern Momentum, invoked cultural, regional, racial and political resentments to persuade the conservative white men working in the plant that a union was a threat not only to their livelihoods, but to their way of life. Billboards labeled the Democratic-leaning union the United Obama Workers and presented ruin porn images of the derelict Packard Motors plant alongside the slogan, \u201cDetroit: Brought to you by the UAW.\u201d A pamphlet distributed to workers compared the Northern union\u2019s campaign to a campaign by the Union Army in the Civil War: \u201cOne hundred and fifty years ago \u2026 the people of Tennessee routed such a force in the Battle of Chickamauga.\u201d\n\n(When I heard a Sheet Metal Workers business agent from Syracuse theorize that Southerners dislike unions because \u201cthe name reminds them of the Union Army,\u201d I thought he was nuts. Since Chattanooga, I think he may have been on to something. The man\u2019s own local lost most of its members when the Carrier Corp. moved its air-conditioner manufacturing plants to Georgia and Tennessee \u2014 and told union employees they weren\u2019t welcome to follow their jobs. Bottom line: If you buy a BMW built in Alabama, or a Toyota built in Mississippi, you\u2019re not helping the American labor movement.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor & white men once stood united.
