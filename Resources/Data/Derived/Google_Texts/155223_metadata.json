The organizers scaled back the campaign\u2019s goal to $100,000 and said they would provide refunds to those interested. Proceeds from the campaign will now go toward replacing Mukpo\u2019s possessions and to \u201csupport Ashoka in rebuilding his life after Ebola.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ebola Scams Prey on the Public\u2019s Fear\n\nAs of Wednesday, the campaign had raised just over $50,000 from 766 donors.\n\nMukpo took to Twitter earlier this week to announce that he\u2019s on the mend. He thanked NBC for its support and reminded followers about the plight in Liberia. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve had firsthand exp [experience] with this scourge of a disease, I\u2019m even more pained at how little care sick west Africans are receiving,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHis family also said in a statement on GoFundMe, \u201cHis appetite has returned and he is asking for food\u2026 The team taking care of him in Nebraska now feels he has turned the corner and with time will make a full recovery.\u201d\n\nYesterday, the World Health Organization said that the virus kills 70 percent of the people it infects in West Africa.\n\nLast week, Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil. Since his death, two health care workers who treated him at a Dallas hospital have tested positive for Ebola. Nurses have criticized that hospital\u2019s preparation and safety protocol.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NBC has agreed to pay the medical bills of the freelance cameraman who contracted Ebol", "title": "NBC to Cover Ebola Patient\u2019s $500,000 in Medical Bills", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/15/NBC-Cover-Ebola-Patients-500000-Medical-Bills", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Ashoka%20Mukpo.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/15/NBC-Cover-Ebola-Patients-500000-Medical-Bills", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Ashoka%20Mukpo.JPG", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NBC has agreed to pay the medical bills of the freelance cameraman who contracted Ebol", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "NBC has agreed to pay the medical bills of the freelance cameraman who contracted Ebola while working for the network in Liberia earlier this month.\nFriends of Ashoka Mukpo, 33, had begun a crowdfunding campaign seeking $500,000 to cover the cost of his treatment at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\nAn update to the GoFundMe campaign posted yesterday confirmed that the network would pay for Mukpo\u2019s treatment.\nSince his death, two health care workers who treated him at a Dallas hospital have tested positive for Ebola.\nLast week, Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil."}
