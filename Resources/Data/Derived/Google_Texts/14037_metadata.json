The cooks at the 1st Cavalry Division\u2019s 3rd Brigade Combat Team dining center also provided edible sculptures of the Mayflower, a chuck wagon, the Alamo and a World War II battlefield.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be a home for everybody, to come in, enjoy their meal and feel at home, specially for family members and soldiers,\u201d Sgt. 1st Class Anthony Perry told the Killeen Daily Herald.\n\nTens of thousands of spectators converged on downtown Houston to view the balloons and floats in the city\u2019s 66th annual Thanksgiving Day parade.\n\n\u201cHave an awesome day with your families! Strike up the band!\u201d Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard, the parade marshal, shouted to the crowd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing to celebrate the Thanksgiving and Christmas season,\u201d spectator Yvonne Thompson told KHOU-TV of Houston. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming for years, since I was a little girl, to watch the parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m going to do when I have grandchildren,\u201d said Sara Corey. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep doing this.\u201d\n\nBut some acted on a much smaller scale. Bobby Depper, formerly among Houston\u2019s legion of homeless, roams the streets of his city offering meals to those who appear to him to need help.\n\nFive years ago, Depper slept beneath a pile of newspapers in a dumpster behind a Dallas restaurant.\n\n\u201cI was just so angry, and I said if (God) is real, I guess I\u2019ll shout out at him. If he\u2019s real, I guess he\u2019ll hear me now,\u201d Depper told the Houston Chronicle.\n\nDepper says he awakened the next morning and asked the restaurant valet for bus fare. Instead, a man stepped out of a car in the valet line,\n\n\u201cHe said not to give me any change, and I thought, \u2018How could anyone say that?\u2019\u201d Depper said. \u201cBut then I turned around and he was handing me a $100 bill.\u201d\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texans renewed their Thanksgiving Day traditions on Thursday and served feasts to those who might otherwise have gone hungry.", "Author": "The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/26/texans-mark-thanksgiving-day-in-big-small-ways/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Texans renewed their Thanksgiving Day traditions on Thursday and served feasts to those who might otherwise have gone hungry.", "title": "Texans mark Thanksgiving Day in big, small ways"}, "twitter": {"title": "Texans mark Thanksgiving Day in big, small ways", "description": "Texans renewed their Thanksgiving Day traditions on Thursday and served feasts to those who might otherwise have gone hungry.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Texans renewed their Thanksgiving Day traditions on Thursday and served feasts to those who might otherwise have gone hungry.\nTens of thousands of spectators converged on downtown Houston to view the balloons and floats in the city\u2019s 66th annual Thanksgiving Day parade.\nIf he\u2019s real, I guess he\u2019ll hear me now,\u201d Depper told the Houston Chronicle.\nSome did it in a crowd, such as when 4,000 volunteers served meals to about 25,000 people at the annual Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Dinner in San Antonio.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing to celebrate the Thanksgiving and Christmas season,\u201d spectator Yvonne Thompson told KHOU-TV of Houston."}
