Meet Clark, the blue eyed cartoon bear with no pants. One could wonder if he rode the El this past Pantless Sunday.\n\nThe Cubs website boasts, \"Unbearably cute! Cubs unveil new mascot\".\n\nUnbearably cute? Says who?\n\nThe unveiling of Clark set the Twitter universe on fire. Much of it was not good.\n\nDefenders, those people with oh so tender sensitivities, are claiming it is for the kids and who really cares? Those weepy over sensitive types are always harping about the children.\n\nListen, when those little sperm and egg omelettes shell out for tickets, hot dogs, dad's beer, and all the other Cubs junk, then, and only then, can it be about them.\n\nChicagoNow's Julie DiCaro said it best on Facebook, \"Do you think us parents want that thing in our houses? Like I want to walk in my kids' room at 3 am and see that thing looking at me? No thanks.\"\n\n\"That thing\" is an apt description of Clark.\n\nClark is Chicago's version of Pajama Boy, the asexual nerdy dorky geek who was the holiday face (farce) of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Don't wear pants. Drink hot cocoa. Talk about purchasing Cubs tickets.\"\n\nClark will be the punching bag for satirists, sarcastic sports writers, local stand-up comics, and Sox fans.\n\nHey Kass, you weighing in on this? Clark and the Cubs should get the moutza of the month- nah!\n\nThe Cubs survey feedback used in picking Clark was probably from children in preschool. The alternatives, like Sammy Sosa in Cubs blue tights, were too scary.\n\nIf for some reason Clark becomes popular, will local Bronies convert, becoming Clarkies. Imagine, grown men dressing and acting just like the cute little bear cub. Picture them walking the streets with no pants, wearing a jersey, blue sneakers, baseball cap backwards, and swinging a bat.\n\nMaybe Build-A-Bear will create a product for their young Cub fans.\n\nWill someone draw a pair of over sized glasses on Clark, depicting him as a \"Cub fan and a Bud man\"?\n\nCan Clark hit, pitch, and field? Lord knows the Cubs need those skills.\n\nHow long before Clark gets his own statue outside Wrigley Field?\n\nAs the photo on the left depicts, Photoshop owners will be quite busy with the hirsute mascot.\n\nMaybe one can replace Bartman with Clark. Wouldn't that be nice?\n\nHow about Clark snatching the ball from a kid instead of offering it?\n\nOh the fun that can be had.\n\nRonnie Woo Woo fans are disappointed that he was not chosen as the new mascot, as he is the unofficial mascot of the Chicago Cubs.\n\nHow long before Clark gets his own show leading to Clark, the Movie? Maybe Mayor Rahm Emanuel's brother, Ari, will represent the cuddly little Cub. That really would be the Chicago Way.\n\nSince Clark has those cute baby blue eyes, maybe the Cubs can get him to belt out a few Sinatra tunes, accompanied by the organ? \"My Kind of Town (Chicago is)\" or \"Chicago\".\n\nDoes Clark twerk? Imagine the cute mascot twerking on the mound, tongue hanging out, with a beer in one hand and a roll of Charmin in the other.\n\nSteve Goodman, who wrote the unofficial official Cubs Anthem, \"Go Cubs Go\", and \"A Dying Cub's Fan's Last Request\", must be turning over in his dead Cub's fan grave.\n\nIts a beautiful day for a funeral, Hey Ernie lets play two!\n\nSomebody go get Jack Brickhouse to come back,\n\nand conduct just one more interview (A Dying Cubs Fan's Last Request/Steve Goodman)\n\nNow that the Cubs have cuddly Clark, the goat can be vindicated.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Cubs, Chicago Cubs, Cubs new mascot, Rahm Emanuel, Ari Emanuel, Steve Goodman, A Dying Cubs Fan's Last Request, Jack Brickhouse, Harry Caray, Wrigley Field, Twitter, Charmin", "og": {"url": "http://www.chicagonow.com/interesting-chicago/2014/01/cubs-unveil-new-mascot-unbearably-cute/", "image": "http://www.chicagonow.com/interesting-chicago/files/2014/01/Clark_Bat-Lean.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "To the home of the brave The land of the free And the doormat of the National League (A Dying Cubs Fan&#8217;s Last Request/Steve Goodman) The Cubs have a new mascot.
