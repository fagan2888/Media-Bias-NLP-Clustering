With France well on its way to defeating Honduras, it's looking very likely that the number will reach ten.\n\n(Update: It did, France defeated Honduras, 3-0.)\n\nBut almost as remarkably, the World Cup contests on the whole have also been more high-scoring affairs than before with 31 total goals scored through nine games.\n\nWorld Cup 2014 so far Games: 9 Goals: 31 Average goals per game: 3.44 Comeback wins: 5 Draws: 0 Teams played: 18 Teams scored: 16 \u2014 Francis Keogh (@HonestFrank) June 15, 2014\n\nThose numbers would be higher were it not for a striking EIGHT total disallowed goals, which is only fueling the excitement.
