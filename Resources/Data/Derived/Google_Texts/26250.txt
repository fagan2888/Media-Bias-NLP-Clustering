LITTLE ROCK — State Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr on Tuesday ordered the emergency suspension of a Florida man’s license to sell insurance in Arkansas.

The emergency suspension order for Joseph Lata of Pompano Beach, Fla., states that he worked with two others to solicit the sale of a short-term health insurance policy to an Arkansas Insurance Department investigator over the phone and failed to disclose that the plan was not in compliance with the federal Affordable Care Act.

One of the people working with Lata also made the false claim that the state of Arkansas was allowing only 1,000 Arkansans to enroll in a special low-cost policy, the order states.

Lata was soliciting the sale of insurance plans on behalf of Health Plan Intermediaries Holdings, doing business as Health Insurance Innovations. On Monday, Kerr issued a cease-and-desist order directing the company to stop trying to sell plans in Arkansas using unlicensed agents and stop misrepresenting its products to Arkansas consumers.

A call Tuesday to a listed number for Health Insurance Innovations in Tampa, Fla., was answered by a recording stating the recipient’s mailbox was full.
