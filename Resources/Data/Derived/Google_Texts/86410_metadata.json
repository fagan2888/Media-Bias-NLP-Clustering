Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nThe Supreme Court sure knows how to put an eager audience on edge.\n\nThe justices are wrapping up their 2014-2015 term and issued four decisions Monday, but none were in the half dozen biggest cases still pending. As in prior years, it looks like the court is saving the best for last.\n\nCases still outstanding include those dealing with the legality of Obama administration health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, same-sex marriage and EPA regulations on power plant emissions. Also pending are important cases on housing law, lethal injection and congressional redistricting.\n\nSeven cases remain in total, and the court is scheduled to decide them no later than next week. The justices will next announce opinions on Thursday.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s rulings, the court in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts faulted a Department of Agriculture requirement that raisin growers set aside a portion of their crop in some years for use by the government to maintain an orderly market. Among the other decisions, the court struck down a Los Angeles ordinance that required hotel operators to make their guest registries available to the police on demand.\n\nMonday\u2019s court session did clarify some mysteries about the remaining cases.\n\nFor instance, it appears likely Justice Antonin Scalia will be writing the court\u2019s ruling in a case examining the validity of EPA regulations requiring power plants to cut emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants. He is the only justice who hasn\u2019t written an opinion from the March oral argument session when that case was considered.\n\nEach justice usually writes at least one opinion from each argument session, and the EPA case is the only one from that session that remains outstanding. Justice Scalia at times was critical of the government\u2019s position during oral arguments in the case.\n\nCourt watchers are also speculating on which justice may be writing the majority opinion in the blockbuster health-care case on the legality of insurance subsidies received by more than 6 million Americans.\n\nThree justices representing a range of ideological leanings haven\u2019t written opinions from the session in which the health-care case was considered: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Only one other case besides the health care matter remains pending from that session, a closely watched dispute about whether states can use independent redistricting commissions to prevent lawmakers from drawing congressional maps to maximize their partisan advantage.\n\nAlso still unclear is who will be writing the marriage ruling, though many observers expect it will be Justice Kennedy, who has written the court\u2019s prior gay-rights decisions.\n\nChief Justice Roberts\u2019 raisins decision Monday came from the same argument session as the marriage case, making it less likely that he would be the author of the court\u2019s marriage ruling.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Supreme Court is wrapping up its 2014-2015 term and issued four decisions Monday, but none were in the half dozen biggest cases still pending.
