As a millennial myself, I find it ironic that it is not conservative policies holding young people back from the middle class, but the liberalism these student promote.\n\nFrom raising the minimum wage, to Obamacare, to the negative emotional and intellectual effects of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d on college campuses, liberalism is harming the young and decreasing their chances of rising in the world.\n\nThe College Freakout\n\nAccording to Salon\u2019s Amanda Marcotte, \u201cYoung people are under assault from reactionary forces and most of their grievances are not about imagined slights, but about very serious problems they are facing, on and off campus.\u201d Ironically, Marcotte is right -- but the \u201creactionary forces\u201d truly at fault are those of the left, not of the right.\n\nMarcotte turns to recent events at the University of Missouri, recounting the school\u2019s brief attempt to take away health insurance subsidies for graduate students, and short scuffles with Planned Parenthood following the Center for Medical Progress videos. In these events, the Salon author sees a looming threat by right-wing nut-jobs. \u201cThe school was listening to and willing to interfere with the health care and educational access the students had, to pander to the whims of a bunch of delusional culture warriors,\u201d Marcotte declares.\n\nMarcotte connects this \u201cattack on the young\u201d to the culture war -- with a clear message as to which side is in the wrong. But could she not have missed something fundamental in all of this? Young people are under attack from the left -- arguably more than any phantom attack from conservatives.\n\nObamacare\n\n\u201cEven the war over Obamacare has a generational aspect to it,\u201d Marcotte writes. She argues that, since Americans between 18 and 34 are the most likely to be uninsured, they \u201ctherefore have the most to gain under the Medicaid expansion and federal subsidies available through Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, young people are caught in a trap -- pay more for expensive coverage they are less likely to need, or pay a penalty for avoiding the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was enacted, the typical cost of insuring an 18 year old was one-fifth the cost of insuring a 64 year old. As Diana Furchtgott-Roth points out in National Review, this price difference made sense because \u201colder people are at much greater risk of serious health problems than people just out of high school.\u201d Nevertheless, since income generally rises with age, 64 year olds are likely better able to afford the higher premiums.\n\nObamacare mandates \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d such as maternity and newborn care and pediatric services, in every plan, even for a young, unmarried male. This drives up the cost of insurance -- encouraging young people to accept the penalty rather than buy coverage they do not need.\n\nThe Minimum Wage\n\nLike Obamacare, a higher minimum wage would disproportionately hurt young people. While it seems like a government mandate for higher wages would \u201cgive workers a raise,\u201d it would really force companies to make a terrible choice -- raise prices or drop employees who have become more expensive than the value they create.\n\nAcross the country, McDonald\u2019s has already started replacing people with robots. Facing steep competition from \u201cfast casual\u201d restaurants like Chipotle, McDonald\u2019s has to keep its edge, and that means lower prices. If government requires fast food restaurants to pay workers more, the restaurants will do so -- but they can only make ends meet by hiring fewer employees.\n\nWhile a higher minimum wage may sound like a raise, in the competition of the free market, it looks more like a pink slip -- for both employees and businesses.\n\nKevin McNamee, owner of a small business in Los Angeles, CA -- a city which recently voted to increase the minimum wage to $15 in 2020 -- worries, \u201cI can\u2019t raise my product prices because of pricing pressure. I can\u2019t reduce my expenses; in fact, salaries are my greatest expense, and $15 per hour increases my expenses and reduces my profit.\u201d\n\nMcNamee claims \u201clast year, my employees made more than I, the owner, did.\u201d Small businesses like his will likely fail under a higher minimum wage.\n\nBig businesses will more likely be able to stomach higher wages, but they will have to hire fewer workers to meet their bottom lines. Since young people have the least experience, they are most likely to fill entry-level positions -- jobs that may become even harder to find if companies have to pay even the least experienced workers a high wage.\n\nThe Coddling of the American Mind\n\nIn the September issue of The Atlantic, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, president and CEO for the Foundation for Individual Rights In Education, wrote about how the anti-speech movement on college campuses actually encourages psychological maladies and cognitive distortions.\n\nHaidt and Lukianoff describe the rising culture of what they call \u201cvindictive protectiveness.\u201d They mention the case of Jeannie Suk, a Harvard Law professor, who wrote in The New Yorker about law students asking her fellow professors at Harvard not even to teach rape law -- and in one weird case even to avoid using the world \u201cviolate\u201d (as in \u201cthat violates the law) -- because it may cause students distress. They also cite a professor whose fear of student reprisal led him to write anonymously for Vox, saying \u201cI\u2019m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Terrify Me.\u201d\n\nThis culture of overreaction to words is slowly being institutionalized, Haidt and Lukianoff note. The recent resignation of University of Missouri President Tim Wolfe and the calls for the resignation of Yale\u2019s Silliman College masters Erika and Nicholas Christakis confirm that the vindictive protectiveness movement is gaining strength.\n\nHaidt and Lukianoff argue that \u201ca campus culture devoted to policing speech and punishing speakers is likely to engender patterns of thought that are surprisingly similar to those long identified by cognitive behavioral therapists as causes of depression and anxiety.\u201d In other words, \u201cthe new protectiveness may be teaching students to think pathologically.\u201d Indeed, as they note, rates of mental illness among young adults have been rising, both on and off campus.\n\nCollege campuses have embraced emotional reasoning, which Haidt and Lukianoff define as assuming \u201cthat your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are,\u201d and letting \u201cyour feelings guide your interpretation of reality.\u201d Subjective feelings can be very unreliable guides, however.\n\n\u201cA claim that someone\u2019s words are \u2018offensive\u2019 is not just an expression of one\u2019s own subjective feeling of offendedness,\u201d for example. \u201cIt is, rather, a public charge that the speaker has done something objectively wrong.\u201d\n\nThe idea of \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d -- small actions or word choices that seem to have no malicious intent but are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless -- twists the objective idea of being \u201coffensive\u201d into a subjective charge on behalf of someone claiming to be offended. According to some campus guidelines, it is a microaggression to ask an Asian American or Latino American \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d because this implies that she or she is not a real American.\n\nHaidt and Lukianoff cite many other instances where college campuses are moving away from free speech and toward an overly cautious worry about hurting students\u2019 feelings. This trend, rather than helping those students who suffer from psychological disorders, actually worsens their plight -- teaching them to think in ways that cause further depression and anxiety.\n\nIf a student has to watch her every word for fear of offending someone else, and in turn she can read offense into any statement by someone else -- whether it was intended or not -- her emotions will be on high alert. Vindictive protectiveness teaches students to think in ways that are not good for them, ill-preparing the young for a world that is not as attuned to their feelings.\n\nAs Haidt and Lukianoff explain, this teaching prepares students poorly for professional life, \u201cwhich often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong.\u201d It can also hamper their intellectual development -- as the free exchange of ideas is limited by a culture of overreaction.\n\nThere it is -- the true threat to the youth. Liberalism in government makes health care mandatory and more expensive for young people and makes it harder for them to find a job, while in the university it prevents millennials from getting the training in thought and action they need to engage an ever-changing world.
