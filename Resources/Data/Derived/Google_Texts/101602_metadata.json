My top priority as President is doing everything I can to create more jobs and more opportunities for hardworking families to get ahead.\n\nOn Friday, we learned that our economy created over 200,000 new jobs in July. That\u2019s on top of about 300,000 new jobs in June. We\u2019re now in a six-month streak with at least 200,000 new jobs each month. That hasn\u2019t happened since 1997. All told, our businesses have created 9.9 million jobs over the past 53 months. That\u2019s the longest streak of private-sector job creation in our history.\n\nBecause of you \u2014 because of your hard work and determination \u2014 America has recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth. The economy is clearly getting stronger. Things are clearly getting better. And the decisions we make now can keep things moving in that direction.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. Making sure our economy works for every working American. Making sure that people who work hard can get ahead. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pushing for common-sense ideas like rebuilding our infrastructure in a way that supports millions of good jobs and helps our businesses compete. Raising the minimum wage. Making it easier for working folks to pay off their student loans. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pushing for fair pay and paid leave.\n\nThese policies have two things in common. All of them would help working families feel more stable and secure. And all of them have been blocked or ignored by Republicans in Congress.\n\nThat\u2019s why my administration keeps taking what actions we can on our own to help working families \u2014 because Congress is doing so little for working families. House Republicans actually got together this week and voted to sue me for taking actions on my own. And then they left town for the month without settling a bunch of unfinished business that matters to working families across America.\n\nThe bottom line is this \u2014 we\u2019ve come a long way these past five and a half years. Our challenges are nowhere near as daunting as they were back then. But imagine how much farther along our economy would be \u2014 how much stronger our country would be \u2014 if Congress would do its job.\n\nI\u2019ll never stop trying to work with both parties to get things moving faster for the middle class. And I could use your help. If you see your Member of Congress around home this month, tell him or her what\u2019s on your mind. Ask them why they haven\u2019t passed bills to raise the minimum wage or help with student loans or enact fair pay for women.\n\nAnd when they return from vacation next month, instead of trying to pass partisan bills on party lines, hopefully we can come together with the sense of common purpose that you expect. And in the meantime, I will never stop doing whatever I can, whenever I can, not only to make sure that our economy succeeds, but that people like you succeed. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\n\nPrevious Weekly Remarks of both parties are available here.\n\nRELATED:\n\nTwo more costly losses for public unions\n\nWeird 2014: Desperate Democrats dream of Obama\u2019s impeachment\n\nYet another report nails Obama for mis-management and incompetence\n\n10 million more Americans are not working than when Obama entered office", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's weekly remarksHi, everybody.
