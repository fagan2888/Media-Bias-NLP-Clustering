Tynedale scored immediately afterwards with Sep Visser acrobatically touching down in the corner but Norman levelled the scores with another penalty shot just before the break.\n\nThe second period exploded into life with four tries in 12 minutes around the hour mark as Cinderford transformed a 14-11 deficit into what turned out to be a match-winning 32-21 lead.\n\nConnon slotted his third penalty for that three-point advantage but Cinderford responded immediately with some powerful surges to the line and Sam Baker found a huge hole in the league\u2019s second best defence to score a try improved by Norman.\n\nCinderford were in the ascendant and, with the bit between their teeth, the pack got in on the act and, after battering the visitors\u2019 line, won a penalty try converted by Norman.\n\nThis was much more like it from Cinderford and they scored their bonus-point try five minutes later, punching holes in the defence for George Mills to rampage through and send Chris McNeill over. Norman added the goal.\n\nHowever, the job wasn\u2019t done and Cinderford lost concentration at the restart and Jack Harrison finished a sharp move under the posts with a try converted by Connon.\n\nThings calmed down a little after that though Norman sat out the final few minutes after being penalised following a superb try-saving tackle on Matt Outson.\n\nIn those frenetic minutes, Tynedale were awarded a penalty try converted by Connon and Cinderford made their supporters sweat for every last second as they chased and harried to keep their lead intact until the referee finally blew time.\n\nCINDERFORD: S Hawley; S Baker, S Hanks, J Adams, C Norman; M Wilcox, D Pointon; J Smart, L Cole, E Booley; L Randall, M Lane; R Birkin, C McNeil; G Mills.
