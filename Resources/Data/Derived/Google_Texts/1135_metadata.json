They get funding from Medicare's Quality Innovation Network to work with patients, providers and physicians on goals that meet CMS targets.\n\nThe awards for Special Innovation Projects are competitively based. Organizations were eligible to submit proposals for two types of projects: those that address issues of quality occurring within the local service area; and those focused on expanding the scope of quality improvement interventions with proven, but limited success.\n\n[Also: Costly, and often deadly, medical errors prompt calls for hospitals to accept fault]\n\nThey were encouraged to propose projects that, among other goals, reduce mortality; lower costs; provide a higher return on investment; link value with quality; and encourage the use of alternative payment models.\n\nSpecific initiatives include reducing healthcare associated infections, reducing readmissions and medication errors, working with nursing homes to improve care for residents, supporting clinical practices in the coordination of care through health information technology, promoting prevention activities, reducing cardiac disease and diabetes, reducing healthcare disparities and improving patient and family engagement.\n\nAdditionally, CMS looked for evidence of partnerships at the community, regional and national levels.\n\n\"We recognize that there is tremendous quality work occurring in the field, and by requiring that the Quality Innovation Networks - Quality Improvement Organizations partner with organizations (federal, state, local community, and/or private), we can potentially capitalize on interventions that have not made it into mainstream use,\" CMS said.\n\n[Also: Expert shares tips for avoiding diagnostic errors in healthcare]\n\nThe program also provides technical assistance for improvement in value-based purchasing programs, including the physician value-based modifier program.\n\nIn total, CMS awarded close to $10 million for 16, two-year special innovation projects.\n\nThe recipients of the awards for improving quality locally are: Atlantic, for transforming end of life care and advanced care planning in New York counties; Great Plains for colorectal cancer screening in Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota; Qualis Health for standardizing discharge processes from short-stay skilled nursing facilities in Washington State and Idaho;

and VHQC, for stopping sepsis in long-term care in skilled nursing facilities in Maryland.\n\nAward recipients for interventions are: Atlantic, for community-based sepsis initiatives in New York and South Carolina;
