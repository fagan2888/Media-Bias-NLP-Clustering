Healthcare as a right has been debated over many years, but is still not in place for all Americans as this country remains an outlier among advanced industrial countries around the world. Instead, despite the ACA, we continue to have a patchwork of ever-changing programs assuring access to health care for some people some of the time.\n\nLet's look at what we do have in this respect. In the 1960s, Congress established a broad right to health care under statutory law by enacting Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for the elderly, disabled, people living in poverty, and children. In the 1980s it passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requiring all Medicare-funded hospitals with emergency departments to provide appropriate emergency and labor care. More recently, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) in 2013, which assures a right to equal access to care for patients with medical and mental health problems. SCOTUS has established a right to health care for prisoners and has protected some limited rights for women's reproductive care (2), but has never interpreted the Constitution as guaranteeing a right to health care for all Americans. In fact, the words \"health,\" \"health care,\" \"medical care,\" and \"medicine\" do not appear in the Constitution. (3)\n\nIt is disingenuous to claim that health care is a right in the U. S. when we consider these inconvenient facts:\n\n35 million uninsured, plus another similar number underinsured.\n\nThe first question asked of us in seeking care is \"what is your insurance?\"\n\n21 states have opted out of Medicaid expansion under the ACA.\n\nMedicaid eligibility and coverage varies widely from one state to\n\nanother, in many cases falling far short of necessary care.\n\nAs the costs of insurance and health care continue to rise and shift\n\nmore to patients, a growing part of the population cannot afford either and forgo seeking care.\n\nMore than 40 million Americans now have an account in collection for medical debt. (4)\n\nThis situation stands in sharp contrast to elsewhere in advanced societies. Healthcare has been recognized as a right since 1948 when the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights including access to health care. (5) The right to health care was also later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its Declaration on the Rights of Patients. (6) As a result, most of Western Europe, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Taiwan, and many other countries have one or another form of national health insurance assuring access to care for their populations. Here we spend twice as much and still have no universal access to health care.\n\nCan we ever see this country coming around to universal access to health care based on medical need, not ability to pay? The record shows that we never can, or will, as long as we permit corporate stakeholders in our medical-industrial complex to call the shots, and as long as they succeed in perpetuating our exploitive for-profit system. There is a fix -- single-payer national health insurance, as embodied in H. R. 676, Expanded and Improved Medicare for All.\n\n2. Curfman, G. King v. Burwell and a right to health care.
