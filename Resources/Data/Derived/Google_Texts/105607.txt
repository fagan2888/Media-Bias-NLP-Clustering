"I hope he prevails. I think he can prevail," Torricelli told host John Catsimatidis on "The Cats Roundtable" on New York’s AM 970.

ADVERTISEMENT "I can't tell you people haven't asked me about it," Torricelli said of his own potential bid.

Torricelli, who has mostly focused on real estate since leaving the Senate in 2003, said he was intent for now "on helping Bob get through this situation."

Last month Torricelli was slammed by Democratic Party bosses for working the room at a fundraiser amid rumors he may be considering a Senate bid, while Menendez fights federal corruption charges.

"There's unfinished business in my life," Torricelli told the New Jersey Star-Ledger in June, fanning speculation about a potential Senate bid.

"I've always been a person whose life is about public service and public policy, and I do still think about it as part of my future," he added.

Similar to Menendez, who has questioned the Obama administration's moves with Iran, Torricelli said in the interview on Sunday that he was "troubled" by an international deal over Tehran's nuclear program.

"Were I a member of the Senate, I could not vote for it," he said. "At the end of the day, this isn’t about loyalty to party or individuals. It’s about the welfare of our country.”
