America\u2019s workforce is growing at the fastest pace since the year 2000. It is showing the kind of strength and durability that makes America\u2019s economy right now the envy of the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d wrote John. S. Roberts on Young Conservatives. \u201cNothing says you care about your fellow Americans like implementing job killers like Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cHow can he explain his choice of words to the 90 million-plus who are out of work?\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cHow can he explain his words to the most Americans on food stamps the nation has ever seen?\u201d\n\nObama maintained that \u201cthe facts don\u2019t lie.\u201d However, there are other numbers not trumpeted by the White House that attracted the attention of Financial Times writer Shawn Donnan, who said the trends at work below the headlines show why the economy is a seething issue for average Americans.\n\nAlthough the official national unemployment rate in January was 4.9 percent, the labor utilization rate \u2014 which counts individuals not officially registered as looking for work and those working part-time \u2014 is 9.9 percent.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nViewed that way, Donnan wrote there are 15.9 million Americans without full-time jobs.\n\n\u201cThat is more than five times the 2.9 (million) Republicans who voted for Donald Trump across 11 states on Tuesday,\u201d Donnan wrote.\n\nAs for long-term unemployment \u2014 individuals out of work for more than 26 weeks \u2014 that figure has hovered around 2 million Americans since June 2015, Donnan wrote.\n\n\u201c\u2026 the long-term unemployed still make up more than one in four of the total unemployed in the U.S. And a million more Americans are still battling long-term unemployment than before the (economic) crisis,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nDonnan also did the math on wages, and found that the picture was not very rosy.\n\n\u201cAdjusted for inflation, the real median household income in 2014, the latest year for which data are available, was $53,657. That was roughly equivalent to the median American household income in 1996,\u201d he wrote.\n\nh/t: Young Conservatives", "article_metadata": {"description": "...there are 15.9 million Americans without full-time jobs.", "author": "Jack Davis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "...there are 15.9 million Americans without full-time jobs.", "title": "Obama Just Made A Huge Claim About His Plans That Will Have Many Americans Shaking Their Heads", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-plans.jpg", "height": 554}, "updated_time": "2016-03-07T09:48:51-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/obama-just-made-a-huge-claim-about-his-plans-that-will-have-many-americans-shaking-their-heads/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "...there are 15.9 million Americans without full-time jobs.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-plans.jpg", "title": "Obama Just Made A Huge Claim About His Plans That Will Have Many Americans Shaking Their Heads", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-05T10:52:09-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Unemployment", "published_time": "2016-03-05T10:52:09-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-07T09:48:51-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "unemployment, jobs, barack obama, economy, the economy, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement \u2013 story continues belowViewed that way, Donnan wrote there are 15.9 million Americans without full-time jobs.\nAs for long-term unemployment \u2014 individuals out of work for more than 26 weeks \u2014 that figure has hovered around 2 million Americans since June 2015, Donnan wrote.\n\u201cThat is more than five times the 2.9 (million) Republicans who voted for Donald Trump across 11 states on Tuesday,\u201d Donnan wrote.\nIt is showing the kind of strength and durability that makes America\u2019s economy right now the envy of the world,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowDonnan also did the math on wages, and found that the picture was not very rosy."}
