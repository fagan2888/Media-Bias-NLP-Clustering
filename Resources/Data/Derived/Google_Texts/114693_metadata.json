John Cornyn, Texas Republican, offered a third plan that posts $1.1 billion by taking money from Obamacare\u2019s preventive health fund.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans unveiled a bill Monday that funds only a third of President Obama's request to combat the Zika virus, saying the White House hadn't fully justified its pitch for nearly $2 billion to gird for the mosquito-borne illness.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Republicans unveiled a bill Monday that funds only a third of President Obama\u2019s request to combat the Zika virus, saying the White House hadn\u2019t fully justified its pitch for nearly $2 billion to gird for the mosquito-borne illness.", "title": "House GOP offers Zika proposal, funds only a third of Obama\u2019s request", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/16/house-zika-proposal-funds-only-third-obama-request/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/16/Zika_Counting_Mosquitoes.JPEG-b0173.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/16/Zika_Counting_Mosquitoes.JPEG-b0173.jpg", "description": "House Republicans unveiled a bill Monday that funds only a third of President Obama's request to combat the Zika virus, saying the White House hadn't fully justified its pitch for nearly $2 billion to", "card": "summary", "title": "House GOP offers Zika proposal, funds only a third of Obama\u2019s re"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Social Issues, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a0d\"", "article_summary": "The White House blasted the House proposal, arguing the administration fully detailed its plans in February.\n\u201cThe administration has still not provided full accounting and justification for its request for Zika funds,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.\nHouse Republicans unveiled a bill Monday that funds only a third of President Obama\u2019s request to combat the Zika virus, saying the White House hadn\u2019t fully justified its pitch for nearly $2 billion to gird for the mosquito-borne illness.\nMr. Rogers said the House can free up additional money, as needed, as part of the fiscal 2017 spending process.\nSen.
