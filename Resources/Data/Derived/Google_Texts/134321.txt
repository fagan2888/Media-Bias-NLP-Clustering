Spanish Villagers of “Kill Jews” in Northern Spain are finally coming around to the idea that their town name, which has been in existence since the Spanish Inquisition, needs to go.

The 60 residents of the village of Castrillo Matajudios near Leon will hold a town hall meeting next week to vote on vote on a formal name change, the regional daily Diario de Burgos reported Friday.

The town’s mayor, Lorenzo Rodriguez, suggested changing the name to Castrillo Mota de Judios, which translates to “Castrillo Jews’ hill,” The Times of Israel reported. That was the original name of the village before the Spanish inquisition.

In northern Spain, locals use the term “killing Jews” (matar Judios) to describe the traditional drinking of lemonade spiked with alcohol during Easter festivals, The Times of Israel reported.

This festival’s name dates back to the middle ages, when converted Jews would sometimes be publicly executed around Easter, Maria Royo, a spokesperson for the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

Ms. Royo said that this type of expression is still popular today in Spain during parties and ceremonies, but added, “The people saying it are mostly unaware of the history. It is a complicated issue that is ingrained in local culture.”

Leon will hold its “matar Judios” fiesta on Good Friday, April 18.
