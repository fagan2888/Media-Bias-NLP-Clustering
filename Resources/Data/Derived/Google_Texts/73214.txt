President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. economy “has been moving and continues to grow.”

Speaking in New Orleans where he marked the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Obama tried to allay worries about a potential global economic slowdown, saying the U.S. “remains an anchor of global strength and stability in the world” despite fears of slowing growth in China.

Global stock markets have been jittery this week over the state of the Chinese economy, the world’s second-largest. Markets plunged earlier this week after China devalued its currency, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed sharply up Wednesday and Thursday — erasing some of those losses.

Mr. Obama pointed to job creation, low unemployment and overall economic growth as signs that the U.S. economy remains healthy.

“It’s important for us to remember that strength,” the president said.

He repeated his call for Congress to pass a budget for the new fiscal year before the current year ends on Sept. 30. A bloc of conservative lawmakers has threatened to shut down the government unless the new budget cuts off federal funds to Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider.
