And he saw the Dominican right-hander win the AL award twice with the Red Sox, in back-to-back seasons in 1999-2000 that established him as one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history.\n\nIn that two-year period \u2014 in the middle of a golden age of hitting \u2014 Martinez went 41-10 with a 1.90 ERA and 597 strikeouts. After that, all he did was anchor the staff that helped the Red Sox earn their cathartic World Series victory in 2004, ending an eight-decade drought.\n\nMartinez went on to pitch four seasons with the New York Mets, three of them injury-plagued, and returned to the World Series with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009 before retiring. Five years later, he is eligible for the baseball Hall of Fame and likely to be among the inductees announced Tuesday.\n\nLike Randy Johnson, who is also making his first appearance on the ballot, Martinez is a virtual certainty to be enshrined in July; each has a chance to break Tom Seaver\u2019s record of 98.84 percent of the ballots cast.\n\nAlso like Johnson, Martinez was an imposing presence on the mound. But while the 6-foot-10 left-hander could intimidate with his size, Martinez accomplished as much with control that allowed him to use all parts of the plate \u2014 including the inside.\n\nWhen he came out of the bullpen in relief for the finale of a 1999 AL Division Series game against Cleveland, the Indians batters were visibly deflated. Martinez, who had left Game 1 with a back strain, pitched six innings of no-hit relief to finish off the series.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make my presence be felt,\u201d Martinez said this summer when he returned to Boston for induction into the franchise Hall of Fame. \u201cEvery time I went out there, I wanted to make sure that you knew, that you were aware, that I wasn\u2019t kidding out there. That this was my job. That I\u2019m here and I\u2019m going to be responsible for it.\u201d\n\nIn all, Martinez finished with a 219-100 record and a 2.93 ERA. He struck out 3,154 batters and walked 760 in 2,827 innings. He twice won 20 games, twice struck out more than 300 batters and twice posted an ERA below 2.00. He was an eight-time all-star, and five times he led the major leagues in ERA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pedro Martinez waits for call from Hall of Fame", "title": "Pedro Martinez waits for call from Hall of Fame", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pedro Martinez waits for call from Hall of Fame", "title": "Pedro Martinez waits for call from Hall of Fame", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/03/pedro_martinez_waits_for_call_from_hall_of_fame/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/hall-of-fame-pedro-martinez-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pedro Martinez waits for call from Hall of Fame", "title": "Pedro Martinez waits for call from Hall of Fame", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/hall-of-fame-pedro-martinez-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jimmy Golen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd65f4\"", "article_summary": "In that two-year period \u2014 in the middle of a golden age of hitting \u2014 Martinez went 41-10 with a 1.90 ERA and 597 strikeouts.\n\u201cI wanted to make my presence be felt,\u201d Martinez said this summer when he returned to Boston for induction into the franchise Hall of Fame.\nMartinez went on to pitch four seasons with the New York Mets, three of them injury-plagued, and returned to the World Series with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009 before retiring.\nAfter that, all he did was anchor the staff that helped the Red Sox earn their cathartic World Series victory in 2004, ending an eight-decade drought.\nFive years later, he is eligible for the baseball Hall of Fame and likely to be among the inductees announced Tuesday."}
