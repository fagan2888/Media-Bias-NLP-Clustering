The former Olympian and reality star has become persona non grata in the LGBT community since coming out for Ted Cruz earlier this March. In an interview with Dawn Ennis for the Advocate (disclosure: I work there as a reporter), Jenner said, \u201cI like Ted Cruz. I think he\u2019s very conservative and a great constitutionalist and a very articulate man.\u201d She also offered to serve as his \u201ctrans ambassador,\u201d should the Senator be elected president in November. During a subsequent episode of \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d Jenner threw more logs on the growing social media firestorm by claiming that racist demagogue Donald Trump \u201cwould be very good for women\u2019s issues.\u201d\n\nJenner, who has never been shy about her Republican views, has attempted to backtrack in recent days by meeting with Hillary Clinton. She had previously been critical of the Democratic frontrunner, calling her a \u201cf**king liar.\u201d Jenner said, \u201cWe\u2019re done, if Hillary becomes president, the country is over.\u201d But in a recent Instagram picture taken with the presidential candidate, Ms. Jenner signaled her willingness to evolve politically. The photo was captioned \u201c#learningfrommygirls #willingtolisten.\u201d\n\nBut for now, the damage may be done. Trans blogger Monica Robert has referred to Jenner\u2019s remarks as \u201cbreathtakingly clueless,\u201d while Joy Behar compared her conservative advocacy to Jewish people supporting Adolf Hitler in a recent episode of \u201cThe View.\u201d Even worse is that the public row over her politics is only Jenner\u2019s most recent controversy. In December, Jenner was widely criticized for transphobic comments she made to Time magazine about why she \u201ctakes [her] presentation seriously.\u201d Jenner said, \u201cIf you\u2019re out there and, to be honest with you, if you look like a man in a dress, it makes people uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn Jenner can and should be criticized, both for these remarks and for her support of Republican candidates like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. After all, Cruz has been an outspoken opponent of affirming bathroom access for transgender teens. The Texas Senator has referred to the Obama administration\u2019s official stance on the subject\u2014that trans students should allowed to use restrooms that match their gender identity\u2014as \u201clunacy.\u201d Cruz told radio show host Steven Crowder last November, \u201c[T]he federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls.\u201d\n\nBut what is not fair game when calling out Caitlyn Jenner is attacking her gender identity. The justified public outrage against Jenner\u2019s problematic personal views has led to a revolting strain of transphobia on the Internet, with social media users exploiting the moment to say pretty much whatever they want about her. Last week, a friend tipped me off that after posting about Jenner\u2019s Republican views on Facebook, his feed filled up with critics bashing her with transphobic slurs and misgendering her. One respondent called her a \u201ctranny ass bitch,\u201d while others repeatedly referred to Jenner as a \u201che.\u201d\n\nThis phenomenon, of course, is not isolated to your Facebook networks. On Twitter, soap opera star Nancy Lee Grahn (who you likely remember for trolling Viola Davis\u2019 Emmy speech) wrote that Caitlyn Jenner still \u201cvotes like a rich white man.\u201d Twitter user Claudia Martin (@cloudypianos) added, \u201cCaitlyn Jenner saying Trump would be good for women\u2019s issues is like a white man saying Trump would be good for women\u2019s issues oh wait [sic].\u201d Chris Hibbs (@chris_hibbs6) also remarked, \u201cShe/he is an attention starved lunatic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since Jenner voiced her support for Ted Cruz, it's been open season for ugly transphobia", "title": "Go ahead and call Caitlyn Jenner a delusional GOP shill \u2014\u00a0but don\u2019t say she\u2019s not a woman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Since Jenner voiced her support for Ted Cruz, it's been open season for ugly transphobia", "title": "Go ahead and call Caitlyn Jenner a delusional GOP shill \u2014\u00a0but don\u2019t say she\u2019s not a woman", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/go_ahead_and_call_caitlyn_jenner_a_delusional_gop_shill_but_dont_say_shes_not_a_woman/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/caitlyn_jenner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since Jenner voiced her support for Ted Cruz, it's been open season for ugly transphobia", "title": "Go ahead and call Caitlyn Jenner a delusional GOP shill \u2014\u00a0but don\u2019t say she\u2019s not a woman", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/caitlyn_jenner.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, caitlyn jenner, LGBT, Transphobia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, caitlyn jenner, LGBT, Transphobia, Elections News, Life News, Entertainment NewsCaitlyn Jenner is having a bad month.\nIn an interview with Dawn Ennis for the Advocate (disclosure: I work there as a reporter), Jenner said, \u201cI like Ted Cruz.\nThe former Olympian and reality star has become persona non grata in the LGBT community since coming out for Ted Cruz earlier this March.\nOne respondent called her a \u201ctranny ass bitch,\u201d while others repeatedly referred to Jenner as a \u201che.\u201dThis phenomenon, of course, is not isolated to your Facebook networks.\nAfter all, Cruz has been an outspoken opponent of affirming bathroom access for transgender teens."}
