There has been steady good news on the economic front in consistent Wall Street gains, record corporate profits, world-leading oil exports, falling gas prices, and job growth numbers as a result of the Obama Administration\u2019s rejection of Republican economic policies. However, now that Republicans will have control of both houses of Congress, they will start, immediately, passing legislation to revert back to Bush-era economics and undo the economic progress of the past six years.\n\nRepublicans campaigned on, and have lied perpetually about their storied \u201c40 bills\u201d on job creation such as opening up our world leading oil production for American jobs, building Canadian corporation TransCanada\u2019s Keystone pipeline, reducing tax rates for the rich and corporations, balancing the budget, and abolishing environmental regulations. Boehner and Paul Ryan have complained bitterly \u201cthat all 40 jobs bills are dying over there in the United States Senate.\u201d The problem for Americans is that beginning in January the 40 jobs bills, all gifts to corporations, will be brought to life and instead of creating jobs, will create more wealth for the one-percent at the expense of the poor, the middle class, Americans\u2019 health, and of course jobs; typical Republican economics.\n\nNone of the House jobs bills were designed to create even one job. It is difficult, indeed, to imagine any American believes that abolishing overtime pay, giving tax breaks and credits to corporations outsourcing Americans\u2019 jobs, or providing tax incentives for the rich and corporations to conceal their wealth offshore will create jobs; but many are stupid enough to believe lying Republicans and probably think they did pass 46 jobs bills. But for any American capable of a 6-year old\u2019s cognitive ability, or noted economic experts, the GOP\u2019s jobs bills are a joke.\n\nAccording to five noted economists who reviewed the storied jobs bills, three decades of trickle-down economics, current economic disasters in Republican states, and current economic successes in blue Democratic states, not one of the Republicans\u2019 so-called \u201cjobs bills\u201d will have any measurable impact on job growth. In fact, as history proves, and Republicans intend, the bills serve to kill jobs and economic growth while promoting the Koch, Wall Street, and Republicans\u2019 agenda; enrich the oil industry and corporations at the middle class and poor\u2019s expense.\n\nSome of the more absurd \u201cjobs bills\u201d are worth noting including four of Boehner\u2019s so-called education bills purported to be monumental job creators. According to Cecilia Rouse, the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, \u201cnot one of them would affect job growth like Republicans claim.\u201d Two of the bills require colleges to offer loan counseling and push the Department of Education to provide information for potential college attendees. Rouse said all colleges already have dedicated loan or financial aid counselors, and like the second bill, will not create any jobs.\n\nThe other two education \u201cjob creation\u201d bills \u201cseize control of primary education from the federal government by allowing states to transfer public school funding to underperforming private and religious charter schools; something the Obama Education Department champions as part of its (not so stealthy) anti-union school privatization crusade. Much more on this in another article.\n\nRepublicans claim that cutting social programs is a sure-fire job creator, and they cite two special bills they claim boosts economic growth and creates an explosion of new jobs. One is Paul Ryan\u2019s Path to Prosperity budget that every economist not with the Heritage Foundation said would \u201cnot only harm poor Americans, but also hinder job creation by depressing demand in the economy.\u201d The other proposal is a harsh work requirement to qualify for food stamps that will not create jobs for the majority of recipients who already work; including active-duty service members.\n\nAn economist at the American Enterprise Institute, Michael Strain, questioned exactly how imposing work requirements will create employment opportunities in a slow economy; particularly for the elderly and children who make up a substantial number of food stamp recipients. Strain said, \u201cThe problem with talking about these things is in a depressed economy, the jobs need to be there. If the jobs aren\u2019t there, you can\u2019t impose work requirements.\u201d A Brookings economist, Gary Burtless, said that \u201cpulling people\u2019s fingernails out in order to get them to take a job does not add to the total stock of jobs in the economy.\u201d It is important to note that Republicans are not interested in adding jobs, just cutting food stamp funding to give the wealthy tax cuts.\n\nThe largest number of bills are aimed at deregulating the dirty energy sector (oil, coal, and mining) that Republicans claim will create jobs by \u201csaving companies a lot of money.\u201d But according to University of Michigan public policy professor specializing in environmental policy, Barry Rabe, \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a classic argument\u201d from Republicans to claim that any these bills would help Americans who are looking for more jobs. Rabe said that the bills are a response to Obama\u2019s environmental goals that will put a damper on the Republican goal of \u201csaving energy companies a lot of money.\u201d For example, one \u201cjobs\u201d bill bans the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing emissions standards, and another \u201cjob creation bill\u201d requires the EPA to give its authority to Republicans in Congress. The total number of jobs created from both bills is absolutely zero, but the total profit for the Kochs to decimate the environment, like the other bills enriching corporations, is immeasurable; but that is the whole point of every one of the Republicans\u2019 so-called jobs bills.\n\nThe only reason there has been consistent job and economic growth since Republicans crashed the economy during the Bush era is because President Obama has rejected their disastrous economic policies. In fact, the Obama Administration has presided over the best job creation streak since 1939, and so far 2014 has been the strongest year for job growth since 1999; all in spite of Republicans\u2019 Herculean attempts to kill jobs, thwart economic growth, and basically do nothing but bitch and moan about immigration, Obamacare, Ebola, Benghazi, and something about a WTF war on religion.\n\nThe President is certainly going to be busy using his veto over the next two years, because as is their wont, Republicans will do everything in their power to decimate the economic gains in jobs, GDP growth, revenue, and debt reduction as a result of a Democrat in the White House. It too bad the Americans who voted for Republicans according to their promise of enacting the 46 jobs bills that do not create jobs were too racist, too religious, and too incredibly stupid to notice that the only reason there has been record job growth is because Republicans did not control Congress. Next month that changes and for the next two years they will do everything in their power to reverse the past few years impressive job growth numbers, give the rich more tax breaks, kill regulations, and keep Americans\u2019 wages from growing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now that Republicans will have control of both houses of Congress, they will start, immediately, passing legislation to revert back to Bush-era economics and undo the economic progress of the past six years.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Now that Republicans will have control of both houses of Congress, they will start, immediately, passing legislation to revert back to Bush-era economics and undo the economic progress of the past six years.", "title": "Boehner And Republicans Plan To Reverse Growth Numbers and Kill Jobs", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/12/06/boehner-republicans-plan-reverse-job-growth-numbers.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/boehner-jobs-lost.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-06T17:44:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,Republican Party,American enterprise Institute,Boehner Ryan,Congress,Department of Education,Economics,economist,Environmental Protection Agency,federal government,food stamp funding,food stamps,Gary Burtless,GOP Job-killers,GOP jobs bills,jobs report,John Boehner,Michael Strain,Oil Industry,paul ryan,tax cuts,TransCanada,trickle down economics,United States Senate,White House,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2014-12-06T15:58:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T17:44:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "American enterprise Institute, Boehner Ryan, Congress, Department of Education, Economics, economist, Environmental Protection Agency, federal government, food stamp funding, food stamps, Gary Burtless, GOP Job-killers, GOP jobs bills, jobs report, John Boehner, Michael Strain, Oil Industry, paul ryan, Republican Party, tax cuts, TransCanada, trickle down economics, United States Senate, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc039\"", "article_summary": "But for any American capable of a 6-year old\u2019s cognitive ability, or noted economic experts, the GOP\u2019s jobs bills are a joke.\nSome of the more absurd \u201cjobs bills\u201d are worth noting including four of Boehner\u2019s so-called education bills purported to be monumental job creators.\nNone of the House jobs bills were designed to create even one job.\nThe only reason there has been consistent job and economic growth since Republicans crashed the economy during the Bush era is because President Obama has rejected their disastrous economic policies.\nRepublicans claim that cutting social programs is a sure-fire job creator, and they cite two special bills they claim boosts economic growth and creates an explosion of new jobs."}
