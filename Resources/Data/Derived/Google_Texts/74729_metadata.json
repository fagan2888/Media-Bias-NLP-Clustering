The assessment includes responses from more than 1,000 medical groups in which more than 48,000 physicians practice nationwide.\n\nThe practices surveyed were critical of Medicare\u2019s physician quality reporting programs and their impact on patients and practices. The Medicare Part B programs under scrutiny include the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), the meaningful-use EHR Incentive Program and the Value-Based Payment Modifier Program.\n\nPhysician practices in the MGMA survey reported significant challenges in complying with Medicare quality reporting requirements. More than 70 percent rated Medicare\u2019s quality reporting requirements as \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d complex. In addition, a significant majority of respondents indicated these programs negatively affected practice efficiency, support staff time and clinician morale.\n\n\u201cMedicare has lost focus with its physician quality reporting programs,\" said Anders Gilberg, MGMA senior vice president of government affairs. \"Instead of providing timely, meaningful and actionable information to help physicians treat patients, this has become a massive bureaucratic reporting exercise. Each program has its own set of arcane and duplicative rules which force physician practices to divert resources away from patient care.\"\n\nMore than 82 percent of the physician group practices surveyed reported they actively engage in internal processes to improve clinical quality for the patients they serve. Gilberg said 2015 will be a critical year for medical group practices participating under the three main Medicare Part B physician quality reporting programs. It will be the first year all three programs penalize physicians for reporting unsuccessfully, and penalties will continue to grow in future years.\n\nUnsuccessful reporting in 2015 will subject physicians and other eligible providers to combined Medicare payment penalties as high as 11 percent, levied in future years.\n\n\u201cMGMA continues to advocate for a single-harmonized Medicare quality improvement initiative that standardizes reporting and supports physicians in their efforts to improve care for their patients,\u201d Gilberg said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/physician-practices-critique-medicare-quality-reporting-programs", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Medical_Care_Card_USA_Sample.JPG", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "More than 83 percent of physician practices do not believe current Medicare physician quality reporting programs enhanced their physicians' ability to provide high-quality patient care, according to new research released Monday.", "title": "Physician practices critique Medicare quality reporting programs"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Medical_Care_Card_USA_Sample.JPG"}, "title": "Physician practices critique Medicare quality reporting programs", "description": "More than 83 percent of physician practices do not believe current Medicare physician quality reporting programs enhanced their physicians' ability to provide high-quality patient care, according to new research released Monday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "More than 83 percent of physician practices do not believe current Medicare physician quality reporting programs enhanced their physicians\u2019 ability to provide high-quality patient care, according to new research released Monday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3aad\"", "article_summary": "The practices surveyed were critical of Medicare\u2019s physician quality reporting programs and their impact on patients and practices.\nMore than 83 percent of physician practices do not believe current Medicare physician quality reporting programs enhanced their physicians\u2019 ability to provide high-quality patient care, according to new research released Monday.\n\u201cMedicare has lost focus with its physician quality reporting programs,\" said Anders Gilberg, MGMA senior vice president of government affairs.\nGilberg said 2015 will be a critical year for medical group practices participating under the three main Medicare Part B physician quality reporting programs.\nPhysician practices in the MGMA survey reported significant challenges in complying with Medicare quality reporting requirements."}
