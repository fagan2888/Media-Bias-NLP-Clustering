Domestic violence isn't a women's problem it's a men's problem and until such time as men wake up to that fact and other men, good men stand up and do something about it, it will continue,\" Mr Murdoch said.\n\n\"We need a massive attitude adjustment or a realisation by men that this sort of stuff is unacceptable and that other men don't put up with it and really take a very strong stand against it and if men become aware their brother, their father, their mate is committing domestic violence they are essentially ostracised, excommunicated. I never want to have anything to do with you again and wipe them, not only about not having a beer, just wipe them, never want to see you again and all his mates need to say that, not just one,\" Mr Murdoch said.\n\nDomestic violence reports has climbed over the past five years because police now have wider powers to act, Mr Murdoch said, assuring victims that police no longer put the crime in the too hard basket, as was the case many years ago.\n\nDatabase aid for domestic violence victims\n\n\"Cops going the extra mile, five years ago, we used to fall into the trap if the victim does not want to cooperate there is not too much we can do, but these days there is lots we can do, we just need to be smarter,\" Mr Murdoch said. \"So if victims have confidence that when they report domestic violence to the cops they will be cared for and supported and that something will be done about it then they will come forward.\" Mr Murdoch said under-reporting was also a problem, estimated as high as 50 per cent, but alarmingly the system was already overloaded.\n\n\"We're at breaking point now, even if we got a five per cent increase, or a 10 per cent increase in reporting, I doubt out mechanisms could cope, we'd basically go into meltdown, we're struggling to cope now, it is a very significant societal problem,\" Mr Murdoch said.\n\nJoan's torment: the unlikely face of our domestic violence crisis\n\nAt 84, Joan Sheargold is the unlikely face of domestic violence. The diminutive great-grandmother has been harassed, intimidated and stood over by her own son, a 44-year-old drug addicted who has continuously fleeced her of her pension money.\n\nMrs Sheargold is one of the many cases the specialist Mt Druitt Domestic Violence Unit was established to help. The Sunday Telegraph was given exclusive access to the unit which deals with between 200 and 400 domestic violence incidents a week, or 4200 a year. Elder abuse like Joan's, police say, is quite common.\n\nPolice in Victoria support crime victims right to know\n\n\"He won't leave me alone, he comes here all the time wanting money,\" Mrs Sheargold said from her tiny housing commission unit in Emerton. Torn between a mother's love and her need to keep herself safe, she has often called police to remove him over a 16-year-period, but now police have taken out an apprehended violence order against Colin Sheargold.\n\n\"He's got no-one else you see,\" Mrs Sheargold said. \"But he continuously harassed me; he just wouldn't leave me alone. I want him to leave me alone.\" Senior Constables Brian Johnson and Constable Chris Grant from the Mt Druitt unit have worked tirelessly for a year to get help for Joan, putting in place a five year apprehended violence order against her son, which he breached three weeks ago and is not serving time in jail.\n\n\"He was a drug user and he would frighten her and he would intimidate her to give him money, harass and bombard her,\" said Senior Constable Johnson. Even from jail he is now calling her, demanding money.\n\nSergeant Dave McInerney, who heads up the six officer unit, said with 51 per cent of the population born overseas, cultural differences often played a role as did unemployment.\n\n\"We have high rates of government housing, blended families, single families, generational unemployment, we tick all the boxes in terms of risk,\" Sgt McInerney said. Some cultures, like the pacific islanders also see domestic abuse as the norm.\n\nCalls go up for tougher sentences for domestic violence\n\nBut police now have expanded powers to take out an AVO's against a perpetrator, no longer waiting for reluctant partners to cooperate, an issue that has traditionally frustrated police.\n\n\"We can have a victim on Friday and by Monday before court they are back in love,\" said Senior Constable Johnson. \"I've even had an offender make a full admission and his partner is denying it.\" One case where police successfully acted without cooperation from the victim involved a 22-year-old woman with three children who had been repeatedly bashed and had called triple zero many times for last minute help.\n\n\"This guy is one of the worst domestic violence offenders, he tried to smother her and collapsed her lung, continued reports have been made by her, just wanting the police to stop him but she would not co-operate with police any further,\" Sgt McInerney said.\n\nPolice from the unit subpoenaed the triple zero calls and medical reports and obtained an AVO against the man without the women as a witness. He was jailed for breaching the AVO, however, he recently got out and police had reports he had move back home and one of the children had been injured and taken out of preschool, a red flag to police as the child may have visible injuries.\n\n\"She's had a baby recently and the kids have been withdrawn from preschool, so we're concerned\" said Sgt McInerney.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph joined police and caseworkers from the Department of Family and Community Services on a visit to the woman. Two little girls aged four and two promptly told Constable Sarah Casey that 'Daddy was hiding upstairs'. The four year old also showed Constable Casey her mouth where she said she had been hit. She then said \"Daddy hit (the two-year-old) in the mouth with an egg flip.\" Sgt McInerney said both police and the DoFCS wanted the woman to co-operate with an intensive case management plan, or lose the children. After an hour, the woman agreed to leave the house with the three children and enter a refuge.\n\n\"Fairy-tale ending? We hope but in reality, she may get back with him and then we'll end up taking the kids off her,\" Sgt McInerney said.\n\nT rust us: Murdoch's plea to women\n\nWOMEN endure an average of 24 domestic violence attacks before coming forward, Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch said.\n\nAround 100 women a year die as a result of domestic violence and with 40 per cent of all homicides related to domestic violence, but Mr Murdoch said women endure the abuse far too long before seeking help.\n\n\"A woman on average, the research tells us will be a victim of domestic violence 24 times before she will first come forward and report,\" Mr Murdoch said.\n\n\"When a woman comes forward as a first time victim, she is already a repeat victim many times over and that's the way I want the police to approach domestic violence because everyone is a repeat victim,\" he said.\n\nKay Schubach, ambassador for Domestic Violence NSW and a former victim herself agreed men needed to 'man up' to other male abusers, but women needed to stand up too.\n\n\"We need to 'woman up', it's about speaking out, turning all that fear and shame around and grabbing it and harnessing it until you have a voice,\" Ms Schubach said, pleading with women to come forward to get help.\n\n\"Don't be ashamed, it's not your fault, you are being controlled and your self-esteem is eroded but it's not your fault, speak out till you are heard. Do talk to the police, they are sensitive and tactful, they are fantastic,\" she said.\n\nOften the most dangerous time for a woman in a violent relationship is when decides to leave and Ms Schubach urges such women to have a safety plan in place.\n\n\"When you try and leave is the most vulnerable time, have some money stashed away if you can, have some clothes at the dry cleaners,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NSW is in the grip of a domestic violence crisis with 135,000 reported cases last year, up 30 per cent from five years ago.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "NSW is in the grip of a domestic violence crisis with 135,000 reported cases last year, up 30 per cent from five years ago.", "title": "Man up: NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch urges blokes to stand up to woman-beaters", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/man-up-nsw-police-assistant-commissioner-mark-murdoch-urges-blokes-to-stand-up-to-womanbeaters/story-fni0cx12-1226718538526", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/09/13/1226718/536536-49bbe59c-19de-11e3-b5fd-781e93ad4f40.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/09/13/1226718/536536-49bbe59c-19de-11e3-b5fd-781e93ad4f40.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226718538526, "keywords": "police work, crime type, repeat victim, Domestic Violence Line, Domestic violence reports, domestic violence crisis, Story Assignment, assignment click, solution lies, men wake, male abusers, Map Reference, email body, Kay Schubach, Jane Hansen, Mark Murdoch, domestic violence, time victim, highest volume crime, massive attitude adjustment, Assignment Instructions, volume crime type, men stand, sending company, computer virus, story text, TASK INFO, safety plan, reply e-mail", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Sep 21 22:40:19 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Sep 21 22:40:19 EST 2013", "author": "JANE HANSEN"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd035\"", "article_summary": "Joan's torment: the unlikely face of our domestic violence crisisAt 84, Joan Sheargold is the unlikely face of domestic violence.\nMrs Sheargold is one of the many cases the specialist Mt Druitt Domestic Violence Unit was established to help.\nAssistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch said domestic violence now constitutes up 40 per cent of all police work in most commands, outstripping every other crime.\nT rust us: Murdoch's plea to womenWOMEN endure an average of 24 domestic violence attacks before coming forward, Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch said.\nMr Murdoch said under-reporting was also a problem, estimated as high as 50 per cent, but alarmingly the system was already overloaded."}
