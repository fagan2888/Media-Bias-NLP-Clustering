PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — According to Richard Weinstein, voters have a right to know that the authors of the Affordable Care Act think it passed because of the “stupidity of the American voter.”

Weinstein has now made news for leaking a video that depicts one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act encouraging a lack of transparency in government.

“I’m not responsible for the words on that video. Dr. Gruber is responsible for the words on that video. I just found it. It was out there in plain sight. I’m just finding it and showing it to people,” Weinstein said.

He told WPHT morning host Chris Stigall that he was inspired to investigate some of the architects of the ACA after he and his family were one of the many people kicked off their insurance about a year ago. Weinstein didn’t have confidence in the mainstream media and politicians to get to the bottom of it.

“You just knew that [the politicians] weren’t telling the truth and the media was simply cheerleading either for or against the law,” he said.

Weinstein has been sifting through hours of video of Dr. David Cutler, Zeke Emanuel, and Dr. Gruber since, but he only found this video within the past week. Weinstein teased that this is not even the most damning of what he has found.

“I think that it might actually come out today…I have an idea of what’s going to come out, and I think that it’s going to be crazy.”

He hinted to WPHT’s Chris Stigall that the people with Megyn Kelly and Fox News are trying to get a comment from the White House on one of his videos. Even though has been reached out to by the likes of Kelly and CNN’s Jake Tapper, he maintains that there is nothing special about what he did, and says that any other everyday citizen could do it too.

“I’m just a regular person…I’m an investment advisor…If I can make a difference, anybody can make a difference. All I did was explore Google. If you have a subject that’s really bothering you, go figure it out.”
