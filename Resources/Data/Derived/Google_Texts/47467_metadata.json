A similar percentage said their ability to manage a patient with the condition was hampered by their own lack of training.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society chief executive, Jeremy Hughes, said: \u201cOur survey gives a stark view from the doctor\u2019s surgery of people with dementia left struggling in the aftermath of a diagnosis. GPs report an endemic and deeply worrying lack of support available from health and social services, with relatives left to pick up the pieces alone.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople can need a lot of help to live well with dementia. Families and friends are a vital source of support but they mustn\u2019t be relied on to do everything. As dementia takes hold, people with dementia and their carers look to statutory services to give them the backup they desperately need to cope.\u201d\n\nDementia has been described as a ticking timebomb with the number of people in the UK expected to increase from 850,000 currently to over one million by 2021 and two million by 2051.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society survey also found that half of GPs think the NHS is doing too little to care for people with the condition and three in five believe a lack of cooperation between the NHS and social care acts as a barrier to patients getting support. Around three-quarters think that patients, families and carers are left confused by the health and social care system.\n\nDr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the BMA\u2019s GP committee, said: \u201cGPs are increasingly frustrated that due to excessive cuts to local authority funding, some of the most vulnerable people in our society are not receiving the level of care and support they deserve.\n\n\u201cThe increasing emphasis on diagnosing dementia has not been matched with proper services for patients once they are diagnosed.\u201d\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society wants everyone diagnosed with the disease to have a dementia adviser and for there to be a single point of contact to help carers navigate the health and social care system. It also says that all hospitals, care homes and home care should be made \u201cdementia-friendly\u201d.\n\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \u201cDementia training has already been given to 600,000 NHS and social care staff, and our diagnosis rates are now among the highest in the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter a diagnosis, we are already expanding access to named clinicians and dementia advisers to help patients and their families, and giving the option of personal budgets \u2013 and we want to see these things being offered across the NHS.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has set out a further challenge for all NHS and social care staff to be trained in order to provide meaningful care and support for people with dementia, their carers and their families.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Survey by Alzheimer\u2019s Society finds dementia patients require support of family and friends after being let down by health and social care system", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Haroon Siddique", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Survey by Alzheimer\u2019s Society finds dementia patients require support of family and friends after being let down by health and social care system", "title": "Dementia patients forced to rely on unpaid carers, poll says", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/06/dementia-care-alzheimers-society-survey-health", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e96c39030bc7dfdf7212ba37e3a5984354816b2/0_247_4252_2553/master/4252.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=5083a25bb7c74063c2d552c28c438304", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2015/jul/06/dementia-care-alzheimers-society-survey-health?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/06/dementia-care-alzheimers-society-survey-health", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2015/jul/06/dementia-care-alzheimers-society-survey-health?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e96c39030bc7dfdf7212ba37e3a5984354816b2/0_247_4252_2553/master/4252.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2015/jul/06/dementia-care-alzheimers-society-survey-health?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Dementia,Alzheimer's,Health,Mental health,Society,UK news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-05T23:01:04.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/haroonsiddique", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T23:01:04.000Z", "tag": "Dementia,Alzheimer's,Health,Mental health,Society,UK news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e96c39030bc7dfdf7212ba37e3a5984354816b2/0_247_4252_2553/4252.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=5e1cd592cdec5294010fd0e8c4b52e11", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Dementia,Alzheimer's,Health,Mental health,Society,UK news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3e7\"", "article_summary": "Three-quarters of GPs say their dementia patients are forced to rely on family, friends, neighbours or other unpaid carers, because they get insufficient help from health and social care services.\nAround three-quarters think that patients, families and carers are left confused by the health and social care system.\nAccording to the poll, a quarter of GPs are reluctant to refer people with suspected dementia if support services are not in place \u2013 potentially undermining a national drive to improve rates of diagnosis.\nGPs report an endemic and deeply worrying lack of support available from health and social services, with relatives left to pick up the pieces alone.\n\u201cThe prime minister has set out a further challenge for all NHS and social care staff to be trained in order to provide meaningful care and support for people with dementia, their carers and their families.\u201d"}
