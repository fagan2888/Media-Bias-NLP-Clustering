Whether this is good or bad depends on what happens to his key policies.\n\nTo commemorate President\u2019s Day, POLITICO Magazine has given space to several historians to give their verdicts on the Obama presidency, and speculate on where it might fall in the scope of American history. The whole exercise is a riff on a quote, from Obama, in his interview with David Remnick of the New Yorker:\n\n\u201cI think we are born into this world and inherit all the grudges and rivalries and hatreds and sins of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also inherit the beauty and the joy and goodness of our forebears. And we\u2019re on this planet a pretty short time, so that we cannot remake the world entirely during this little stretch that we have.\u201d The long view again. \u201cBut I think our decisions matter,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd I think America was very lucky that Abraham Lincoln was President when he was President. If he hadn\u2019t been, the course of history would be very different. But I also think that, despite being the greatest President, in my mind, in our history, it took another hundred and fifty years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality. I think that doesn\u2019t diminish Lincoln\u2019s achievements, but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we\u2019re part of a long-running story. We just try to get our paragraph right.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a historian, but I do read history, follow politics, and have thoughts on Obama\u2019s potential legacy as the 44th president of the United States. Now, obviously I\u2019m writing this as a liberal, who\u2014for all of my criticism\u2014has a favorable view of the president. Still, I think it\u2019s inarguable that Barack Obama is\u2014and will be considered\u2014a consequential president.\n\nTo start, his election (and reelection) as the first African American to reach the nation\u2019s highest office, will earn him a place in the history books, regardless of how his administration shakes out. To call it \u201chistoric\u201d is a bit clich\u00e9, but we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the extent to which it redefines our view of which groups have a claim to the presidency.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, I think Obama\u2019s legacy depends on two things: The final shape of the economy when he leaves office, and the fate of the Affordable Care Act. For as much as the stimulus was a success\u2014in addition to ending the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, it made hundreds of billions in long-term investments to the nation\u2019s physical and human infrastructure\u2014it wasn\u2019t enough to bring the economy back to speed. Instead, for much of Obama\u2019s presidency, we have slogged through a painful recovery, with mass unemployment, stagnant wages, and vicious cuts to public sector employment.\n\nIf, by 2017, those trends are on the reverse\u2014if the economy is growing at a healthy clip and those gains are more evenly distributed\u2014then Obama gets credit both for stopping the Great Recession and putting the nation on track for a robust recovery. This, I think, moves him up a notch and puts him in the top half of post-war presidents. On the other hand, if we remain on the same path, then it is\u2014or should be\u2014a huge detriment to his standing.\n\nThe dynamic is a little different with Obamacare. Either way, because of its size and the herculean effort to pass it, it stands as an important expansion of the welfare state for which Obama will be remembered. The question for his legacy as a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d president depends on your ideological perspective\u2014even Lincoln still has his detractors\u2014and the actual success of the program.\n\nIf the Affordable Care Act works\u2014if it expands insurance to all Americans, if it slows costs and moves our health care system to something more sustainable\u2014then Obama will be hailed for his foresight and skill. But if, as Republicans predict, it collapses completely, it will stand as a huge mistake and major blemish on his presidency. Indeed, if we get a stagnant economy and a failed health care problem, you\u2019re left with a domestic legacy that\u2019s mediocre at best.\n\nAnd I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Obama\u2019s role\u2014material and otherwise\u2014in advancing and protecting the rights of LGBT Americans. Given the degree to which they still lack legal protections, and continue to face violence, discrimination, and social stigma, this isn\u2019t a small thing.\n\nForeign policy isn\u2019t my wheelhouse\u2014for that you\u2019ll want to read my colleagues\u2014but my guess is that Obama will get deserved credit for ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as killing Osama bin Laden, but will receive an asterisk\u2014if not criticism\u2014for his expansion of the national security state, from mass surveillance to targeted killings and drone warfare.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402171810, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Barack Obama was elected in consequential times, which makes him a consequential president.
