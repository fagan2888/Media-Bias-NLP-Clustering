A December Quinnipiac survey showed her walking away with the nomination with the support of two-thirds of Democratic voters, and an NBC head-to-head poll showed her beating potential GOP pick Gov. Chris Christie by 10 points.\n\n/ Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accepts the Global Champion Award onstage at the International Medical Corps Annual Awards Celebration at Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel on November 8, 2013 in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nBut in a redux of her battle against then-Sen. Barack Obama during the 2008 primary, Clinton will again have to differentiate herself from the man who went from a harbinger of hope to a president with sinking approval ratings.\n\n\u201cPolitics is a team game,\u201d says Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, who points to Obama\u2019s unpopularity as a drag on Clinton\u2019s national approval ratings. \u201cThe captain of the Blue Team, President Obama, isn\u2019t doing well these days and it rubs off on members of the team.\u201d\n\nClinton ultimately lost her last bid to lead a country hungry for a fresh kind of leadership. This time, she\u2019ll have to thread the needle between displaying the political experience she gained during the past administration and appearing to maintain the Democratic status quo.\n\nJoe Biden \u2013 Accentuate the positive\n\nIn a November focus group of Cincinnati voters conducted by NBC News, the Wall Street Journal and the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, Biden was a relatively sympathetic figure to Democratic-leaners, but not a strong one. Those in the group who were generally supportive of the president and his team insisted that Biden is \u201ctrying\u201d to be a good leader and to ease governance with a stubborn Congress. Others in the group were less forgiving, bluntly labeling the vice president \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nSteve Pope / Getty Images Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the 36th Annual Harkin Steak Fry on September 15, 2013 in Indianola, Iowa.\n\nWhile his favorability with Democrats remains relatively high, it\u2019s much more tempered than the fervor surrounding Clinton. (Seventy percent of Democrats in the recent Quinnipiac poll had a favorable view of Biden, versus a whopping 92 percent for Hillary Clinton. And a November poll showed that just 51 percent of Democrats said they think Biden \u201cwould make a good president,\u201d versus 38 percent who said the opposite.)\n\nIf he wants to stay in the game, he\u2019ll have to convince voters who like him that he\u2019s not just \u201ctrying\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s succeeding as a savvy deal-maker whose diplomatic skills really are a \u201cbig ****ing deal.\u201d\n\nBut with the kind of numbers he\u2019s posting now, that\u2019s going to be a heavy lift for the veep.\n\nOther 2016 Democrats \u2013 Introduce yourself\n\nAsk a regular Democratic-leaning voter how he or she feels about Martin O\u2019Malley, Andrew Cuomo or Brian Schweitzer, and you\u2019re likely to get a shrug or a \u201cwho?\u201d Besides Clinton and Biden (and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says she\u2019s not running), no Democrats are registering more than a few percentage points of support.\n\nSome liberal Democrats say that there\u2019s a vacuum to Clinton\u2019s left on economic issues that could be filled by a new voice \u2013 much like how Obama pressured Clinton over her early support of the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cWall Street and Social Security are the new Iraq,\u201d says Adam Green, the head of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThese are issues that Democratic primary voters will vote on, and if she\u2019s not aligned with Elizabeth Warren on those issues, it\u2019s likely that some candidate is going to see that opportunity and decide to run.\u201d\n\nWarren \u2013 dubbed the \u201cNorth Star\u201d of Green\u2019s progressive organization -- has said she\u2019s not running for president, but Clinton can expect her acolytes to pepper her with questions about issues like banking regulations and income inequality.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that she does the right thing,\u201d Green says of Clinton. \u201cA lot of people are ready for Hillary to be bold and to be populist. We\u2019re rooting for her to do that, but if she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s to her own detriment.\u201d\n\nFormer Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, one possible 2016 contender, appears to be eyeing the chance to jump in if Clinton doesn\u2019t assuage the concerns of the party\u2019s populist wing.\n\n\u201cThe question that we have is, will it be the Hillary that leads the progressives?\u201d he said on MSNBC this week. \u201cOr is it the Hillary that says, 'I'm already going to win the Democratic nomination, and so I can shift hard right on Day 1.?' We can't afford any more hard right.\u201d\n\nChris Christie \u2013 Break out of the Acela corridor\n\nOne of the most striking findings from that NBC/WSJ/Annenberg focus group in Ohio was just how \u201cmeh\u201d participants were about the governor of New Jersey.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ) participates in an onstage interview during the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council annual meeting in Washington November 18, 2013.\n\n\u201cChris Christie was a non-personality,\" said pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the focus group. \"We talk about him as being big and omnipresent; he was small and insignificant.\"\n\nSure, he\u2019s got a lead in the fragmented polling of GOP contenders, and he\u2019s the talk of the Morning Joe crowd. But some of the country\u2019s influential early voting populations are not so jazzed about the man who won an overwhelming re-election in a deep blue state.\n\nHe\u2019s tied for fifth place in the Des Moines Register\u2019s latest poll of Iowa Republicans, and his national approval ratings among self-described conservatives are lower than those for firebrands like Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cThe question is that the Republican presidential primary is dominated by conservatives, and there are some who are just not enamored with Mr. Christie,\u201d said Brown, who noted that Christie garners impressive support among independents. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d\n\nRand Paul \u2013 Focus on the family\n\nEvery politician has to balance family and his career, but no clan did more thinking out loud about a presidential run in 2013 than the Pauls. The Kentucky senator has openly said he\u2019s considering a bid, while his famous father former Rep. Ron Paul told CNN that he thinks his son \u201cprobably will\u201d go for it. But Rand\u2019s wife Kelley Ashby \u2013 a former political consultant \u2013 has said she\u2019s not sold on the idea because of today\u2019s culture of \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d\n\nGary Cameron / Reuters Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) (R) talks to reporters outside of the Senate chamber after voting on the U.S. budget bill in Washington December 18, 2013.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of the tens of millions of dollars in opposition research that they\u2019d be aiming right at us and our family \u2014 that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d she told reporter Jason Horowitz earlier this year.\n\nThe younger Paul has been candid about how the first political battle of his campaign would have to be won in his own living room. \u201cIf I\u2019m a very able politician, I\u2019ll tell you in a year whether I\u2019m able to persuade my wife,\u201d he told inquirers at a Detroit speaking engagement. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t know yet, but I thank you for your interest.\u201d\n\nHis father\u2019s big name is a strength for Paul, offering him a built-in constituency and the outlines of a political organization in key primary states. But the senator will also have to differentiate himself as a more accessible version of the libertarian patriarch if he wants to succeed electorally where his dad was unable to break through.\n\nTed Cruz \u2013 Grow big or go home\n\nCruz was unquestionably a breakout conservative star of 2013. After pulling off an upset Senate primary win against a well-funded lieutenant governor, Cruz bounded from relative obscurity to the national spotlight after he led the conservative fight to defund Obamacare \u2013 and became the face of the October government shutdown. He handily won this year\u2019s CPAC straw poll and made the shortlist for Time\u2019s 2013 person of the year.\n\nBut when it comes to the numbers, it\u2019s a less rosy picture. The latest NBC/WSJ poll showed Cruz upside-down with non-Tea Party Republicans. In Iowa, a state ripe for a rock-ribbed social conservative to make a play, Cruz has a tepid 46 to 17 percent approval rating even among Republicans, and he gets handily beaten by Clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.\n\nAs with many candidates, there\u2019s also a big chunk of Americans who haven\u2019t been focused enough on the political landscape to form an opinion yet. That could signal that he has room to grow with small-government voters, but it might also mean that he could maintain more influence as a thorn in the side of establishment senators than he would on the national campaign trail.\n\nOther 2016 Republicans \u2013 Build a case\n\nThe wide-open GOP nomination race could get crowded. But unlike last cycle\u2019s parade of contenders who turned out to be better candidates for a cable TV gig than for president, there\u2019s no shortage of experienced Republican pols who could catch a wave and ride it to the nomination. Budget whiz Rep. Paul Ryan (recently aglow from some attention-catching poll numbers in Iowa), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio could all position themselves as pragmatic candidates with an eye for reshaping a more modern GOP.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget veteran candidates who may be returning for another try: Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum could each make a convincing play for Iowa and South Carolina evangelicals. For these potential candidates, the coming year\u2019s outreach and alliances will show who\u2019s got a realistic path to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., and why.\n\nThis story was originally published on", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a new year approaching, Americans around the country turn to self-improvement as they boldly embark on new gym memberships, frugal savings plans and well-intentioned strategies to break their bad habits.\nThe nation\u2019s next crop of aspiring", "author": "NBC Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "With a new year approaching, Americans around the country turn to self-improvement as they boldly embark on new gym memberships, frugal savings plans and well-intentioned strategies to break their bad habits.\nThe nation&rsquo;s next crop of aspiring", "title": "Never too early: New Year's resolutions for the 2016 crowd", "url": "http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/25/21970054-never-too-early-new-years-resolutions-for-the-2016-crowd", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/g-cvr-131112-hillary-clinton-tease-10a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 21970054, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"nbcpolitics\",\"displayName\":\"NBC Politics\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"7244\",\"articleCount\":\"4978\",\"seedCount\":\"3166\",\"memberCount\":\"33\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1321036920,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464298734,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Never too early: New Year's resolutions for the 2016 crowd - NBC Politics", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"politics\",\"subSection\":\"nbcpolitics\",\"sitePageId\":\"a21970054\",\"headline\":\"Never too early: New Year's resolutions for the 2016 crowd\",\"pageSource\":\"NBC Politics\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"NBC Politics\",\"tags\":[\"white-house\",\"featured\",\"meet-the-press\",\"updated\",\"appfeatured\",\"decision-2016\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "104.96.220.239", "nv": {"contentId": 21970054, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 26, 2016, 4:01 pm", "server": "web07", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/25/21970054-never-too-early-new-years-resolutions-for-the-2016-crowd"}, "article_summary": "Sure, he\u2019s got a lead in the fragmented polling of GOP contenders, and he\u2019s the talk of the Morning Joe crowd.\n(Seventy percent of Democrats in the recent Quinnipiac poll had a favorable view of Biden, versus a whopping 92 percent for Hillary Clinton.\nBrian Schweitzer, one possible 2016 contender, appears to be eyeing the chance to jump in if Clinton doesn\u2019t assuage the concerns of the party\u2019s populist wing.\nBudget whiz Rep.
