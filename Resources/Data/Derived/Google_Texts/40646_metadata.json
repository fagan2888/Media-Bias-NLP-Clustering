Because court records have been redacted containing necessary information, it\u2019s also possible but not confirmable at this time that Mann, who headed the prosecution of the O\u2019Keefe case, may have done the same.\n\nO\u2019Keefe is seeking to have Letten, Perricone, Mann and Dobinski disbarred. Letten, Perricone and Mann all had to resign after the Danziger Bridge scandal and they can\u2019t practice at the federal bar anymore. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s complaint seeks to remove them from the Louisiana bar. He\u2019s also seeking to get Dobinski disbarred in Wisconsin and DC.\n\n\u201cIt is in the public\u2019s best interest that none of these people should be able to practice in either state or federal court again,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen O\u2019Keefe was arrested back in 2010, Letten recused himself from the case. But his leaving the prosecution in Mann\u2019s hands was problematic, given her multiple documented connections with U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu. She did, after all, go to high school with Mary Landrieu. Senator Landrieu\u2019s brother Maurice was also involved in the leadership of the office and worked closely with Mann. And O\u2019Keefe\u2019s phone, on which he had filmed the attempted prank video leading to evidence which would have shown a lack of criminal intent at Landrieu\u2019s office that day, was destroyed along with the video.\n\nMichael Madigan, James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s attorney, requested the case be moved to another jurisdiction due to these relationships \u2013 to no avail.\n\n\u201cSenator Landrieu needs to address the questions raised in the complaints we have filed and the prosecutors involved in my case need to answer for their possibly criminal, or at least unethical actions,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cIf the Senator and her friends in powerful positions can do what they did to me, they can do it to any Louisianan.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe is demanding a presidential pardon owing to the prosecutorial misconduct involved in his case. He wants Landrieu to ask for that pardon, since there seems to be the appearance that Landrieu\u2019s cozy relationship led to the aggressive posture the authorities took toward him in the first place.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "Earlier today in Baton Rouge, conservative filmmaker and author James O'Keefe, who spent three years dealing with the aftereffects of getting arrested outside of Mary Landrieu's New Orleans office and charged with \u00a0something akin to domestic terrorism for...", "title": "Turns Out The Letten-NOLA.com Comment Scandal Involves James O\u2019Keefe As Well", "url": "http://thehayride.com/2014/12/turns-out-the-letten-nola-com-comment-scandal-involves-james-okeefe-as-well/", "image": "http://thehayride.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ethical-complaint-150x150.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "James O'Keefe, Jan Mann, Jim Letten, Mary Landrieu, Sal Perricone", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e94\"", "article_summary": "Letten, Perricone and Mann all had to resign after the Danziger Bridge scandal and they can\u2019t practice at the federal bar anymore.\nO\u2019Keefe is seeking to have Letten, Perricone, Mann and Dobinski disbarred.\nMichael Madigan, James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s attorney, requested the case be moved to another jurisdiction due to these relationships \u2013 to no avail.\nBecause court records have been redacted containing necessary information, it\u2019s also possible but not confirmable at this time that Mann, who headed the prosecution of the O\u2019Keefe case, may have done the same.\nWhen O\u2019Keefe was arrested back in 2010, Letten recused himself from the case."}
