Hmmm, have they indeed?\n\nPerhaps a better explanation can be found in analyzing who stands to gain the most and who stands to lose the most from this sudden shift in oil prices.\n\nRelated: The Threat from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Oil Power Play\n\nThe obvious winners would be consumers, where prices at the pump will reflect these changes most clearly. Just as obviously OPEC, the organization that regulates those prices, did not want to slash prices out of the kindness of their hearts. So what is really behind this move?\n\nLet us look first at who the major oil producers are today: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, as well as Russia, Iran and the Islamic State.\n\nOf those, we can make a clear distinction between the first four countries who have solid economies and ample amounts of cash reserves and who can sustain a sharp drop in revenue when oil is sold at a lower price. They are also the same group of countries currently leading the fight against the so-called Islamic State.\n\nThe big losers in this case will clearly be the last three countries on that list: Russia, Iran and the Islamic State.\n\nCoincidentally, these countries are currently engaged in highly controversial conflicts and are facing opposition from the United States and the West.\n\nRelated: Russia Tones Down the Rhetoric as Its Economy Struggles\n\nRussia is involved in Ukraine\u2019s civil war, supporting the separatists in a highly criticized move condemned by the United States and its Western allies. In response, the allies began to impose sanctions as punishment and, given the ruble\u2019s recent downturn, Russia\u2019s credit rating being slashed and desperate gas deals in the Asian markets, it seems that the sanctions have, thus far, been highly successful.\n\nIran is already suffering from sanctions imposed by the West for its pursuit of a nuclear program, with many countries still skeptical of Iran\u2019s intentions, namely whether the technology will be used for military applications or purely civilian ends, as Iran has repeatedly claimed. Additionally, the Islamic Republic is involved in the civil war in Syria, supporting President Bashar Assad, whom the US and its allies want to see vacate the Syrian presidency. Iran also funds and supports the Lebanese Shi\u2019ite militia, Hezbollah. In order to do so, Iran depends heavily on already limited oil exports to maintain its struggling economy, revenues of which have fallen by 30% according to President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAnd finally, the other entity that will be hurt by falling oil prices is the so-called Islamic State, which controls roughly 80 oil wells in Northern Iraq and Syria according to some estimates. The Islamic State was already under-selling the established markets, taking $20 per barrel, as they are hurting for cash in order to fund their military operations on several fronts. On top of this, the current allied airstrike campaign, that has mainly targeted the Islamic State-controlled oil production, is adding yet more pressure to the Islamic State\u2019s economy.\n\nAnswers to questions pertaining to current affairs are often found in history books. Indeed if you want to predict the future, study the past.\n\nRelated: Russia Seen \u201cIn Denial\u201d As Economy Stagnates\n\nVagif Sharifov, an expert in the oil markets and a senior officer at Trend News Agency in Baku, Azerbaijan recalls the last time the oil markets were so low was when Washington wanted to pressure Moscow towards the end of the Cold War just before the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. Washington\u2019s policy was to try and get the Soviets to spend money they didn\u2019t have. To bankrupt Moscow.\n\n\u201cWhat followed was the collapse of communism and the disappearance of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Sharifov.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening today is a repetition of what happened the last time around, the former Cold War warriors fought it out,\u201d said Sharifov.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared at OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nOPEC & Russia\u2019s Vulnerability and America\u2019s Ingenuit\n\nUkraine Facing Harsh Winter Due To Coal Shortages\n\nRussian Credit Rating Slashed, Economic Future Remains Dim", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Why would the oil producers, who have over the years raised the price of oil at every", "title": "Falling Oil Prices Will Hurt Russia, Iran and ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/14/Falling-Oil-Prices-Will-Hurt-Russia-Iran-and-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/14/Falling-Oil-Prices-Will-Hurt-Russia-Iran-and-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_oil_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Why would the oil producers, who have over the years raised the price of oil at every", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And finally, the other entity that will be hurt by falling oil prices is the so-called Islamic State, which controls roughly 80 oil wells in Northern Iraq and Syria according to some estimates.\nPerhaps a better explanation can be found in analyzing who stands to gain the most and who stands to lose the most from this sudden shift in oil prices.\nThe big losers in this case will clearly be the last three countries on that list: Russia, Iran and the Islamic State.\nLet us look first at who the major oil producers are today: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, as well as Russia, Iran and the Islamic State.\nCoincidentally, these countries are currently engaged in highly controversial conflicts and are facing opposition from the United States and the West."}
