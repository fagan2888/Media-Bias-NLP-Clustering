Recently, the Manchester and the Mountains Chamber of Commerce announced it was closing, only to announce its reopening days later.\n\n\n\nManchester chamber officials and local partners are taking a hard look at the organization\u0092s future, and efforts are underway to get the chamber on firm financial footing. Its membership has declined over the past eight years by more than 50 percent.\n\n\n\nOne of those former member businesses is the Bromley View Inn in Bondville. The inn\u0092s owners, Kevin and Kami Golembeski, dropped their membership with the Manchester and the Mountains Chamber of Commerce about five and a half years ago. At the time, Kami Golembeski said there was nothing to hold them to the membership after she got a job that offered health care and didn\u0092t need the chamber\u0092s coverage.\n\n\n\nThey felt their business was an \u0093afterthought\u0094 and that the chamber was more focused on members in Manchester.\n\n\n\n\u0093We never got referrals from the chamber, we never got invitations to any chamber member events, like it was just expected that we knew they were going to happen,\u0094 Golembeski said. Additionally, when they dropped their membership, she added, the chamber did not follow up to ask why.\n\n\n\nIf they were to rejoin in the future, she said, they\u0092ll need assurance they are valued, and better communication and more networking opportunities through the chamber.\n\n\n\nGolembeski said the chamber could play a huge role in helping businesses build lasting relationships with other businesses.\n\n\n\n\u0093I just hope that we can help the chamber, because we\u0092d like to have a chamber,\u0094 she said.\n\n\n\nBerta Maginniss, executive director of the Manchester chamber, declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\n\n\nAnother chamber transition is happening nearby, but for a much different reason.\n\n\n\nThe Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce is starting a new era, with longtime CEO Tom Donahue recently stepping down after 21 years to take the top job at BROC \u0097 Community Action in Southwestern Vermont in Rutland. Mary Cohen was named interim executive director.\n\n\n\nThe Rutland chamber\u0092s board is in the middle of an ongoing discussion about the organization\u0092s future. Bill Ackerman, the chamber\u0092s vice president and incoming president, said the organization has many strengths \u0097 including events like the annual business show \u0097 but a major focus of the current discussion is what else the chamber can do for the business community.\n\n\n\nA big part of that is new events \u0097 ones that have a major impact for a diverse number of businesses. The job fair, which debuted last fall, is an example of this. Ackerman said the job fair addresses an everyday need for businesses at a time when a variety of companies are struggling to find the employees they need.\n\n\n\n\u0093The push for good talent today is enormous,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nDavid Correll, the Rutland chamber\u0092s current president, said the chamber\u0092s website \u0097 which was revamped last year into a mobile device-friendly site \u0097 added great value for members and is also a key resource for the wider community. This enhances the chamber\u0092s role as a marketer of businesses, a role chambers have had for many years.\n\n\n\n\u0093Our goal was (for the site) to be exactly what it has quickly grown into \u0097 the most popular resource for our community,\u0094 Correll said. \u0093Additionally, we designed it as a place for our members to improve their online presence and visibility to potential customers.\u0094\n\n\n\nCorrell added the chamber has spent a lot of time, especially over the last year or two, adding to its partnerships and collaborative efforts with businesses and organizations in the area. He said any chamber needs those connections to accomplish goals and create meaningful programs and services.\n\n\n\nLast week, Donahue said the chamber has led successful efforts to bring conventions to the area, including the National Railway Historical Society. He said big conventions are economic engines in and of themselves, bringing a number of new customers to Rutland and surrounding towns.\n\n\n\nDonahue said the value of these large events doesn\u0092t stop when the planning is over. On the day of the event, he said, the chamber offers a concierge type of service on site, connecting people with services they need.\n\n\n\n\u0093We\u0092re boots on the ground,\u0094 he said.\n\n\n\nSue Hoxie, president of the Addison County Chamber of Commerce, said she and the chamber board also recently discussed ways the chamber could offer more value to its members. Hoxie said it was too early to discuss details of possible changes, but the first changes will likely be in the chamber\u0092s programs.\n\n\n\n\u0093It\u0092ll probably take us 12 to 24 months to implement some of the things we talked about,\u0094 Hoxie said. Those may take the form of \u0093more educational opportunities, more networking opportunities.\u0094\n\n\n\n\u0093You may see us do more advocacy for our member businesses,\u0094 Hoxie added. That advocacy could be at the local or state level, she said, depending on the issue at hand.\n\n\n\nHoxie said all Vermont\u0092s chambers are considering new services and new ways to add value for their members. Previously, she noted, chambers in Vermont lost 20 to 25 percent of their membership when they had to stop offering health care because of Vermont Health Connect and the Affordable Care Act. Since that happened, chambers have had to take a harder look at their services.\n\n\n\nHoxie said a consistent service of chambers is to be providers of information for visitors, customers and businesses \u0097 much like a county clerk would be in other states.\n\n\n\n\u0093That\u0092s a value we offer to the community, not just to our member businesses,\u0094 she said.\n\n\n\nHoxie said the board is also looking at ways it can attract a younger demographic to its membership. She said that discussion may result in a young professionals\u0092 group.\n\n\n\n\u0093We do make it a point to make our board diversified as far as age, gender and industry,\u0094 Hoxie said.\n\n\n\nTom Torti, president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, said chambers, for decades, have been the place to go for information.\n\n\n\n\u0093We really are the place where people come to get information, and then they go and do what it is they need to do,\u0094 Torti said. \u0093You either deliver it or broker it.\u0094\n\n\n\nTorti said the advocacy piece is key at the Champlain chamber. In fact, that chamber has several staff members who specialize in certain issues, such as tourism or workplace issues, and then they advocate on those issues when needed.\n\n\n\nTorti recalled what a local manufacturer once told him: \u0093I pay dues to you to have you do the things that I don\u0092t want to do, I don\u0092t have the time to do, but I know need to be done.\u0094\n\n\n\nAdvocacy at the State House was one of these things, Torti said.\n\n\n\nHe also said his members also like the chambers\u0092 services around economic and business development.\n\n\n\n\u0093We run programs for both leadership and career development from high school through senior executive,\u0094 Torti said. \u0093We\u0092re building the talent pipeline, we\u0092re growing the talent pipeline and we\u0092re helping people grow in their careers.\u0094\n\n\n\nMarji Graf, CEO of the Okemo Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce, is the new president of the Vermont Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives, or VACCE.\n\n\n\nGraf said the value of chambers was seen particularly acutely after Tropical Storm Irene, when chambers \u0093got on the phone with their members and asked, \u0091What do you need?\u0092\u0094\n\n\n\n\u0093Working together, we\u0092re really strong,\u0094 Graf said.\n\n\n\nShe said a big part of the value chambers offer is their role as a \u0093connector\u0094 between businesses. Over the years, Graf and her colleagues have partnered with businesses to build a strong spirit of collaboration and resource-sharing in the region\u0092s business community.\n\n\n\nGraf said a major service the chamber provides is a co-op arrangement that provides advertising in some major publications, such as the Vermont Vacation Guide and Yankee Magazine. This way, the businesses can advertise in these publications for far less money than they would have to pay on their own.\n\n\n\n\u0093I tell my members, \u0091Look at me as your in-house ad agency. Let me do all the negotiating for you,\u0092\u0094 she said. \u0093And I don\u0092t do anything in print that isn\u0092t online as well.\u0094\n\n\n\nGoing forward, Graf said, more services could be jointly offered through the Vermont Department of Tourism & Marketing and the local chambers, such as efforts to offer financial assistance to cover trade show fees for businesses. Using a co-op type of model, Graf said, the state could potentially offer that assistance to the chambers, and chambers could offer it to members.\n\n\n\ngareth.henderson@rutlandherald.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "newspaper, timesargus, montpelier, barre, vermont, election results, news, daily news, sports, obituaries, editorial, events, community, calendar, headlines, classifieds, real estate", "google-site-verification": "Gy2TvJVOPRCmiGNmQzTV43qo8_S1H7alfF6MwpfcLhM", "y_key": "a158acb4f2ab39b3", "Description": "Times Argus Online  -  Vermont news, Vermont election results, Barre News, Montpelier News, Central Vermont News, local news, Vermont government, Vermont sports, Vermont classifieds, Jobs in Vermont", "Subject": "Vermont Election News & Information"}, "article_summary": "She said a big part of the value chambers offer is their role as a \u0093connector\u0094 between businesses.\nThis enhances the chamber\u0092s role as a marketer of businesses, a role chambers have had for many years.\nAt the same time, chambers have had a renewed focus on strengthening other programs \u0097 and trying new ones \u0097 which add value for local businesses.\nUsing a co-op type of model, Graf said, the state could potentially offer that assistance to the chambers, and chambers could offer it to members.\nGolembeski said the chamber could play a huge role in helping businesses build lasting relationships with other businesses."}
