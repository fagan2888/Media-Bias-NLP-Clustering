Both were pragmatic as governors, mild-mannered as candidates and more comfortable balancing budgets at their desks than clinking glasses at a political dinner.\n\nThe two Republican leaders\u2019 personal rapport is cordial. But they are hardly chummy \u2014 and at moments their relationship has been strained, with each man\u2019s intertwined political network carrying some grievances with the other\u2019s.\n\nAs Bush, 61, and Romney, 67, explore presidential campaigns in 2016, they are like boxers warming up for what could become a brutal bout, sizing each other up and mulling whether or when to step into the ring.\n\nTheir early maneuvering reveals a level of competitiveness and snippiness that stems from a long history following similar career paths in business and politics prescribed by their dynastic families.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the first shots of the war between clan Romney and clan Bush,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who has worked for both men. \u201cBoth bring to the battle incredibly powerful fan clubs as well as wounds they have to heal. How ugly could it get? You\u2019re only competing to lead the free world.\u201d\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\n\u2022 Four Issues that Could Derail Bush\u2019s 2016 Hopes\n\n\n\n\u2022 How About Clinton vs. Romney in 2016?\n\n\n\n\u2022 10 Things You Should Know About Jeb Bush\n\nBush has been trying to consolidate support among establishment donors, leaders and operatives since announcing in December that he would begin laying the groundwork for a likely campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Bush connection is a centrifugal force, and it\u2019s drawing back a whole generation of public servants and politicos,\u201d said former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, one of Romney\u2019s 2012 opponents.\n\nBut on Friday, Romney sought to slam the brakes on Bush, telling about 30 powerful donors that he, too, was seriously considering a 2016 bid. \u201cI want to be president,\u201d he said, adding that his wife, Ann, was supportive.\n\nRomney has begun methodically calling donors, staff members and endorsers from his two prior campaigns to measure how deep his reservoir of support would be if he runs for a third time, his advisers said. He also has scheduled a series of public speeches, including a Jan. 28 address at Mississippi State University.\n\nThe entry of both Bush and Romney is far from certain, and Romney\u2019s dalliance is preliminary. But the prospect of two center-right heavyweights entering a 2016 field likely to be fluid, crowded and diverse forces other contenders and the party\u2019s stable of donors to adjust their thinking.\n\n\u201cAwkward,\u201d was the reaction from several past Romney supporters when they learned he was weighing a 2016 campaign. If both he and Bush run, they would occupy similar space as favorites of the party brass and business community.\n\n\u201cThe abundance of great candidates developing on the Republican side is making life very tough for me because I\u2019m going to have to choose amongst friends,\u201d said former New Hampshire governor John H. Sununu, who was White House chief of staff under Bush\u2019s father but a top campaign surrogate for Romney.\n\nBut, Sununu added, \u201cit\u2019s applesauce right now. Let\u2019s not try to pick up applesauce and move it to the other side of the plate.\u201d\n\nMore personal race\n\nThe two candidates would invite comparisons to each other, which could be tense for Bush, who was sharply critical of Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign \u2014 in particular, his lack of outreach to minorities \u2014 and has pledged to run a more inclusive and transparent campaign.\n\n\u201cA Romney-Bush race could end up being nastier than Jeb against someone like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul,\u201d Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, said of the Texas and Kentucky senators. \u201cA Cruz-Bush race is pretty straightforward and ideological. A Romney-Bush race would be more personal \u2014 about whose turn it is and who is owed it.\u201d\n\nAssociates of both men insist there is no animosity between them and that each will make his decision about a 2016 run irrespective of the other.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bush respects Governor Romney,\u201d said Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, who worked on Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cHis process moving forward won\u2019t be impacted by Governor Romney\u2019s decision to explore a run \u2014 and I would assume it is the same on the reverse side.\u201d\n\nBeth Myers, a longtime adviser to Romney, said he and Bush have been friends since 2002, when Romney was elected to his first term as Massachusetts governor and Bush to his second as Florida governor.\n\n\u201cMitt has great respect for Jeb\u2019s ability and integrity, and they\u2019ve worked together many times over the years to promote conservative principles,\u201d Myers said. \u201cAt the end of the day, whatever decision Mitt makes about running for president, I\u2019m 100 percent certain he will still value and maintain his friendship with Jeb.\u201d\n\nMitt and Ann Romney also have nurtured a friendship with Bush\u2019s parents, former president George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara. In 2007, when Romney gave a personal speech on his Mormon faith, which had become a touchy issue with evangelical Christian voters, he did so at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Tex., where he was warmly introduced by the 41st president.\n\nWorking on Romney\u2019s 2008 primary campaign were several Jeb Bush lieutenants: Sally Bradshaw, Bush\u2019s longtime political adviser; Ann Herberger, a Miami-based fundraiser; and Al Cardenas, a fixture in Florida Republican politics. All three stayed out of Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, although Cardenas, then the chairman of the American Conservative Union, endorsed him as the primaries were ending.\n\nThe Bush-Romney family dynamic has been one of intrigue and ambition, dating at least to the 1950s, when Romney\u2019s father, George Romney, then president of American Motors, was striving to make political connections as he eyed a run for office.\n\nIn 1957, Romney wrote a letter to Prescott Bush, Jeb\u2019s grandfather then serving in the Senate from Connecticut, urging him to test-drive a Rambler or a Metropolitan. Both were popular AMC models, and Romney told Bush the latter got 40 miles to the gallon, according to car-industry historian Patrick R. Foster\u2019s book \u201cThe Metropolitan Story.\u201d But, Foster writes, it remains unknown whether the efforts resulted in a sale \u2014 or even if Romney\u2019s solicitation drew any notice in Bush\u2019s office.\n\nEyeing one another\n\nIn recent weeks, Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush have been quietly trying to ascertain the other\u2019s motives and playbook. Bush has asked Romney\u2019s former donors about what Romney is up to, while Romney met shortly before Christmas with Bush strategist Mike Murphy and inquired about Bush\u2019s preparations, according to political consultants who know Romney and Bush.\n\nRomney has said little publicly about Bush, but in exchanges with intimates, he has focused on Bush\u2019s past advisory work for Lehman Brothers and Barclays, two major financial institutions. He argued that it makes Bush vulnerable to the same kind of Democratic attacks that he faced in 2012 over his career as Bain Capital co-founder and chief executive. He also has voiced doubts about Bush\u2019s political skills and ability to beat likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nAna Navarro, a GOP operative and Bush confidant, said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get worked up over comments Romney has allegedly made to donors behind closed doors \u2014 yet. We all know he sometimes misspeaks.\u201d\n\nBush has vowed to defend his business record more vigorously than Romney did. Comparing their careers is like \u201ccomparing an apple to a peanut,\u201d Bush said in a December interview with a Miami television station.\n\nThose comments irritated Romney\u2019s family and loyalists, who took them as a slight against his career managing a complicated enterprise on a scale far larger than Bush\u2019s business dealings, according to Romney associates.\n\nBush also is considering releasing a decade or more of his tax returns after Romney faced heat for only reluctantly releasing two years of his returns. And Bush has advocated a more welcoming message on immigration reform than Romney\u2019s hard-right position, which he criticized in 2012.\n\n\u201cHe got sucked into other people\u2019s agendas, and I think it hurt him a little bit,\u201d Bush said in the TV interview. He added, \u201cWinning with purpose, winning with meaning, winning with your integrity is what I\u2019m trying to talk about.\u201d\n\nBefore announcing his 2012 campaign, Romney, sensing that immigration policy would be a contentious issue in the primaries, sought Bush\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cI went to see Jeb, I flew down to see him, and said: \u2018I\u2019d like to take immigration off the issue list for the primaries. And wouldn\u2019t it be great if Republicans could come up with an immigration plan that all of the contenders could say, yeah, I agree. And then we could sweep that aside,\u2019 \u201d Romney told The Washington Post\u2019s Dan Balz in an interview for his book \u201cCollision 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were unable to get there,\u201d Romney continued. \u201cI mean, there just wasn\u2019t enough consensus among Republicans generally.\u201d\n\nRival strategists\n\nAs Bush and Romney explore a run, whispering into their ears are two political professionals with big egos, eccentric personalities and a long-simmering rivalry: Romney\u2019s Stuart Stevens and Bush\u2019s Murphy. They are fierce competitors with roots in each other\u2019s turf. Stevens worked on George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns, while Murphy worked on Romney\u2019s 2002 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nMembers of Bush\u2019s team have not forgotten Stevens\u2019s role in Bush\u2019s 1994 gubernatorial race, which became Bush\u2019s lowest point politically. Stevens advised one of Bush\u2019s primary opponents, Jim Smith, who waged a bruising TV ad assault against Bush over his business experience and character.\n\n\u201cThis begins the destruction of Jeb Bush,\u201d Stevens told the New York Times as the ads began. Bush won the primary, but he didn\u2019t win the governorship until four years later.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Murphy mocked Stevens on Twitter as Romney struggled in the primaries against relatively weak opponents. More recently, Romney backers have been murmuring fresh questions about Murphy\u2019s work for the political action committee of former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), who is anathema to the conservative base.\n\nSome Romney allies are bitter that Bush was slow to endorse Romney in 2012. In the run-up to the Florida primary, with Romney fighting to beat back a surge from Newt Gingrich, Bush sat on the sidelines when Romney\u2019s team thought he could have made a difference. Romney called, e-mailed and met privately with Bush to try to win him over, but he could not be convinced.\n\n\u201cI voted absentee,\u201d Bush said on CNN. \u201cAnd thank God it\u2019s a secret ballot.\u201d\n\nRomney won Florida nevertheless, and by the time Bush announced his endorsement, on March 21, the day after Romney\u2019s decisive victory in the Illinois primary, the nomination was all but officially his.\n\nBush called Romney on his cellphone, with no tip-off from an emissary, and their talk was brief, according to aides. Back at headquarters, advisers were pleased by the news, but grumbling still, wondering why it had taken so long.\n\nTom Hamburger contributed to this report.\n\nRead More at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney have much in common.", "title": "Bush and Romney Get Ready to Step into the Ring", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/11/Bush-and-Romney-Get-Ready-Step-Ring", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01122015_Mitt_Romney_Jeb_Bush_Split-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/11/Bush-and-Romney-Get-Ready-Step-Ring", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01122015_Mitt_Romney_Jeb_Bush_Split-1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney have much in common.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7aa\"", "article_summary": "If both he and Bush run, they would occupy similar space as favorites of the party brass and business community.\nBush has asked Romney\u2019s former donors about what Romney is up to, while Romney met shortly before Christmas with Bush strategist Mike Murphy and inquired about Bush\u2019s preparations, according to political consultants who know Romney and Bush.\n\u201cGovernor Bush respects Governor Romney,\u201d said Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, who worked on Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign.\nEyeing one anotherIn recent weeks, Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush have been quietly trying to ascertain the other\u2019s motives and playbook.\n\u201cThis begins the destruction of Jeb Bush,\u201d Stevens told the New York Times as the ads began."}
