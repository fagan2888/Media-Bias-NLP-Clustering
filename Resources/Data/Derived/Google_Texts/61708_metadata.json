The new guidance does not purport to change DOL policy but rather \u201cprovides additional guidance regarding the application of the standards for determining who is an employee\u201d under the FLSA, which \u201cmay be helpful to the regulated community in classifying workers and ultimately in curtailing misclassification.\u201d\n\nAs detailed below, the AI is an effort to tilt the FLSA\u2019s economic realities test further in favor of finding employee status. Indeed, the AI emphasizes how \u201cbroad\u201d the definition of employee is under the FLSA, concluding that \u201cmost workers are employees under the FLSA\u2019s broad definitions.\u201d Its interpretation of the economic realities test clearly aims to make this observation a reality. In particular, the AI appears to emphasize the importance of the \u201cintegral to the business\u201d prong of the test, suggesting that work that is integral to the putative employer\u2019s business can only be performed by employees. It also identifies as correct employee-friendly interpretations of the factors in the test, while criticizing those interpretations that make independent contractor findings less onerous.\n\nWeight Attributed to Administrative Interpretations\n\nDOL\u2019s practice of issuing \u201cadministrative interpretations\u201d began in March 2010, with the issuance of Administrator\u2019s Interpretation No. 2010-1 (\u201cAI 2010-1\u201d). In that document, DOL concluded that employees who perform the \u201ctypical\u201d duties of a mortgage loan officer employee do not satisfy the duties requirements of the FLSA\u2019s administrative exemption. AI 2010-1 was significant not only because it withdrew a 2006 opinion letter that reached the opposite conclusion, but also because it established a new procedure for DOL to provide broad interpretive guidance. Prior to 2010, DOL issued guidance in the form of rules and opinion letters limited to the specific facts presented to it in each request.\n\nDOL recently survived a challenge to its use of Administrator\u2019s Interpretations in Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assoc., No. 13-1041 (U.S. 2015). In Perez the United States Supreme Court addressed whether AI 2010-1 was procedurally invalid because it was issued without using the notice-and-comment process set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Court held that agencies are only required to follow notice-and-comment procedures for legislative rules (rules that amend or otherwise modify statutes and/or rules) and not interpretive rules (rules that constitute an agency\u2019s construction and/or interpretation of a statute and/or rule). Where agencies issue interpretive rules, notice-and-comment rulemaking is not required, but those rules do not carry the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d In addition, the Court stated that the level of deference afforded to an agency\u2019s interpretive rule depends on that agency\u2019s consistent, or inconsistent, historical interpretation of the same regulation.\n\nThe AI on independent contractor classification likely constitutes an interpretative rule, meaning that the guidelines are not binding on the regulated community.\n\nEmployment Status Under The FLSA\n\nThe AI goes to great lengths to emphasize that the term \u201cemployee\u201d is broadly defined under the FLSA and therefore genuine independent contractor status should be the exception, not the rule. To emphasize this point, the AI utilizes some iteration of the term \u201cbroad\u201d at least 18 times throughout its 15 pages in describing the scope of the definition of the FLSA\u2019s \u201cemployee.\u201d\n\nThe AI\u2019s main goal is to provide DOL\u2019s view on how courts should interpret the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test utilized to determine whether a worker is an employee for purposes of the FLSA. The test seeks to determine the degree of economic dependence of the worker on the putative employer. If the worker is economically dependent on the putative employer, the worker under the test should be found to be an employee. The test includes six factors aimed at helping courts make this determination. The six factors typically associated with this test are:\n\nthe nature and degree of the alleged employer\u2019s control as to the manner in which the work is to be performed; the alleged employee\u2019s opportunity for profit or loss depending upon his managerial skill; the alleged employee\u2019s investment in equipment or materials required for his task, or his employment of workers; whether the service rendered requires a special skill; the degree of permanency and duration of the working relationship; and the extent to which the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer\u2019s business.\n\nSec\u2019y of Labor v. Lauritzen, 835 F.2d 1529, 1534-35 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\nThe AI states that the application of the economic realities test factors should be guided by the FLSA\u2019s definition of the term \u201cemploy\u201d which means to \u201csuffer or permit to work,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(g). Administrator Weil in the AI contends that this standard was specifically designed to ensure as broad of a scope of statutory coverage as possible.\n\nThe main feature of the AI is its examination of each factor in the economic realities test, identifying court decisions regarding each factor with which DOL agrees, as well as those it believes misapplied the analysis. In so doing, the AI essentially gives its stamp of approval to the analyses most likely to result in a finding of employment status, aiming to alter many common approaches to the test to tip the scales further in favor of employee status.\n\nFor example, the AI appears to emphasize the importance of the \u201cintegral to the business\u201d prong of the test \u2013 even though that element does not appear in some formulations of the economic realities test. The AI states that this factor \u201cshould always be analyzed in misclassification cases,\u201d contending that \u201c[i]f the work performed by a worker is integral to the employer\u2019s business, it is more likely that the worker is economically dependent on the employer.\u201d By analyzing this factor first, and noting that courts have found it to be \u201ccompelling\u201d in finding employee status, the AI signals that companies that rely on independent contractors to perform work that is part of their business are in DOL\u2019s cross-hairs.\n\nAt the same time, the AI deemphasizes the \u201ccontrol\u201d element of the analysis. As most companies know, control exerted by the putative employer over the worker is often considered the most critical factor in determining if an employer/employee relationship exists. Courts usually ask, among other things, whether the putative employer is the one to set the worker\u2019s hours, ensure quality control, or set the rate of pay. If so, an employer/employee relationship is usually considered to exist. Administrator Weil, however, takes issue with placing too much emphasis on control in the economic realities test, stating that \u201cthe nature and degree of the employer\u2019s control must be examined as part of determining the ultimate question whether the worker is economically dependent on the employer.\u201d To emphasize his point, even though the control factor is typically listed first in recitations of the economic realities test, the AI addresses it last.\n\nEven so, the AI does provide DOL\u2019s view on how courts should analyze the control prong of the test. Most significantly, the AI addresses the argument made by employers in heavily regulated industries that certain controls exercised over workers due to statutory regulatory requirements should not be considered to be \u201ccontrol\u201d exerted over workers for purposes of the misclassification analysis. The AI rejects this argument, stating essentially that control is control, whether it is the result of government regulations or not.\n\nSimilarly, the AI alters the \u201cworker\u2019s investment\u201d prong of the analysis. Many courts examine whether the worker has invested significant sums into his or her business. The AI, however, posits that the worker\u2019s investment \u201cmust be significant in nature and magnitude relative to the employer\u2019s investment in its overall business to indicate that the worker is an independent businessperson.\u201d This comparative analysis is not evident from the factor as typically articulated, which examines \u201cthe alleged employee\u2019s investment in equipment or materials required for his task, or his employment of workers.\u201d Even so, the AI states that \u201c[a]n analysis of the workers\u2019 investment, even if that investment is substantial, without comparing it to the employer\u2019s investment is not faithful to the ultimate determination of whether the worker is truly an independent business.\u201d In articulating this view, the AI specifically takes issue with decisions from the Fourth and Eleventh Circuits.\n\nImpact\n\nCompanies that utilize independent contractors should re-examine their independent contractor relationships in light of the AI to assess whether they are likely to withstand scrutiny under the DOL\u2019s new interpretation of the economic realities test.\n\nOf course, these guidelines only address independent contractor classification under the FLSA\u2019s test. Companies that utilize independent contractors need to be aware that different tests applicable under other statutes and regulations, both state and federal, remain in effect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The AI provides the Department of Labor\u2019s guidance for determining whether a worker is properly classified as an independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "As forecast in our June 12, 2015 blog post&amp;nbsp;David Weil, Administrator of the Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has released Administrator&amp;rsquo;s Interpretation (AI) No. 201", "title": "US Department of Labor Issues Administrator\u2019s Interpretation Aimed At Limiting Independent Contractor Classification", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-department-labor-issues-administrator-s-interpretation-aimed-limiting-independent", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/Department%20of%20Labor_Homepage_0.jpg?itok=ON45brjk", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "US Department of Labor, DOL, independent contractor, employee classification, AI, administrator interpretation, FLSA, fair labor standards act, FMLA,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, US Department of Labor, DOL, independent contractor, employee classification, AI, administrator interpretation, FLSA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd029\"", "article_summary": "The Court held that agencies are only required to follow notice-and-comment procedures for legislative rules (rules that amend or otherwise modify statutes and/or rules) and not interpretive rules (rules that constitute an agency\u2019s construction and/or interpretation of a statute and/or rule).\nThe AI on independent contractor classification likely constitutes an interpretative rule, meaning that the guidelines are not binding on the regulated community.\nImpactCompanies that utilize independent contractors should re-examine their independent contractor relationships in light of the AI to assess whether they are likely to withstand scrutiny under the DOL\u2019s new interpretation of the economic realities test.\nWeight Attributed to Administrative InterpretationsDOL\u2019s practice of issuing \u201cadministrative interpretations\u201d began in March 2010, with the issuance of Administrator\u2019s Interpretation No.\nIt also identifies as correct employee-friendly interpretations of the factors in the test, while criticizing those interpretations that make independent contractor findings less onerous."}
