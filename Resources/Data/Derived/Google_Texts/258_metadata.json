The DASH diet reflects a more balanced diet and as a result may be easier and more realistic to follow long term.\"\n\nUsually, doctors recommend a diet low in oxalate to patients at risk for developing kidney stones, given that most kidney stones result from oxalate binding to calcium while the kidneys produce urine. Such a diet restricts foods such as beets, navy beans, bulgar, kale, almonds, sweet potatoes, rice bran, rhubarb, and spinach.\n\nIn the study, Willis and her colleagues followed 41 people who restricted themselves to either the DASH or low-oxalate diets during an eight-week period. Those on the DASH diet cut their risk of developing kidney stones by 35 percent, while the others cut their risk by 14 percent. Moreover, the researchers suggested that combining the two dietary types may provide the most effective means of preventing kidney stones.\n\nIn fact, the combination increases the likelihood that oxalate and calcium bind in the stomach and intestines before moving to the kidney, meaning a lowered chance of kidney stones forming, according to Nazanin Noori, who led the study. \"Most people do not eat single, isolated nutrients, such as oxalate, but rather meals consisting of a variety of foods,\" he said. \"So a practical diet plan for kidney stone prevention should be based on the cumulative effects of foods and the impact overall dietary patterns have on risk for stone formation rather than single nutrients.\"\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation advises people to drink plenty of fluids, at least 68 ounces daily, to prevent kidney stones from forming -- in addition to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, while limiting high-fat dairy, salt, and animal protein.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "preventing kidney stones, kidney stones, kidney stones and diet, kidney stones prevention", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In good news for those who fear the kidney stone, researchers say they've found an optimum diet for preventing trouble.", "title": "Kidney Stones Thwarted By Blood Pressure Diet, Vegetables", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kidney-stones-thwarted-blood-pressure-diet-vegetables-270401", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/01/shutterstock137318150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In good news for those who fear the kidney stone, researchers say they've found an optimum diet for preventing trouble.", "title": "Kidney Stones Thwarted By Blood Pressure Diet, Vegetables", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kidney-stones-thwarted-blood-pressure-diet-vegetables-270401", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/01/shutterstock137318150.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/01/shutterstock137318150.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-03-01T20:50:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-03T11:51:26-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In good news for those who fear the kidney stone, researchers say they've found an optimum diet for preventing trouble."}, "article_summary": "A diet originally intended to lower blood pressure may work just as well for preventing kidney stones, researchers from the National Kidney Foundation say.\nMoreover, the researchers suggested that combining the two dietary types may provide the most effective means of preventing kidney stones.\nThe DASH diet reflects a more balanced diet and as a result may be easier and more realistic to follow long term.\"\nUsually, doctors recommend a diet low in oxalate to patients at risk for developing kidney stones, given that most kidney stones result from oxalate binding to calcium while the kidneys produce urine.\nThose on the DASH diet cut their risk of developing kidney stones by 35 percent, while the others cut their risk by 14 percent."}
