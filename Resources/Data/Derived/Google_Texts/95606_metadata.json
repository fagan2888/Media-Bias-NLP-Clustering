This time, it\u2019s for people who owe taxes on the subsidy they received on the exchanges for 2014. From Kaiser Health News:\n\nConsumers who received too much in federal tax credits when buying insurance on the health law\u2019s marketplaces last year got a reprieve of sorts from the Internal Revenue Service this week. Although they still have to repay some or all of the excess subsidies, the IRS won\u2019t ding them with a late payment penalty if they don\u2019t repay it by the April 15 tax deadline\u2026.The IRS will allow people to repay what they owe on an installment basis. But be forewarned: Interest will continue to accrue until the balance is paid off.\n\nThe Galen Institute has counted 47 changes (soon to be 48) that have been made to ObamaCare since the law took effect. Here are some of the more notorious ones:\n\n-Employer-mandate delay: By an administrative action that\u2019s contrary to statutory language in the ACA, the reporting requirements for employers were delayed by one year. (July 2, 2013)\n\n-Congressional opt-out: The administration decided to offer employer contributions to members of Congress and their staffs when they purchase insurance on the exchanges created by the ACA, a subsidy the law doesn\u2019t provide. (September 30, 2013)\n\n-Self-attestation: Because of the difficulty of verifying income after the employer-reporting requirement was delayed, the administration decided it would allow \u201cself-attestation\u201d of income by applicants for health insurance in the exchanges. This was later partially retracted after congressional and public outcry over the likelihood of fraud. (July 15, 2013)\n\nA few thoughts in no particular order: In the Kaiser article, Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who\u2019s an expert on the health law (and a foremost apologist), said, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make this work.\u201d Yeah\u2026how\u2019s that going so far?\n\nThe article also states that, \u201cThis penalty reprieve only applies to the 2014 tax year.\u201d For now. But the smart money is on the reprieve becoming an annual feature.\n\nFinally, I suggest we apply the spirit of ObamaCare to all income taxes. We shouldn\u2019t have to send in documents to verify our income. \u201cSelf-attestation\u201d of our income should be sufficient. And if we get it wrong and eventually owe back taxes, we shouldn\u2019t get dinged with a late penalty. Sound like a good idea?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/Taxbreak2.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1423143162986", "description": "The Administration is granting more special privileges under the banner of ObamaCare.
