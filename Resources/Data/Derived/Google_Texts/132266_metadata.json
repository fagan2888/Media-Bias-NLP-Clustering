GHS in its latest growth move has organized more than 1,800 health care providers in a physician-led network focused on \u201cimproving and standardizing care\u201d and containing escalating costs.\n\nDr. Angelo Sinopoli, GHS chief medical officer and president of the new MyHealth First Network, said hospitals are among providers that have been consulted about the network and are welcome to join.\n\n\u201cWe think the concept of My Health First Network has merit, but we have decided not to participate until we learn a little more about the structure of the network and the role each hospital system would need to play in making the effort successful,\u201d Bill Manson, AnMed\u2019s president and COO, said in an email statement.\n\nSinopoli\n\nSinopoli said the network includes providers in Greenville, Spartanburg, Anderson, Greenwood, Laurens, Oconee, Pickens, Abbeville and Newberry counties. He said they will be linked electronically to enhance care in a setup that should begin operating next year.\n\nGHS earlier this year took over the Oconee Medical Center and its affiliated operations, one year after taking over the Laurens County Health Care System. The GHS board had voted to spend $40 million developing ambulatory care centers in Anderson and Spartanburg counties. The network announcement follows a statement made by GHS President and CEO Mike Riordan that, to succeed, health systems need to be developing \u201cmulticommunity integrated delivery systems that focus on keeping people healthier over their entire lives. The old episodic way of treating patients simply isn\u2019t working anymore and too often results in fragmented or insufficient care.\u201d\n\n\u2018Our Market\u2019\n\nFollowing GHS board approval of the ambulatory care expansion, AnMed officials suggested that state oversight of major health care projects through the certificate of need process would help safeguard against \u201can entity from arriving from outside of a community with the intent of cherry-picking only certain patients.\u201d\n\nGHS Vice President of Strategic Services Malcolm Isley said cherry-picking paying patients was not the intent, but he described the Upstate as being \u201cour market.\u201d\n\nSpartanburg Regional Healthcare System officials declined to comment.\n\nAnMed\u2019s Hanson, whose promotion to CEO became effective Thursday, said the Anderson-based system \u201cwill continue to communicate with GHS and others in the region that are a part of the network, and we will continue to consider our participation. Ultimately, we want to be certain we make the best decision on behalf of those we care for in this community.\u201d\n\nPart of something bigger\n\nSinopoli said there are about 250 such networks in the U.S. and GHS\u2019 partnership is the first in the state. He said the network doesn\u2019t require state licensing or a certificate of need and could expand, possibly into other states. He said the S.C. Medical Association has given its blessing.\n\nSinopoli said providers are learning that \u201cto survive in the future you are going to have to be part of something bigger.\u201d\n\nThe network is led by a 12-member board of managers and numerous committees \u201cwhose focus is on improving and standardizing care,\u201d a GHS statement said.\n\nSinopoli said health care is changing from a fee-for-service model to one that focuses on health outcomes per dollars spent. He said the new network is not related to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the U.S. health care system is unsustainable, but what is most important is how we fix it and that we work together across county and state lines to ensure the people in our communities have access to the best care possible,\u201d Sinopoli said in a statement.\n\nThe statement said network providers will coordinate care to identify and use evidence-based best practices to treat patients with chronic conditions.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cIt also involves providers partnering with their patients in the delivery of this care ... Network providers will work with their patients to develop treatment plans that are customized to the individual and address barriers and gaps in care, as well as cultural differences and psychosocial issues that prevent compliance.\u201d\n\nSinopoli said studies have shown that 5% of the U.S. population accounts for about half of total health care spending, and 20% accounts for 80% of total spending. He said the network\u2019s increased coordination of care activities and new outreach will help control wasteful spending, such as emergency room care for nonemergency conditions. Sinopoli said 911 medical calls require emergency services responses and some calls will instead be referred to a nurse call center.\n\nA Greenville nonprofit, Care Coordination Institute, will organize a system that allows providers to monitor patients\u2019 health outcomes and \u201creceive information, education and training to improve those outcomes,\u201d the GHS statement said. The network\u2019s information technology infrastructure will allow for greater communication among providers, the statement said.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "SinopoliSinopoli said the network includes providers in Greenville, Spartanburg, Anderson, Greenwood, Laurens, Oconee, Pickens, Abbeville and Newberry counties.\nSinopoli said health care is changing from a fee-for-service model to one that focuses on health outcomes per dollars spent.\nThe GHS board had voted to spend $40 million developing ambulatory care centers in Anderson and Spartanburg counties.\nGHS earlier this year took over the Oconee Medical Center and its affiliated operations, one year after taking over the Laurens County Health Care System.\nBy Bill Pooveybpoovey@scbiznews.comPublished Jan. 2, 2015Administrators at AnMed Health in Anderson have not ruled out joining the Greenville Health System\u2019s new health care partnership that extends into nine counties, but they\u2019re not in any hurry."}
