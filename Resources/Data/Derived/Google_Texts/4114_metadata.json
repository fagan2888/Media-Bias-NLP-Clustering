Then Howard Dean, former Democratic National Committee chair, said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, \u201cThe issue is, how well educated is this guy? That\u2019s a problem \u2026 I\u2019m absolutely serious. I worry about people being president of the United States not knowing much about the world and not knowing much about science.\u201d\n\nRelated: Scott Walker Makes Top Tier of White House Wannabes\n\nWalker \u2013 who three times in the past four years has been elected to Wisconsin\u2019s highest office \u2013 is dismissing all of this as partisan politics. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s the kind of elitist, government-knows-best, top-down approach from Washington we\u2019ve heard for years,\u201d he told Fox News on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an Ivy-trained lawyer in the White House for six years who\u2019s pretty good at reading off the teleprompter, but has done a pretty lousy job leading this country.\" (President Obama received his undergraduate degree in political science from Columbia University in New York in 1983 and earned his law degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1991.)\n\nWalker also said on Fox, \u201cI\u2019d rather have a fighter who\u2019s actually proven he could take on the big government special interests and win.\u201d\n\nAs a kid, Scott Walker worked part-time as a dishwasher and spent some time flipping burgers at a local McDonald\u2019s during his high school years. He entered Marquette University in the fall of 1986 and was active in student politics. In February 1990, shortly before he left as a senior, he took a job with a local chapter of the non-profit American Red Cross.\n\nHe said last night that people on the left have worked themselves into a \u201ctither\u201d about his college years and that they assume there must be more to the story than what actually happened \u2013 that he left to go to work. \u201cI think people [instead] want to judge, \u2018What have you done lately?\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: How Scott Walker Would Reform the GOP\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Walker did not leave college under an academic shadow, as some have insinuated. In a statement released a year and a half ago on this issue and published by Politifact.com, Marquette University said, \u201cGov. Scott Walker was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew from Marquette.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s own biography says, \u201cIn 1986, Scott moved to Milwaukee to attend Marquette University. While still in college, he worked for IBM before leaving school in his senior year to work full-time in marketing and development for the American Red Cross.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have people who helped found Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, plenty of other successful businesses and enterprises across this country who did the exact same sort of thing I did,\u201d Walker said on Fox, referring to Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg respectively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two sons in college,\u201d Walker added. \u201cI hope they finish, I expect that. My wife [Tonette Walker] and I are helping to fund their pathway, along with the hard work they\u2019ve put in. So we value college for those who want to pursue a career, but in the end you don\u2019t have to have that to be successful like many Americans have over the years.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, one of the leading candidates for the GOP presidentia", "title": "No Diploma?
