The Obama administration responded by reiterating its commitment to the mandate and its requirements.\n\nUSA Today said the administration is \u201cnow stuck arguing that it is justified in compelling nuns who care for the elderly poor to assist in offering health insurance that they say conflicts with their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe publication said the administration wrote its religious exemption to the rule \u201cso narrowly\u201d that it failed to exempt Catholic and other religious hospitals, colleges and charities. The Little Sisters of the Poor fail to qualify because they are not affiliated with a particular house of worship.\n\nThe Obama administration \u201ccould find some less divisive way to provide the coverage,\u201d USA Today said. \u201cInstead, the administration is battling Catholic bishops and nuns, Southern Baptists, Christ-centered colleges and assorted religious non-profits that filed challenges across the country.\u201d\n\nRather than extending a religious exemption to the Little Sisters, the federal government has instead offered an \u201caccommodation\u201d under which the sisters can sign a document authorizing an outside group to provide the coverage they find morally objectionable.\n\nHowever, the USA Today editors dismissed this accommodation as \u201cmore of a fig leaf than a fix.\u201d They observed that the Little Sisters of the Poor and others say that the requirement \u201cmakes them complicit in an act that violates a tenet of their faith.\u201d\n\nThe punishment for noncompliance with the mandate is \u201cruinous fines,\u201d with the Little Sisters facing $4.5 million in annual fines for just two of their 30 homes.\n\nUSA Today noted that most of the legal cases against the mandate have been successful so far. More than 300 plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against the mandate, and legal injunctions have been granted in most cases, which are largely still working through the court system.\n\n\u201cThe administration should take the hint,\u201d the editorial said, calling on the federal government to adopt the \u201cmost expansive\u201d religious exemption.\n\nA \u201cmore meaningful\u201d compromise would give religious freedom \u201cthe wide berth it deserves,\u201d the publication stated.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic News Agency", "description": "The editors of USA Today have urged the Obama administration to stop trying to require the Little Sisters of the Poor to abide by the federal contraception mandate in violation of their religious beliefs.", "title": "USA Today to Obama admin: leave Little Sisters alone", "url": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/usa-today-to-obama-administration-leave-little-sisters-alone/", "image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Little_Sisters_of_the_Poor_Courtesy_of_the_Becket_Fund_for_Religious_Liberty_CNA_US_Catholic_News_9_25_13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The editors of USA Today have urged the Obama administration to stop trying to require the Little Sisters of the Poor to abide by the federal contraception mandate in violation of their religious beliefs.", "title": "USA Today to Obama admin: leave Little Sisters alone", "image": {"src": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Little_Sisters_of_the_Poor_Courtesy_of_the_Becket_Fund_for_Religious_Liberty_CNA_US_Catholic_News_9_25_13.jpg"}, "creator": "@cnalive", "site": "@cnalive", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 32422915}, "fb": {"app_id": 1502824986641800}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3db0\"", "article_summary": "In a Jan. 12 editorial entitled \u201cObamacare overreach tramples Little Sisters,\u201d the publication's editors argued that the administration's move is \u201ca political loser,\u201d \u201cconstitutionally suspect\u201d and \u201cultimately unproductive.\u201dThe Little Sisters of the Poor have worked for 175 years to care for the low-income elderly and dying in communities throughout the U.S.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor fail to qualify because they are not affiliated with a particular house of worship.\n.- The editors of USA Today have urged the Obama administration to stop trying to require the Little Sisters of the Poor to abide by the federal contraception mandate in violation of their religious beliefs.\nThe Obama administration \u201ccould find some less divisive way to provide the coverage,\u201d USA Today said.\nUSA Today noted that most of the legal cases against the mandate have been successful so far."}
