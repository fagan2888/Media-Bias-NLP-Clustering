Tom Moakler, chief executive officer at Houlton Regional Hospital, said the move comes at a period of change in health care.\n\n\u201cThe advent of the Affordable Care Act, changes in reimbursement and a number of other complex issues are reshaping the landscape for hospitals and other health care providers across the nation,\u201d Moakler said in a news release announcing the collaborative. \u201cOur hospitals here in Maine are coping with these changes while facing unique challenges in providing health care to a rapidly aging and low-income population, particularly in rural parts of the state. By working together in a collaborative fashion we can all benefit from each other\u2019s experience, standardize best practices and protect quality, accessible care.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report by the American Hospital Association, 72 million Americans, or 22 percent of the nation\u2019s population, live in rural areas and depend on their local hospital as an important and often the only source of care. Rural hospitals often are also their communities\u2019 largest employers.\n\nMary Prybylo, CEO at St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor, said the health collaborative will look for ways to improve access to care, particularly preventive services.\n\n\u201cBy working together we can identify programs that are working the best and replicate them so that patients can be more engaged in self-care and prevent complications,\u201d she said in the news release. \u201cAdvancing technologies may also benefit us in this effort by being able to deliver some of this education online, reducing the patient\u2019s need for travel.\u201d\n\nA shortage of primary care physicians also affects many rural hospitals.\n\nPeggy Pinkham has been hired as the executive director for the Maine Rural Health Collaborative LLC. A former hospital CEO, she for the last six years has consulted on health care issues primarily in Maine. She also works with the Maine Rural Health and Primary Care Program and Maine\u2019s critical access hospitals. Pinkham, a registered nurse, earned her MBA at New Hampshire College.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five hospitals in Maine have formed the Maine Rural Health Collaborative LLC with a goal of preserving and enhancing health care within the communities they serve.
