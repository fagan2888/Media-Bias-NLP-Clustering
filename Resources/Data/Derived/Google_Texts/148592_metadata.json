He pursued the quarterback with carnivorous instincts and little concern of his path to the sack. Those are the days of the dinosaur. Watch the Broncos\u2019 DeMarcus Ware, currently the top performer on the NFL\u2019s top defense, and it\u2019s easy to see how the much the game has evolved.\n\nWare, 33, boasts the best start of his career at an age when he should be considering broadcasting options. Pass rushers aren\u2019t supposed to get better when they get older, especially one who finished with just one sack in the final seven games last season.\n\nPart of what sets Ware apart is film study, a constant processing of information. He has turned the art of the sack into a blend of analytics and brute instincts.\n\n\u201cI look at tape week in and week out on one guy who I am going to be facing. It\u2019s like a chess match. What would I do when this guy did that move? And I watch it 40 times, the same play over and over and over,\u201d Ware said last week. \u201cI then see how he handled different types of rushers. Then I go back to that play. It\u2019s seared into my head once I go into the game.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s third-and-7 in the Broncos\u2019 season opener. The Baltimore Ravens face an obvious passing situation late in the first quarter. Ravens left tackle Eugene Monroe stands across from Ware. He assumes a passing stance that Ware detects from his film study, recalling how Monroe reacted to a specific move off the edge. He calculates how the Ravens\u2019 offensive line will counter Von Miller rushing from the opposite side.\n\nWare decides on a power-punch move to create a short path to quarterback Joe Flacco rather than making a wide loop around Monroe. The hours of study produced the answer Ware sought. He broke free of Monroe and pulled Flacco down by his shoulder pads in a burst of brawn and brains.\n\n\u201cOnce you get around the corner,\u201d Ware said, \u201cyou already know it\u2019s Christmastime now. I am thinking in my mind, \u2018Don\u2019t throw the ball, don\u2019t throw the ball.\u2019 Once Flacco started running, I knew from the film that he holds on to the ball the majority of the time in that situation. Once I get there, I still don\u2019t know if he has the ball or not. I always turn around and look. That\u2019s why you see me do that. I always come and I swipe and try to knock the ball out. I try to see if the ball is out or if he\u2019s on the ground with the ball. Getting that sack, that\u2019s the ultimate reward.\u201d\n\nWare uncovers clues of his craft each week, burying his head into his iPad. He\u2019s able to notice things that few in his own locker room can. A twitch, a head movement, a shoulder raise, the slightest inflection by the offensive tackle might tip him off.\n\n\u201cHe does enough studying for about four or five of us. It definitely helps me, and not only me, but everybody in the meeting room,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019ll watch film for like three or four plays and he\u2019ll have a tendency right there. He\u2019ll be like, \u2018The quarterback is lifting his hands.\u2019 He always has something just off one or two plays.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the film room\n\nThe evolution of Ware was not televised. It occurred during his third season with the Dallas Cowboys in front of a TV in a linebackers meeting room. Ware began his career terrorizing quarterbacks, collecting 19\u00bd sacks in his first two seasons and Pro Bowl honors in 2006. In 2007, Ware changed his approach at the urging of teammate and fellow pass rusher Greg Ellis, a productive but aging veteran. He gave Ware invaluable advice. Ware was gifted athletically. Everyone realized this. Ellis told Ware what he did away from the practice field could make him better than what he did during workouts.\n\n\u201cHe pulled me aside and showed me this and that on film. I remember looking at the screen and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t see anything,\u2019 \u201d Ware said. \u201cThe more I did it, the more I understood. Now I go in the film room with guys like (Broncos outside linebacker) Lerentee (McCray) and he says, \u2018I see it.\u2019 I realized I would never see it without putting in long hours in the film room.\u201d\n\nWare has become so adept at analyzing offensive sets that he has developed a code language with Miller. He will yell across to him using key words known only to them that tip off a protection scheme, or the right time to use a move they worked on in practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the language that he can speak with me that he can\u2019t speak to rookies. It\u2019s advanced when he starts speaking like Chinese,\u201d Miller said.\n\nKnowledge is power for Ware. He used to run by offensive tackles with alarming regularity, playing bigger than his 247 pounds. He long ago heeded the advice of Hall of Famer Michael Strahan, who told him to get lighter as he aged. He uses his hands as well as any pass rusher in the game, skills gleaned from countless sessions with mixed martial arts experts.\n\nBack in Wade\u2019s world\n\nStatistics lay bare Ware\u2019s success this season. He leads the AFC in sacks with 3\u00bd. He ranks first in quarterback hits with 11. Returning to a 3-4 defense with defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who helped Ware average 16 sacks per season in their four years together at Dallas, accelerated his rebound.\n\n\u201cThis defense is his baby,\u201d Broncos inside linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \u201cThis is his home.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s only partly correct. Ware\u2019s residence is the backfield, via the film room. So confident was Ware in his revival, he bought a 1982 Red Bourdeaux \u2014 the year he was born. If successful the previous week, he savors a glass each Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt tastes good,\u201d Ware said with a big smile. \u201cSo good.\u201d\n\nThe mystery of Ware, of how a player growing older appears to be getting younger, goes beyond his statistics. Watch the game, peel back the layers. Ware will set up the tackle, using a power move in a specific situation only to switch to a spin move when he needs it most in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s the equivalent of Clayton Kershaw eschewing his curveball for a changeup to strike out a hitter with runners on base.\n\nWare\u2019s September is a tribute to understanding the NFL\u2019s nuances.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to excel, you really start paying attention to the small things. That became film study for me,\u201d Ware said. \u201cEverybody has tendencies and little glitches. I have glitches. But when you understand what they are in an opponent, and you turn it into a sack on Sunday, it makes it all worth it.\u201d\n\nSack is in the bag\n\nBroncos star DeMarcus Ware is experiencing a renaissance at age 33. NFL reporter Troy E. Renck examines the art of the sack with Ware, by words and numbers:\n\n\u2022 Ware\u2019s favorite move is the \u201cstab and swipe,\u201d in which he gets his hands into the offensive tackle\u2019s chest and then uses his hands to clear or swipe past the blocker.\n\n\u2022 Ware\u2019s favorite move he has seen used by someone else? The \u201cside scissor\u201d by fellow former Dallas Cowboys pass rusher Greg Ellis. \u201cHe swipes through their hands underneath,\u201d Ware said, \u201cand it works. I am like, \u2018Why do they keep sticking their hands out?\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u2022 Ware\u2019s 3\u00bd sacks this season lead the AFC. He was chosen the AFC defensive player of the month for September.\n\n\u2022 Ware\u2019s 11 quarterback hits lead the NFL, three ahead of Houston Texans star J.J. Watt.\n\n\u2022 Ware\u2019s 132\u00bd career sacks rank 13th in NFL history, two behind Lawrence Taylor and Leslie O\u2019Neal.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DeMarcus Ware and the art of the sack", "title": "DeMarcus Ware and the art of the sack", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/demarcus-ware-and-the-art-of-the-sack/", "image": {"width": 464, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151003__BN20151004_C1_BNSP04FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151003__BN20151004_C1_BNSP04FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T18:40:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T12:12:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And I watch it 40 times, the same play over and over and over,\u201d Ware said last week.\nI am like, \u2018Why do they keep sticking their hands out?\u2019 \u201c\u2022 Ware\u2019s 3\u00bd sacks this season lead the AFC.\nHe has turned the art of the sack into a blend of analytics and brute instincts.\n\u201cI look at tape week in and week out on one guy who I am going to be facing.\nGetting that sack, that\u2019s the ultimate reward.\u201dWare uncovers clues of his craft each week, burying his head into his iPad."}
