Protests targeting police brutality, injustice and racial inequality in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and Minneapolis became a frequent occurrence.\n\nSupreme Court rulings\n\nHistory was made this year at the Supreme Court when the justices voted to save the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and approved same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nKim Davis\n\nBut one county clerk in Kentucky didn\u2019t follow that ruling and refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples \u2014 and was subsequently jailed. She was released five days later in a very public display of celebration, accompanied by Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee and her husband.\n\nPope Francis Visit\n\nPope Francis made a historic visit to the United States and Cuba this year, visiting New York, Philadelphia and Washington. He was the first pope to address Congress.\n\n#DeflateGate\n\nAnd one of the most controversial stories of the year sparked arguments nationwide, when the New England Patriots were accused of cheating in the Superbowl against the Indianapolis Colts. The story spawned a widely shared hashtag that became so embedded in normal conversation, it became the de facto name of the scandal \u2014 #DeflateGate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shootings unfortunately made up a large part of this year's biggest national stories, peppered with highlights from Pope Francis' visit to the United States, and the Supreme Court making two historic rulings.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "KFOR.com", "description": "Shootings unfortunately made up a large part of this year\u2019s biggest national stories, peppered with highlights from Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States, and the Supreme Court makin\u2026", "title": "2015: The year in national news", "url": "http://kfor.com/2015/12/14/2015-the-year-in-national-news/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvkfor.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/s053983830-300.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkfor.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/s053983830-300.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@kfor", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kfor"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Oklahoma's News Channel 4", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=318424694", "fb": {"pages": 141321506635}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kfor.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/aee35bfc7477e257e24606dad6c61f85?s=16", "application-name": "KFOR.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/kfor4", "published_time": "2015-12-15T01:58:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T01:58:37+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kfor4"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "JB9aQ7nSVzIQVBM38B4ctWDv37uWJZtYggJ4irTt8bQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 2015: The year in national newsShootings unfortunately made up a large part of this year\u2019s biggest national stories, peppered with highlights from Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States, and the Supreme Court making two historic rulings.\nSupreme Court rulingsHistory was made this year at the Supreme Court when the justices voted to save the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and approved same-sex marriage nationwide.\nPope Francis VisitPope Francis made a historic visit to the United States and Cuba this year, visiting New York, Philadelphia and Washington.\nNine people were killed at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, sparking a national debate over the Confederate flag and prompting its removal from the South Carolina Capitol grounds.\nSeveral other shootings devastated states across the country:Four Marines and a sailor were killed at a recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee."}
