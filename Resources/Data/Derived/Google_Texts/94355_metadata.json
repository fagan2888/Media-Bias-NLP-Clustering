Howard Coble (R-N.C.) Wednesday night, including multiple fellow North Carolina Republicans who wore plaid suit jackets in his honor.\n\nCoble, who has served since 1985, is well known around Capitol Hill for regularly wearing plaid suit jackets. He sat in the front row of the House floor as his colleagues praised his service.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwo of his fellow North Carolina Republicans, Reps. Patrick McHenry and Richard Hudson, wore plaid suit jackets while praising Coble on the House floor.\n\n\"You may notice my sharp jacket tonight,\" Hudson joked.\n\nHudson noted that Coble was known for more than just his suit jacket choices.\n\n\"Howard was not always known for his colorful jackets. When he first came to town, Howard was known for his many colorful suspenders,\" Hudson said.\n\nCoble was most active on the House Judiciary Committee, where he chaired multiple subcommittees over the course of his tenure.\n\n\"It is just a real honor to be here tonight to tell my friend Howard Coble how much he means to me and how much I'm going to miss him here in the House of Representatives,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).\n\nIt wasn't just Republicans who praised Coble. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said she had enjoyed having Coble as a neighbor in the Rayburn House Office Building.\n\n\"I would say that Congressman Howard Coble represents the values of gentlemanly behavior, affability, cordiality,\" Kaptur said. \"He's not just a man of character, but he is a character. And his personality and demeanor represents the type of collegiality that is so important to bringing this institution together.\"\n\n\"We love you, Howard,\" said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas).\n\nCoble thanked his colleagues afterward for their remarks.\n\n\"You all sure know how to make an old man feel good. I thank you for this,\" Coble said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Two fellow North Carolina Republicans wore plaid suit jackets in his honor.", "description": "Two fellow North Carolina Republicans wore plaid suit jackets in his honor.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Two fellow North Carolina Republicans wore plaid suit jackets in his honor.", "title": "Lawmakers pay tribute to Howard Coble", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/223972-lawmakers-pay-tribute-to-howard-coble", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/hudsonrichard_111214cspan.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-12T20:31:16-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-12T20:31-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/223972-lawmakers-pay-tribute-to-howard-coble", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-12T20:14-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-12T20:14:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-12T20:31:16-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Howard Coble,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/223972-lawmakers-pay-tribute-to-howard-coble", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Two fellow North Carolina Republicans wore plaid suit jackets in his honor.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers pay tribute to Howard Coble"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers pay tribute to Howard Coble"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e2d\"", "article_summary": "Members paid tribute to retiring Rep.
