Pew notes that it would be the first time in world history the populations of the two groups were so similar in size.\n\nThere Will Be Fewer People Who Don\u2019t Identify With a Particular Faith\n\nBy Pew\u2019s estimate, there were 1.1 billion \u201catheists, agnostics and people who do not identify with any particular religion\u201d on Earth in 2010. In 2050, there will be approximately 1.2 billion. Bearing in mind the estimated 2050 human population of 9.3 billion, people who are unaffiliated will represent a much smaller percentage of the world\u2019s population.\n\nJudaism\n\nPew notes that Judaism is the \u201csmallest religious group\u201d they studied separately. The world\u2019s Jewish population is expected to grow by 16 percent over the next 40 years. They estimate that in 2010, there were 14 million Jews worldwide, and in 2050 there will be 16.1 million.\n\nBuddhism and Hinduism\n\nThe population of Buddhists is expected to remain stable, and the population of Hindus will grow by 34 percent by 2050.\n\nThe Buddhist population is aging, they note, and Hindus are expected to keep pace with overall population growth.\n\nSmaller Religions\n\nLocalized religions, such as \u201cAfrican traditional religions, Chinese folk religions, Native American religions and Australian aboriginal religions,\u201d will grow from 405 million in 2010 to approximately 450 million in 2050.\n\nPew combined all other faiths in an \u201cumbrella category\u201d including \u201cBaha\u2019is, Jains, Sikhs, Taoists and many smaller faiths.\u201d These groups are projected to grow from 58 million to more than 61 million by 2050.\n\nIn Europe\n\nIn the year 2050, about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s population will be Muslim.\n\nIn Africa\n\nSub-Saharan Africa will be home to 40 percent of the world\u2019s Christians. High fertility rates on the continent will mean an increased population for several faiths.\n\nIn India\n\nHinduism will remain the dominant religion in India, but the country will replace Indonesia as home to the largest Muslim population in the world.\n\nIn the United States\n\nIn 2010, Christians accounted for three-quarters of the American public. By 2050, only two thirds of Americans will practice Christianity. Islam will replace Judaism as the nation\u2019s most prominent non-Christian faith.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some religions are predicted to grow.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Some religions are predicted to grow.", "title": "What Will Major World Religions Look Like in 2050?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/403prayer.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-03T15:29:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BX1LO1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Some religions are predicted to grow.", "title": "What Will Major World Religions Look Like in 2050?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/403prayer.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-04-05T03:01:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T15:29:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Smaller ReligionsLocalized religions, such as \u201cAfrican traditional religions, Chinese folk religions, Native American religions and Australian aboriginal religions,\u201d will grow from 405 million in 2010 to approximately 450 million in 2050.\nIn a study titled \u201cThe Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050,\u201d the Pew Research Center estimated how many followers each of the world\u2019s major religions will have in the year 2050.\nPew analyzed demographics that will determine the populations of major world religions in 2050, such as the size of each group\u2019s youth population, fertility rates and ability to attract converts.\nResearchers say the demographics of each of the world\u2019s major religions will undergo significant changes by the year 2050.\nIn 2050, they estimate, there will be 9.3 billion people on Earth, including 2.9 billion Christians and 2.8 billion Muslims."}
