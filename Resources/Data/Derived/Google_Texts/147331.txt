One of the few efforts to bring down health costs in ObamaCare actually caused federal spending to climb last year, according to a report in Kaiser Health News, adding to the pile of ObamaCare’s failed promises.

The idea was to encourage doctors and hospitals to coordinate care with an eye on keeping patients healthier and lowering spending. These “Accountable Care Organizations” would get bonuses if they were able to keep costs below what traditional Medicare would have spent.

That was the idea, anyway.

But it turns out that almost half the 353 ACOs in the program last year spent more on seniors than would have been the case had they stayed in regular old Medicare, Kaiser reports. Oregon’s North Bend Medical Center, for example, spent 12% more than expected, and then dropped out of the ACO program this year.

Then, after paying out bonuses to those ACOs that did save money, the program ended up adding a total of $3 million to Medicare costs. That’s not much in a program with a $500+ billion annual budget, but ACOs were supposed to cut Medicare spending by $320 million last year, and by almost $5 billion through 2019.

So, naturally, the Obama administration is expanding the program, with a goal of having half of Medicare spending running through one of these ACOs.
