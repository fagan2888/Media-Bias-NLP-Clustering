To say that the measure merely failed would be putting it mildly.\n\n\u201cSince the fast-food restrictions were passed in 2008, overweight and obesity rates in South Los Angeles and other neighborhoods targeted by the law have increased faster than in other parts of the city or other parts of the county,\u201d reads a RAND press release on the study.\n\nWell then.\n\n\u201cThe South Los Angeles fast food ban may have symbolic value, but it has had no measurable impact in improving diets or reducing obesity,\u201d said lead author Roland Sturm of RAND.\n\nThe RAND study results represent some of the best evidence to date that policies that restrict food freedom do no make people healthier. The failure and repeal of Denmark\u2019s so-called \u201cfat tax\u201d and damning research on mandatory menu labeling are two other convincing examples.\n\nThey also echo\u2014and magnify\u2014the results of an earlier RAND study by Sturm that I wrote about here in 2013. The earlier study, which also looked at the Los Angeles fast-food ban, was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cObesity in South Los Angeles, 30 percent in 2007, had climbed to 33 percent by 2012 despite the ban on new fast food restaurants,\u201d I noted in my column while discussing the larger implications of that earlier RAND study.\n\nThe new study\u2019s release is fortuitous, coinciding as it does with a flurry of increased scrutiny over an ongoing FDA proposal to mandate an \u201cadded sugar\u201d label on packaged foods.\n\nThis latest example of social engineering is, like the fast food ban, a terrifically misguided idea, as I described last year.\n\nThere are plenty of good arguments against the FDA\u2019s proposal. Mandatory \u201cadded sugar\u201d labeling may violate the First Amendment. Use of the term \u201cadded sugar\u201d is misleading, as it creates a deceptive health halo around products like orange juice and apple juice, which are high in naturally occurring sugar but contain no added sugar. The \u201cadded sugar\u201d label also raises this question: why stop at mandating added sugar on food labels? Why not added salt, added caffeine, and added allergens like soy and dairy? Why not label for added protein and added carbs?\n\nThose are some of my arguments against the label. Others appear equally skeptical. As an L.A. Times piece published earlier this week notes, opposition to the FDA\u2019s proposal has emerged among strange bedfellows, including a Democratic governor of Massachusetts and a Republican governor of Wisconsin, and from as far away as Australia\u2014where the national government also objected to the proposal.\n\nDoes the lack of an \"added sugar\" label mean food companies can just hide the ball when it comes to how much sugar is in their food? Hardly.\n\nThanks to existing FDA regulations, there are already at least three places on a food label where consumers can find out how much sugar is in a food. The mandatory Nutrition Facts panel already tells consumers exactly how much sugar is in a given serving. Ingredients rules requires that every component of a food, including sugar, be listed in descending order of weight. Another requirement for listing the carbohydrate content\u2014which appears on the Nutrition Facts panel right above total sugar\u2014tells consumers how many carbs, including sugar, are in that same serving.\n\nIf all of that information isn\u2019t clear enough, then it\u2019s incumbent on proponents of mandating still more information to explain how adding the term \u201cadded sugar\u201d will fix everything and why all that other information is necessary if people aren\u2019t paying it any mind.\n\nOh, and they\u2019re not. One bit.\n\nI appeared on KCRW\u2019s excellent To the Point program this week to discuss the added sugar proposal. Dr. Robert Lustig, the nation\u2019s leading sugar hater, was a fellow guest. Lustig garishly defended the FDA\u2019s proposal\u2014really, it\u2019s worth a listen\u2014while admitting during the program that only, um, fifteen percent of people even read food labels.\n\nIt\u2019s facts like those that demonstrate the FDA\u2019s \u201cadded sugar\u201d proposal is merely a tool to punish food manufacturers.\n\n\u201cBy forcing what amounts to an added-sugar warning on the label, the government is attempting to skew consumer demand,\u201d I told the L.A. Times this week.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the negative results such laws have produced\u2014from the South Los Angeles fast food ban to Denmark\u2019s fat tax to various counterproductive menu-labeling efforts. There\u2019s no reason the FDA should make the same mistake here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "To say that Los Angeles merely failed would be putting it mildly.", "title": "Socially Engineering Food Choices Doesn't Work", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/03/21/socially-engineering-food-choices-doesnt", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14268872493364.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To say that Los Angeles merely failed would be putting it mildly.", "title": "Socially Engineering Food Choices Doesn't Work", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14268872493364.jpg", "creator": "@baylenlinnekin", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-21T12:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/baylen-linnekin"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cadded sugar\u201d label also raises this question: why stop at mandating added sugar on food labels?\nThis latest example of social engineering is, like the fast food ban, a terrifically misguided idea, as I described last year.\nUse of the term \u201cadded sugar\u201d is misleading, as it creates a deceptive health halo around products like orange juice and apple juice, which are high in naturally occurring sugar but contain no added sugar.\nDoes the lack of an \"added sugar\" label mean food companies can just hide the ball when it comes to how much sugar is in their food?\nWe\u2019ve seen the negative results such laws have produced\u2014from the South Los Angeles fast food ban to Denmark\u2019s fat tax to various counterproductive menu-labeling efforts."}
