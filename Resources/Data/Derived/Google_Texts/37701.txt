I’ve been researching the topic of big Government. It’s a weird thing to research. We all know that Government is huge. But what percentage of Government workers are elected?

Only .001 % of Government employees are elected! If you count up all the United States (tax funded employees) it adds up to 22 million people. We are a nation of 320 million. So we are being governed by 22 million people.

So we experience a massive overreach. If you look at our taxation, the IRS is taking in trillions more dollars in America than other countries do. We’re a huge country but we’re spending all the money we take in. But how can we be immune from an imminent collapse?

And tied with all this, we have the court yet again telling Obama that there is part of Obamacare that is illegal. This is the D.C. circuit court, a court that is very inclined to agree with government at all costs. The court said the subsidies are illegal and against the constitution. Yet the same judge is also telling the White House that they don’t have to stop. It’s against the law but keep on doing it because they know they’re going to appeal this ruling.

Would this ever happen in the world of private industry? Of course not! But these 22 million people who govern us have set up special rules. And you wonder why people are so upset by the system.
