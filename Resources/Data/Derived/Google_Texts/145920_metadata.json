While that\u2019s good news for those whose parents are well-off, it\u2019s really bad news for economic mobility. A new study from the St. Louis Fed attempts to discern precisely what factors contribute to this phenomenon, and how those factors might be manipulated to increase economic mobility in America.\n\nThe paper\u2019s authors, George-Levi Gayle and Limor Golan of Washington University in St. Louis; and Mehmet A. Soytas of Ozyegin University, looked at several characteristics to figure out the factors that play the largest role in the earnings alignment between parents and their children. They looked two-parent households and their respective participation in the labor market, education, number of children, spousal choice, and division of labor.\n\nGayle says that some of what they found surprised them. They initially thought that assortative mating, an increasingly common occurrence where individuals wed someone of a similar educational status, would be a significant determinant of earnings similarity. But according to their analysis, it only accounted for around 13 percent of correlation. \u201cThis is supposed to be one of the holy grails of household economics in terms of generating persistence,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, they found the most significant contributor to intergenerational earnings similarities was the way the modern labor market is set up. \u201cThe lack of flexibility in jobs was one of the major things accounting for intergenerational persistence,\u201d Gayle says. The way employers (and employees) think about work and human capital has a huge influence on how households distribute their time. And those decisions play a big role in shaping the earnings of the next generation. After taking a significant amount of time away from the workforce, it can be difficult if not impossible, to just pick back up where you left off. \u201cYou actually have a depreciation of human capital,\u201d Gayle says. \u201cThe cost of raising kids is much more than just the cost of the foregone wages current value, it\u2019s also the future wages that you're going to lose.\u201d That\u2019s a cost that some families can afford more easily than others.\n\nThe study also notes that often, research about intergenerational earnings focuses on the relationship between the earnings of fathers and sons. But that measuring stick is largely outdated since women now make up 50 percent of the workforce. And factoring in the role of women, both at home and at work, is especially crucial given how important the trade-off between working and child-rearing is to familial earnings\u2014both current and future.\n\nSo how do parent\u2019s choices impact children\u2019s future earnings? It\u2019s largely through investment\u2014of both time and money. Parents have to make choices about how much time they allot to caring for children and who will do so. Those decisions can impact how children grow up and then make their own choices about education, family, and work-life balance in the future. Families with more money may be able to afford more time away from the workforce, or more high-quality childcare and educational opportunities, should they choose to remain on the job.\n\nGayle says that based on the research, increasing changing the way workers interact with the labor market will be crucial to whittling away at earnings persistence in the future, by decreasing the financial losses inherent in choosing to spend more time with kids. \u201cFlexibility in jobs and in the labor market and friendlier workplaces may be one of the better avenues for affecting changes in intergenerational mobility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A worker&#39;s socioeconomic status often mirrors their parent\u2019s, creating a different work environment could change that.", "author": "Gillian B.
