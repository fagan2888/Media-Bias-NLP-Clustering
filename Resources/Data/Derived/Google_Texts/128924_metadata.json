More than the former would care to admit about the latter.\n\nBefore adjourning and heading home for campaign season, the House of Representatives passed a bill to prevent the EPA from implementing its proposed Waters of the U.S. rule. Farmers and ranchers have cried foul over what they see as a regulatory power grab that threatens their livelihoods. However, EPA insists it is merely clarifying vague statutory language (what constitutes \u201cnavigable waters\u201d) under the Clean Water Act.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven murkier than the CWA\u2019s statutory language are the groups that have emerged to support EPA. Some claim to represent anglers, hunters, and other \u201csportsmen,\u201d but a deeper dive reveals that they\u2019re shilling for wealthy liberal activists at the expense of rural farmers.\n\nRecently, the Izaak Walton League of America (IWLA) blasted out an \u201cAction Alert\u201d urging its members to oppose H.R. 5078, which would block EPA\u2019s water rule. IWLA praises EPA for \u201crestor[ing] protections to many of these important waters,\u201d over the objections of farmers, who fear that EPA\u2019s proposal gives federal regulators undue control over how they use their private property. Just this week, IWLA co-signed a letter supporting EPA\u2019s proposed power plant rules.\n\nSo who is IWLA and why do they stand opposed to the farming community? IWLA is a Maryland-based group with numerous local chapters whose members support uncontroversial causes like hunting and angling. These grassroots members should check up on their national office.\n\nIWLA national has received $4.1 million from the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based group that Senate investigators dubbed a \u201cquintessential example of a pass through frequently employed by the Billionaire\u2019s Club\u201d of liberal activists. Essentially, Energy Foundation helps wealthy liberals disguise their donations to activist groups\u2014apparently some of these liberal backers deemed IWLA worthy.\n\nOther so-called \u201csportsmen\u201d groups that support EPA\u2019s water rule are also just liberal front groups. Earlier this year, several organizations\u2014including the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP), Trout Unlimited, and IWLA\u2014co-signed a press release offering praise for EPA\u2019s \u201chuge step forward for protecting America\u2019s waters and wildlife.\u201d\n\nThe press release should have come with a warning: liberal activism is closer than it may appear. The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP), for instance, was co-founded by the liberal Pew Charitable Trusts about a decade ago. One of the other co-founders: IWLA.\n\nTRCP claims it is comprised of \u201cgrassroots partners.\u201d However, the group receives 77 percent of its funding from eight donors. Major backers include the liberal Hewlett and Packard foundations, San Francisco-based outfits that oppose coal and natural gas development. Trout Unlimited also counts among its supporters the Hewlett and Packard foundations and Pew.\n\nSportsmen should make no mistake that these camouflaged green groups will sell them short. This was never clearer than last year when Democrats in Congress moved to ban some of the most popular sporting firearms. Where were these so-called sportsmen\u2019s groups then? TRCP did its best ostrich impression and claimed that it doesn\u2019t work on 2nd Amendment issues.\n\nMeanwhile, former Democrat staffer Gaspar Perricone of the Bull Moose Sportsmen\u2019s Alliance\u2014another group supporting the EPA\u2019s water rule\u2014parroted Michael Bloomberg\u2019s anti-gun talking points. This position makes more sense when you hear that Bull Moose Sportsmen\u2019s major funder is the Western Conservation Foundation, a front group for a whole host of leftist causes.\n\nWhat does EPA\u2019s rule mean for farmers? Echoing the general sentiment of the agricultural community, the Nebraska Farm Bureau slammed the proposal as \u201cvery disruptive to farming and ranching,\u201d adding that the rule \u201cwould affect every possible thing farmers and ranchers could do on the land.\u201d EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy Gina McCarthyHow Congress got to yes on toxic chemical reform Overnight Energy: Labor rift opens over green mega-donor GOP: EPA is violating court hold on climate rule MORE dismissed such criticism as \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\nEPA\u2019s water rule pits liberal billionaires against rural farmers. Except it isn\u2019t a fair fight when the well-heeled dress up their true intentions in sportsmen\u2019s garb. Americans shouldn\u2019t let these green decoys sell them down the river.\n\nCoggin is a senior research analyst at the Environmental Policy Alliance, a project of the non-profit Center for Organizational Research and Education.
