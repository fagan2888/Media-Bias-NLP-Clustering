I am thankful for the sport of cycling and what it gave to me.\u201d\n\nVoigt won a stage in the Tour of California in 2013 and got a gutsy stage win in the 2012 Pro Challenge into Beaver Creek after an early breakaway. In the Tour de France, he has three stage wins.\n\n\u201cHe always came to every single race willing to win. He was always great for the team, and the whole team will need that special push \u2014 and somebody who brews the coffee for us,\u201d said German rider and teammate Frank Schleck, smiling.\n\nSo, why choose to end it all now? First, Voigt wanted to end on his terms, not when teams decided they no longer wanted to offer him a contract. (He will turn 43 next month.) And he wanted to do it in Colorado, a place he called \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cgood for your soul.\u201d He even went fly-fishing with his team, Trek Factory Racing.\n\n\u201cI think I have a pretty good fan base in the U.S.,\u201d Voigt said, \u201cand it just felt right to end my career here.\u201d\n\nFewer World Tour teams in Colorado. Five World Tour teams are competing in this year\u2019s Pro Challenge, down from seven last year, and the fewest since the race started in 2011.\n\nRace CEO Shawn Hunter attributes that to the difficult Tour de France in July. Numerous crashes, injuries and difficult stages, along with unfavorable weather, forced some of the teams\u2019 top riders to drop out.\n\nWorld Tour teams are mandated, according to UCI, the sport\u2019s governing body, to field teams in all three World Tours \u2014 the Giro d\u2019Italia, the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and the Tour de France.\n\nAnd that meant many riders \u2014 the ones healthy, at least \u2014 needed to be racing in Spain for the Vuelta, which starts Saturday.\n\n\u201cSome teams didn\u2019t feel they could put together a competitive roster of eight healthy riders to compete at this elevation,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nNew start time. The start time for Stage 1 is being pushed back by 30 minutes to 2:40 p.m. to accommodate NBC\u2019s schedule. The delay should help with TV\u2019s ratings, an all-important measure of the event\u2019s success. The race will broadcast from 3-5:30 p.m. on NBC Sports Network, with a recap show from 9-10 p.m. featuring highlights.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "German cyclist Jens Voigt says USA Pro Challenge will be last as pro", "title": "German cyclist Jens Voigt says USA Pro Challenge will be last as pro", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/17/german-cyclist-jens-voigt-says-usa-pro-challenge-will-be-last-as-pro/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140817__Jens-Voigtp1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140817__Jens-Voigtp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T21:38:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:23:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "article_summary": "First, Voigt wanted to end on his terms, not when teams decided they no longer wanted to offer him a contract.\nFive World Tour teams are competing in this year\u2019s Pro Challenge, down from seven last year, and the fewest since the race started in 2011.\nWorld Tour teams are mandated, according to UCI, the sport\u2019s governing body, to field teams in all three World Tours \u2014 the Giro d\u2019Italia, the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and the Tour de France.\nNow, the German rider is calling it a career: He re- affirmed Sunday that the USA Pro Challenge would be his final professional race.\n\u201cI think I have a pretty good fan base in the U.S.,\u201d Voigt said, \u201cand it just felt right to end my career here.\u201dFewer World Tour teams in Colorado."}
