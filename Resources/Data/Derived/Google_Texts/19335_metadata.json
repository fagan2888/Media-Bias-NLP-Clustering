The facilities have served homeless veterans, addicts, and the mentally ill for more than thirty years.\n\nExecutive director Donna Dooley called it devastating:\n\n\u201cSix months or a year from now, when your homelessness increases, your crime increases, everything increases because there\u2019s just not anyone to catch all this anymore.\u201d\n\nBoard chairwoman Linda White and other board members will formally vote to dissolve the agency at a meeting tomorrow night. She said the whole situation is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing the safety net in this community, and who will step up, or who can even step up to provide services to the most vulnerable?\u201d she asked.\n\nWindward Behavioral Care could close as early as July 1st. Partner agencies in Volusia will treat some patients. Meanwhile, state officials, could require the agency to pay as much as $1 million in penalties.\n\nRenata Sago is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
