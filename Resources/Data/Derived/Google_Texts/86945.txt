The U.S. healthcare economy expanded rapidly in 2014 and parts of 2015, but economic statistics show the growth may be tapering.The Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a nonpartisan healthcare think tank, put out its February 2016 report , and it has promising data points for those who feared healthcare expenses were growing out of control. National health spending increased 4.9% in December 2015 compared with December 2014. Health spending for all of 2015 grew at a 5.9% clip, up from 5.3% in 2014

Those preliminary rates, which still must be confirmed by the CMS' actuaries, are higher than 2013's historically low growth rate and the post-recession years. But Altarum's numbers crunchers found that last year's health spending decelerated every month after February, when the year-over-year rate neared 7%.Health spending unsurprisingly climbed in 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act's mass expansion of health insurance. More people were insured and therefore sought healthcare services. Spending continued to explode throughout the early parts of 2015. Hospital expenditures were up significantly, and a lot of money was also spent on big-ticket prescription drugs , such as the hepatitis C blockbusters made by Gilead Sciences.However, demand for prescription drugs and hospital services leveled off and even declined as 2015 dragged on. The slow flu season , in particular, suppressed hospital volumes. “If this trend continues, health spending growth in 2016 will drop to more modest levels,” Altarum's report reads.
