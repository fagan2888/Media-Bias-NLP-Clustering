(REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n4321969\n\nAfter a long list of Obamacare failures in Alaska, one physician is shutting down his decades-old practice, charging that the health-care law and other federal programs are \u201cunsustainable\u201d for practicing doctors.\n\nDr. William Wennen, a plastic surgeon, is closing his Fairbanks practice after 38 years of working in the state. Dr. Wennen blames federal health insurance programs, citing Obamacare, Medicaid and Medicare, for shutting down his practice.\n\n\u201cIt is an unsustainable system,\u201d Dr. Wennen wrote to his customers in a letter obtained by The Daily Caller. \u201cI am personally writing off upwards of three quarters of a million dollars annually in free/uncompensated care.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reasons for closing down the office are simply economic,\u201d Wennen wrote. \u201cThe governmental agencies that are supplying \u2018medical insurance\u2019 to the elderly, the disadvantaged, the indigent and the sick, injured, or disabled have placed an unrealistically low value of worth on physician\u2019s services.\u201d\n\nMedicaid typically has the lowest physician reimbursements of any federal program. Doctors have been protesting pay cuts for services through Medicaid and Medicare. It\u2019s increasingly difficult for customers to actually find health care providers that accept the coverage \u2014 especially in private practice, where doctors are more hard-pressed to be profitable than at big-budget hospitals. (RELATED: Less Than Half Of Doctors In Nation\u2019s Largest Cities Accept Medicaid)\n\n\u201cWithin the last month, Fairbanks has lost three other much respected physicians for the same or similar reasons,\u201d Dr. Wennen wrote. \u201cI am not the first and certainly will not be the last of the exodus of physicians from active practice because of all of this.\u201d\n\nDr. Wennen is far from alone in his stark opposition to the health-care law. A recent survey from the Physicians Foundation found that 46 percent of doctors in the U.S. would give Obamacare a \u201cD\u201d or an \u201cF,\u201d the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nFor his part, Wennen hopes to continue providing medical care through other avenues, but can no longer afford to keep his practice. Other doctors nationwide have simply refused to accept coverage provided by federal agencies \u2014 even private coverage sold through Obamacare exchanges.

And that\u2019s after Obamacare\u2019s already hit the state especially hard \u2014 the state Obamacare exchange is facing some of the highest rate hikes in the nation.\n\nPremera Alaska is upping its rates by 37 percent \u2014 and says even that isn\u2019t enough. The state insurance department expects Premera will lose $5 million in 2015 alone at these rates. The only other carrier, Moda, will up rates by 27 percent.\n\nIncumbent Democratic Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, who voted for Obamacare, has already taken hits over the drastic rate hikes. Sen. Begich is in a tight race against former state attorney general Dan Sullivan, who\u2019s made gains in several polls over the past month.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'It is an unsustainable system'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "After a long list of Obamacare failures in Alaska, one physician is shutting down his decades-old practice, charging that the health-care law and other federal programs are \"unsustainable\" for practic", "title": "Alaska Physician Shuts Down Practice, Citing Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/21/alaska-physician-shuts-down-practice-citing-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-09-16T202852Z_1_LYNXMPEA8F11U_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1411156163301.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It is an unsustainable system'", "title": "Alaska Physician Shuts Down Practice, Citing Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/21/alaska-physician-shuts-down-practice-citing-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-09-16T202852Z_1_LYNXMPEA8F11U_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1411156163301.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-21 21:39:37", "sailthru.title": "Alaska Physician Shuts Down Practice, Citing Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "alaska,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "standout,alaska,dan sullivan,mark begich,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "After a long list of Obamacare failures in Alaska, one physician is shutting down his decades-old practice, charging that the health-care law and other federal programs are \"unsustainable\" for practic", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-09-16T202852Z_1_LYNXMPEA8F11U_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1411156163301.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3a2\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Wennen blames federal health insurance programs, citing Obamacare, Medicaid and Medicare, for shutting down his practice.\n\u201cIt is an unsustainable system,\u201d Dr. Wennen wrote to his customers in a letter obtained by The Daily Caller.\nAnd that\u2019s after Obamacare\u2019s already hit the state especially hard \u2014 the state Obamacare exchange is facing some of the highest rate hikes in the nation.\nDr. William Wennen, a plastic surgeon, is closing his Fairbanks practice after 38 years of working in the state.\n(REUTERS/Larry Downing)4321969After a long list of Obamacare failures in Alaska, one physician is shutting down his decades-old practice, charging that the health-care law and other federal programs are \u201cunsustainable\u201d for practicing doctors."}
