(Photo: AP)\n\nWASHINGTON - It\u2019s crunch time to sign up for coverage under President Obama\u2019s health care law. The website works much better now, but rising premiums and shaken faith among insurers have cast new shadows.\n\nTuesday is the deadline for millions of uninsured procrastinators to sign up in time for coverage to begin on Jan. 1. As the health insurance expansion enters its third year, their decisions are critical to its economic viability. A surge of younger, healthier customers could hold down premiums in a market that\u2019s struggling to grow.\n\n\u201cMedical costs of enrollees have been higher than expected and total enrollment remains low,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, a vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health. \u201cIf participation is leveling off, then plans may be stuck with a risk pool that is not particularly balanced.\u201d\n\nMore than half of the health law\u2019s 23 nonprofit insurance cooperatives have folded, and even some major industry players have recently gone public with doubts.\n\nThere have been bumps with the health law, says business owner Rayna Collins of Lincoln, Nebraska, but overall she counts on it. She\u2019s surprised, however, that many people she knows have remained uninsured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to think that they could have affordable insurance,\u201d said Collins. \u201cThey think it\u2019s like going on welfare.\u201d One friend believed incorrectly that insurers could still turn down customers with pre-existing health conditions, a practice barred under the law.\n\nCollins, a graphic designer, has had to make adjustments. She switched insurers for 2016 because the company she was with left the market. Her premium will be about the same, after subsidies the law provides for private coverage. But her deductible will spike from $500 to $2600.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting less coverage for about the same, and I\u2019m not happy with that,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what I would do if I weren\u2019t getting the government subsidy. I was already being priced out of health insurance before Obamacare.\u201d The coverage allows her to get regular preventive care that\u2019s important for people like her, in their early 60s.\n\nThe Obama administration says it\u2019s seeing a vigorous consumer response this sign-up season, with more than 1 million new customers already.\n\n\u201cAll the evidence for us is that the marketplace is strong, it\u2019s vibrant, and it\u2019s growing,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the government\u2019s major insurance programs.\n\nStill, the administration\u2019s sign-up target for 2016, the president\u2019s last full year in office, is modest: 10 million people enrolled and paying premiums at the end of the year, an increase of about 10 percent.\n\nSome important things for consumers thinking about signing up for the first time, as well as for those renewing:\n\nDeadlines: Tuesday is the deadline to sign up for coverage so it can take effect on the first of the year. It\u2019s also the deadline to make any changes to existing coverage so they take effect Jan. 1. Current customers will be automatically renewed Jan. 1 if they make no changes, but they may save money now by shopping for a plan with lower premiums.\n\nThe final deadline for new sign-ups and plan switches is Jan. 31, 2016. After that, new enrollments and changes are only allowed under special circumstances. People who remain uninsured after Jan. 31 risk fines when they file their 2016 taxes.\n\nFines will sting: The fines for people who remain uninsured in 2016 have gone up substantially. A study from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the average tax penalty will rise to $969 per household, or nearly 50 percent. The fines are one of the law\u2019s methods for nudging healthy people to get insured.\n\nFines of $900 would put a serious dent in most income tax refunds, and it\u2019s enough money to pay several months\u2019 worth of subsidized premiums. This year uninsured people got a second chance to sign up and avoid penalties if they found out about the fines upon filing their tax returns. There\u2019s no such reprieve next year.\n\nWebsite working: The HealthCare.gov website, famously balky a couple of years ago, is working well by most accounts. The site has some consumer-friendly enhancements including a cost calculator, a doctor and hospital look-up feature and a way to see whether your prescription drugs are covered. Consumers are urged to double-check the physician finder results with their plans and doctors.\n\nAhead of sign-up season, it was expected that premiums for health law plans would go up in most places. A wave of closures among the law\u2019s nonprofit insurance co-ops led to more worries. But what really seems to have shaken confidence were recent comments by UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley that the nation\u2019s largest insurer had made a bad decision in expanding into more of the law\u2019s insurance exchanges.\n\nDrew Altman, president of the Kaiser Foundation, says the health law\u2019s insurance markets appear to be making progress. But they\u2019re not there yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take more people enrolled to be fully successful,\u201d Altman said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1YfFExW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It\u2019s crunch time to sign up for coverage under President Obama\u2019s health care law.
