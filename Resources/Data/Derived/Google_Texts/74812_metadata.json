It\u2019s making projections about aggregate hours worked and the total number of workers who choose to stay in the workforce: \u201cThe labor force is projected to be about 2 million full-time-equivalent workers smaller in 2025 under the ACA than it would have been otherwise,\u201d the agency wrote. That is, fewer work hours will be logged and paid for, the rough equivalent of 2 million jobs. But those two things \u2014 reduced hours across the economy and total jobs \u2014 are different things. And it\u2019s important to note that the reduction in hours worked is relative to the number of hours that would have been worked in the absence of the law; in either case, total work hours continue to grow into 2025, it\u2019s just a matter of by how much.\n\nThere are several factors at play that could result in a slight shrinkage in the labor force, according to CBO. For instance, lower-wage earners might decide to cut back on their hours or quit menial jobs altogether without fear of losing health care coverage because of their subsidized coverage under the new law. \"The ACA's health insurance subsidies will make it easier for some people to work less or stop working without losing health insurance coverage,\" the CBO noted.\n\nGlenn Kessler, The Washington Post\u2019s fact checker, wrote last year that \u201cthis is not about jobs offered by employers. It\u2019s about workers \u2014 and the choices they make.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d he added, \u201cthe nonpartisan agency is examining whether the law increases or decreases incentives for people to work.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that the lion\u2019s share of the projected reduction in the workforce would come from adverse effects of new tax policy under Obamacare. For instance, phasing out health insurance subsidies as people\u2019s income goes up creates a disincentive to work more.\n\nOther provisions of the law will reduce the labor supply \u201cby imposing higher taxes on labor income directly\u201d \u2014 for example, the ACA\u2019s increase in the payroll tax that higher-income workers must pay for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance program.\n\n\u201cThose estimates reflect CBO\u2019s assessment of how workers, employers, and others will respond to the many significant changes that the ACA has made to federal programs and tax policies,\u201d the report states.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Enrollees Are Reeling from High Deductibles\n\nIn any event, the report by the non-partisan agency\u2019s tax analysts must be taken with a large grain of salt. Republican critics of Obamacare have been predicting since the law\u2019s passage in 2010 that President Obama\u2019s signature health care program was a job killer that would set the economy back on its heels.\n\nIn reality, the country has experienced 69 consecutive months of job expansion since enactment of Obamacare, while the unemployment rate was cut in half.\n\nEven the CBO acknowledges that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effects on the labor supply are uncertain in part because of \u201cthe magnitude of people\u2019s responses to the work incentives created by the law is uncertain.\u201d\n\nOne example is CBO\u2019s supposition that many seniors who once continued working late in their careers for the health insurance coverage would be more inclined to leave their jobs \u2013 or cut back on their hours \u2013 now that they have access to Obamacare coverage. As The Fiscal Times has reported, that phenomenon hasn\u2019t played out yet, with recent research from the University of Michigan finding no evidence of this among Americans between 55 to 64 years old.\n\nMoreover, CBO acknowledges that its tax simulation model lacks some data needed to estimate the effects of two major provisions \u2014 the penalty on larger employers that fail to provide insurance coverage for their workers and the penalty on individuals who fail to obtain insurance coverage \u2014 on each taxpayer\u2019s marginal and average tax rates. The agency consequently had to do some guesswork by making a simplified calculation of those provisions\u2019 total effects on tax rates.\n\nIn some ways, the CBO\u2019s latest calculations of the long term effects of Obamacare on the job market were conceived in a vacuum. U.S. health care spending increased 5.3 percent last year, topping $3 trillion overall, largely due to the expansion of Obamacare and Medicaid coverage. Employment in the health care sector is booming, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the most employment growth by 2022 will be among health care support jobs, such as diagnostic medical sonographers and physical therapist assistants, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThat likely means that growth in the health care sector could more than offset other work force reductions in the coming decade.\n\nRelated: Rising Federal Health Care Costs Could Widen the Generation Gap\n\nEven so, some GOP leaders pounced on the latest CBO report as solid evidence that Obamacare is harmful to the economy and needs to be replaced.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office released a new", "title": "Obamacare Won\u2019t Really Cost the U.S. 2 Million Jobs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/08/Obamacare-Won-t-Really-Cost-US-2-Million-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082012_obamacare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/08/Obamacare-Won-t-Really-Cost-US-2-Million-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082012_obamacare_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office released a new", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That likely means that growth in the health care sector could more than offset other work force reductions in the coming decade.\nRelated: The Thrill Is Gone for Obamacare as Health-Care Approval FadesRepublican foes of Obamacare and some news organizations seized on the CBO report as evidence that the controversial health care law would eliminate or \u201ckill\u201d 2 million jobs by 2025.\nU.S. health care spending increased 5.3 percent last year, topping $3 trillion overall, largely due to the expansion of Obamacare and Medicaid coverage.\n\"When the president's health law hurts the labor force at the same time it increases health care premiums and taxes, it's clear the law is not working for the American people.\"\nThat is, fewer work hours will be logged and paid for, the rough equivalent of 2 million jobs."}
