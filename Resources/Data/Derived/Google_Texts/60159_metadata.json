Despite a preponderance of evidence refuting a connection between vaccines and autism \u2014 and despite the very real public health risks of choosing not to vaccinate \u2014 anti-vaccine fervor is strong enough that 20 states allow personal-belief exemptions for enrollment in public school.\n\nIs this all just a case of misinformation, as many researchers contend? Are parents really just that deferential to the all-knowing authority of Jenny McCarthy? According to a disconcerting new study in Pediatrics, it may be more complicated than that. Once people are convinced that vaccines are bad, researchers found, changing their minds is no longer just a matter of setting the record straight.\n\nMother Jones has more on the study out of Dartmouth College, which evaluated the effectiveness of four different pro-vaccine messages:\n\nThe first message, dubbed \u201cAutism correction,\u201d was a factual, science-heavy correction of false claims that the MMR vaccine causes autism, assuring parents that the vaccine is \u201csafe and effective\u201d and citing multiple studies that disprove claims of an autism link. The second message, dubbed \u201cDisease risks,\u201d simply listed the many risks of contracting the measles, the mumps, or rubella, describing the nasty complications that can come with these diseases. The third message, dubbed \u201cDisease narrative,\u201d told a \u201ctrue story\u201d about a 10-month-old whose temperature shot up to a terrifying 106 degrees after he contracted measles from another child in a pediatrician\u2019s waiting room. All three of these messages are closely based on messages (here, here, and here) that appear on the CDC website. And then there was a final message that was not directly based on CDC communications, dubbed \u201cDisease images.\u201d In this case, as a way of emphasizing the importance of vaccines, test subjects were asked to examine three fairly disturbing images of children afflicted with measles, mumps, and rubella. The results showed that by far, the least successful messages were \u201cDisease narrative\u201d and \u201cDisease images.\u201d Hearing the frightening narrative actually increased respondents\u2019 likelihood of thinking that getting the MMR vaccine will cause serious side effects, from 7.7 percent to 13.8 percent. Similarly, looking at the disturbing images increased test subjects\u2019 belief that vaccines cause autism. In other words, both of these messages backfired.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why is it so hard to change a skeptic's mind?", "title": "Study: Trying to convince parents to vaccinate their kids just makes the problem worse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why is it so hard to change a skeptic's mind?", "title": "Study: Trying to convince parents to vaccinate their kids just makes the problem worse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/03/study_trying_to_convince_parents_to_vaccinate_their_kids_just_makes_the_problem_worse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/jenny_mccarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why is it so hard to change a skeptic's mind?", "title": "Study: Trying to convince parents to vaccinate their kids just makes the problem worse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/jenny_mccarthy.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-vaccine, climate skeptics, measles, public health, vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab64\"", "article_summary": "The second message, dubbed \u201cDisease risks,\u201d simply listed the many risks of contracting the measles, the mumps, or rubella, describing the nasty complications that can come with these diseases.\nSimilarly, looking at the disturbing images increased test subjects\u2019 belief that vaccines cause autism.\nAll three of these messages are closely based on messages (here, here, and here) that appear on the CDC website.\nThe third message, dubbed \u201cDisease narrative,\u201d told a \u201ctrue story\u201d about a 10-month-old whose temperature shot up to a terrifying 106 degrees after he contracted measles from another child in a pediatrician\u2019s waiting room.\nAccording to a disconcerting new study in Pediatrics, it may be more complicated than that."}
