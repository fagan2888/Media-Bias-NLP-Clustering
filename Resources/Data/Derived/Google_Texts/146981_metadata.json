Dianne Totten, Panconi's 70-year-old grandmother, who helped Rutgers University nab President Barack Obama as its commencement speaker says she hasn't stopped smiling about that special day. (Photo: Mel Evans/AP)\n\nAh, the \u201cgood old days,\u201d the ones that President Obama took a sarcastic swipe at during his recent commencement speech at Rutgers University when he said that America\u2019s \u201cgood old days weren\u2019t that great.\u201d\n\nCertainly he misread his teleprompter.\n\nSure, we\u2019ve experienced enormous advances in things like technology and medicine, but the \u201cgood old days\u201d aren\u2019t so bad, especially compared to what\u2019s happening today.\n\nDuring the speech Obama said, \u201c \u2026 by almost every measure, America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even eight years ago.\u201d\n\nApparently, Hillary Clinton missed the email.\n\nMaybe she accidentally deleted it when she wiped her personal server clean. Before the Kentucky primary, Hillary ran around the state telling voters she wanted to take America back to the good old days when philandering Bill was in the White House. She promised Energizer Bunny Bill would come out of retirement to revitalize Obama\u2019s impotent economy.\n\nThe economy\u2019s not the only issue on the brink.\n\nValues matter, right? Certainly high schools back in the \u201cgood old days\u201d didn\u2019t allow plays to be performed depicting female-on-female and male-on-male rape like the play recently performed at Houston\u2019s Carnegie Vanguard High School.\n\nHow about healthcare? Post-Obamacare, millions of Americans remain uninsured, premiums are higher and people can\u2019t keep their doctors as promised. Americans hate it.\n\nWhat about the racial tension that\u2019s escalated over the last eight years? And the increased terrorist attacks on our homeland and the birth of ISIS? How about the ever-expanding debt and the contracting job market?\n\nObviously, perspective effects our worldview.\n\nSusan Stamper Brown (Photo: Cagle Cartoon Syndicate)\n\nObama and a large number of his advisors spent a good portion of their lives abroad. Both Obama and his senior advisor, Valerie Jarrett, say their years living in Indonesia and Iran, respectively, helped shaped their worldviews. It\u2019s hard to be truly objective about a particular time in history unless we were there to experience it. That\u2019s the downside of nostalgia. And that\u2019s also the downside of President Obama\u2019s obviously skewed worldview which inspires him to believe America\u2019s \u201cgood old days weren\u2019t that great.\u201d\n\nAn awful lot of Americans disagree with him. According to a recent Real Clear Politics poll, 66 percent of those surveyed say they believe America\u2019s going in the wrong direction. A spirit of discouragement and cynicism has overwhelmingly saturated our society like a wet blanket on a cold winter\u2019s night. That\u2019s not progress.\n\n\u201cBut I guess,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cit\u2019s part of human nature, especially in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked, and the economy hummed, and all politicians were wise, and every kid was well-mannered, and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a shame Mr. Obama believes Americans are so shallow.\n\nThere was a time, however, and it is in no way \u201cimaginary,\u201d when America\u2019s economy did \u201chum,\u201d politicians had a conscience, families worshiped and prayed together, kids had moms and dads, children understood the meaning of respect, the Constitution was revered, people knew which bathroom to use, America was a superpower, and ISIS did not exist.\n\nBy no measure is America better today than eight years ago. Someone much wiser than our president, the prophet Jeremiah, had this to say about the good old days: \u201cThis is what the Lord says: \u2018Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Jeremiah, good ways and ancient paths lead us to the \u201cgood old days.\u201d We need to go back to move forward. Now that\u2019s the kind of positive change we can and should believe in.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Susan Stamper Brown\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/opinion/2016/05/24/going-back-move-forward/84799830/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ah, the \u201cgood old days,\u201d the ones that President Obama took a sarcastic swipe at during his recent commencement speech at Rutgers University when he said that America\u2019s \u201cgood old days weren\u2019t that great.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Baxter Bulletin", "description": "Ah, the \u201cgood old days,\u201d the ones that President Obama took a sarcastic swipe at during his recent commencement speech at Rutgers University when he said that America\u2019s \u201cgood old days weren\u2019t that great.\u201d", "title": "Going back to move forward", "url": "http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/opinion/2016/05/24/going-back-move-forward/84799830/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/baxterbulletin.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ah, the \u201cgood old days,\u201d the ones that President Obama took a sarcastic swipe at during his recent commencement speech at Rutgers University when he said that America\u2019s \u201cgood old days weren\u2019t that great.\u201d", "creator": "@BBNewsroom", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ce8d1bb1b5bf7fd70ebb24ae8970315204715c8/c=162-0-2207-2045&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/23/MountainHome/MountainHome/635996115138839173-Obama-Rutgers-Rios.jpg", "title": "Going back to move forward", "site": "@BBNewsroom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=875264530", "fb": {"app_id": 183082181717378}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Sure, we\u2019ve experienced enormous advances in things like technology and medicine, but the \u201cgood old days\u201d aren\u2019t so bad, especially compared to what\u2019s happening today.\nAccording to a recent Real Clear Politics poll, 66 percent of those surveyed say they believe America\u2019s going in the wrong direction.\nCertainly high schools back in the \u201cgood old days\u201d didn\u2019t allow plays to be performed depicting female-on-female and male-on-male rape like the play recently performed at Houston\u2019s Carnegie Vanguard High School.\nBefore the Kentucky primary, Hillary ran around the state telling voters she wanted to take America back to the good old days when philandering Bill was in the White House.\n(Photo: Mel Evans/AP)Ah, the \u201cgood old days,\u201d the ones that President Obama took a sarcastic swipe at during his recent commencement speech at Rutgers University when he said that America\u2019s \u201cgood old days weren\u2019t that great.\u201dCertainly he misread his teleprompter."}
