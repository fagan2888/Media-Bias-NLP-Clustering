We did a little digging into those results and found that some of the state's highest test scores are at Brandon Valley. Students there also score the highest on ACT tests when compared to other public school students.\n\nYou can't tell it just by looking at them, but there's something special about students at Brandon Valley High School. Senior Ethan Brown is among the brightest of the bright, scoring a 35 on his ACT, one point shy of perfection.\n\n\"Brandon is a great school, and I feel like the teachers here really prepared me to take those tests,\" Brown said.\n\nSo what\u2019s the secret here?\n\n\"The secret, if there is one is having great people on staff, working with great students, great families in a very supportive community,\" David Pappone, Brandon Valley School District Superintendent, said.\n\nJustin Lovrien teaches Biology and the ACT review course at Brandon Valley. He says it feels good to see his students excel.\n\n\"Of course, the kids realize that our ultimate goal is to get them ready for the next step, so a high ACT is just one of those things where absolutely everyone's winning,\" Lovrien said.\n\nThe average ACT score at Brandon Valley High School is a 24.5. That means a lot more students are ready for college.\n\nSchool officials haven't made any major changes to lessons plans or the way they teach.\n\nHigh test scores are nothing new to the district. School officials say Brandon Valley students have always performed exceptionally well.\n\n\"As a district, half of our schools finish in the top ten-percent on the school performance index report card,\" Pappone said.\n\nBrandon Valley District also has one of the highest graduate rates. 97 percent of students graduate from high school in four years.\n\nAs for the next test, the students and staff here are already putting in the work needed to get equally high scores next year.\n\nHigh School {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\n\nChanges were made to clarify the scores are high compared to other public schools.\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
