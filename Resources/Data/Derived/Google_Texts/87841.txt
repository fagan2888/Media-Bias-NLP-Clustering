Greenville musician Benton Blount has made it to the finale of “America’s Got Talent,” and he’s hoping his fans will help get his family to New York to see him perform.

Blount posted, “Almost a year ago I auditioned for AGT, and here I am in the Final 10 at Radio City Music Hall.

“Travel expenses have been tough, but as always, I have to have my family there for this special moment in my life,” he said. “This particular weekend before the show is abnormally expensive (probably due to 9/11) so once again, I'm reaching out to the team for help!”

There is a tilt.com page set up to help Blount cover the costs of flying his family to New York City and to cover the cost of food while they are there. As of 5 p.m. Friday, nearly $1,000 had been raised.

Blount said, “I'm not in any way looking to profit more off of this than for the purpose (of having my family there). You all have been so supportive from day one of this journey and I absolutely believe that I have the best fans in the world!

“I completely understand if you can't help this way, but you can help even more by VOTING on September 15th! Love you guys – Benton”

Blount, who is expecting his second child with his wife, Ashley, is a stay-at-home dad to his 2-year-old son Jaxson, who is in the process of building his own fan base.

Blount's fans are the ones who put him into the final 10. He ended up in the “Dunkin’ Save” group of the three acts with the lowest percentage of votes, along with Samantha Johns and the Craig Lewis Band.

After a tense hour of waiting for votes to be tabulated, the fan vote kept Blount in the running for the $1 million prize and a headline gig at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.

On his Facebook page, Blount thanked his fans. He said, “I'm almost glad I was in the Dunkin’ Save so people can see what kind of TEAM you are!”
