But health system officials expect the changes to pay off in time.\n\nThis year, Catholic Health Initiatives is set to reduce its workforce of 90,500 by 1.7 percent, mostly in administrative and support services, across its 19 states of operations \u2014 amid some hefty losses incurred in the expansion that will see the nonprofit company vying against dozens of regional health systems, for-profit hospitals and also insurance companies.\n\nTo counter that, nonprofit will offer 54 million Americans living in its footprint a higher standard of quality care and new insurance options, relying on the creation of clinically integrated networks that enables it to share services and treat its patients across a broad spectrum of care.\n\nFinancing those plans, however, are going to be a challenge.\n\nBefore the new year, S&P downgraded CHI\u2019s ratings from A+ to A, after a $134 million loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. That\u2019s after CHI lost $641 million for the full year of fiscal 2014, according to S&P\u2019s calculations. Another ratings agency, Fitch, has kept CHI\u2019s A+ rating, but with a negative outlook.\n\n[Also: S&P outlook weak for nonprofits]\n\nAnd though CHI has posted revenue higher revenue \u2014 jumping from less than $10 billion in 2012 to $14 billion today \u2014 it\u2019s debt has also swelled from $6 billion in 2012 to $8.4 billion in 2014.\n\nFollowing the S&P report, CHI posted its own notice of 48 outstanding bond issues, with $674.6 million of it from local and state agencies in Kentucky, where a number of high costs, such as IT spending and charity care, were blamed for the losses.\n\nCatholic Health Initiatives was founded in 1996 by Catholic hospital ministries in Kentucky, Nebraska, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and its business has grown ever since \u2014 especially since the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\nLed by Kevin Lofton, CEO since 2003, CHI is headquartered in Colorado, and has an $22 billion in assets comprised of 105 hospitals, 30 critical access facilities, community clinics, nursing colleagues, home health services and a budding insurance portfolio. In the last three years, CHI has made more than 10 acquisitions in Kentucky, Nebraska, Ohio and Texas, including the $1.2 billion purchase of the six-hospital St. Luke's Health System in Houston and two different health plans.\n\nCHI\u2019s 2020 vision statement calls for the health system to improve patient care while also moving beyond its focus on the hospital.\n\nThe system is striving for a \u201cPerfect Care\u201d composite score of 95 percent or higher, aiming for no serious events, and a high-performing, happy workforce. More importantly, it hopes to generate 65 percent of revenue from services other than inpatient care.\n\nCurrently, CHI earns about 55 percent of its revenue from outpatient and physician services, with 45 percent still dependent on inpatient services. The largest share of its payer reimbursement, 41 percent, is from patients in managed care plans, followed by Medicare at 32 percent, Medicaid at 9 percent and commercial insurance at just 6 percent.\n\nThat payer mix may change in CHI\u2019s favor, however, if its venture into insurance succeeds.\n\nLast summer CHI renamed its Collab Health insurance subsidiary Prominence Health, led by Juan Serrano, a former UnitedHealthcare and WellCare executive. Built from a Washington-state Medicare plan and Arkansas-based HMO CHI acquired in 2013 and 2014, Prominence Health will focus on population health, utilizing value-based reimbursement.\n\nAlready selling Medicare Advantage plans in Kentucky, Nebraska, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington, this year, CHI is set to offer commercial plans in five states \u2014 and then in 18 states in 2016.\n\n\u201cProminence Health will significantly advance CHI\u2019s ability to excel in a pay-for-value environment,\u201d Serrano, CHI\u2019S senior vice president of payer strategy and operations, said in a statement. \u201cThrough Prominence, CHI has developed a catalyst to position us as a broadly integrated health system that enables exceptional health services and superior value for the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nAnother prong of CHI\u2019s long-term strategy is standardization of technology, quality metrics and clinical practices across its many hospitals, including four academic medical centers, nursing homes and other facilities, in part through OneCare, its system-wide EHR project that\u2019s expected to cost $2 billion through 2017.\n\n\"We have a history of being autonomous, unique hospitals, and over time it has become more important to be less autonomous and more prescriptive from the national perspective,\" said Ann Shepard, CHI's chief nursing informatics officer and a former critical care nurse at one of CHI's founding Sisters of Mercy hospitals, in an interview last year. \"We're trying to decrease variability.\"\n\nChart: CHI payer and revenue mix as of September 2014\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/catholic-health-initiatives-feels-pinch-expensive-integration-strategy", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/CHI-feature_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Health system will cut its workforce of 90,500 by 1.7 percent amid some hefty losses incurred in the expansion.", "title": "Catholic Health Initiatives feels pinch of expensive integration strategy"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/CHI-feature_0.gif"}, "title": "Catholic Health Initiatives feels pinch of expensive integration strategy", "description": "Health system will cut its workforce of 90,500 by 1.7 percent amid some hefty losses incurred in the expansion.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "The nation\u2019s third largest faith-based health system is struggling financially following its big bet on clinical and insurance integration.
