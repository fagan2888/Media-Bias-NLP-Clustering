In taking this position, the individual taking on the devil\u2019s advocate role seeks to engage others in an argumentative discussion process.\u201d This definition of a Devil\u2019s advocate seems to describe Mr. Doherty perfectly. It\u2019s hard to \u201cbring it on,\u201d to a Devil\u2019s Advocate such as Mr. Doherty, or half-truth tellers such as Obama.\n\nI enjoy reading the Letters to the Editor, and can usually pick out the letters that Mr. Doherty will respond too, and what his response will be. If someone writes positive for the Democrats, then Doherty is Republican. If someone writes favoring Republicans, Doherty then favors Democrats. If their letter favors the left, then he favors the right. Someone writes joking about climate change, and then Doherty will say it\u2019s freezing the Devil\u2019s campfire, or no snow for the winter Olympics.\n\nLast year Doherty stated that voter were not educated enough to vote on important issues, and then the following editorial on June 4th, he writes, \u201cLess than 8 percent of citizens went to the polls and most took this responsibility seriously. They did their homework and entered the polling station knowing who they believe would best represent their views. These are my neighbors and they are knowledgeable, conscientious and care about the community.\u201d\n\nSomeone writes about the Affordable Care Act and says that it should be called the UN-Affordable Care Act, and then Doherty can quote the page numbers and paragraphs having read the whole document, page by page to memory.\n\nI like to believe I\u2019m a little like Will Rogers when he stated that he never met a man that he didn\u2019t like. Some men/women are just a little harder to understand than others. I do respect everyone opinions, and even Mr. Doherty\u2019s both sides of the fence \u201cbring it on\u201d opinions.\n\nHarvey Yaw\n\nMontgomery", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourconroenews.com", "description": "To the dditor:", "title": "Sitting on both sides of the fence", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/opinion/sitting-on-both-sides-of-the-fence/article_2fcc4480-e495-57ef-9db4-fe7111e6c21b.html", "image": "undefined", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "To the dditor:", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "opinion", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "opinion"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s hard to \u201cbring it on,\u201d to a Devil\u2019s Advocate such as Mr. Doherty, or half-truth tellers such as Obama.\nI do respect everyone opinions, and even Mr. Doherty\u2019s both sides of the fence \u201cbring it on\u201d opinions.\nI enjoy reading the Letters to the Editor, and can usually pick out the letters that Mr. Doherty will respond too, and what his response will be.\nIn taking this position, the individual taking on the devil\u2019s advocate role seeks to engage others in an argumentative discussion process.\u201d This definition of a Devil\u2019s advocate seems to describe Mr. Doherty perfectly.\nIf someone writes favoring Republicans, Doherty then favors Democrats."}
