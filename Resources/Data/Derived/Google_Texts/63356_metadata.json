The North, whose lone major ally is neighbor China, routinely threatens to destroy South Korea and its major ally, the United States.\n\nThe North Korean threat was why \"we have started formal consultations about the possibility of deploying the THAAD system on the peninsula\", Kim said.\n\n\"It's a completely defensive system. There is no need for China or Russia to be concerned about this system.\"\n\nNorth Korea has vowed to conduct further nuclear tests, despite stepped up international sanctions.\n\nSatellite images show that North Korea may have resumed tunnel excavation at its main nuclear test site, similar to activity seen before the January test, a U.S. North Korea monitoring website reported on Wednesday.\n\nKim said he had no definitive information a fifth test was coming, and that he was not sure China knew either.\n\nChina is North Korea's most important economic and diplomatic backer, but has been infuriated by North Korea's nuclear and missile tests and has signed on for tough U.N. sanctions.\n\nThe effectiveness of current or any new sanctions depends heavily on them being fully implemented by China, U.S. officials and analysts say.\n\nKim said China had taken \"a number of steps toward implementation\" of the latest sanctions resolution.\n\n\"I hope and I expect that China would take its responsibility very seriously and actually implement all provisions of this unprecedented resolution,\" he added.\n\nChina says it has a right to develop what it calls \"normal relations\" with North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea became China's second-biggest coal supplier in March, with deliveries up 80.6 percent from a year ago to 2.35 million tonnes, data from China's customs authority showed on Thursday.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce announced at the beginning of April that it would ban North Korean coal imports to comply with new U.N. sanctions. But it would make exceptions for coal delivered via North Korea's Rason port from third countries, and for exports intended for \"the people's well-being\" and not connected to nuclear or missile programs.\n\n(Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has no need to be worried about U.S.", "title": "U.S. says China needn't fear missile defense for South Korea", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/US-says-North-Korea-has-shown-no-interest-diplomacy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-nuclear-kim_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/US-says-North-Korea-has-shown-no-interest-diplomacy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-nuclear-kim_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has no need to be worried about U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"And we, together with South Korea, have decided that we should take appropriate defensive measures to protect ourselves against this missile threat from North Korea.\"\n\"The fact is that North Korea presents a very serious missile threat to the Korean peninsula,\" Sung Kim, the U.S. special envoy for North Korea, told reporters.\nNorth and South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, rather than a treaty.\nThe North, whose lone major ally is neighbor China, routinely threatens to destroy South Korea and its major ally, the United States.\nSatellite images show that North Korea may have resumed tunnel excavation at its main nuclear test site, similar to activity seen before the January test, a U.S. North Korea monitoring website reported on Wednesday."}
