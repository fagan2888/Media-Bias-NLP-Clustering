A woman accused of burning her son-in-law's body says she didn't kill him but did help cover up his death to protect her grandchildren.

Lydia Martinez is charged with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Manuel Vasquez. Prosecutors say his body was burned in a container in June and his ashes were spread around his yard in New Hope.

Martinez spoke with WCBI-TV on Wednesday, hours after being released on bond from the Lowndes County jail.

She says she will be staying with her sister in Colorado until her trial. She and her daughter, Christina Martinez Vasquez, are scheduled for trial in February.

Vasquez is charged with murder and with domestic violence aggravated assault against her mother, whom she allegedly tried to poison with antifreeze.
