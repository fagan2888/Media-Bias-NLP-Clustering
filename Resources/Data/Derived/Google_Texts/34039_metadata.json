But to have an ideas contest, you have to actually have some ideas.\n\nPaul Ryan seemed completely unaware of this fact as he sat down to talk to The Blaze. The Speaker\u2019s office reported that,\n\nRyan was not shy about acknowledging the GOP\u2019s divided state in his conversation with The Blaze, but stressed the solution would be born out of policy \u2014 not personality. Asked, for instance, whether he thought former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal history was \u201cfair game\u201d in the 2016 election, as Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has said, the speaker responded that he doesn\u2019t \u201ceven think of that stuff.\u201d \u201cAll I care about is making this an ideas contest,\u201d he said.\n\nDo you remember the last time Republicans had an idea beyond saying \u2018no\u2019 to Obama?\n\nDemocrats say, \u201cLet\u2019s fix the environment.\u201d Republicans say, \u201cNah, leave it like it is.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say, \u201cLet\u2019s fix Wall Street.\u201d Republicans say, \u201cNah, leave it like it is.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say, \u201cLet\u2019s fix gun laws and protect people.\u201d Republicans say, \u201cNah, leave it like it is.\u201d\n\nSaying \u2018no\u2019 is not an idea. Never has been. Never will be.\n\nYet Ryan explained that he was \u201cconsumed\u201d with thinking about how to present policy proposals to the public, aimed at tackling issues ranging from the economy and national security.\n\n\u201cAll those other personal things I could care less about. To me, if we make this a personality contest, we lose. If we make it an ideas contest, we win. That\u2019s just the way I see it.\u201d\n\nWell, at least Ryan is not falling into that trap of Rand Paul\u2019s, where the solution to all Republican problems is being more likable or wear jeans while you screw people. But ideas? Don\u2019t make us laugh. What he claims are ideas have already been annihilated by Robert Reich.\n\nWhat kind of sense does all this ranting about a weak economy make when unemployment under Obama is lower than at any time under Reagan? If Reagan is the Republican ideal, Ryan and his fellow Republicans ought to be rallying around the president rather than attacking him.\n\nBut reality, facts, plans and principles mean nothing to the GOP.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that Chris Wallace hammered Ted Cruz on his lie about job growth and Obamacare but Paul Ryan and the rest of the GOP are saying the same thing. So is Wallace\u2019s own network.\n\nThe entire conservative apparatus seems to be operating somewhere in the La-La Land Zone, with Ryan\u2019s office telling us that when \u201cPressed as to whether a largely angry Republican base is more interested in personality than policy, Ryan gave a blunt response\u201d:\n\n\u201cAnger is not a plan. Anger is not a principle. Anger is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI think as leaders it is our obligation to challenge this energy into a constructive use so we can get a mandate to fix the country\u2019s big problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo yes, policies do not sell as well. They don\u2019t get as much clicks and they don\u2019t get as much news. That shouldn\u2019t deter us. That should just motivate us to work harder. To have a serious and sober conversation with our citizens.\u201d\n\nWork harder. Oh that rough schedule of an average of 28 hours a week must be a killer, most of it spent trying to defund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood, and coming up with solutions for problems that don\u2019t exist.\n\nRyan wants you to think he\u2019s working hard to give you a \u201cbold, pro-growth\u201d agenda but like Boehner, his entire agenda amounts to saying \u2018no\u2019 every time Obama says \u2018yes.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnger is not a plan,\u201d said the Speaker of the Republican Party, which has made it\u2019s whole platform and agenda about hate and fear. So apparently when he says he wants to make this an \u201cideas contest\u201d the ideas he is talking about are more hate and fear.\n\nWell, it has the virtue of consistency, at least.\n\nConsistent also is the desire to blame President Obama for the GOP\u2019s problems, Ryan telling The Blaze that yes, GOP leaders \u201cdrifted from our principles some time ago\u201d but, he insisted,\n\n\u201cI think you combine that with the fact that you have a dedicated, dogmatic progressive president who got reelected and who is taking the country a direction we don\u2019t like, who is untethering us from the Constitution \u2014 that makes for a very combustible mixture. It makes for a very anxious time.\u201d\n\nObama didn\u2019t make the GOP crazy. They built that on their own. It isn\u2019t just Ryan, of course. His plan to replace Obamacare is no better than Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out.\u201d\n\nBut this is not just a simple matter of a Republican rejection of reality and the substitution of their own fantasies. As Noam Chomsky told Huffington Post, their refusal to face the facts about climate change and other issues make the GOP a \u201cserious danger to human survival.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s a big deal when Ryan says he wants to make this about ideas, because not only has he no ideas, but his complete lack of ideas, and his appeal to false premises every time he tries to make an argument, doom all of us to destruction.\n\nHe says anger is not a plan, and he is at least right about that. It\u2019s a shame then that behind all the fantasy bluster that anger is all he has.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan says, \u201cIf we make it an ideas contest, we win.\u201d But to have an ideas contest, you have to actually have some ideas.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Ryan says, \u201cIf we make it an ideas contest, we win.\u201d But to have an ideas contest, you have to actually have some ideas.", "title": "Paul Ryan Claims \u201cIf we make it an ideas contest, we win.\u201d", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/01/paul-ryan-claims-if-ideas-contest-win.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/paul-ryan.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T07:57:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,U.S. House of Representatives,Donald Trump,Noam Chomsky,paul ryan,Republican Party,Ted Cruz,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "U.S. House of Representatives", "published_time": "2016-02-01T07:57:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T07:57:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Noam Chomsky, paul ryan, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, U.S. House of Representatives"}, "article_summary": "So apparently when he says he wants to make this an \u201cideas contest\u201d the ideas he is talking about are more hate and fear.\nDemocrats say, \u201cLet\u2019s fix the environment.\u201d Republicans say, \u201cNah, leave it like it is.\u201dDemocrats say, \u201cLet\u2019s fix Wall Street.\u201d Republicans say, \u201cNah, leave it like it is.\u201dDemocrats say, \u201cLet\u2019s fix gun laws and protect people.\u201d Republicans say, \u201cNah, leave it like it is.\u201dSaying \u2018no\u2019 is not an idea.\nBut to have an ideas contest, you have to actually have some ideas.\nIf we make it an ideas contest, we win.\nIt follows logically that if Republicans have abandoned reality and facts that the next logical step is to pretend, \u201cIf we make it an ideas contest, we win.\u201d Right."}
