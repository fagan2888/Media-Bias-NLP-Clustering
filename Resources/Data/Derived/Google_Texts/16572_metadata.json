People needing insurance who are earning 400 percent above the poverty level will get access to plans that will be subsidized at various levels. There will also be non-subsidized plans available for those without insurance or above the income threshold.\n\nHowever, the only company offering subsidized plans through the exchange, Anthem, has made side agreements with a little more than half the state\u2019s hospitals, limiting coverage to thousands of potential new customers. Hospitals that have not signed onto the agreement will not be able to accept Anthem for coverage and those patients won\u2019t be able to see doctors outside of the new network in 2014.\n\nHospitals that will not be covered by Anthem exchange plans include Concord Hospital, HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Concord, New Hampshire Hospital in Concord, Northeast Rehabilitation Hospital in Salem, Parkland Medical Center in Derry, Portsmouth Regional Hospital in Portsmouth, and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua, as well as others.\n\nPaula Rogers, the director of government affairs for Anthem, confirmed that the company had made contract agreements with 14 of the state\u2019s 26 hospitals in an effort to contain costs while ensuring that hospitals in the agreement had \u201csome expectation of increased volume\u201d in the wake of those hospitals agreeing to lower prices for Anthem. She said many policyholders would be grandfathered in for a short period of time. As well, exceptions would be made for emergency situations, or current care situations, like a woman who is pregnant who switches providers between now and then. Rogers added that she was expecting \u201csome consumer pushback\u201d after the details of the plans are approved by the federal government in the coming weeks. The plan won\u2019t also be put into place until January 2014, she said.\n\nThe state had already approved of the plans, according to Jennifer Patterson of the New Hampshire Insurance Department, but she said she wasn\u2019t at liberty to discuss the details until October, calling the information \u201cproprietary.\u201d She added that she could only acknowledge that Anthem was a participate because it had become \"common knowledge,\" but other information was not.\n\nRepublicans on the committee were critical of the news, with state Sen. Andy Sanborn, R-Bedford, saying it proved that the president lied when he said that ObamaCare would allow people to keep their own doctors or hospital. He questioned the legitimacy of not being able to talk about the specifics when hospital officials in his district were calling to complain about the network limitations.\n\n\u201cThere are hospitals no longer in the network \u2026 insurance brokers that are concerned \u2026 define to me what is common knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s 24 days out \u2026 we have an obligation to talk about this.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, said it seemed to go against the commitment that the federal plan wouldn\u2019t ration care, calling the plan \u201ccontroversial and confusing\u201d especially in the wake of higher premiums and \u201celimination of choice.\u201d\n\nHowever, state Rep. Ed Butler, D-Hart\u2019s Location, countered that the plan was being put in place to control costs and not to have 15 to 20 percent increases.\n\n\u201cIn order to do that, you need this network of hospitals (and) you will guarantee them increased volume of consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn return, they will control their costs.\u201d\n\nDetails about potential plans, plan management, and costs of premiums, copays, coinsurance, and deductibles for Anthem or other potential carriers are not yet known at this time. However, the rates and information is expected to be available in October.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Concord, NH Patch", "description": "Purchasers of subsidized Anthem plans via the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t be allowed to see doctors at Concord Hospital.", "title": "Limited Health Care Options Coming to Some", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/546351/2013/09/T800x600/8ee28d0325f7f7ef03e5ae8d9d32b685.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/new-hampshire/concord-nh/limited-health-care-options-coming-to-some", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2013-09-04T17:21:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T21:04:58-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Concord, NH - Purchasers of subsidized Anthem plans via the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t be allowed to see doctors at Concord Hospital.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca396\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere are hospitals no longer in the network \u2026 insurance brokers that are concerned \u2026 define to me what is common knowledge,\u201d he said.\nThe Health Care Reform Oversight Committee on Sept. 4, featured testimony by a New Hampshire Insurance Department official and officials from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, about the upcoming changes in health insurance coverage for many people currently without coverage.\n\u201cIn order to do that, you need this network of hospitals (and) you will guarantee them increased volume of consumers,\u201d he said.\nUnder the ACA, Americans without insurance will be forced to purchase a plan or be subject to fines.\nRogers added that she was expecting \u201csome consumer pushback\u201d after the details of the plans are approved by the federal government in the coming weeks."}
