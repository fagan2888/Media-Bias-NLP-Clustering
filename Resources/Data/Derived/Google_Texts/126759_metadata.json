In our case, it\u2019s pretty much the opposite,\u201d SDGroup CEO Doug Galbraith told Watchdog.org. \u201cIf people are talking about tightening up the rules about how you litigate those situations, what\u2019s the alternative for a company like ours?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s inconvenient for a big company to get sued for patent infringement, but it\u2019s much more inconvenient for a small company to have their intellectual property taken after they\u2019ve gone through all the work of developing it and creating it,\u201d Galbraith said.\n\nFrom Galbraith\u2019s perspective, sweeping changes to favor defendants in patent infringement cases could have the unintended consequence of making it harder for small companies to protect their intellectual property.\n\n\u201cMaybe the solution is to move things along quickly enough that you get the cases that have no merit out of the way, so the people defending don\u2019t have to spend a huge amount of money if it is frivolous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat the larger tech companies are proposing and pushing for is veiled behind the attack against what are known as patent trolls,\u201d Bob Rauker, a patent attorney representing companies like SDGroup and other inventors, told Watchdog.org.\n\nBut Rauker said it\u2019s inaccurate to paint all non-practicing entities \u2014 businesses that hold patents for technology they aren\u2019t currently licensing or developing \u2014 as trolls, although some are bad actors \u201ctrying to extort money from somebody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deck is starting to get stacked against smaller companies,\u201d Rauker said. He suggested instead of putting more hurdles in front of inventors filing patent complaints, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office should set clear standards and grant sound patents, and judges should be relied upon to decide when a plaintiff is acting in bad faith.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a patent on something and the Patent Office issued it and you did everything you\u2019re supposed to do, disclosing what you were required to disclose and following the proper processes \u2013 if they did a bad job, why are you suddenly not a legitimate patent holder?\u201d\n\nThe two major pieces of legislation on Capitol Hill, the PATENT Act and the Innovation Act, are being sold by their sponsors as a way to crack down on frivolous patent complaints. But weakening patent protection would not help small inventors like SDGroup \u2014 the company recently filed a complaint against a larger competitor alleging patent infringement \u2014 if it made defending their intellectual property more difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the Post Office losing your mail and saying, \u2018Well you should have used UPS or FedEx,'\u201d Rauker said.\n\nConsistency from USPTO will \u201cmake life a lot easier for everybody, so that you have something to start with,\u201d he explained, \u201cand the court system shouldn\u2019t be afraid to penalize both sides for bad behavior.\u201d\n\nWith regard to software patents, in particular, Rauker said USTPO and Congress should focus on providing better definitions of what can and cannot be patented instead of \u201cusing a sledgehammer to kill a fly\u201d by dramatically changing the infringement complaint process.\n\nAt least several members of Congress are sympathetic to small inventors\u2019 position. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, has voiced concern about the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to stop patent trolls by making it more expensive to file patent infringement complaints.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blessed to have many great innovators,\u201d Ayotte said at a November 2013 hearing. \u201cHow do we make sure we\u2019re not harming legitimate innovators?\u201d\n\nRauker said the priorities of huge tech companies should be considered alongside input from businesses of varied sizes in varied industries, because issues surrounding intellectual property rights are not uniform across the economy.\n\nLike Galbraith, Rauker worries that stifling innovation from small businesses could be an unintended consequence of laws meant to stop patent trolls from stifling innovation at larger corporations.\n\nMaking it too expensive to protect intellectual property would reduce incentives for inventors to develop \u2014 and for investors to support \u2014 the sort of technologies the Googles of the world have acquired from small companies over the years, he warned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see less funding going to a lot of these things,\u201d Rauker concluded. \u201cI think people will still continue to invent, but I think it will slow that down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intellectual property law changes pursued in the name of fighting patent trolls could make it easier for large companies to steamroll small inventors.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Intellectual property law changes pursued in the name of fighting patent trolls could make it easier for large companies to steamroll small inventors.", "title": "Patent law changes could stack the deck for big business - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/stockvault-invention-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-18T11:34:17+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/259774/patent-law-changes-stack-deck-big-business/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Intellectual property law changes pursued in the name of fighting patent trolls could make it easier for large companies to steamroll small inventors.", "title": "Patent law changes could stack the deck for big business - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/stockvault-invention-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Judiciary", "tag": "Innovation Act,PATENT Act,Separation Design Group,U.S. Patent and Trademark Office", "published_time": "2016-03-21T04:39:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T11:34:17+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "SDGroup, separation design group, patent trolls, patent reform, patent law, intellectual property, IP reform, IP law, patent rights"}, "article_summary": "Intellectual property law changes pursued in the name of fighting \u201cpatent trolls\u201d could make it easier for large companies to steamroll small inventors.\nSen.
