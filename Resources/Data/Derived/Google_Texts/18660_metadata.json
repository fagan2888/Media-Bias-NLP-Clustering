Influential politicians around the world have often put in time at American universities or \u201cWashington consensus\u201d-type multilateral institutions, but generally aren\u2019t eager to let this be known during election season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe most extreme example of this at the moment is Ashraf Ghani, one of two candidates contesting a runoff election for the Afghan presidency on June 14. Having earned a Ph.D. from Columbia, put in time at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins and the World Bank, co-founded a D.C.-based think tank, and co-written an influential policy book, Ghani is about as D.C. as it gets, a fixture of the Massachusetts Avenue think-tank circuit.\n\nBut in running for president, Ghani has not only traded in his Brooks Brothers for shalwar kameez, he now says his time in D.C. was all an act.\n\nThe Washington Post reports today:\n\n\u201cI learned English only so I could satisfy the foreigners and defend our national interests,\u201d Ghani told the sprawling Afghan meeting hall one recent afternoon. The crowd cheered.\n\nHe certainly had this foreigner fooled.\n\nGhani was painted as too American when he ran in 2009 and received only 2.9 percent of the vote. (Hiring James Carville to advise his campaign apparently didn\u2019t help.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "ghani", "sailthru.author": "Joshua Keating", "description": "The fate that befell House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday night may have been shocking, but it\u2019s also just an extreme example of an age-old pol ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The fate that befell House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday night may have been shocking, but it\u2019s also just an extreme example of an age-old pol ...", "title": "American Politicians Aren\u2019t the Only Ones Who Have to Worry About Seeming \u201cToo Washington\u201d", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry/481725687-afghan-presidential-candidate-ashraf-ghani-ahmadzai.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The fate that befell House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday night may have been shocking, but it\u2019s also just an extreme example of an age-old pol ...", "creator": "@joshuakeating", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry/481725687-afghan-presidential-candidate-ashraf-ghani-ahmadzai.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "American Politicians Aren\u2019t the Only Ones Who Have to Worry About Seeming \u201cToo Washington\u201d", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-11T18:11:24Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "American Politicians Aren\u2019t the Only Ones Who Have to Worry About Seeming \u201cToo Washington\u201d", "sailthru.headline": "Ashraf Ghani\u2019s Very American Political Problem", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"American Politicians Aren\\u2019t the Only Ones Who Have to Worry About Seeming \\u201cToo Washington\\u201d\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry/481725687-afghan-presidential-candidate-ashraf-ghani-ahmadzai.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"236140611002\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-11T18:11:24Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Joshua Keating\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"afghanistan\",\n    \"politics\",\n    \"international\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "American Politicians Aren\u2019t the Only Ones Who Have to Worry About Seeming \u201cToo Washington\u201d", "tw-line": "American Politicians Aren\u2019t the Only Ones Who Have to Worry About Seeming \u201cToo Washington\u201d", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "keywords": "ghani", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "The fate that befell House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday night may have been shocking, but it\u2019s also just an extreme example of an age-old pol ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2014/06/11/ashraf_ghani_american_politicians_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_have_to_worry/481725687-afghan-presidential-candidate-ashraf-ghani-ahmadzai.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca69e\"", "article_summary": "This isn\u2019t just an issue for American politicians.\nInfluential politicians around the world have often put in time at American universities or \u201cWashington consensus\u201d-type multilateral institutions, but generally aren\u2019t eager to let this be known during election season.\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\nGhani was painted as too American when he ran in 2009 and received only 2.9 percent of the vote.\nAdvertisementThe most extreme example of this at the moment is Ashraf Ghani, one of two candidates contesting a runoff election for the Afghan presidency on June 14."}
