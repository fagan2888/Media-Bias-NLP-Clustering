The point is to get you singing in church. \u201cI strive for trying to write something that people can sing, that people want to sing, and that people need to sing,\u201d Tomlin explained before the show. Tomlin is the undisputed king of worship music, a genre of Christian music sung on Sunday mornings all across the world and increasingly played on Christian radio stations. The music is simple, devotional and easy on the ears. \u201cWe would say that Chris is the most prolific songwriter in the United States now, in this past decade,\u201d said Howard Rachinski, CEO of Christian Copyright Licensing International, the company that tracks what music is used in churches around the world. In 2012, CCLI paid out $40 million to artists and musicians, and Tomlin got a healthy slice of that pie. Churches around the world used 128 songs he wrote or co-wrote last year, Rachinski said. CCLI estimates that every Sunday in the United States, between 60,000 and 120,000 churches are singing Tomlin\u2019s songs. By extrapolating that data, Rachinski says, \u201cour best guess would be in the United States on any given Sunday, 20 to 30 million people would be singing Chris Tomlin's songs.\u201d\n\nChris Tomlin's \"God's Great Dance Floor\" video from \"Burning Lights\" Deluxe Edition CD/DVD appears here courtesy of Capitol Christian music group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By the CNN Belief Blog Editors (CNN)-- One of the most popular artists on the planet, Chris Tomlin, is about to release a new music video, and CNN's Belief Blog has an exclusive first look.Next week Tomlin is releasing a deluxe CD/DVD edition of his chart-topping album \"Burning Lights.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "CNN exclusive: Chris Tomlin's new music video", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/20/exclusive-look-at-chris-tomlins-latest-music-video/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131018175344-cnn-exclusive-chris-tomlins-new-music-video-00015519-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By the CNN Belief Blog Editors (CNN)-- One of the most popular artists on the planet, Chris Tomlin, is about to release a new music video, and CNN's Belief Blog has an exclusive first look.Next week Tomlin is releasing a deluxe CD/DVD edition of his chart-topping album \"Burning Lights.", "title": "CNN exclusive: Chris Tomlin's new music video"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, christianity, music,", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/20/exclusive-look-at-chris-tomlins-latest-music-video/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36e3\"", "article_summary": "By the CNN Belief Blog EditorsFollow @CNNBelief(CNN)\u2013 One of the most popular artists on the planet, Chris Tomlin, is about to release a new music video, and CNN's Belief Blog has an exclusive first look.\nCNN Belief \u2013 Chris Tomlin, king of the sing-alongAs lively as (Tomlin's) shows are, the point is not to get you inside the doors.\nThe CNN Belief Blog is the only place you can see Tomlin's new video, \"God's Great Dance Floor,\" filmed live at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado.\nTomlin is the undisputed king of worship music, a genre of Christian music sung on Sunday mornings all across the world and increasingly played on Christian radio stations.\nCCLI estimates that every Sunday in the United States, between 60,000 and 120,000 churches are singing Tomlin\u2019s songs."}
