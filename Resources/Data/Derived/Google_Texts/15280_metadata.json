The act requires drug, medical device and biological companies to report payments and gifts they give to doctors and teaching hospitals.\n\nDesigned to bring greater transparency to the medical field, it is a response to concerns about relationships between physicians and pharmaceutical and medical device companies and was sponsored by Senators Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Herb Kohl (D-WI).\n\nUnder the requirements of the act, any drug or device manufacturer must report payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals or any doctors providing care in a teaching hospital. The reporting includes anything at least $10 in value.\n\nThe initial reporting under the act has begun already and you can review these payments on a federal website \u2013 http://cms.gov/openpayments/ .\n\nWhat\u2019s in the details\n\nCertainly, any possible impact on patient safety needs scrutiny. It is important to examine how these industry relationships could impact the way physicians treat their patients \u2013 potentially affecting choices for specific medical implants for example.\n\nHowever, the data that drove this legislation needs careful consideration as well.\n\nWhile research finds that more than 85 percent of physicians had some form of financial relationship or support from industry, it is important to recognize that more than two-thirds of these payments were for less than $100.\n\nGifts often include trivial things, such as a drug company representative purchasing a cup of coffee or a pen for a physician in order to highlight a certain drug or prescription agent.\n\nAt the same time, a few individual physicians may receive millions of dollars for intellectual property or ownership in a company. It\u2019s difficult to put all of these situations into one bucket when talking about the impact of industry relationships.\n\nA closer look at industry relationships\n\nIt is also important to recognize that just as a physician\u2019s industry relationships have the potential to affect patients negatively, they can also offer many benefits that ultimately are good for patients.\n\nThe more active a physician is, the more likely drug or device companies want and need their input to define clinical needs and explore ideas for studying drugs and devices. The relationship often indicates a physician\u2019s experience and clinical strength while helping improve the design and effectiveness of medical devices and drugs.\n\nAll physicians must manage the potential conflicts from these relationships. Also, leading institutions will have conflict of interest management strategies to assure physicians maintain the ability to care for their patients, remain engaged with industry and provide this care in such a way that assures they are choosing the best possible options for their patients.\n\nConflict of interest\n\nClearly there are some aspects of industry relationships hold the potential for conflict of interest and the public should be made aware.\n\nIn most instances, patients trust physicians to provide some information regarding their relationships, but sometimes, this information has not been provided. It\u2019s become evident that patients need clarity about the exact nature of relationships (including the amount being given).\n\nUltimately, identifying a physician to care for you depends upon your sense of confidence, and this is more a reflection of experience the physician has in dealing with your problem.\n\nIn many instances, this will be the same physician a pharmaceutical or medical device company will want to partner with to devise the next drug or device to deal with significant medical problems.\n\nHealth care organizations do well to maintain transparency and a strategy for conflict management. For example, Cleveland Clinic publishes physicians\u2019 industry relationships on its website.\n\nThe experience physicians acquire at this institution makes them frequent partners for industry and experts in their individual fields. Ultimately, this can lead to innovation and better, newer treatments for patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a health care consumer, there are important details that you should know about a well-intentioned but misguided piece of legislation -- the Physicians Payments Sunshine Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Essentials from Cleveland Clinic", "description": "As a health care consumer, there are important details that you should know about a well-intentioned but misguided piece of legislation -- the Physicians Payments Sunshine Act.", "title": "What New Legislation About Physician-Industry Relationships Means to You - Health Essentials from Cleveland Clinic", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 275, "identifier": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/01/sunshine-act-fi.jpg", "height": 225}, "updated_time": "2015-07-14T13:14:25-04:00", "url": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/2015/03/what-new-legislation-about-physician-industry-relationships-means-to-you/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/01/sunshine-act-fi.jpg", "description": "As a health care consumer, there are important details that you should know about a well-intentioned but misguided piece of legislation -- the Physicians Payments Sunshine Act.", "card": "summary", "title": "What New Legislation About Physician-Industry Relationships Means to You - Health Essentials from Cleveland Clinic"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-02T08:45:35-04:00", "article": {"section": "Health A-Z", "tag": "Physicians Payments sunshine act", "published_time": "2015-03-02T08:45:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T13:14:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "dr. clair, healthcare industry, heart, heart and vascular institute, industry relationships, medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies, physicians payments sunshine act, health, cleveland, cleveland clinic, health hub, health essentials"}, "article_summary": "For example, Cleveland Clinic publishes physicians\u2019 industry relationships on its website.\nIt\u2019s difficult to put all of these situations into one bucket when talking about the impact of industry relationships.\nConflict of interestClearly there are some aspects of industry relationships hold the potential for conflict of interest and the public should be made aware.\nThe act requires drug, medical device and biological companies to report payments and gifts they give to doctors and teaching hospitals.\nAs a health care consumer, there are important details that you should know about a well-intentioned but misguided piece of legislation \u2014 the Physicians Payments Sunshine Act."}
