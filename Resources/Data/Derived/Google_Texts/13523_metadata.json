She said the animal\u2019s being close to people and out during the day were cause for concern.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t relocate cougars (found) in town,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you see them, there something is wrong.\u201d\n\nCoverage of the cougar killing prompted a flurry of critical comments on The Bulletin Facebook page, as well as calls to the paper. Dennehy said Fish and Wildlife had also heard from critics about how the agency handled the cougar.\n\nWhile cougar sightings may cause a commotion, attacks by the animals are rare in Oregon. Fish and Wildlife has no fatal attacks by wild cougars on record.\n\nConcerns about public safety can prompt workers with the department or law enforcement officers to kill cougars.\n\nData from Fish and Wildlife show at least one cougar killed per year for safety reasons over the past four years in Deschutes County. Statewide an average of more than two dozen cougars were killed for safety reasons from 2004 to 2013, the most recent data available.\n\nIn the Bend killing, seven Bend Police officers, two Deschutes County sheriff\u2019s deputies and two Oregon State Police troopers, some of whom had guns drawn, responded, ready to shoot the animal if it came out of the tree. Fish and Wildlife had three workers respond .\n\nA Fish and Wildlife biologist shot the cougar with a tranquilizer dart and workers with the agency lowered the sedated animal using a rope. After taking the cougar away they killed it with a lethal injection.\n\nWildlife advocates argue this was the wrong solution.\n\n\u201cThey did not need to kill this animal,\u201d said Brooks Fahy, executive director and co-founder for Predator Defense, a Eugene-based national wildlife advocacy organization. He called the killing of the cougar \u201coutrageous\u201d and an \u201coverreaction\u201d by Fish and Wildlife.\n\n\u201cI just think it is a horrible tragedy,\u201d he said.\n\nRather than kill the cougar, Fahy said Fish and Wildlife workers should have taken the animal to nearby wildland and released it. The experience of being hit with a tranquilizer dart and hauled in a carrier could be enough to keep the cougar from coming back.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to come back anymore,\u201d he said. Fahy said relocating cougars has been successful in other places.\n\nIn other states around the West, such as Washington and California, the cougar would have been relocated and released, said Tim Dunbar, executive director for the Mountain Lion Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working elsewhere,\u201d he said. Based in Sacramento, California, the foundation is an education and advocacy group. Known as cougars in Oregon and Washington, big wildcats are known as mountain lions in California and elsewhere around the West.\n\nLike Fahy, he said he did not feel the cougar in Bend was a threat.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t looking to hurt anyone or harm anyone,\u201d Dunbar said, who checked out media accounts about the killing. \u201cIf they had left him alone he would have been gone by nightfall.\u201d\n\nSaying he understands why Fish and Wildlife workers might not want to wait for the animal to leave on its own, Dunbar said he was OK with the decision to tranquilize it. But he does not agree with the decision to kill the cougar.\n\n\u201cThey could have easily driven it out into a wildness area,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing agency guidelines, Fish and Wildlife does not relocate adult cougars, Dennehy said.\n\n\u201cMoving it would simply move the problem elsewhere,\u201d she said. Fish and Wildlife estimates there are about 6,000 cougars around the state. Relocating a cougar means releasing it into another cougar\u2019s territory, which could lead to fights between the animals resulting in injury or death.\n\nFahy and Dunbar both said they disagree with the state\u2019s estimate of the number of cougars in Oregon, saying there are probably fewer of them around the state. And, they don\u2019t buy the argument that relocation would create territorial disputes. They said they felt the cougar would have likely fared well in the wild.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to move an animal like that back to where it came from,\u201d said Rick Hopkins, senior conservation biologist for Live Oak Associations in San Jose, California, an ecological consulting firm.\n\nThe cougar killed in Bend was a 110-pound, 2-year-old male. Hopkins said it was a young cougar probably looking for territory of its own.\n\nHe said it was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d that someone would decide the cougar should be killed.\n\n\u201cI get it if you get an animal that really is a risk to humans,\u201d Hopkins said, \u201cbut that animal was not a risk to humans.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7812,\n\nddarling@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state wildlife department stands by its decision to kill a cougar captured late last month in southeast Bend despite criticism from wildlife advocates.
