On Monday, the day before her husband\u2019s State of the Union address, the first lady sent an email to supporters asking for $10 donations to help Democrats in this fall\u2019s midterm elections, fearing Republicans are a threat to Obamacare, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe email from Obama said, according to the Examiner:\n\nFriend \u2014 Earlier this month, because of what you did, it became illegal for insurance companies to discriminate against the up to 129 million Americans living with pre-existing conditions. Young Americans are able to stay on their parents\u2019 health care plans as they get on their feet, and we can now know that our insurance companies won\u2019t put lifetime caps on our coverage. You should be so proud of that. That happened because you organized, you talked to your friends and neighbors, and you chipped in what you could, when you could, to elect Barack and a Congress who supported his agenda. Today, I\u2019m asking you to do it again. So before Barack gives his State of the Union address tomorrow, chip in $10 or more and help protect Obamacare: https://my.democrats.org/State-of-the-Union Thank you so much, Michelle\n\nSeriously? Not everyone found it patriotic, or even amusing, according to these tweets reposted by Twitchy:\n\nShorter Michelle O: Dear America, We know most of you are hurting financially but send us $10 to save the law hurting you. #tcot #Obamacare \u2014 KillerBunnyFoofoo (@PolitiBunny) January 27, 2014\n\nAnd that was only the beginning.
