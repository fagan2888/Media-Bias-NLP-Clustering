While that may be true, turning down this federal money for fear that covering the cost of caring properly for the state's low-income residents will become overly burdensome is heinous and shortsighted. Sick people cost the state money, one way or another. They are unable to contribute positively to our economy, they depend on other social assistance programs more heavily, and often times, they eventually fall below the income levels that kept them from getting coverage anyway. But in cases like that of my friend, by the time they get to that point, it will be too late.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION: Let\u0092s hope the governor does what he was elected to do, with or without the Legislature.
