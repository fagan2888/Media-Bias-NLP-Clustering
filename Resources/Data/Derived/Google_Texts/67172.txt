PORTLAND — Ty Lawson is back in the lineup for the Nuggets against Portland Sunday night after missing Friday’s game against Cleveland due to ankle swelling and soreness.

Gametracker: Denver Nuggets vs. Portland Trail Blazers

Lawson was a late scratch for the Nuggets in their loss to Cleveland. He experienced discomfort during the morning shootaround Friday and was announced out about an hour before the game.

Also, Nuggets guard Nate Robinson, recently slowed by a hamstring injury, will play.

Forward J.J. Hickson returns to the Nuggets lineup after serving a five-game suspension for violating the NBA’s Anti-Drug program. Hickson will slot right as the reserve power forward behind Kenneth Faried in place of Darrell Arthur, who is sitting out due to a one-game suspension for the flagrant two foul he committed against Cleveland guard Dion Waiters on Friday night.
