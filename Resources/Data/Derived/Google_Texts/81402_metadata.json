A tenured professorship is nice; very few are dismissed for cause. Then there\u2019s the Supreme Court justice, which is a gig that, irritatingly \u2014 if, like me, you scan the actuarial tables whenever Antonin Scalia writes a decision \u2014 can last a lifetime. The media, you\u2019d think, is not a realm in which such cushy gigs exist. And for the most part, you\u2019d be right. Editors and reporters are fired all the time.\n\nBut the New York Times Op-Ed page seems to exist on a plane different even from the one occupied by the rest of the staff, which is subject to buyouts on, seemingly, an annual basis. The money crunch never seems to touch the stars of the Op-Ed page \u2014 and that\u2019s weird, because a lot of them are fiscal black holes.\n\nOne exception should be noted: William Kristol. In late 2007, the editorial page\u2019s editor, Andrew Rosenthal, boasted of the paper\u2019s new pickup, and jabbed at liberals who were upset about it. \u201cThe idea that The New York Times is giving voice to a guy who is a serious, respected conservative intellectual \u2014 and somehow that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cHow intolerant is that?\u201d Well, the hippies were right to be intolerant; Kristol was inaccurate, careless and dull, which is precisely what you\u2019d expect of the editor of the Weekly Standard. The paper was forced to issue a slew of corrections and Kristol\u2019s contract was not renewed.\n\nBut, as I say, he\u2019s the exception. And that\u2019s a problem. Any rule for which William Kristol is the exception probably needs to be revised.\n\nI thought about this as I read this morning\u2019s David Brooks column. And I thought, too, of Brooks\u2019 words from a couple of weeks ago, delivered at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Asked by Katie Couric what working for the Times is like, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never attended a meeting at the Times. \u2026 We can write about anything. I\u2019ve been at the Times for over a decade, I\u2019ve never had a performance review. We can go anywhere we want. And we are just left alone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYT columnist boasts he has no supervision or job requirements -- and the proof is in the very horrible pudding", "author": "Elon Green", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYT columnist boasts he has no supervision or job requirements -- and the proof is in the very horrible pudding", "title": "David Brooks\u2019 grotesque freedom: Why this Times columnist needs an editor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/14/david_brooks_grotesque_freedom_why_this_times_columnist_needs_an_editor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/david_brooks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYT columnist boasts he has no supervision or job requirements -- and the proof is in the very horrible pudding", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/david_brooks.jpg", "title": "David Brooks\u2019 grotesque freedom: Why this Times columnist needs an editor", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "David Brooks\u2019 grotesque freedom: Why this Times columnist needs an editor", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Baseball, David Brooks, Editor's Picks, journalists, Maureen Dowd, Media Criticism, New York Times, Soccer, Thomas Friedman, White people", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfddd\"", "article_summary": "The media, you\u2019d think, is not a realm in which such cushy gigs exist.\nTopics: Baseball, David Brooks, Editor's Picks, journalists, Maureen Dowd, Media Criticism, New York Times, Soccer, Thomas Friedman, White people, Media News, Politics NewsThere are certain levels of job security.\nAny rule for which William Kristol is the exception probably needs to be revised.\nAsked by Katie Couric what working for the Times is like, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never attended a meeting at the Times.\nBut the New York Times Op-Ed page seems to exist on a plane different even from the one occupied by the rest of the staff, which is subject to buyouts on, seemingly, an annual basis."}
