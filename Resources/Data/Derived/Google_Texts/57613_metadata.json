It would mean seeing every human as an insignificant speck of a larger problem rather than balls of contradiction and messiness. It would mean not trusting anyone. And it would require giving up on a staggering number of people, especially Our Dudes.\u201d\n\nThe Last Human Robot Boris Kachka | Vulture \u201cDaniels can be a prickly ambassador, publicly tweaking the Ewoks, the suit, the actors, and Lucas himself. But what true fan, Abrams included, hasn\u2019t had a beef with the franchise? Like 3PO and R2-D2, Star Wars and Daniels have something deeper than love: commitment. \u2018People say, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to go back to C-3PO?\u201d\u2019 Daniels says. \u2018Well, I never left him.\u2019\u201d\n\nRousey Says She\u2019s Down but Not Out Ramona Shelburne | ESPN the Magazine \u201cThe more invincible she seemed, the louder she was cheered and from more corners. She was becoming everyone\u2019s avatar. That\u2019s a lot to put on someone who makes a living fighting in a cage\u2014it\u2019s a lot to put on anyone, probably too much. But she kept living up to it until Holm\u2019s thunderous kick to the side of her head sent her crashing down to earth.\u201d\n\nSpotlight and Its Revelations\n\nSarah Larson | The New Yorker\n\n\u201cSince seeing the movie Spotlight, about the Boston Globe investigation of sexual abuse and coverups in the Catholic Church, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it and the questions it raises\u2014about how far institutions will go to protect themselves, about who we listen to and protect, about who and what we ignore, about the power of disclosure and even conversation.\u201d\n\nThe Year in Found Families\n\nHaley Mlotek | Hazlitt\n\n\u201cThe story of a family found outside of the traditional, conventional, limited sense of that word is, I\u2019ve come to believe, the only story that matters. The work of building one is not precious, not melodramatic, not sentimental. It is both the very simple and very complex renewal of parts, a renewal that happens no matter where or how we\u2019re moving beside the people we\u2019ve vowed to stay with.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Really Doesn\u2019t Want Me to Tell You This, But \u2026\n\nMark Bowden | Vanity Fair\n\n\u201cWith Trump, what you see is what you get. His behavior was cringe-worthy. He showed off the gilded interior of his plane\u2014calling me over to inspect a Renoir on its walls, beckoning me to lean in closely to see \u2026 what? The luminosity of the brush strokes? The masterly use of color? No. The signature. \u2018Worth $10 million,\u2019 he told me.\u201d\n\nScott Weiland\u2019s Family: \u2018Don\u2019t Glorify This Tragedy\u2019\n\nMary Forsberg Weiland | Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cBut at some point, someone needs to step up and point out that yes, this will happen again\u2014because as a society we almost encourage it. We read awful show reviews, watch videos of artists falling down, unable to recall their lyrics streaming on a teleprompter just a few feet away. And then we click \u2018add to cart\u2019 because what actually belongs in a hospital is now considered art.\u201d\n\nThere Once Was a Girl\n\nKaty Waldman | Slate\n\n\u201cThe narrative impulse is one entwined with anorexia itself. Being sick means constructing an alternate reality, strapping it in place with sturdy mantras, surrendering to the beguiling logic of an old fairy tale: There once was a girl who ate very little. There once lived a witch in a deep, dark wood. Anorexics are convinced that they are hideous, bad, and unlovable. At the same time, they are constantly soliloquizing about their sacrifice, their nobility, their ethereal powers.\u201d\n\nThe Art of Flying in the Movies\n\nA.O. Scott | The New York Times Magazine\n\n\u201cWe live in the grip of a technological paradox, in which the proliferation of wonders dilutes the possibility of wonder \u2026 And yet the domain of astonishment has been extended, its earlier manifestations lovingly preserved. Movies can introduce us to feelings that have no literal correlative, and they can induce those feelings again and again.\u201d\n\nPossessed by a Mask\n\nSandra Newman | Aeon\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reminiscent of the common trope in superhero comics, where the heroes exercise their powers only when appropriately masked and costumed. This rule is so strictly adhered to that the costume feels essential to the character\u2019s powers, even when, as with Spider-Man, the character\u2019s origin story explicitly demonstrates that it is not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The highlights from seven days of reading about entertainment", "author": "The Editors", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The highlights from seven days of reading about entertainment", "title": "Ronda Rousey and Human Robots: The Week in Pop-Culture Writing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/RTR4RL96/facebook.jpg?1449865017", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/ronda-rousey-and-human-robots-the-week-in-pop-culture-writing/420057/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It would mean seeing every human as an insignificant speck of a larger problem rather than balls of contradiction and messiness.\n(Not) All Men Nona Willis Aronowitz | Matter \u201cIt\u2019s painful to think about what we\u2019re burying, but the alternative is equally undesirable.\nThat\u2019s a lot to put on someone who makes a living fighting in a cage\u2014it\u2019s a lot to put on anyone, probably too much.\nAt the same time, they are constantly soliloquizing about their sacrifice, their nobility, their ethereal powers.\u201dThe Art of Flying in the MoviesA.O.\nLike 3PO and R2-D2, Star Wars and Daniels have something deeper than love: commitment."}
