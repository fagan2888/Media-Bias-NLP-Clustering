A story, titled \u201cWhere Radical Is Sensible,\u201d profiled a Manhattan activist center, and spurred a broader conversation about gender neutral pronouns. \u201cMx. Hardwick, 27, who prefers not to be assigned a gender \u2014 and also insists on the gender neutral Mx. in place of Ms. or Mr.,\u201d the piece read, consistently referring to \u201cMx. Hardwick\u201d throughout.\n\nThough the move was touted as something of a victory, perhaps signaling broader acceptance of gender neutral language, the profile seemed to imply the opposite, linking Hardwick\u2019s gender neutrality with the store\u2019s \u201cradicalism.\u201d More jarring was the clarification. It was understandable that the Times found it necessary to define the honorific \u201cMx.\u201d for readers unfamiliar with the term. But it was bizarre that the paper attributed the editorial decision to Hardwick\u2019s \u201cpreference,\u201d or, for that matter, felt the need to explain it at all. The Times went out of its way to make clear that it would have assigned Hardwick a gender but for the subject\u2019s insistence otherwise.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the paper of record including similar clarifications about other features. A recent piece on debates surrounding race at Princeton, for example, tags the race of each of the students quoted, and identifies the dean of the public policy as black. In an unfortunate omission, the current Princeton president\u2019s race was not tagged, seeming to imply that white is the default. Still, the relevance of racial identity here is obvious. Racial tags, however, can also have an editorializing effect. A story on police brutality that notes the race of the victim and the perpetrating officer offers something of an acknowledgment that prejudice can fuel such incidents and speaks to broader tensions between minority communities and law enforcement.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, in an essay that is no longer available online, the practice of making inferences based on diction certainly isn\u2019t limited to journalism. When someone refers to a Hispanic person or a lesbian or someone with blue eyes or curly hair or double-jointed thumbs, it\u2019s not unreasonable to question whether the detail is merely a rhetorical flourish of sorts or is, in the speaker\u2019s mind, substantively relevant. Such superfluous details can often be offered as a way of reinforcing a stereotype without outright stating it. It is no surprise that we often respond to statements like \u201cMy black coworker is always late\u201d or \u201cThat blonde student is actually quite smart\u201d or \u201cMy gay friend is so dramatic\u201d by asking what, exactly, the speaker is \u201ctrying to say.\u201d We are entitled to our indignation because the language presented a very clear alternative; these traits needn\u2019t have been mentioned at all.\n\nBut such statements don\u2019t have to be grounded in trite stereotype to be offensive \u2014 merely referring to one\u2019s \u201cgay friend\u201d or \u201cblack coworker\u201d is a way of tokenizing or otherizing someone. In doing so, the speaker reveals that he or she conceives of race or sexuality as central to identity. Further, in reinforcing this notion, the speaker is making the world a place wherein one\u2019s race and sexuality are somehow more than just that, making these characteristics more relevant to our conceptions of self than they otherwise would have been, central to identity simply because our community deems it so. Which is why such things are not done in polite society.\n\nWhen it comes to gender, on the other hand, the language has traditionally presented no elegant alternative. We are forced to clumsily dance around the matter, or to give in and refer to our coworkers, students and friends as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d The result is that our language caps our ability to be progressive in this realm, forces us to immediately characterize people as male or female, associates other aspects of their personalities with their sex and, in doing so, makes it an inseparable part of how we perceive ourselves and each other, far more so than any other random biological feature or accident of birth. It is so hard to distinguish words from their potentially sexist intentions or applications because sexism necessarily pervades our language. It is literally impossible to say what, exactly, it is that many of us are \u201ctrying to say.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The NY Times offers \"Mx.\" and the Washington Post \"they\" \u2014 here's why we should take that one step further", "title": "Let\u2019s call everyone \u201cthey\u201d: Gender-neutral language should be the norm, not the exception", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The NY Times offers \"Mx.\" and the Washington Post \"they\" \u2014 here's why we should take that one step further", "title": "Let\u2019s call everyone \u201cthey\u201d: Gender-neutral language should be the norm, not the exception", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/lets_call_everyone_they_gender_neutral_language_should_be_the_norm_not_the_exception/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/gender_puzzle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NY Times offers \"Mx.\" and the Washington Post \"they\" \u2014 here's why we should take that one step further", "title": "Let\u2019s call everyone \u201cthey\u201d: Gender-neutral language should be the norm, not the exception", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/gender_puzzle.jpg", "creator": "@silpakov", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Silpa Kovvali", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, gender nonconforming, Language, LGBT, Media, newspapers, words", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hardwick, 27, who prefers not to be assigned a gender \u2014 and also insists on the gender neutral Mx.\nA story, titled \u201cWhere Radical Is Sensible,\u201d profiled a Manhattan activist center, and spurred a broader conversation about gender neutral pronouns.\nThough the move was touted as something of a victory, perhaps signaling broader acceptance of gender neutral language, the profile seemed to imply the opposite, linking Hardwick\u2019s gender neutrality with the store\u2019s \u201cradicalism.\u201d More jarring was the clarification.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, gender nonconforming, Language, LGBT, Media, newspapers, words, Media News, Life News, Entertainment NewsThis weekend, the New York Times made headlines.\nIt is so hard to distinguish words from their potentially sexist intentions or applications because sexism necessarily pervades our language."}
