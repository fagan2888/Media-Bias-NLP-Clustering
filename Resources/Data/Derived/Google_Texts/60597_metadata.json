I don\u2019t want to be \u201cliked.\u201d I want to write articles that readers engage with, articles that make them think and at the very least leave them a little better informed.\n\nThat\u2019s why I love it when readers write back. Good or bad, I get a great sense of satisfaction out of knowing that what I\u2019ve written triggered enough emotion in another person that they felt compelled to let me know how they\u2019re feeling.\n\nThis very situation happened a few months ago with a story I wrote for the January issue of Workforce titled, \u201cCaring for the Caregiver.\u201d It was about employees who care for their aging or ill parents in addition to holding down a full time job. It\u2019s no small task, and 15 percent of the U.S. workforce is currently trying to do it. The intention was to shine light on an underreported issue and to give employers ideas on how to support these employees.\n\nBased on the Facebook likes, it was well received.\n\nBut then I got a letter from Laura Francis, the director of marketing at River software. With patience and gratitude she informed me that while accurate, my story was too narrow in its scope.\n\n\u201cI really appreciated your article on caring for caregivers,\u201d Francis wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important topic we need to address in society. Unfortunately, I feel like you overlooked a huge piece of this caregiver puzzle: parents of children with special needs.\u201d\n\nHer note struck a chord with me. I hadn\u2019t even considered parents of special-needs children. Worse, none of the experts I spoke with for the story brought it up, either. I did some research, and according to the U.S. Census Bureau Report, one in every 26 families reported having a child with a disability. That\u2019s a huge number of working adults. And it immediately made me wonder what, if anything, employers are doing to help ease that burden.\n\nSo I gave Francis a call, and she graciously shared her story.\n\nFrancis is the mother of a 6-year-old son who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and cortical visual impairment in addition to other special needs. He can\u2019t sit up on his own. He can\u2019t crawl. He can\u2019t walk. He can\u2019t talk. He can\u2019t feed himself. He needs someone with him all the time. Francis is that someone.\n\nShe considers herself lucky, though. Working for a small company like River has been a blessing.\n\n\u201cThey know my family,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI\u2019m not just some faceless name on a list. I\u2019ve been with the company for 16 years so they\u2019ve been with me through all of this. They are so responsive and flexible and I think flexibility is the key for parents of special-needs children.\u201d\n\nFrancis works from home so that both she and her husband can care for their son. But River\u2019s contribution goes beyond that. Last year when the company was switching insurance providers they called Francis first and asked her to make sure all her doctors would still be in network. They didn\u2019t want to make a move that would leave her son uncovered.\n\n\u201cThey are very thoughtful and respectful and open hearted and kind,\u201d Francis said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also has been a blessing for Francis and parents like her. Before the legislation was passed in 2010, Francis had a $1 million lifetime maximum benefit for her health insurance policy. GIven her son\u2019s medical needs, they had almost spent more than half of that. The ACA eliminated lifetime maximums and made it so insurance companies can no longer deny coverage based on preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cWIth all of the health issues my son faces, we would surely have faced this problem had there not been a law in effect to protect us,\u201d Francis said.\n\nWhile Francis is grateful for all that River and government legislation have done for her, she understands that not all parents of special-needs children have an ideal working situation. Her advice to those parents and their employers is to encourage conversation and understanding.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things for me is having my co-workers understand that caring for a special-needs child takes a lot out of you,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIt can be exhausting. If you come to work one day and you\u2019re just not on your game they can understand why without making assumptions about your commitment to the job.\u201d\n\nFor employers considering treating parents of special-needs children the same way they treat parents who are responsible for elderly family members, here\u2019s Francis\u2019 advice: Don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThese situations might feel similar, but they can be quite unique,\u201d Francis said. \u201cA lot of that is why it\u2019s easy for us to get overlooked in the grand scheme of things. We\u2019re trying to do our jobs and keep the family running. There\u2019s not a lot of energy left to advocate for ourselves. Having benefits and ways to communicate within the workplace is so helpful.\u201d\n\nSo for all the employers out there reading this, don\u2019t make my mistake. Create a welcoming environment for all employees so that those with challenges like Francis feel comfortable coming to you knowing adjustments can be made so they can take care of work and family \u2013 without compromise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of my biggest fears as a journalist \u2013 other than not getting the facts straight \u2013 is that no one is reading what I write.
