Cold weather is hard on not only humans but also their machines.

Car batteries are notorious for dying during cold snaps, stranding drivers in the cold.

"One day it is good, the next day it is shot because of the cold," said Dane Wood of AAA.

Wood is an expert repairman when it comes to batteries. He says that colder weather makes the starter in a car have to work harder to turn the engine over.

"The oil is harder...harder for the starter to turn so it pulls more juice from the battery and the battery cannot handle it once it is getting older," Wood said.

He suspects that a mild fall has many car batteries holding on and with an incoming cold snap, those batteries will fail.

Many car batteries are warrantied to last between two and five years. Having an emergency kit in a car with jumper cables can help get the car started again.

If a car is getting notably slow or sluggish to start, that can be a sign that the battery is getting ready to die. AAA suggests that the car owner get the battery looked at.
