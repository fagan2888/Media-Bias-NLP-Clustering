Bill compared the time it took to launch healthcare.gov to the United States\u2019 entire involvement in World War II.\n\n\u201cPutting things in perspective: March 21st 2010 to October 1 2013 is 3 years, 6 months, 10 days. December 7, 1941 to May 8, 1945 is 3 years, 5 months, 1 day. What this means is that in the time we were attacked at Pearl Harbor to the day Germany surrendered is not enough time for this progressive federal government to build a working webpage. Mobilization of millions, building tens of thousands of tanks, planes, jeeps, subs, cruisers, destroyers, torpedoes, millions upon millions of guns, bombs, ammo, etc. Turning the tide in North Africa, Invading Italy, D-Day, Battle of the Bulge, Race to Berlin \u2013 all while we were also fighting the Japanese in the Pacific!! And in that amount of time \u2013 this administration can\u2019t build a working webpage.\u201d\n\nBaier read the email on his show \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on Friday night, eliciting an astounding outcry from viewers demanding to see Bill\u2019s email online. Their voices were heard as Baier posted the entirety of the email to his blog.\n\nDespite the healthcare exchange site\u2019s snafus of late, the Obama administration has promised a working site by the end of November. The administration reportedly has hired a private firm to handle working out the site\u2019s kinks since President Obama admittedly can\u2019t write code.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Apparently the United States can fight a world war in less time than it can put together a successful website.", "title": "U.S. fought WWII quicker than launching healthcare website - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/10/healthcare.gov_-600x367.jpg", "height": 367}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/11/09/u-s-fought-wwii-quicker-than-launching-healthcare-website/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "wwii-healthcare", "published_time": "2013-11-09T12:35:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T10:22:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2124\"", "article_summary": "Apparently the United States can fight a world war in less time than it can put together a successful website.\nBill compared the time it took to launch healthcare.gov to the United States\u2019 entire involvement in World War II.\nDespite the healthcare exchange site\u2019s snafus of late, the Obama administration has promised a working site by the end of November.\nMobilization of millions, building tens of thousands of tanks, planes, jeeps, subs, cruisers, destroyers, torpedoes, millions upon millions of guns, bombs, ammo, etc.\nThe administration reportedly has hired a private firm to handle working out the site\u2019s kinks since President Obama admittedly can\u2019t write code."}
