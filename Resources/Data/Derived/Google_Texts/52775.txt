FRANKFURT--German construction and service company Bilfinger SE (GBF.XE) appointed Per Utnegaard as chairman of the executive board with effect from June 1, the company said Thursday.

Mr. Utnegaard will succeed Herbert Bodner, 67, who took over the position on an interim basis in August 2014.

Bilfinger Wednesday warned on full-year earnings targets, saying a weak first quarter and difficult developments in key markets will leave it short of its full-year guidance for output volume and profits. The company warned on profits several times last year and reshuffled key management. A new chief financial officer started April 1.

Mr. Utnegaard, 55, a Norwegian national, previously served as the president and CEO of Swissport International Ltd.

"As an internationally very experienced manager, Per Utnegaard has proven his strong leadership skills and strategic vision many times," said Eckhard Cordes, supervisory board chairman.
