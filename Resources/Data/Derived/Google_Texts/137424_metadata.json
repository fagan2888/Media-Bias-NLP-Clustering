The italics are the interviewer Allan MacInnis, the non-italics Thomas' answers:\n\nI remember reading provocative quotes from you \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t pin down where \u2013 where you made statements about the vitality of art produced in free market societies, as opposed to art that is state funded. You came across as a bit of a libertarian. I try not to take anything you say at face value \u2013 I think of you as a provocateur \u2013 but I wonder if you actually still feel that way? (Because if so, there\u2019s, umm, some irony to the band being mostly based in Europe these days, since state support of the arts is prevalent over there\u2026 and in Canada, I might add). Yes, I still feel that way. I\u2019ll take the dirty socialized art money but I prefer crummy little clubs where there\u2019s a promoter who is risking his own money to put the show on. I feel no urge to thank an audience. I thank the promoter \u2013 as should the audience. Follow up re \u201cdirty socialized money\u201d \u2013 is this less a matter of political principle for you, and more a matter of personal pride as an artist? I think the government has no business in the arts at all. Follow up: do you not think it valid, in countries that cannot compete on equal footing with the American entertainment industry, like Canada, to support their artists through government funding? I doubt there\u2019s a Canadian musician, filmmaker, writer, or novelist who hasn\u2019t received some government support along the way, be it scholarships, grants, fellowships, things like the Canada Council. No, see above. Follow-up: In a purely market driven entertainment landscape, which is mostly what we see in the States, doesn\u2019t that lead to the proliferation of Miley Cyruses and Britney Spears and other such phenomenon? Isn\u2019t it bad for art? No, it\u2019s good for them.\n\nSign Pere Ubu's non-alignment pact!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "I get a weird pleasure of watching supporters of the obscure arts, whose fans lean overwhelmingly liberal-prog-commie, get increasingly bewildered as", "title": "Pere Ubu Frontman David Thomas Bewilders A Fan by Obdurately Believing Markets are Proper for Art", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/12/26/pere-ubu-frontman-david-thomas-bewilders", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2013_12/-67.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2013_12/-67.jpg", "description": "I get a weird pleasure of watching supporters of the obscure\narts, whose fans lean overwhelmingly liberal-prog-commie, get\nincreasingly bewildered as their heroes obdurately refuse to ratify\ntheir politics for them, forcing them to confront the unbelievable:\ndecent worthwhile humans I admire&nbsp;might disagree with me\nabout core elements of my politics!\n\nI wrote amusingly of this when Mikal Gilmore of Rolling\nStone spent round after round of questions", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pere Ubu Frontman David Thomas Bewilders A Fan by Obdurately Believing Markets are Proper for Art"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2013-12-26T19:27:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Now it is classic avant-rocker David Thomas of the band Pere Ubu, in an interview in great punky-rocky interview zine Big Takeover, refusing to say he loves state subsidized art.\nI\u2019ll take the dirty socialized art money but I prefer crummy little clubs where there\u2019s a promoter who is risking his own money to put the show on.\nI try not to take anything you say at face value \u2013 I think of you as a provocateur \u2013 but I wonder if you actually still feel that way?\nYes, I still feel that way.\n(Because if so, there\u2019s, umm, some irony to the band being mostly based in Europe these days, since state support of the arts is prevalent over there\u2026 and in Canada, I might add)."}
