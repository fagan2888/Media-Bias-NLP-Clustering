President Obama is set to arrive in Los Angeles Thursday for a four-day West Coast fundraising trip. The president is scheduled to attend a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Pacific Palisades home of television producer Chuck Lorre Thursday afternoon, then head across town for another fundraiser at Tyler Perry’s Beverly Hills home.

According to Deadline, the president will make a Friday morning pit stop at the Highland Park garage where Maron records his popular podcast before flying to San Francisco in the afternoon for more fundraisers. Maron will conduct a one-hour interview with Obama, the topic of which has not been disclosed.

“Oh my god, I hope my bathroom’s clean,” Maron joked about meeting the president. “We let the neighbors know. My producer has been at the house dealing with secret service. My street is going to be incredibly safe for the next few days.”

Maron’s “WTF” is one of the most popular podcasts on the Internet, having reportedly been downloaded more than 100 million times since its start in 2009.

Obama could be using Maron’s podcast to speak about an important issue (Obamatrade?) with a younger demographic, similar to what he did last year when he appeared on “Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis” on online comedy site Funny or Die. In that appearance, Obama promoted Affordable Care Act enrollment.

Obama’s interview with Maron will be released June 22.
