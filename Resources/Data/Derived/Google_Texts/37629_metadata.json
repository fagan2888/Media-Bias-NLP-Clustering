Some in the media may not yet have caught on to the way the momentum continues to shift, but eventually the reality will sink in.\n\nThere are three things Sanders needs to do\u2014and has already started doing in a noticeable way\u2014to move clearly and permanently ahead of Hillary Clinton at the national level: a) dramatic emphasis on minority outreach; b) expansion of his economic message to one of social harmony; and c) delegitimization of the negative populism pervasive in the Republican primary.\n\nAlready, Cornel West has given a rousing introduction to Sanders in South Carolina. Sanders has been trying to reach out to the Congressional Black Caucus, though not yet with much luck. They might as this message becomes clearer: Sanders is a much better deal for minorities of every stripe\u2014from embattled African-Americans to Hispanics and Asians and others\u2014because of what his policies of economic justice represent compared to the neoliberal repressiveness of Clinton and the establishment Democratic Party.\n\nThe Clintons talk a good game when it comes to African-Americans (Bill, after all, was supposed to be our first black president before the real first black president showed up) but the truth is that Clintonian neoliberalism really tightened the screws on African-Americans by legitimizing extreme income inequality as the normal course of things\u2014smashing, in effect, the Democratic Party\u2019s bargain with minorities since the New Deal.\n\nThe Clintons ended welfare as we knew it, for example, by delusionally hoping that technology-driven productivity would somehow make poverty cease to exist, or by expanding the surveillance, prosecution and incarceration capacities of the state, building on the war on drugs initiated by Ronald Reagan to impose a stark omnipotence much less forgiving of mistakes made by poor people. Rhetorically\u2014and emptily\u2014the Clintons may align themselves with African-Americans, and claim some sort of honorary status with that community, but their policies have been death\u2014literal death on the streets\u2014for African-Americans.\n\nIt is a myth created by the establishment media that Sanders\u2019 appeal is limited to well-educated white coastal liberals, particularly males, and that he has a natural barrier to how far and deep his support can extend. The claim is that South Carolina\u2014and then Nevada with its Hispanic population\u2014will be the firewalls that will break Sanders\u2019 momentum if he wins in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBut the truth is that Sanders\u2019 potential appeal to minorities is unlimited\u2014unlike Clinton\u2019s upper limits due to the nature of her past and present policies and her utter incapacity to enunciate anything real that resonates with people beyond recycled neoliberal micro-platitudes. Therefore, Sanders must go for broke in reaching out to African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians as their natural candidate, and in the process rewrite the whole script for how the Democratic Party courts voters. New, and unprecedented, promises must be made to shatter the silence around issues that neoliberal candidates have zero interest in highlighting.\n\nSecondly, while it has so far been a necessary and indeed winning strategy for Sanders to emphasize a straightforward recital of agenda items\u2014especially single-payer healthcare, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage (outlined by Jonathan Tasini in \u201cThe Essential Bernie Sanders and his Vision for America\u201c)\u2014Sanders needs to open this up to a message of optimism that reaches well beyond the listing of economic policy items. Britain\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn has already shown how to do this.\n\nOf course, these need to continue being hammered into consciousness until they became accepted parts of liberal discourse again (as the necessary antidote to Reaganite social darwinism that we never got from the Democratic Party), but I\u2019m sure that Sanders will also figure out a way to connect these policy prescriptions to a radically expansive vision of the good life, part of which must involve reimagining America as an honest and responsible citizen in the world community.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary-bots argue that Sanders only appeals to white Iowa & New Hampshire voters.
