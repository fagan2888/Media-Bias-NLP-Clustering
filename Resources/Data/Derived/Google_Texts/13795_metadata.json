Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) takes poison and collapses, convulsing, at the end of episode seven, as part of a desperate attempt to silence a voice in his brain. It looks like he died\u2014because he did die, in that his heart stopped and he stopped breathing. In \u201cInternational Assassin,\u201d he comes to\u2014naked and submerged in a bathtub. He surfaces, gasping, to discover that he is in a hotel room he has never seen before. If he has not died, the world is at least transformed. The TV is playing static and won\u2019t turn off. Some of his own clothes are in the closet, under a placard that reads, \u201cKnow who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.\u201d When he opens the door, the man from room service tries to kill him. And throughout, the opening bars to the unsettling, show-stopping \u201cVa, pensiero\u201d\u2014composed by Giuseppe Verdi\u2014scores Kevin\u2019s engagement with this fraught dreamscape.\n\nThe effect is difficult to forget. In Kevin\u2019s wild search for meaning, the music reflects the layers of confusion and clarity that come with any unpleasant awakening\u2014whether that\u2019s a bathtub coming-to or a spiritual epiphany. (In Kevin\u2019s case, it\u2019s probably both.) The music haunts him, and us, throughout the episode, to its incredible, difficult-to-explain conclusion.\n\n\u201cInternational Assassin\u201d is an unbelievably amazing episode of television. \u201cVa, pensiero\u201d appears in act three of the opera \u201cNabucco,\u201d and \u201cInternational Assassin,\u201d placed late in the second season, is a similar crescendo to a show-stopping number. And for me, it came unexpectedly. I did not care for season one for the show, though I was able to find merit in some episodes; season two has made me a convert. It inspires passion in its fans, because although other shows are good, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d is vital. It is a weekly reckoning with what it means to be a person, which often means reckoning with pain, despair, loss and meaninglessness. It\u2019s not an easy watch, but in some ways, the difficulty of the show is what is so rewarding about it\u2014as if, finally, there is a show that understands how awful it can feel to be a human being in the world. We don\u2019t live in a world with \u201cthe Departure,\u201d as the characters on \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d call it, but we all have our losses and our burdens and our griefs. Less than trying to explain the mystery of why both terrible and wonderful things happen the way they do, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d tries to relate how humans deal with unanswered questions and missing pieces.\n\nIt\u2019s done that from the start. But the second season does it much, much better. Having watched the finale in advance of its broadcast tonight, I can say confidently that this is a season of television worth investing in. But more than that, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d is an extraordinary case study for how to improve a show. Studios and networks have been fixated on quantity more than quality in the years since the Golden Age of Television was proclaimed to have begun. As is discussed over and over, by critics including myself, this has led to a glut of shows that are good enough, but few that are truly brilliant.\n\nShowrunner Damon Lindelof has been quite candid about the mistakes of season one, such as in this interview with Alan Sepinwall of HitFix:\n\nI was really depressed while writing the first season of the show \u2026 I was mainlining Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road,\u201d and \u201cGimme Shelter,\u201d and all of these post-apocalyptic stories. It\u2019s like, \u201cHow can I take the feeling of these people scrounging for Coke cans and sardines and a burnt sky? How can I take that feeling and just put that feeling in the world that we know? Can I create an existential apocalypse?\u201d And of course, I probably also should have been thinking, \u201cWhy would anybody want to watch that?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In its second season, Damon Lindelof turned his mediocre drama into one of the best shows on TV", "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In its second season, Damon Lindelof turned his mediocre drama into one of the best shows on TV", "title": "How \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d became brilliant: HBO\u2019s depressed dark horse finally found its voice \u2014\u00a0and now it sings", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/06/how_the_leftovers_became_brilliant_hbos_depressed_dark_horse_finally_found_its_voice_and_now_it_sings/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/leftovers3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In its second season, Damon Lindelof turned his mediocre drama into one of the best shows on TV", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/leftovers3.jpg", "title": "How \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d became brilliant: HBO\u2019s depressed dark horse finally found its voice \u2014\u00a0and now it sings", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d became brilliant: HBO\u2019s depressed dark horse finally found its voice \u2014\u00a0and now it sings", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, damon lindelof, Editor's Picks, giuseppe verdi, justin theroux, Lost, opera, the leftovers, TV, va pensiero, verdi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "How can I take that feeling and just put that feeling in the world that we know?\nAnd throughout, the opening bars to the unsettling, show-stopping \u201cVa, pensiero\u201d\u2014composed by Giuseppe Verdi\u2014scores Kevin\u2019s engagement with this fraught dreamscape.\nTopics: damon lindelof, Editor's Picks, giuseppe verdi, justin theroux, Lost, opera, the leftovers, TV, va pensiero, verdi, Entertainment NewsThe eighth episode of this season of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d starts with a dead man.\nIt\u2019s like, \u201cHow can I take the feeling of these people scrounging for Coke cans and sardines and a burnt sky?\nHaving watched the finale in advance of its broadcast tonight, I can say confidently that this is a season of television worth investing in."}
