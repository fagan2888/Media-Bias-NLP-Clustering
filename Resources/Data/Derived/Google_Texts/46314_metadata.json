For supporters of the ACA and the Medicaid expansion it calls for, the win was nothing short of monumental.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here to stay,\u201d Jen Bersdale, executive director of Missouri Health Care for All, told The Missouri Times. \u201cThe court was very clear, and the ruling could potentially give some momentum to [Medicaid] expansion.\u201d\n\nBersdale was sitting in the back of the conference with one eye on the SCOTUS online blog when the ruling broke. While her fellow advocates sat in a budget presentation meant to show the fiscal positives of expanding Medicaid eligibility, Bersdale was watching the court uphold President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.\n\nBersdale leapt to her feet and broke the news to the room, which broke out into applause and cheers. And while advocates were thrilled, Bersdale said it\u2019s nothing compared to the relief of those watching the case wondering if the end of their subsidy and thus their vital treatment was coming.\n\nA woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer not long after signing up for insurance said her subsidies were vital in paying for her treatments. Bersdale said the woman fell into her arms, crying, when word broke that the subsidies were here to stay.\n\nThe ruling in the King v. Burwell case settles the legality of much of the ACA for good, some legal scholars have said. And while plenty of conservatives scoffed at the court\u2019s decision and issued statements against the case, the ruling ends the final significant legal challenge to the law.\n\nSen. Bob Onder, R-Lake St. Louis, said the ruling was likely to harden both supporters and opponents of the law, saying the majority went outside their judicial restraints to \u201crewrite\u201d and \u201csave\u201d Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court again on Thursday re-wrote Obamacare to save Obamacare,\u201d Onder said. \u201cThey did it with regard to the Medicaid expansion piece, they did it with regard to the individual mandate, and now they\u2019ve done it for the subsidies as well.\u201d\n\nOnder filed a bill last year that essentially would have had the same force and effect as an anti-Obamacare ruling on Thursday. Onder\u2019s bill stripped health insurance subsidies for any Missourian signed up through one of the ACA federal exchanges. With the Burwell ruling, Onder says little is \u201csettled.\u201d\n\nIn Missouri, Medicaid expansion advocates like Bersdale are hoping the ruling represents positive momentum toward expansion, a fight that has been a bitter uphill climb in Missouri. But next year advocates have an even taller order, when 2016 becomes the first year that the federal government does not reimburse states for 100 percent of new Medicaid enrollees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen multiple studies say that we\u2019re going to save more than we spend,\u201d Bersdale said. \u201cIt is still a fantastic deal for the states. We\u2019d like to see our legislators listen to data and statistics and facts instead of politics.\u201d\n\nOnder said that while he had no doubt the ruling will have energized supporters on the left, he believes rank-and-file Republicans will still line up to rail against the ACA.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "Saint Louis, Mo. \u2014 A group of healthcare advocates were attending an annual conference in Columbia, Missouri when the Supreme Court announced its decision on a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act that conservatives said was the best legal chance at dismantling the law.
