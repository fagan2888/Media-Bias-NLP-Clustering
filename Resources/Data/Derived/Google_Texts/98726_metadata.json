The new plan allows for improvements to the troubled MNsure information technology system, plus measures to prevent people from inadvertently losing coverage.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that the system functionality could handle this number of people coming through,\u201d Jesson said. Of the 2016 enrollment projection, she said: \u201cI feel like we are very much on track.\u201d\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure health insurance exchange to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have coverage or pay a tax penalty.\n\nThe majority of Minnesotans get health insurance from their employer or the federal Medicare program. Those who don\u2019t can use MNsure to buy private coverage or enroll in the Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare public health insurance programs.\n\nThe projections for 2016 enrollment come from a consultant\u2019s report, which forecast the majority of MNsure\u2019s business would come from people obtaining public insurance coverage.\n\nSince October, people who are newly eligible for the state programs have been enrolling through MNsure. Another 800,000 people previously covered through Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare soon will be asked to start renewing their existing coverage through MNsure.\n\nThis \u201cconversion\u201d process has worried county officials who have struggled for months trying to use the MNsure system to help just the smaller group of people newly eligible for public insurance.\n\n\u201cThe thought of transitioning all of the current Medical Assistance recipients \u2026 into a system that is functioning the way that it is now is untenable,\u201d said Deborah Huskins, a Hennepin County official, during a MNsure board meeting in April. \u201cIf that were to be the route taken \u2026 we would lose some people \u2014 they would lose the health care coverage that they need.\u201d\n\nState officials want to prevent disruptions, so they delayed the start of the conversion from April to August, Jesson said. Whereas the state originally planned on about 70,000 people converting their coverage each month, the current plan asks 14,000 people to do so in August and another 14,000 in September.\n\nLetters explaining the conversion will start going out to beneficiaries this month, Jesson said. The letters will include user names and temporary passwords so people can access their MNsure accounts.\n\nThere also will be instructions about where people can get help, Jesson said. Beneficiaries also have the option of using paper applications.\n\n\u201cWe are really proceeding with care here, because these are things where we can alter our approach if it\u2019s not working,\u201d Jesson said.\n\nIf things go well this summer, another 100,000 people will make the transition this fall, Jesson said, followed by another 700,000 beneficiaries in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this in a slower, more careful, pilot-oriented fashion,\u201d Jesson said. But when it\u2019s done, she said, the exchange will have taken a large step toward hitting the projected number of enrollees.\n\nWhen the state Legislature created MNsure in 2013, supporters repeatedly cited projections that 1.3 million people would be enrolled by 2016, including about 300,000 who previously lacked coverage.\n\nThis week, University of Minnesota researchers released a report suggesting the state is more than halfway to hitting the 2016 forecast for reducing the number of uninsured residents. The report included figures for MNsure enrollment as of May 1.\n\nThe long-term projection anticipated about 452,000 people would obtain commercial coverage through MNsure by 2016. As of May 1, about 43,000 used the exchange to obtain commercial insurance, but the number has since ticked up to about 50,000, said Scott Leitz, the MNsure chief executive.\n\nCurrently, MNsure\u2019s budget expects another 50,000 to enroll in commercial coverage for 2015 and another 50,000 to enroll in coverage for 2016. MNsure isn\u2019t backing away from the original projections for commercial enrollment, Leitz said, but the numbers don\u2019t constitute current goals for the exchange, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get as many people into coverage as we can through MNsure, and that\u2019s really our goal,\u201d Leitz said.\n\nMost of the commercial enrollment through MNsure has come from individuals buying coverage. Employers with 50 or fewer workers also can buy coverage through the exchange, but few have done so.\n\nAs of May, just 761 people were insured through what\u2019s known as \u201csmall group\u201d coverage. The original projections forecast small group enrollment of 131,000 by 2016.\n\nGiven MNsure\u2019s many technical challenges, insurance companies have called for shutting down the portion of the exchange for small groups. When asked about the idea, Leitz said, \u201cWe wanted to do a very real evaluation of (the small group exchange) at this point and time, and make some decisions.\u201d A final decision could come in the next month or so, he said.\n\nOriginal projections assumed that employers with 51 to 100 workers could buy through the exchange beginning in 2016. Whether that happens will depend, Leitz said, on what MNsure decides to do for small groups.\n\nMNsure got off to a rough start last fall, with a balky website and hourlong waits for help from the health exchange\u2019s call center. The performance improved, and by March, officials boasted that MNsure had exceeded its short-term goal of connecting 135,153 people overall with coverage.\n\nAt the time, the exchange missed its short-term goal for enrollment in commercial policies and MinnesotaCare, but exceeded goals for Medical Assistance.\n\nChristopher Snowbeck can be reached at 651-228-5479.
