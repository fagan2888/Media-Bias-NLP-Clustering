No way these kind of players would actually want to play in a non-traditional hockey market.\n\nNo, this is not another retread story about former Lightning captain Vinny Lecavalier and the allure of returning to Montreal to play for his beloved hometown Habs.\n\nInstead, this is about the future captain of the Lightning, Steven Stamkos, and the presumed intention he will return home to Toronto to play for the Maple Leafs, the team he grew up watching and idolizing.\n\nIt started with a column in The Toronto Star last week laying the groundwork for a pursuit of Stamkos in the summer of 2016, when he is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThis feeling, apparently, comes from the presence of Tim Leiweke, who left a high-profile position in Los Angeles to take over as president of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, a position that comes with a specific sort of glare in Canada\u2019s largest city and sports market.\n\nLeiweke, the brother of Lightning CEO Tod Leiweke, already has made a splash in the city by bringing in U.S. soccer star Michael Bradley on a costly transfer agreement to play for MLSE-run Toronto FC of Major League Soccer.\n\nWith the stir created around David Clarkson returning to his hometown team last summer \u2014 Clarkson left New Jersey as an unrestricted free agent \u2014 can you imagine what kind of splash would be created in Toronto if Stamkos did the same?\n\nWell, you will only be able to imagine it, because just like in the summer of 2011, when Stamkos was a restricted free agent and hit the market on July 1, he\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\nIn that three-week period, which became known in social media circles as Stammergeddeon, Toronto fans went to bed each night dreaming of an offer sheet from the big-market Leafs that Tampa Bay would refuse to match and allow the high-scoring Stamkos to return home.\n\nThere was talk of Stamkos heading to Philadelphia, as well, as the Flyers contemplated extending an offer sheet for Stamkos.\n\nOf course, who wouldn\u2019t want to have Stamkos on their team? He\u2019s a tremendous talent on the ice but is a better person off the ice, and that adds up to somebody who can be an ambassador for the game and his team. Just as we\u2019ve seen for five years in Tampa.\n\nBut you can take this one to the bank, and I\u2019m 99.91 percent sure on this: Steven Stamkos will not reach the free-agent market.\n\nIn January 2015 \u2014 as soon as it is allowed \u2014 negotiations for a contract extension will begin in some capacity. They might drag on a bit, and something might not be done before the season is out, but by the time Tampa Bay opens training camp in September 2015, the ink will have dried on a long-term extension that will keep Stamkos in a Lightning uniform for a long time.\n\nThat means Stammergeddeon 2.0 will never reach the market.\n\neerlendsson@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7835\n\nTwitter: @erlendssonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 20:49:22 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Well, it has started.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Well, it has started.", "title": "Bolts Beat: Ignore all the talk of Stamkos leaving town", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/bolts-beat-ignore-all-the-talk-of-stamkos-leaving-town-20140118/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140118/ARTICLE/140119175/AR/0/AR-140119175.jpg", "height": 1800}, "updated_time": "2014-01-18T20:49:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Well, it has started.", "title": "Bolts Beat: Ignore all the talk of Stamkos leaving town", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140118/ARTICLE/140119175/AR/0/AR-140119175.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-18T20:49:22Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-18T20:49:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaccc\"", "article_summary": "There was talk of Stamkos heading to Philadelphia, as well, as the Flyers contemplated extending an offer sheet for Stamkos.\nOf course, who wouldn\u2019t want to have Stamkos on their team?\nBut you can take this one to the bank, and I\u2019m 99.91 percent sure on this: Steven Stamkos will not reach the free-agent market.\nNo way these kind of players would actually want to play in a non-traditional hockey market.\nIt started with a column in The Toronto Star last week laying the groundwork for a pursuit of Stamkos in the summer of 2016, when he is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent."}
