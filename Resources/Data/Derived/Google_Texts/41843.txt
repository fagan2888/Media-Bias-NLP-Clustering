A northwest Oklahoma City business has been evacuated Tuesday afternoon, Oklahoma City fire officials said.

The dentist's office and dry cleaning business at 2903 NW 122 were evacuated after some people inside the building said they were not feeling well, Oklahoma City fire District Chief Benny Fulkerson said.

People inside the building said there was a "chemical odor" inside.

Paramedics are at the scene to check the people out, but no one has been taken to the hospital.

Firefighters think a cleaning agent from the dry cleaning business leaked, Fulkerson said.
