It\u2019s a controversial, 900-plus-page federal law (officially the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) that was signed by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. It makes sweeping changes to health care, such as requiring almost all Americans to have health insurance. Some people say it goes too far. Others say it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nWhy is the ACA also known as Obamacare? Opponents came up with that name back in 2007 as a dig at Obama. It stuck.\n\nThis is universal health care, right? No. In places with universal health care (we\u2019re looking at you, Canada), the government pays for medical care. The ACA, on the other hand, requires that people pay for their own care by buying insurance. The ACA did expand government coverage \u2014 Medicaid \u2014 to some people, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states didn\u2019t have to accept that expansion. So many states, including Maine, didn\u2019t.\n\nSo I have to have health insurance now? Yes, that started in 2014, unless you are both very poor (under the federal poverty level) and live in a state that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid (like Maine). You can also get an exemption to the penalty if:\n\n\u2014 Your religion prevents you from accepting insurance benefits.\n\n\u2014 You\u2019re part of a health care sharing ministry.\n\n\u2014 You are an Alaska Native shareholder or a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe.\n\n\u2014 You lack insurance for fewer than three months in a row.\n\n\u2014 You have suffered a certified hardship.\n\n\u2014 You can\u2019t afford coverage because you\u2019d have to pay more than 8 percent of your household income for coverage.\n\n\u2014 You\u2019re behind bars.\n\n\u2014 You are not a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national or an alien lawfully present in the U.S.\n\nOK, so I\u2019m not on that list. What if I don\u2019t get insurance? If you didn\u2019t have it in 2014 and you were supposed to, you\u2019ll pay a penalty come tax time in April. The IRS is in charge of that. In 2015, the penalty gets bigger.\n\nHow much is the penalty? In 2014, it\u2019s either 1 percent of your annual household income or $95 per adult for the year/$47.50 per child, whichever is higher. (FYI: To calculate 1 percent of your household income, the IRS uses only the amount above its tax filing threshold. So for a single person, for example, the first $10,000 or so doesn\u2019t count.)\n\nNote the \u201cwhichever is higher\u201d part. If you make $35,000 a year, you\u2019ll owe about $250 in penalty, not $95.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty is either 2 percent of your annual household income or $325 per adult/$162.50 per child, whichever is higher. Again, that 2 percent is only on the amount above the tax filing threshold.\n\nThe penalty will go up again in 2016.\n\nBut what if I only went without insurance for a month (or, um, two)? Short gaps of three months or fewer are penalty free. However, those months must be consecutive. In other words, if you have more than one gap in a year \u2014 say, you didn\u2019t have insurance between May and July and then again between October and December \u2014 only the first one is exempt. So there\u2019s no penalty the first time, but you\u2019ll have to pay the second.\n\n(FYI: Penalties are based on how many months you\u2019re without insurance. So if your penalty was $95 for the year but you were only without insurance for half the year, you\u2019d pay half that penalty.)\n\nI bought my insurance this past spring. That means I don\u2019t have to shop around again until next spring, right? Right? Wrong. All individual health insurance ends Dec. 31 no matter when or where you bought it. If you want insurance in 2015, you have until Feb. 15 to sign up.\n\n(FYI: It takes time for paperwork to be processed, so don\u2019t expect insurance to kick in the moment you sign up. If you\u2019re buying from the marketplace and need your insurance to start on the 1st of next month, you must sign up by the 15th of this month. If you\u2019re not buying through the marketplace, check with your insurance carrier. It may have a different start date.)\n\nCan I sign up for insurance whenever I want? No. Open enrollment runs only through Feb. 15, 2015. Unless you are a tribal member or an Alaska Native shareholder, or you experience a certain life-changing event (marriage, adoption, job loss, etc.), open enrollment is the only time you can get health insurance for 2015. It doesn\u2019t matter how or where you buy it, Feb. 15 is your deadline. If you qualify, you can sign up for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program at any time.\n\nEnrolling was a nightmare last year! Do I have to re-enroll all over again? No. Your insurance will automatically renew if you do nothing. However, experts strongly \u2014 Very. Strongly. \u2014 advise people to review their medical needs, financial situation and insurance options. That\u2019s because your insurance plan might have changed. Or you might qualify for a larger subsidy. Or maybe you\u2019re in a plan that worked well this past year but isn\u2019t what you need now.\n\n(FYI: Some people who signed up through the marketplace did not check the box that allowed the federal government to automatically access their tax records every year. If you\u2019re one of them, you must go back to the marketplace now to update your financial information. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll either lose your subsidy or lose your insurance.)\n\nBut \u2026 nightmare. I just don\u2019t want to go through that sign-up mess again! People who have used the marketplace this year say it\u2019s working better and is easier to navigate. New sign-ups that took five or six hours to complete last year are taking an hour or so now. Renewals can take just 30 minutes since last year\u2019s information should already be filled in and only needs to be reviewed and updated.\n\nHey! I just logged on to Healthcare.gov and discovered I was already re-enrolled in my marketplace plan. What gives? I wanted to pick a different plan. If you didn\u2019t go to the marketplace and choose a new plan by Dec. 15, you were automatically renewed. (That way you\u2019d have coverage come Jan. 1.) If you don\u2019t like that plan, you don\u2019t have to keep it. You have until Feb. 15 to pick something else.\n\nIs this all going to be moot? I heard something about the U.S. Supreme Court. In March 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide whether federal subsidies apply only in states that set up their own insurance marketplaces or whether they also can be used in states that use the federal marketplace, as they are now. Just over half of all states, including Maine, use the federal marketplace.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision has the potential to dramatically affect subsidies \u2014 as in, kill them in most states \u2014 but no one knows how the Supreme Court will rule. And if that happens, there are possible fixes, including a tweak to the ACA\u2019s language or a change in states\u2019 relationship to the federal marketplace.\n\nYou can hold off getting insurance to see how the Supreme Court rules, but it\u2019s not expected to make a decision until summer, well after open enrollment and halfway through the year. If you gamble that the law is going to fall apart and it doesn\u2019t, you won\u2019t be able to get insurance and you\u2019ll be on the hook for hundreds of dollars in penalty.\n\nIf you get a subsidy, experts say you shouldn\u2019t worry about being forced to pay it back because the court\u2019s decision cannot be made retroactive. However, it is possible you could lose your subsidy if the court rules against the federal marketplace \u2014 and losing your subsidy could mean losing your insurance, unless you can pay the whole cost on your own.\n\nWait, a subsidy? If you can\u2019t get affordable health insurance through your job and you earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, you can get money from the feds to help pay for insurance. If you\u2019re between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level, you also can get a discount on your out-of-pocket health care expenses. This will all be on a sliding scale \u2014 the less you earn, the bigger your subsidy.\n\nWhat\u2019s the federal poverty level? Right now it\u2019s $11,670 a year for one person (modified adjusted gross income).
