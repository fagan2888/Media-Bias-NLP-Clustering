"The clock is ticking with just four days left," said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell.

Burwell also said, "We are focused on making sure people know that financial help" is available to buy Obamacare plans. Obamacare customers with low and moderate incomes qualify for subsidies that reduces the price of their monthly insurance premiums, and many of those customers also get additional financial help paying for their out-of-pocket medical expenses.

"The deadline is fast approaching and ... we're here to help them enroll, so they don't risk having to pay a penalty," Burwell said.

The Obamacare penalty for not having some form of health coverage in 2016 is rising to the higher of $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income.

Burwell and other health officials have repeatedly mentioned that penalty during enrollment this year to spur remaining uninsured people to sign up.

Burwell previously has noted the remaining uninsured will be tougher to enroll than in Obamacare's first two years. She expects that about 10 million people will still be enrolled in Obamacare plans nationwide by the end of this year, which would represent just a modest increase in enrollment as of the end of 2015.
