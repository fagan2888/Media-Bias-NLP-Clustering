That back door was an additional $38 billion into the Pentagon\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, commonly known as the war fund.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Cooks the Books to Hide Massive Waste\n\nThe NDAA sets spending levels for all Defense Department programs, including troop pay, and serves as a policy roadmap for the agency. Obama\u2019s veto, only the fifth of his presidency, was a move to keep the pressure on for a budget deal to raise spending for defense and nondefense.\n\nThe high-stakes gambit seems to have paid off last week when Congress approved a budget agreement that increased federal spending by $112 billion, with $50 billion in fiscal 2016, $30 billion in 2017, and about $32 billion for the OCO account split evenly between the defense and domestic programs.\n\nThe spending level for defense in 2016 is $5 billion less than the president\u2019s original budget request.\n\nThe question now becomes what to do with the NDAA, a bill Congress has passed for 53 straight years. The House is slated to vote on Thursday to override Obama\u2019s veto, but lawmakers are also preparing a new policy blueprint, minus the $5 billion.\n\nRelated: Here's How GOP Hardliners Could Still Blow Up the Budget Deal\n\nSpeaking at a Defense One summit on Monday, House Armed Services Committee chair Mac Thornberry (R-TX) said lawmakers are \u201cgoing to be ready for both options.\u201d\n\nHe said he was working with appropriators and the Senate to determine where the $5 billion cut would come from, noting dollars could from making \u201cadjustments\u201d to accounts like DOD\u2019s fuel account, as oil prices continue to be lower than expected.\n\nWhich approach lawmakers ultimately take is \u201creally going to be a leadership call,\u201d Thornberry told reporters after the event. He said he hoped to finalize a new draft of the NDAA some time Monday and lawmakers are looking at all Pentagon programs to determine where they can do \u201cthe least damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be pain. There\u2019s gonna be pain,\u201d according to Thornberry. \u201cThere\u2019s not a bunch of fat here that you can just take an inch and cut off the top and avoid getting into the meat. You get into the meat,\u201d he later added.\n\nHe ruled out the idea of spreading the cuts evenly throughout DOD, calling that \u201ca really bad way to make decisions.\u201d\n\nRelated: With $8.5 Trillion Unaccounted for, Why Should Congress Increase the Defense Budget?\n\nThornberry noted that big-ticket items, like the multi-billion dollar F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, could take a hit but declined to name specific programs that could be cut.\n\nRegardless of their complaints, the Pentagon has a problem justifying budget increases when they can\u2019t account for how $8.5 trillion has been spent since 1996. The reason\u2014they\u2019ve never passed an audit. With convoluted accounting practices that would send private sector CFOs to jail for fraud, the military has been accused of \u201ccooking the books\u201d when it comes to justifying its expenses.\n\nMoving forward with an override vote could be risky for the GOP, as Democrats could sustain the president\u2019s veto. Thornberry said he thinks Republicans are \u201cin the ballpark\u201d of having the votes to defeat the veto. But if the vote came up short, it could trip up new House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) before he\u2019s even settled into his new Capitol Hill office.\n\nTaking up a fresh bill brings up other challenges, according to Thornberry, as Senate lawmakers could try to open it up for amendment, subjecting the legislation to more partisan bickering.\n\nFor Thornberry, the path forward is cloudy because Obama has \u201cshown himself able and willing to play political games\u201d with the NDAA and that\u2019s Part of what leadership needs to sort through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After the breakneck approval of a budget deal that boosts federal spending over the next two years, the Republican-controlled Congress this week will look to sort out the fate of the $612 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal 2016.", "title": "Can\u2019t Cut a $612 Billion Budget by Less than One Percent?
