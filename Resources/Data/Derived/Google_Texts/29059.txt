ST. LOUIS (KMOX) – Mercy Health officials say challenges from the Affordable Care Act and lack of Medicaid expansion are to blame for the layoffs, which will happen in the four states it operates in: Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.

Governor Nixon points to Republican leadership in the House and Senate that refused to expand Medicaid.

“You continue to see a constriction of health care here in Missouri relative to other states that are moving forward on Medicaid expansion,” Nixon says. “Turning away two million dollars of taxpayer money a year and letting it be spent in other states mean health care jobs are growing in other states and today is yet another example of that in Missouri.”

Chesterfied-based Mercy Health will lay off between 300 to 350 employees next week.
