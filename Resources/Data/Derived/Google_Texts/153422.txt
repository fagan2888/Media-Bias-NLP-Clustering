Thousand Oaks police were looking Wednesday for a man suspected of two robberies.

The first one occurred Friday at a gas station in the 400 block of North Ventu Park Road. Witnesses said a man entered the store, approached the front counter with his hands in his front sweatshirt pocket and told the clerk he had a gun. The man demanded money from the clerk and was handed an undisclosed amount of cash, then fled on foot, authorities said.

Police said they believe the same man struck a 7-Eleven on Tuesday at 609 Rancho Conejo Blvd. The robber man approached the front counter and demanded money from both cash registers. No weapon was used, but the clerk noticed a bulge in his waistband and believed he had a handgun, authorities said. As the clerk was handing the man money from one of the registers, a customer exited the restroom, which frightened the robber, who left on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash, authorities said.

The robber was described as 40 to 55 years old, about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 220 pounds. He had a mustache and goatee and black hair and wore jeans and a dark blue sweatshirt with a hood, authorities said.

Anyone with information is urged to call 947-8113.
