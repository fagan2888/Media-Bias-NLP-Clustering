Tiago, CC BY 2.0\n\nWhile most viruses aren\u2019t transferrable from humans to pets, and vice versa, one Michigan veterinarian is saying that a mysterious dog virus, which has already killed six dogs, could be one of those rare instances.\n\nDr. Lindsay Ruland, of the Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Ann Arbor, has seen several dogs with symptoms similar to those caused by canine circovirus, including vomiting, bloody diarrhea, lethargy, and inflammation of the intestinal tract. The virus causes blood vessels to leak and blood to thicken, making it difficult for nutrients and oxygen to get to vital organs. So far six deaths and 36 veterinary visits have been attributed to the virus. In Ohio, the virus has also been linked to an additional four dog deaths.\n\n\u201cThis is like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before, and I don't know if it\u2019s multiple viruses in combination or just the circovirus,\u201d Ruland told the Columbus Dispatch. Infected dogs are usually killed within 12 to 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, she told ABC5.\n\nThe virus is under investigation because the affected dogs\u2019 owners also showed signs of flu-like symptoms, Ruland said. Furthermore, the veterinary staff developed flu-like symptoms after treating the dogs, including abdominal and respiratory issues.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, we don\u2019t pass viruses to our pets. This year, I think that there is potential that we are passing it to our pets,\u201d Ruland told ABC5. She also reported her own pain coming from \u201cright beneath my ribs.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the viruses were not identified in the sick dogs\u2019 stool, but it's unknown whether such testing is valid. An autopsy performed at Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center on one dog who died while infected by the virus couldn\u2019t establish the cause of death.\n\nCanine circovirus was originally discovered in a one-year-old dog in California last year. However, the dog was euthanized before the virus could be properly studied, leaving it unclear whether this new slate of illnesses is related. \u201cThe relationship to the canine circovirus is unknown,\u201d Dr. Mike Oglesbee, chairman of the OSU Veterinary Biosciences Department, told the Dispatch. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority to dig down into this, but were at step zero.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the AVMA urges pet owners to contact their veterinarian if their animal is vomiting or has diarrhea. These symptoms aren\u2019t exclusive to a circovirus-like illness, and could be an indication of something else. Although the mode of transmission of the virus is still unclear, the AVMA says that there\u2019s no cause for panic. Avoiding other dogs\u2019 stool is one way to try to prevent infection.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "circovirus, canine, dog, deadly, virus, michigan, ruland, humans, veterinarian", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mysterious virus similar to the Canine circovirus that appeared in California last year has shown up in Ohio and Michigan recently, killing up to 10 dogs.", "title": "Canine Circovirus-Like Illness Kills 6 Dogs In Michigan; Virus Could Affect Humans, One Vet Says", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/canine-circovirus-illness-kills-6-dogs-michigan-virus-could-affect-humans-one-vet-says-259095", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/06/canine-circovirus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mysterious virus similar to the Canine circovirus that appeared in California last year has shown up in Ohio and Michigan recently, killing up to 10 dogs.", "title": "Canine Circovirus-Like Illness Kills 6 Dogs In Michigan; Virus Could Affect Humans, One Vet Says", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/canine-circovirus-illness-kills-6-dogs-michigan-virus-could-affect-humans-one-vet-says-259095", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/06/canine-circovirus.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/06/canine-circovirus.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-06T13:28:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-06T13:28:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mysterious virus similar to the Canine circovirus that appeared in California last year has shown up in Ohio and Michigan recently, killing up to 10 dogs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb054\"", "article_summary": "This year, I think that there is potential that we are passing it to our pets,\u201d Ruland told ABC5.\nThe virus is under investigation because the affected dogs\u2019 owners also showed signs of flu-like symptoms, Ruland said.\nUp to 10 dogs have been killed by a mysterious new virus in Ohio and Michigan.\nInfected dogs are usually killed within 12 to 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, she told ABC5.\nTiago, CC BY 2.0While most viruses aren\u2019t transferrable from humans to pets, and vice versa, one Michigan veterinarian is saying that a mysterious dog virus, which has already killed six dogs, could be one of those rare instances."}
