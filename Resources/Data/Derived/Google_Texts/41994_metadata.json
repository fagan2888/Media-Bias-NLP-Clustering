Statewide, the average increase is 9.84 percent for individuals and 3.17 percent for small groups.\n\nIn 2014, Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountain Resort Region \u2014 Eagle, Summit, Pitkin and Garfield counties \u2014 had the nation\u2019s highest health insurance costs. Federal officials addressed that not by studying the cost of health care in the region but by increasing the coverage area to include most of Colorado\u2019s Western Slope.\n\nWho\u2019ll pay this?\n\nThe rates pertain to the individual market \u2014 for people who do not get insurance from their employer, but buy their own insurance \u2014 and the small group market, small businesses with 2-100 employees, said Vincent Plymell, communications manager with Colorado\u2019s Division of Insurance.\n\nFor both markets, the rates apply to plans sold both on the exchange \u2014 Connect for Health Colorado \u2014 and off of the exchange.\n\nRight now, the individual market in Colorado makes up about 8 percent of the market, and the small group about 4 percent.\n\nThis does not apply to the large group market, employers with more than 100 employees. The large group market comprises a little over half of the health insurance market in Colorado, Plymell said.\n\nSome jump more than others\n\nRocky Mountain Health Plan was awarded a 31 percent increase, and Anthem Blue Cross is taking an 8 percent increase for individual policies. Along with other health increases for 2016, the average increase for individual health insurance plans in our area is 26 percent.\n\nHow much more you pay depends on what company you select and what you buy, said Bethe Wright, who owns and operates Wright Insurance in Eagle County.\n\n\u201cNone of their premiums have gone down and benefits have been pulled away, so you\u2019re going to pay more and get less in benefits,\u201d Wright said.\n\nTake Anthem Blue Cross, for example, one of four companies still offering insurance in Eagle County, along with Kaiser, Rocky Mountain Health Plan and Cigna.\n\nIf you\u2019re a 40-year-old non-smoker living in Edwards and you bought a silver level plan last year, you paid $402 a month. That same plan will cost $445 in 2016.\n\nRates reflect Cost of health care\n\n\u201cRates reflect the cost of healthcare, and the DOI has verified that information,\u201d said Marguerite Salazar, commissioner of Colorado\u2019s Division of Insurance. \u201cThe division doesn\u2019t regulate the cost of health care, but everyone involved in health care in Colorado needs to work on bringing these costs down.\u201d\n\nOpen enrollment begins Sunday, only the third one under the Affordable Care Act, and this is the first time health insurance companies have had a full year of data on which to base their rates, Salazar said.\n\n\u201cThey are still trying to figure out what consumers want in terms of plans, deductible levels and services at a price that attracts enrollment but allows the carrier to keep the lights on and pay their bills,\u201d Salazar said.\n\nFederal and state regulators removed one of Colorado\u2019s major low-cost health insurance players last week when they banned Colorado HealthOP from selling policies on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s state health insurance exchange, saying it did not have enough reserve funds.\n\nA quick walk through that state exchange data finds that under Anthem Blue Cross\u2019s gold plan, the maximum deductible for an individual will be $6,850 in 2016 and $13,700 for a family. The Colorado HealthOP gold level policy maximum deduction was $2,000. After that, everything was covered.\n\nSummit County harder hit\n\nIndividuals in Summit County will take a harder hit, said Wright, who handles dozens of Summit County clients.\n\nColorado HealthOP was popular in Summit County because of its low cost, achieved by negotiating lower rates with a smaller number of doctors, in exchange for bringing those doctors more of the co-op\u2019s clients.\n\nIf you were with HealthOP last year, you have to find new insurance because the co-op is banned from renewing policies for next year. Some HealthOP members in Summit County could pay 100 percent more for individual insurance next year than they did this year, Wright said.\n\nAcross the state, premiums will increase over 2015 premiums by 7 percent, on average, with individual policies rising an average of 9.84 percent, and 3.17 percent for small group plans, which are purchased by small employers, ones with 2-99 employees.\n\nPolitical backlash from both sides\n\nTwo congressional representatives, Republican Scott Tipton and Democrat Jared Polis, both blistered the higher health insurance rates.\n\n\u201cThe big government Obamacare model continues to fail, and unfortunately it\u2019s hardworking Americans who are suffering,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing Obamacare\u2019s legacy in Colorado, where the largest insurer on the Colorado exchange just collapsed, insurance rates are skyrocketing and access to care is declining.\n\n\u201cWe can do better, which is why I am working to do everything possible to repeal, defund and replace this law,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cWe must have an alternative, and I believe that market-based alternatives that empower patients and doctors, enact tort reform, allow for greater flexibility, portability and cost savings, and provide coverage for pre-existing conditions show great promise, and need to be at the core of Congress\u2019 focus to replace this law.\u201d\n\nPolis called the increase \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis outrageous increase on top of already high rates is really jeopardizing access to health insurance in our mountain communities,\u201d Polis said. \u201cThe state must make sure residents of our mountain and western counties can actually purchase affordable healthcare and that the Affordable Care Act is implemented in a way that achieves the goal of providing affordable access to quality health care for all individuals. This kind of increase simply doesn\u2019t work for our community and will cause people to drop their healthcare because they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nStaff Writer Randy Wyrick can be reached at 970-748-2935 or rwyrick@vaildaily.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WESTERN COLORADO \u2014 If you\u2019re an individual buying your own health insurance in western Colorado, you\u2019ll pay an average of 26 percent more next year.Colorado\u2019s Division of Insurance approved", "og": {"url": "http://www.summitdaily.com/news/18807051-113/health-insurance-set-to-soar-next-year-on", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.summitdaily.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=HigrCbKVIugNQ$PFFSQMkc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvl3LZnVxtit9Wa$wJQoC3FWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Summit Daily", "description": "WESTERN COLORADO \u2014 If you\u2019re an individual buying your own health insurance in western Colorado, you\u2019ll pay an average of 26 percent more next year.Colorado\u2019s Division of Insurance approved", "title": "Health insurance set to soar next year on Western Slope | SummitDaily.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SummitDailyNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 143571369144148}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 18807051}}, "keywords": "INSURANCE, HEALTH, COLORADO, PERCENT, COUNTY, INCREASE, CARE, COST, INDIVIDUAL, RATES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb275\"", "article_summary": "Along with other health increases for 2016, the average increase for individual health insurance plans in our area is 26 percent.\nIn 2014, Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountain Resort Region \u2014 Eagle, Summit, Pitkin and Garfield counties \u2014 had the nation\u2019s highest health insurance costs.\nWESTERN COLORADO \u2014 If you\u2019re an individual buying your own health insurance in western Colorado, you\u2019ll pay an average of 26 percent more next year.\nThe large group market comprises a little over half of the health insurance market in Colorado, Plymell said.\nPolitical backlash from both sidesTwo congressional representatives, Republican Scott Tipton and Democrat Jared Polis, both blistered the higher health insurance rates."}
