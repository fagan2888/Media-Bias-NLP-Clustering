Fox News on Thursday invited Tony Perkins, president of noted hate group the Family Research Council, to discuss Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s veto of her state’s anti-LGBTQ measure, the “Religious Freedom Restoration Act.”

The conversation between Perkins and host Megyn Kelly was pretty canned, which is precisely what you get when you lob softball questions about discrimination at a homophobe. No surprise there.

But something interesting did happen during their exchange, and it’s a point that has come up in a number of other interviews with supporters of the bill. Perkins told Kelly, flat out, that anti-LGBTQ discrimination and broad “conscience clauses” for business owners are already the law of the land in Arizona.

He’s right. There are only three cities in the entire state with LGBTQ anti-discrimination statutes on the books. Discrimination based on “sincerely held” religious beliefs is fair game everywhere else.

In response to a question from Kelly about legal discrimination, Perkins replied that business owners in Arizona “can do that now … There is no prohibition [against such discrimination] in most places [in the state]. In Arizona, you can do that now.”
