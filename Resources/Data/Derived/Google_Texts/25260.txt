As far as "vulnerable" democrats, Hewitt said that Obamacare is a "tsunami sucking in democrats."

President Obama offered an apology last night in an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd. Referring to citizens losing their health insurance despite Obama's repeated pledge that if people like their health insurance, they can keep it, the President said in part,

“I am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me.”

The incomparable Avik Roy of Forbes observed

"As millions of Americans receive cancellation letters in the mail, however, that pledge looked increasingly strained."

Additionally, despite the White House Administration's claim that only five percent of those who purchase individual health care are affected, "Obamacare renders illegal the majority of the privately-sponsored health plans in America issued prior to 2014, not merely 5 percent of them."
