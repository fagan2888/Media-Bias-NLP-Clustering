Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, says he’s simply following the law in likely getting health insurance through an Obamacare exchange, accusing the media of playing “gotcha games” with the development.

“You know, the mainstream media loves to play gotcha games,” Mr. Cruz said in an interview with CBN News’ David Brody.

He said his wife, Heidi, decided to take an unpaid leave of absence from her job when he announced his presidential campaign. Since she’s losing her benefits in the process, he said, they are going to take health insurance from their employer, “so in all likelihood, we’ll go on the exchange.”

“And so suddenly, all the media says, ‘Ahahaha, gotcha, because Cruz is now signing up for Obamacare,’ ” he said in the interview, which was posted on The Daily Signal’s website. “Listen, I have zero intention of taking any government subsidy or Obama subsidy. Rather, what I’m going to do is pay in the marketplace for health insurance for my family just like millions of Americans.”

Mr. Cruz went on to say that just because he wants to abolish the IRS, for example, doesn’t mean he’s going to stop paying taxes.

“Some of these media outlets think that following the law is somehow less than principled,” he said. “I strongly support a flat tax, abolishing the IRS. It doesn’t mean I refuse to pay my taxes today, because the current law isn’t a flat tax. It is my intention to continue to lead the fight to repeal every word of Obamacare so that none of us are burdened by this law. But in the meantime, I and everybody else are bound by the laws that are passed in this country.”
