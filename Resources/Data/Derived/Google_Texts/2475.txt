Tucson police say a man wounded in a shooting outside a bar last month has died.

Sgt. Pete Dugan says 41-year-old Raul Castro Jr. succumbed to his injuries Friday after being hospitalized for about three weeks.

Authorities say the suspect, 51-year-old Mark Walck, will now face additional charges.

According to investigators, police found Castro on May 16 just before 12:30 a.m. in a parking lot in front of Famous Sam's with life-threatening injuries.

They say Walck fled the scene but police were able to identify him.

Walck surrendered to police later that day and was booked into Pima County Jail for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
