\u2014 and on the eve of the biggest overhaul of health care in American history, these nerves were definitely fraying.\n\nScores of computer experts were working feverishly Monday to fix a slew of problems with the software that millions of Americans are supposed to use to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, sources told The Post.\n\nTechies employed by the CGI Group in Herndon, Va., have been \u201cputting in late hours\u201d for days, trying to ensure that ObamaCare Web sites across the country will work properly when the controversial program\u2019s online exchanges open Tuesday, one contractor said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of bugs,\u201d the contractor said.\n\nThe \u201cbiggest problem\u201d is with a program that calculates the tax credits that will reduce the cost of ObamaCare to lower-income Americans and their families, the source said.\n\nIf the problem isn\u2019t fixed, some people could get bad information about the cost of their government-mandated health insurance \u2014 and get socked with monthly premiums far higher than they expect.\n\n\u201cIt might be nightmare,\u201d said one programmer familiar with the problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hope
