Researchers find that beliefs on climate change science strongly correlate with other policy preferences.\n\nFor example, if you are skeptical of the science of climate change, then you almost certainly oppose the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and support gun rights.\n\nThose who support action to reduce greenhouse gases very likely hold the opposite views.\n\nIf arguments about the science of climate change were actually about the science, then this result would make no sense. Whether climate change is true or not is a scientific matter, and it should be uncorrelated with philosophical views on the role of government in health care or the constitutional right to own a firearm.\n\nBut they are correlated. And this tells us that the arguments about the science of climate change are not actually about science.\n\nSo what is the argument about? The answer is policy.\n\nIf climate change is true and we decide to reduce emissions, then it will almost certainly require intervention by the government into the energy market. For some, that idea is so repugnant that the only conclusion is that the problem must not exist.\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/air/sect812/prospective2.html\n\nhttp://www.ig.utexas.edu/jsg/css_jsg/people/statement.html\n\nhttp://atmo.tamu.edu/weather-and-climate/climate-change-statement\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/ frontline/environment/climate-of-doubt/bob-inglis-climate-change-and-the-republican-party/\n\nIt is also about being part of the tribe. Climate change has achieved such an elevated status in the policy debate that it has become a litmus test. To be a Republican, for example, you must reject the science.\n\nAny Republican who does not risks being voted out of office \u2014 as happened, for example, to Rep. Bob Inglis. (www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/ frontline/environment/climate- of-doubt/bob-inglis-climate- change-and-the-republican- party/).\n\nAs proud Texans, we are sympathetic to those who worry about out-of-control eco-totalitarianism. And we both love cheap and abundant energy and the lifestyle it allows us to lead. But, like most people, Republican and Democrat alike, we also want to protect the environment. Thus, we both support balanced action to address the clear and present danger of climate change.\n\nIt is important to remember that we've done this before.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Congress passed the Clean Air Act, which drastically improved air quality, yielding benefits that exceed the cost by more than 30 times (www.epa.gov/air/sect812/prospective2.html).\n\nAnd the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chemicals, was a profoundly cost-effective policy that saved the ozone layer.\n\nPrior to implementation of both policies, it was argued that these regulations would bankrupt us and cause a litany of other terrible consequences \u2014 for example, forcing middle-class families to give up their air conditioners.\n\nThese predictions obviously turned out to be wrong. And today, many of those same people are arguing that regulations on greenhouse gases will bankrupt us and force us to give up cheap energy.\n\nThese people are, in fact, the true alarmists in the climate debate.\n\nThroughout history, American ingenuity has overwhelmed every problem we've faced. Along the way, we have found cost-effective ways to clean up the air and switch off ozone-depleting substances. This not only led to a cleaner environment but to economic growth. And we are confident that the same thing will happen here.\n\nIf we put our minds to it, we can solve the climate problem and prosper along the way.\n\nOnly someone profoundly pessimistic would bet against American ingenuity.\n\nGerald R.
