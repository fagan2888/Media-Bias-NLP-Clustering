Bondara, an adult toy company based in the UK, announced they\u2019re working on a prototype for an activity tracker and sex toy called SexFit.\n\n\u201cOur device is a natural next step alongside the influx of personal health trackers and with the added benefit of improving an individual\u2019s sex life, we expect it to be a huge hit when it becomes,\u201d Louise Bagley, a sex toys buyer for Bondara, said in a press release.\n\nSexFit is exactly what it sounds like: a tracker men wear at the base of their penis during sex to transmit calories burned and thrusts per minute to a free app via Bluetooth. Then, if they're so inclined, they can share their \"workout\" with their social media followers. The tracker very much works like a penis ring in that it also vibrates to stimulate a better erection (and overall better sex), and lights up to notify the wearer they\u2019ve hit the jackpot. Er, a steady rhythm.\n\nShould this prototype not make it to the market, men still have fitness program Private Gym For Men. While this is a step up from an app, Private Gym comes with a weighted penis ring that helps men strengthen their pelvic muscles. And as you know, a stronger pelvic floor, makes for a stronger orgasm.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sexfit, better, sex, penis, pedometer, measures, calories, burned, and, thrusts, minute, so, you", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Bondara, a British sex toy company, is working to boost your sex life with their new kind of activity tracker.", "title": "FitBit For Sex: New Tracker Measures Calories Burned And Thrusts Per Minute", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sexfit-better-sex-penis-pedometer-measures-calories-burned-and-thrusts-minute-so-you-can-297174", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/sexfit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bondara, a British sex toy company, is working to boost your sex life with their new kind of activity tracker.", "title": "FitBit For Sex: New Tracker Measures Calories Burned And Thrusts Per Minute", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sexfit-better-sex-penis-pedometer-measures-calories-burned-and-thrusts-minute-so-you-can-297174", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/sexfit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/sexfit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-08-08T11:36:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T11:36:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Bondara, a British sex toy company, is working to boost your sex life with their new kind of activity tracker."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81d0\"", "article_summary": "Bondara, a British sex toy company, is working to boost your sex life with their new kind of activity tracker.\nBondara, an adult toy company based in the UK, announced they\u2019re working on a prototype for an activity tracker and sex toy called SexFit.\nSexFit is exactly what it sounds like: a tracker men wear at the base of their penis during sex to transmit calories burned and thrusts per minute to a free app via Bluetooth.\nWhile this is a step up from an app, Private Gym comes with a weighted penis ring that helps men strengthen their pelvic muscles.\nShould this prototype not make it to the market, men still have fitness program Private Gym For Men."}
