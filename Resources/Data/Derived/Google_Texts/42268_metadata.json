They want a full-time job, but they can\u2019t find one \u2014 a sign that the economy is still in full-on recovery since the 2007 recession, The Boston Globereports. According to the Labor Department, 7 million Americans are currently forced to work part-time because they can\u2019t find full-time work. This is about 3 million more than in 2007.\n\nIt might be cause to worry, experts say. The numbers indicate that part-time work might comprise a \u201cnew normal,\u2019\u2019 where companies are relying more on part-time, temporary, or contract employees instead of full-time employees. In most cases, the former don\u2019t qualify for health insurance and benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, might have something to do with this, The Globe reports. Employers may be more reluctant to bring on full-time people if they are required to provide them with insurance.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just restaurants and retail ramping up their use of part-timers. Labor Department numbers show that in finance, the number of involuntary part-time workers increased 75 percent between 2007 and 2013. In the hospital industry, the amount has doubled since 2007.\n\nKate Nelson, 58, of Beverly, works as a part-time instructor at a community college and a training consultant to nonprofits. She told the Globe she should be in her prime earning years, but doesn\u2019t have a full-time job to show for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with the part-time world, but I still feel like I have a lot to contribute,\u2019\u2019 she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There\u2019s a historically high number of part-time workers who can\u2019t find full-time work.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "There\u2019s a historically high number of part-time workers who can\u2019t find full-time work.", "title": "Involuntary Part-Time Workers At Historic High", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/BDC_b_logo_transparent_background_og.jpg", "creator": "@BostonDotCom", "site": "@BostonDotCom", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/smalltile.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "There\u2019s a historically high number of part-time workers who can\u2019t find full-time work.", "title": "Involuntary Part-Time Workers At Historic High", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/iStock_000050952624_Large-850x478.jpg", "url": "https://www.boston.com/jobs/jobs-news/2014/11/24/involuntary-part-time-workers-at-historic-high", "type": "article"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "section": "Jobs", "tag": "Jobs News", "published_time": "2014-11-24T16:34:43-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mediumtile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9e6\"", "article_summary": "There are a historically high number of involuntary part-time workers across the country right now.\nLabor Department numbers show that in finance, the number of involuntary part-time workers increased 75 percent between 2007 and 2013.\nAccording to the Labor Department, 7 million Americans are currently forced to work part-time because they can\u2019t find full-time work.\nShe told the Globe she should be in her prime earning years, but doesn\u2019t have a full-time job to show for it.\nThe numbers indicate that part-time work might comprise a \u201cnew normal,\u2019\u2019 where companies are relying more on part-time, temporary, or contract employees instead of full-time employees."}
