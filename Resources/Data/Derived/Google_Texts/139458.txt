Sioux Falls, SD

The owner of a South Dakota-based dietary supplement business has been charged with allegedly rebranding and selling Mexico-manufactured pills that were the subject of a U.S. recall.



Stanley Brower is accused of tearing off the labels on bottles of the recalled Mexican pain-relieving supplement, Reumofan Plus, and selling them under the brand WOW.



The pills have been recalled because they have been linked to cases of bleeding, stroke and even death.



The pills were long marketed as "100 percent natural" remedies for arthritis and muscle pain. But the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 warned consumers against taking them after it was discovered that the products actually contained several prescription drugs.



The 68-year-old Brower has pleaded not guilty to two federal charges and is scheduled to face trial in April.
