That non-profit health insurer was set up to serve Iowa and Nebraska under Obamacare, but Gerhart made the decision to shut it down after determining it didn\u2019t have enough money to operate.\n\nCoOportunity covered 120,000 people in Nebraska and Iowa before going bust last year. It collapsed without the capital to support itself after amassing $150-million in liabilities.\n\nGerhart\u2019s spokesman, Chance McElhaney, says the concern now is the money that was left over.\n\nMcElhaney says the lawsuit is based on where the federal government stands compared to other creditors when it comes to the money. Gerhart says the feds believe they should be paid first.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has taken the position that they have a super-priority ahead of all other creditors,\u201d McElhaney explains. \u201cThe insurance commissioner\u2026believes otherwise, that they are not the super creditor, vis-a-vis all other creditors.\u201d\n\nMcElhaney says the money would first go to the guarantee associations that paid the medical claims, but ultimately the states could end up on the hook if not paid from the liquidation funds.\n\n\u201cIt would be a direct impact of $20-million to the State of Iowa \u2014 about $40-million to state of Nebraska \u2014 for $60-million total,\u201d McElhaney says.\n\nThe federal government is claiming it is not subject to the authority of the Iowa district court, which would force the proceedings into federal court. McElhaney says a court hearing has not yet been set.\n\nTwelve of the 23 health cooperatives established under the Affordable Care Act failed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nebraska Radio Network", "description": "It\u2019s still unclear if Nebraska will follow suit with tens of millions of dollars at stake, but Iowa\u2019s Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart is filing a lawsuit against the U.S. Department\u2026", "title": "Lawsuit targets feds over failed CoOportunity, Nebraska could owe $40-million", "url": "http://nebraskaradionetwork.com/2016/05/05/lawsuit-targets-feds-over-failed-cooportunity-nebraska-could-owe-millions/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/cdn.nebraskaradionetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CoOp.jpg", "identifier": "http://cdn.nebraskaradionetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CoOp.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-05T11:00:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T14:57:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.nebraskaradionetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CoOp.jpg?w=1400", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The federal government is claiming it is not subject to the authority of the Iowa district court, which would force the proceedings into federal court.\nCoOportunity covered 120,000 people in Nebraska and Iowa before going bust last year.\n\u201cIt would be a direct impact of $20-million to the State of Iowa \u2014 about $40-million to state of Nebraska \u2014 for $60-million total,\u201d McElhaney says.\nThe suit focuses on the way millions of dollars are divided up from the liquidated CoOportunity insurance exchange.\nMcElhaney says the lawsuit is based on where the federal government stands compared to other creditors when it comes to the money."}
