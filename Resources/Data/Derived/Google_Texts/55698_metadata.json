Petrini, senior vice president of Public Affairs at Yale-New Haven Hospital, said after taking a careful look at finances following dramatic state budget cuts, the hospital has decided to close facilities in East Haven on Foxon Road and Branford on North Main Street.\n\nNo other facilities operated by the hospital are scheduled to be closed, Petrini said\n\n\u201cWe are working very hard to manage the type of cuts that came down,\u201d Petrini said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClosing the clinics will help the hospital save approximately $1 million, Petrini said. The hospital took a brunt of the cuts made to hospitals in the state: of the $105 million cut in hospital funding, 56 percent, or about $58 million, was for Yale-New Haven Hospital, Petrini said.\n\nPetrini said about 31 employees at the two sites will be affected by the closure and have been informed of the hospital\u2019s decision. He said that the hospital is making an effort to \u201cfind positions within our existing vacancies in the health system.\u201d\n\nClinic Associate Director Debbie Borisjuk confirmed employees at the facility at 317 Foxon Road in East Haven have been informed of the hospital\u2019s plan to shut down the clinic, but declined further comment. An employee at the Branford outpatient facility at 84 N. Main St. also confirmed employees have been told about the closure, without providing further comment.\n\nPatients receiving services from the two sites can continue to receive assistance at the hospital\u2019s clinic in North Haven at 6 Devine St., Petrini said. They also can seek care at other hospital clinics in Hamden and New Haven.\n\nThe facility in East Haven provides urgent care and occupational health services, while the Branford location also offers occupational health services in addition to physical therapy.\n\nThe hospital system is the biggest provider of Medicaid in the state. Medicaid enrollment has increased significantly after requirements were expanded several years ago, Petrini said, but while enrollment has grown, funding has dropped dramatically.\n\nAccording to the federal Medicaid website, as of March 2015, Connecticut has 726,253 people enrolled in the program.\n\nDavid Dearborn, a spokesman for the state Department of Social Services, said that as of May, there has been a sharp increase from the 592,128 enrolled in 2012. More people than ever before are insured due to enactment of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded the Medicaid program, Dearborn said.\n\n\u201cThis means that hospitals and affiliated services are seeing more insured patients and fewer uninsured,\u201d Dearborn said in an email. \u201cAs more (state) residents have health coverage overall, the more revenue sources hospitals see and the less uncompensated care they have to provide.\u201d\n\nPetrini said the hospital must file a certificate of need before closing the two facilities, which he said hospital officials soon will do. The certificate is reviewed by the state, which makes a final decision.\n\nPetrini said he hopes hospital cuts are addressed when the state legislature holds a special session this month.\n\nReach Esteban L.
