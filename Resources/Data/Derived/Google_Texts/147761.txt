Several witnesses said the support eliminating first-dollar Medigap coverage.

The idea of overhauling the traditional Medicare plan design in ways that could kneecap the Medicare supplement (Medigap) market kept coming up today during a House Energy & Commerce health subcommittee hearing on Medicare physician pay reform.

The subcommittee organized the hearing to look at ways to solve the Medicare physician pay "sustainable growth rate" (SGR) problem. Years ago, members of an early Congress tried to rein in Medicare spending by holding increases in Medicare physician pay to the growth rate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Since then, physician pay has increased much faster than GDP, and Congress has never had the heart to make an SGR-related adjustment stick.
