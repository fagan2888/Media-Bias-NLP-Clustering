That\u2019s like the Ayatollah Khamenei saying my position is the same as his on the Iranian nuclear deal. It is laughingly, blazingly, on its face false.\u201d\n\nCruz also addressed his stance on H1B visas, telling Gallagher he thought that the program had been abused to bring in \u201crelatively low-skilled IT workers, sometimes with a bachelor\u2019s degree, sometimes from a diploma mill.\u201d He argued that those workers replaced American workers.\n\n\u201cThat is utterly unacceptable, it is wrong, it is an abuse of the program, it is a manifestation of frankly the lawlessness of the Obama administration,\u201d Cruz argued. He said that he would not allow such abuse if he were elected president.\n\nyoutube.com ID: 7335370\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4075903, "userid": 2870875}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "\"That\u2019s like Obama saying my position is the same as his on Obamacare.
