So it was not really a surprise when CIS awarded Erbe its annual journalism prize this year for her \u201creporting on immigration\u2019s effects on health care, poverty, and natural resources, as well as on birth tourism.\u201d\n\nErbe, who was given the award Tuesday at a gathering at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., told the audience in her acceptance speech that she \u201cno longer\u201d considers herself a progressive, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t believe the progressives really support the environment.\u201d\n\nErbe\u2019s speech explicitly acknowledged the coordination of anti-immigrant activism among various organizations associated with CIS, including the \u201cgreenwashing\u201d group Progressives For Immigration Reform (PFIR), and Numbers USA, which along with CIS and another nativist outfit, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, are all part of a network devoted to opposing immigration.\n\nErbe acknowledged that she works closely with CIS and Numbers USA, and openly accepts their frequently dubious studies as accurate: \u201cWe work with them on many projects,\u201d she said, praising them for their growing influence, \u201cshown by the growth of their website and email list they run a very necessary organization with now more than 2 million, I believe.\u201d\n\nShe explained her thinking on immigration, saying she doesn\u2019t have a problem with immigrants as people, but as a mass phenomenon: \u201cAnyway, immigrants are fabulous. Immigrants make the best Americans. They work the hardest for the least amount of money. They contribute so much to this country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the journalistic community, if you dare raise any negative impact of mass immigration that we have now, both legal and illegal, you are shunted aside as some kind of strange person who has \u2013 you know, has a very strange approach to reporting.\u201d\n\nErbe said she became concerned about immigration mostly as an environmental issue, and came to part ways with liberals over the issue of overpopulation, \u201cbecause they support open-border immigration, pretty much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly came of age as a progressive, but I am no longer a progressive because I don\u2019t believe the progressives really support the environment, and to me, that\u2019s the most important issue. If we don\u2019t deal with climate change and human impact on the planet, there\u2019s not going to be a planet in 50 years, it\u2019s my personal belief,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t \u2013 you say that in journalistic or political circles, and people look at you cross-eyed. And some \u2013 and we get objections from viewers sometimes. We also get great, you know, emails saying, thank you for doing this; I have \u2013 I hear this nowhere else on TV. But we also get people who say \u2013 you know, call me bad names and say that our \u2013 that begins with R \u2013 and call us out for just reporting what are the facts.\u201d\n\nThose facts, as Erbe sees it:\n\nWe\u2019re not dealing with the fact that we are the major contributors to greenhouse gases and what we do \u2013 and this is our cultural disadvantage, but when we do take immigrants from developing nations who have very small carbon footprints, we turn them into the rest of us, who have huge carbon footprints, and turn them into greater contributors to global warming. And we need to do something somewhere. We\u2019re not doing anything on any of the fronts. Immigration is just one of the fronts where we need to start controlling thing \u2013 things, but again, is anybody going to listen? Does anybody care?
