With the facts just a click away, there\u2019s no excuse for the liberal media to continue misrepresenting H.B. 2. Yet that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing \u2014 almost a month after Governor Pat McCrory (R-N.C.) signed the bill into law. Unfortunately, the truth about the measure \u2014 that it gives businesses the freedom to set their own bathroom policies \u2014 doesn\u2019t fit the Left\u2019s narrative. So they ignore it.\n\n[Sunday] on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Chuck Todd took his interview with McCrory down a familiar path, distorting the most basic aspects of the law. \u201cDoes it bother you,\u201d Todd said at one point, \u201cthat basically North Carolina and Mississippi is the only other state to side with you on this?\u201d For starters, McCrory stopped him, Mississippi passed a religious liberty law \u2014 not a privacy measure. Secondly, he fired back, a lot more states agree with North Carolina than don\u2019t. \u201cThis is not just a North Carolina debate. This is a national debate that\u2019s just come on in literally the last three months\u2026 We have 29 states that also don\u2019t have this type of mandate on private business, including the state of New York [one of its most vocal opponents].\u201d\n\nStill, Todd argued, what the legislature did in overturning Charlotte\u2019s ordinance was an overreach. If anyone is overreaching, McCrory pointed out, it\u2019s the people who think the government should force companies to adopt their confused ideas of gender and sexuality. CEOs are free to do that on their own \u2014 but, the governor said firmly, \u201cIt\u2019s not government\u2019s business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower practices should be. Not only the private business, but also the YMCA and other nonprofit organizations\u2026 I don\u2019t think the government ought to be the H.R. director for every business, whether it be in Charlotte or whether it be in Greensboro or whether it be in Boone, North Carolina.\u201d\n\nAs the mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, McCrory knows where voters side on this issue \u2014 and it isn\u2019t with cultural bullies. In a strong rebuttal to the Washington Post, the governor explained that the same activists beating up North Carolina in the press are conveniently ignoring their own hypocrisy. \u201c[T]he Human Rights Campaign has led a coordinated assault and smear campaign. This national special-interest group, which is funded by anonymous donors, is attempting to bully companies, entertainers, and anyone else who disagrees with its agenda. Our state is unfairly being used as its political pawn. However, the HRC remains silent while the same individuals and organizations sell their products, make their products or take entertainment dollars from countries like China, Cuba, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore \u2014 countries with deplorable human rights records, especially toward the gay and lesbian community.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, I took my own turn trying to set the record straight on laws like Mississippi\u2019s. There, Governor Phil Byrant (R) and state leaders agreed that the government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of punishing people who disagree with same-sex marriage \u2014 whether they\u2019re a public official, entrepreneur, minister, or wedding vendor. In a sit-down with \u201cMatter of Fact\u2019s\u201d Fernando Espuelas (video below) I tried explaining whose civil rights were being violated in cases like Aaron and Melissa Klein\u2019s. \u201cHaving business is a commercial activity that does not exclude groups,\u201d Fernando argued. But then what you\u2019re doing, I explained, is limiting religious freedom at the door of the marketplace. If you listen closely to his answer, you\u2019ll see where the Left is going next with this agenda \u2014 which is to threaten the business licenses of anyone who doesn\u2019t subscribe to same-sex marriage.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with people like Governor John Kasich (R-Ohio), who keep telling Americans to \u201cget over it\u201d \u201cchill out,\u201d and \u201cmove on.\u201d The Left doesn\u2019t plan on \u201cgetting over it\u201d until every person is forced to celebrate this perversion. So in reality, what Kasich is advocating is for Christians to move on. That\u2019s difficult to do when the government is taking away your home or life\u2019s savings.\n\nFortunately for Americans, other leaders do understand what\u2019s at stake in this debate is nothing less than our freedom. Take a minute and thank one of them, Governor Pat McCrory, for continuing to defend the First Amendment rights of North Carolina \u2014 and being a shining example to other states in the process.

Also, if you\u2019re part of a Culture Impact Team in the hundreds of churches FRC has in North Carolina that helped get H.B. 2 passed, circulate this to your members and encourage them to show their appreciation too!\n\nOriginally published here.\n\nA Cure for What Fails You\n\nThe November elections spell the end for a lot more than the Obama administration. It could mean the end of one of its worst mistakes as well. The two-term failure of Obamacare may not last beyond its namesake, experts suggest, now that insurers are jumping the sinking ship. A few months ago, plenty of people panicked when UnitedHealth Group \u2014 crippled by more than $1 billion in exchange losses \u2014 floated the prospect of exiting the president\u2019s bomb of a coverage system. Now, it seems the company is taking the first steps to a full-fledged exodus by pulling out of Georgia and Arkansas in 2017.\n\nOthers, who have intently watched the nation\u2019s largest insurer, are also threatening to leave. Humana executives say they may also sever ties, which, the Motley Fool warns, could lead to the law\u2019s complete collapse. Already, they write, \u201cIn 2016, the risk corridor wound up being underfunded by more than $2 billion, leading more than half of Obamacare\u2019s approved health care cooperatives to shut their doors\u2026 If the largest health insurer in the country pulls out of Obamacare because it can\u2019t turn a profit, then what sort of sustainable future does the program really have?\u201d\n\nWith enrollment well below the government\u2019s expectations and premiums more unaffordable than ever, it\u2019s no wonder House Republicans are kicking their Obamacare replacement plans into high gear. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) has been part of a core group working to replace the president\u2019s miserable excuse for a health system since it became law. But finding suitable alternative has been a complicated process, but Upton promises that conservatives are making good headway. \u201cGive us a little time,\u201d he said, \u201canother month or so.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, if the market doesn\u2019t destroy Obamacare, the current crop of presidential candidates will. Only Hillary Clinton has said she would leave the unpopular law in place. Even so, Motley points out, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the fragile system collapses on itself. \u201cThe only near-certainty at the moment is that Obamacare\u2019s future looks as a shaky as ever.\u201d And anyone who\u2019s a fan of freedom, conscience, and lower premiums should be happy to hear that!\n\nOriginally published here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's amazing with technology like ours that people still refuse to take a few minutes to read for themselves a bill like North Carolina's.
