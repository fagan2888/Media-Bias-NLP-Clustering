We’ll see how long Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) keeps this up.

Senate Democrats have completely lost it over the Supreme Court’s narrow ruling granting some for-profit religious employers exceptions under Obamacare’s HHS mandate. You’d be hard pressed to learn from them, for example, that Hobby Lobby provides 16 of the 20 forms of contraception required by federal law to its employees, and only objected to compulsorily providing the other four because, in their view, such drugs are abortifacients. In other words, freedom of conscience was the central argument in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, and the plaintiffs ultimately won. But the Left cannot abide by or accept this ruling.

Most egregiously, Senate Democrats continue to lie and mislead the public about the Hobby Lobby decision for political gain. Hence this:

In point of fact, the type of birth control shown in the infographic above was freely provided to Hobby Lobby employees before the controversy even began. Perhaps, then, the California Democrat should take it down.
