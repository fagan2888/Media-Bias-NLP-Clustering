They shouldn\u2019t have been. While it\u2019s true that Ryan\u2014an enthusiastic backer of the 2008 bank bailout\u2014is a reliable vote for the agenda of the Wall Street speculators who fund his campaigns, he wasn\u2019t going against his political patrons when he joined 143 other House Republicans in voting \u201cno.\u201d Rather, the Budget Committee chairman\u2014who just reported raising more than $1 million in fresh campaign funds in the third quarter of 2013\u2014was voting to strengthen his own hand as he steps into the ring for the next stage of an inside-the-Beltway fight that is far from finished.\n\nThe deal that ended the shutdown set up a high-stakes conference committee on budget issues. If there is to be a \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d this is where it will be generated. And Ryan\u2014the most prominent of the fourteen Democrats, fourteen Republicans and two independents on the committee\u2014is in the thick of it.\n\nThe Budget Committee chairman says it would be \u201cpremature to get into exactly how we\u2019re going to\u201d sort out budget issues.\n\nBut no one should have any doubts about the hard bargain he will drive for. In the midst of the shutdown, Ryan jumped the gun by penning a Wall Street Journal op-ed that proposed: \u201cReforms to entitlement programs and the tax code\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHere are just a few ideas to get the conversation started,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cWe could ask the better off to pay higher premiums for Medicare. We could reform Medigap plans to encourage efficiency and cut costs. And we could ask federal employees to contribute more to their own retirement.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nTranslation: Get ready for the radical reshaping of Medicare so that it is no longer a universal program. Make way for more price-gouging by the private companies that sell supplemental insurance. Launch a new assault on public employees who have already been hit with wage freezes and furloughs.\n\nAnd Ryan will not stop there.\n\nHe never does.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Democrats on the conference committee\u2014led by Senate Budget Committee chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington\u2014must be exceptionally wary.\n\n\u201cChairman Ryan knows I\u2019m not going to vote for his budget, and I know he\u2019s not going to vote for mine,\u201d says Murray. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find the common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on and that\u2019s our goal.\u201d\n\nThe thing to remember that Ryan is working to get cuts to earned-benefit programs onto that common ground.\n\nRyan cast his \u201cno\u201d vote on the deal that set up the conference committee in order to begin organizing his troops for a fight that will set up the next shutdown and debt-ceiling struggles. The committee has a deadline of December 13. That makes its report\u2014or the lack of one\u2014the first deadline on a schedule that proceeds toward new continuing resolution and debt-ceiling votes in January and February. That creates tremendous pressure for a deal, and Ryan\u2019s at the ready.\n\nThat answer to his supplications must be a firm \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, is proposing. Sanders, one of a member of the conference committee says: \u201cit is imperative that this new budget helps us create the millions of jobs we desperately need and does not balance the budget on the backs of working people, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor\u2026\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 office notes: \u201cThe Senate budget protects Medicare while the House version would end Medicare as we know it by providing coupons for private health insurance. Unlike the House budget, the Senate resolution does not repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would prevent more than 20 million Americans from getting health insurance. The House version would eliminate grants for up to 1 million college students while the Senate plan protects Pell grants. The House version would kick up to 24 million Americans off of Medicaid while the Senate budget would protect their benefits. The Senate budget calls for new revenue while the House version would provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks mainly for the wealthiest Americans and profitable corporations offset by increased taxes on the middle class.\u201d\n\nRyan would be more than happy to settle for a \u201ccommon ground\u201d agreement that opens the way for a little bit of privatization, a little bit of movement toward vouchers, a little bit of means testing, a little bit of an increase in the retirement age. But if he gets that, the big \u201cblink\u201d that everyone was talking about during the shutdown fight will have happened.\n\nIf that is where this thing ends, it might not be the Democrats who get the last laugh.\n\nIt might yet be a Republican named Paul Ryan.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paul_ryan3_ap_img_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "John Nichols", "description": "House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan plots to use a powerful conference committee to assault Medicare, Social Security and more.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan plots to use a powerful conference committee to assault Medicare, Social Security and more.", "title": "Beware of Paul Ryan\u2019s Lose-a-Battle, Win-a-War Strategy", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/beware-paul-ryans-lose-battle-win-war-strategy/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paul_ryan3_ap_img_0.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 471}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:52:31+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan plots to use a powerful conference committee to assault Medicare, Social Security and more.", "title": "Beware of Paul Ryan\u2019s Lose-a-Battle, Win-a-War Strategy", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/beware-paul-ryans-lose-battle-win-war-strategy/", "image": {"height": 471, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paul_ryan3_ap_img_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paul_ryan3_ap_img_0.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "October 18th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Beware of Paul Ryan\u2019s Lose-a-Battle, Win-a-War Strategy", "keywords": "Paul Ryan, medicare, social security, House of representatives, conference committee, John Nichols, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 108726, "sailthru.tags": "Budgets,Congress,Politics,The Right,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2013-10-18T20:04:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:52:31+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/JohnNichols/"}, "sailthru.description": "The House Budget Committee chair plots to use a powerful conference committee to assault Medicare, Social Security and more.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paul_ryan3_ap_img_0-615x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb700\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why the Democrats on the conference committee\u2014led by Senate Budget Committee chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington\u2014must be exceptionally wary.\nThe Budget Committee chairman says it would be \u201cpremature to get into exactly how we\u2019re going to\u201d sort out budget issues.\nThe House version would kick up to 24 million Americans off of Medicaid while the Senate budget would protect their benefits.\nThe House version would eliminate grants for up to 1 million college students while the Senate plan protects Pell grants.\n\u201cChairman Ryan knows I\u2019m not going to vote for his budget, and I know he\u2019s not going to vote for mine,\u201d says Murray."}
