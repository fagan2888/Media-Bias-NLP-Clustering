Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Paul reported 215 patients on Sunday, a record 24-hour volume, due in large part to flu cases. Children\u2019s Hospital in Minneapolis set an ER record the following day.\n\n\u201cFlu is here,\u201d said Patsy Stinchfield, an infectious disease expert for Children\u2019s. \u201cIt has hit hard.\u201d\n\nSome of the surge is due to patients who are acting based on caution or because of news reports of a harsh flu season, officials said, and are at low risk for serious complications.\n\nBut Regions also has filled its inpatient beds with high-risk patients with breathing problems and other complications, said Dr. Bjorn Peterson, a Regions ER physician. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily seeing any more people in the ER than we normally would,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have anywhere to move them. \u2026 It\u2019s just backed up throughout the system.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Health on Thursday declared flu widespread in the state, and reported 185 flu-related hospitalizations as of Dec. 6. While that designation is normal in most flu seasons, it typically doesn\u2019t occur until January \u2014 after the traditional holiday germ-swapping at family gatherings and end-of-year parties.\n\nThe state also reported 19 schools with flu-like outbreaks last week. Stinchfield said she has heard reports of more than 80 schools making such announcements this week, but the exact count won\u2019t be known until the state Health Department\u2019s next flu report on Dec. 18.\n\nTracy Holtan of Edina has been worried all week about her 13-year-old daughter, Isabella, whose symptoms included severe dizziness and at one point delirious speech. She took her daughter Tuesday to the University of Minnesota children\u2019s hospital.\n\n\u201cAs we were sitting in the waiting room,\u201d Holtan said, \u201cBella said it felt like the room was spinning and she felt the worst she had ever felt.\u201d\n\nAlternatives to the ER\n\nHoltan urged the doctors to conduct a flu test \u2014 which isn\u2019t routine because the result doesn\u2019t necessarily alter the way doctors will treat the symptoms \u2014 and said it ended up positive for influenza A. Her daughter\u2019s fever has broken, but she remained weak and coughing on Friday.\n\n\u201cBella is my third and youngest child so I\u2019ve seen almost everything,\u201d Holtan said. \u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nBecause of the ER backlog, doctors are encouraging people at lower risk of flu complications to consider alternatives for care. That includes nurse hot lines and online clinics such as HealthPartners\u2019 Virtuwell, where patients can get expert advice without exposing others to the virus.\n\nWhile antibiotics can treat bacterial strep infections, there are no comparable medications for viral influenza infections. One option is the drug Tamiflu, but it must be given within the first three days of illness and it is generally conserved for people at higher risk of complications from infection \u2014 a group that includes the elderly, children 2 and younger, and adults with chronic illnesses.\n\n\u201cFor everyone else, you really just need to try to ride it out at home \u2014 as miserable as you might be,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nPart of the problem this season is that an A strain of influenza that is circulating is poorly matched to the vaccine, and is also known to cause more severe illnesses, particularly in the elderly and in young children.\n\nBut Stinchfield noted that the vaccine is still available and offers some protection. \u201cIf (people) haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine yet, it\u2019s not too late at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most patients don't require advanced care, but two hospitals reported record numbers of visits.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Most patients don't require advanced care, but two hospitals reported record numbers of visits.", "title": "Flu cases jam Twin Cities hospitals", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/flu-cases-jam-twin-cities-hospitals/285678121/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141835274151299.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141835274151299.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most patients don't require advanced care, but two hospitals reported record numbers of visits.", "title": "Flu cases jam Twin Cities hospitals", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/flu-cases-jam-twin-cities-hospitals/285678121/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141835274151299.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141835274151299.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Minnesota"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "flu,influenza season,vaccine,Minnesota"}, "article_summary": "Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Paul reported 215 patients on Sunday, a record 24-hour volume, due in large part to flu cases.\nRegions had 29 cases of flu-like illness in its ER on Thursday, and more than 100 cases since Monday.\nHundreds of patients with flu-like illness have crowded emergency rooms at Twin Cities hospitals this week, the latest sign of an early and aggressive start to the influenza season.\nEast metro hospitals briefly closed their emergency rooms and diverted ambulances to other hospitals, and Regions Hospital in St. Paul converted a clinic into an overflow area so it had room for all of its ER patients.\n\u201cFlu is here,\u201d said Patsy Stinchfield, an infectious disease expert for Children\u2019s."}
