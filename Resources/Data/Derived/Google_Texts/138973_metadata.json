It\u2019s one of the only times these candidates will get together, to each answer the same questions on issues including the minimum wage and healthcare.\n\nIt\u2019s a cluttered race, and polls show the leading Democrat, Edwin Edwards, way ahead, with four Republicans clustered a dozen or more percentage points behind him. Monday\u2019s Press Club event was a round robin affair, not a debate, so candidates had to work at differentiating themselves as they stepped up to the podium, one at a time.\n\nThe oldest candidate, 87-year-old Edwards, is running on his experience.\n\n\u201cIf you liked the fact that I was governor for 16 years, and what I accomplished, then that\u2019s the kind of congressman I\u2019m going to be,\u201d Edwards told the luncheon attendees.\n\nThe youngest candidate, 28-year-old Paul Dietzel, made it clear that he\u2019s not Edwin Edwards\u2014or Jindal\u2019s former coastal chief Garret Graves.\n\n\u201cCareer politicians who\u2019ve never held a job in the private sector for any length of time make poor political leaders,\u201d Dietzel observed. \u201cAs all of you know, I don\u2019t have any government experience. I\u2019ve never taken a paycheck from the government.\u201d\n\nThe lone woman still in the race, State Representative Lenar\u2019 Whitney, stuck with her usual theme.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m considered to be the most conservative elected official and I\u2019m the most conservative running in this race,\u201d Whitney said.\n\nSo the candidates were each asked to define \u201cconservative\u201d. Whitney answered first.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Founding Fathers\u2019 principles, following the Constitution, states\u2019 rights and eliminating all the power that the federal government has,\u201d is what she believes the term means.\n\nDietzel\u2019s definition is similar: \u201cI think \u2018conservative\u2019 can really be summed up in a few words: God, family, country, and hard work.\u201d\n\nGraves said, \u201cIt\u2019s common sense. That\u2019s what we need in Washington.\u201d\n\nEdwards defined both \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d.\n\n\u201cConservative: one who is happy with the status quo,\u201d Edwards said, adding \u201cLiberals, on the other hand, see situations that might be made available to help people who do not have enough.\u201d\n\nState Senator Dan Claitor said there are different types of conservatives.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s fiscal conservatives and social conservatives and somebody that encompasses the whole package,\u201d and Claitor says that\u2019s how he defines himself.\n\nCandidates were then quizzed on issues, and differences quickly became harder to spot. Regarding the marriage of same sex couples, all four Republicans\u2014Claitor, Dietzel, Whitney and Graves\u2014say Louisiana voters already spoke in 2004, with a constitutional amendment defining marriage as \u201cbetween one man and one woman\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is a states\u2019 rights issue and the people of Louisiana have spoken on that,\u201d Claitor summed it up succinctly.\n\nEdwards views it differently.\n\n\u201cI think we should have a civil union for people of the same sex who want to spend their lives together in a loving relationship, and give them the same benefits that married couples have,\u201d the former governor said.\n\nOn raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, Edwards supports it, while the GOP candidates say no. Graves explained the Republican stance.\n\n\u201cIf you increase the minimum wage all you\u2019re doing is increasing the prices of goods and services.\u201d Graves went on to say, \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be making minimum wage when they have families. They need to be working harder, and they need to be advancing their careers through hard work.\u201d\n\nThe candidates appeared were aligned by party when it comes to keeping Obamacare. Claitor went first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to predict one, two, three, four nos, and one potential yes,\u201d Claitor pointed to himself and the other Republicans in turn, and then to Edwards, the Democrat.\n\nHe was right. Claitor, Dietzel, Graves and Whitney each said they would work to repeal the federal healthcare overhaul, whereas Edwards basically told them to \u201cget over it\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll of us together can\u2019t repeal Obamacare,\u201d Edwards said forcefully. \u201cIt was passed by the Congress, signed by the President and validated by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nWith the four top Republicans sounding so similar, there\u2019s no telling who will make a likely runoff with the ex-con/ex-governor. Early voting in the primary starts today, and the election itself is just two weeks from now.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The Baton Rouge Press Club hosted a forum Monday for the top five contenders in the 6th congressional district race.
