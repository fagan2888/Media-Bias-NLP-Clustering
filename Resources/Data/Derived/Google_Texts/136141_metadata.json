Swain was shot four times Friday while trying to enter a home to make a welfare check. Another firefighter, John Ulmschneider, was fatally shot.\n\nThe fire department previously said that firefighters had gone to the Temple Hills home after the brother of the man who lived there told authorities he was concerned about the man. When the firefighters arrived, the person inside was unresponsive, so they decided to force entry. As that was happening, the person inside fired several rounds.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A firefighter shot while responding to a call for help at a home in a Maryland suburb of Washington and has been moved out of intensive care.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Firefighter-shot-responding-to-call-in-Maryland-improving--376000611.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/john+ernest+ulmschneider.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A firefighter shot while responding to a call for help at a home in a Maryland suburb of Washington and has been moved out of intensive care.", "title": "Firefighter shot responding to call in Maryland improving"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A firefighter shot while responding to a call for help at a home in a Maryland suburb of Washington and has been moved out of intensive care.", "title": "Firefighter shot responding to call in Maryland improving", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Firefighter-shot-responding-to-call-in-Maryland-improving--376000611.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/john+ernest+ulmschneider.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Firefighter shot responding to call in Maryland improving", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Firefighter shot responding to call"}, "article_summary": "A firefighter shot while responding to a call for help at a home in a Maryland suburb of Washington and has been moved out of intensive care.\nAs that was happening, the person inside fired several rounds.\nWhen the firefighters arrived, the person inside was unresponsive, so they decided to force entry.\nThe Prince George's County fire department said in a statement Sunday that 19-year-old volunteer firefighter Kevin Swain continues to show signs of improvement.\nSwain was shot four times Friday while trying to enter a home to make a welfare check."}
