It\u2019s also a self-fulfilling one, as George Packer illustrates in his latest New Yorker article.\n\n\u201c[T]he 2016 campaign doesn\u2019t seem like fun to me. Watching Marco Rubio try to overcome his past support for immigration reform to win enough conservative votes to become the Mainstream Alternative to the Invisible Primary Leader\u2014who, if there is one, will be a candidate named Bush\u2014doesn\u2019t seem like fun,\u201d Packer writes. \u201cNor does analyzing whether Chris Christie can become something more than the Factional Favorite of moderate Republicans, or whether Ted Cruz\u2019s impressive early fundraising will make him that rare thing, a Factional Favorite with an outside chance to win.\u201d\n\nA year of covering the 2016 race like this would fossilize my soul, and reading a year\u2019s worth of analysis like this will drain all the precious fluids from my eyeballs. But to argue that 2016 will be boring because campaign reporting conventions are boring is to drain oneself of agency. In fact, Packer could liberate himself from the specter of watching 2016 through the prism of those reporting conventions by simply following his own advice.\n\n\u201cThe issues remain huge and urgent,\u201d Packer writes, before launching into a list of eight things that would liven the next year and a half. Six of them are genuinely fantastical, but the last two?\n\n7. Political reporters should embrace the value of objective truth, and adopt a policy of never repeating a party or a candidate\u2019s dubious or false statement without exposing it in the next sentence. 8. Policies and their consequences should be the main story, tactics the footnote. Coverage of a candidate\u2019s positioning on this or that issue should include a reminder of the context: notwithstanding No. 6 above, the differences between the two parties are clear, stark, and uniform across almost all issues.\n\nIt is entirely within Packer\u2019s power to conceive of and cover the 2016 campaign in this way, rather than conceiving of it as the sum of the worst journalism it inspires. If you place this election in its proper political and historical contexts, it\u2019s insanely interesting, and has stakes that rival (though don\u2019t quite match) those of 2012.\n\nBecause Republicans will maintain control of the House of Representatives under almost any circumstances, and because her regulatory agenda would resemble Obama\u2019s, a Hillary Clinton victory wouldn\u2019t be a liberal policy watershed like Obama\u2019s was. But it would be momentous in other ways\u2014most obviously for women\u2019s leadership and as a ratification of America\u2019s comfort with electing non-white-males generally\u2014not recoiling from Obama\u2019s presidency back into the old white guy pattern. Her victory would make Obama\u2019s reorientation of the Democratic party semi-permanent, much as George H.W. Bush\u2019s election in 1988 crystalized Ronald Reagan in the Republican imagination.\n\nClinton would very likely be able to flip the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, and with successful leadership could ultimately help end the GOP's vicelike grip on Congress.\n\nA Republican president, by contrast, would enjoy immediate legislative and regulatory dividends. After cutting taxes, a Republican president would be able to do great damage to Obama\u2019s legacy. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz\u2019s candidacies carry with them the possibility of the country\u2019s first Latino president succeeding its first African American one. In eight years time, a Republican president would leave behind a Supreme Court tilted heavily to the right, with a durable 6-3, or possibly 7-2, conservative majority.\n\nThe candidates themselves won\u2019t lay out the stakes this nakedly, but this is what they\u2019ll be trying to communicate by repeating platitudes that understandably make reporters yawn. \u201cThe language of politics stays the same, and it is a dead language,\u201d Packer wrote. Sometimes it feels that way. But people who know how to translate from dead languages into living ones have supplied us with some of our most basic and crucial knowledge.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "If Mitt Romney had defeated President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, a lot of things would be very different today.
