Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown is set to pick up endorsements from New Hampshire’s GOP senator and two former governors of the state.

The campaign for Mr. Brown — a former senator from Massachusetts who switched his address to take on Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen — said Sen. Kelly Ayotte and former Republican governors Steve Merill and Craig Benson will offer their support at a cafe in Nashua, N.H.

“I’m honored to have earned the support of these respected New Hampshire leaders,” Mr. Brown said. “I’m looking forward to working with them toward a victory in the fall, and joining Senator Ayotte in the Senate to help her fight for more good-paying jobs, a repeal of Obamacare and restoring Granite State principles to our congressional delegation.”
