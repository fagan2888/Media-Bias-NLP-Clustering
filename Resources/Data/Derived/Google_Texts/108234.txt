WOLFSBURG, Germany — It’s been a bad week for German automakers. Volkswagen said Friday that a diesel emissions-cheating scandal would cost it an astounding $18.2 billion just for 2015, while Daimler revealed that U.S. authorities are sniffing around its tailpipes.

Both companies saw a niche with U.S. buyers who wanted performance, gas mileage and clean air. But there is growing evidence that neither was able to back up the claims without violating pollution standards.

On Thursday, Daimler said the U.S. Justice Department asked the company to investigate irregularities in diesel emissions in its Mercedes brand vehicles.

Volkswagen on Friday posted a net loss of 1.58 billion euro for 2015.

For 2016, Volkswagen said group revenue would fall as much as 5 percent, partly because of the emissions issue. It expects a “sharp decline” in passenger car revenue, the company said. The Associated Press, Dow Jones Newswires
