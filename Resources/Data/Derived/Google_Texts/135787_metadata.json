District officials said the revenue is needed because of a loss of revenue from the commercial fire alarm business and added costs from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVan Dorpe said the members of the district were \u201ca bit shocked\u201d by the result because they felt the referendum had been well-received by residents they had spoken to.\n\n\u201cWe did really well in places and really poorly in others,\u201d Van Dorpe said. \u201cMy personal sense is the information didn\u2019t get out across the whole district.\u201d\n\nThe money from a potential tax would not have been included in the budget for the fiscal year starting May 1, but because of the rejection, the chief said he was reducing his maintenance budget in the upcoming budget and he will not be putting money aside for vehicle replacement.\n\nThe budget for 2017-18 likely would include personnel cuts, he said.\n\nAlgonquin-Lake in the Hills Firefighters Local 3895 President Matt Burg said the union, who led the campaign to spread the word about the referendum, would support the chief and trustees if they chose to put the question on November\u2019s ballot.\n\n\u201cWe put together hundreds of hours of effort leading up into this, and we would continue to do that,\u201d Burg said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious there were some precincts that weren\u2019t in favor as much as others. I think it\u2019s our job to ensure people in those precincts receive and understand the message that several others have.\u201d\n\nThe next scheduled Board of Trustees meeting is Wednesday.\n\nIf you go\n\nWHAT: Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District Board of Trustees meeting\n\nWHEN: 7 to 9 p.m. Wednesday\n\nWHERE: 1020 W.
