(AP) - Gary Brown approached the dilapidated yellow station wagon in the Walmart parking lot slowly.\n\nA dog peered through the smudged glass, barking loudly, and Brown glimpsed a man sleeping on the front bench seat. He rapped gently on the window.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Brown said, after the man rolled it down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude or bother you.\u201d\n\nHe explained he was participating in an annual survey to count homeless people. The point-in-time survey would reveal approximate numbers of homeless in the county.\n\nEach January, agencies across the nation take a day to help the Department of Housing and Urban Development count the nation\u2019s homeless population.\n\nOn Tuesday, teams scoured Pendleton, Hermiston and surrounding areas. Brown and Steve Nelson, both from Veterans Affairs in Walla Walla, headed to Walmart, where they located the sleeping man, and then hiked Pendleton\u2019s River Parkway.\n\nJennifer Richards, who organized the local point-in-time count, searched parks and known camping spots along the river. She said she knows they didn\u2019t capture everyone.\n\n\u201cSome people are just off the grid,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make a really big effort to capture everyone we can.\u201d\n\nShe said the numbers of homeless appear to be dropping, though that may be a matter of better data collection and not double-counting people. Last year, the count revealed 171 homeless people in Umatilla County, down from 195 in 2012.\n\nOn Tuesday, the mercury had dropped to 29 degrees. Most homeless people evidently were couch surfing or hanging out at the library or other warm spots.\n\nBrown and Nelson strolled the parkway anyway, carrying data sheets on clipboards. They would gather basic information about each homeless person - their age, situation, amount of time they\u2019d been without stable housing and other details.\n\nBrown, an Air Force veteran with a long goatee, wore a leather jacket and knit cap to ward off the chill. He hailed a passing walker to ask if he\u2019d seen anyone who might be homeless. The man shook his head, but suggested checking Stillman Park up the path.\n\nBrown and Nelson both work in outreach to homeless veterans so they also looking for that subset. They said VA programs such as Housing First and Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing are steadily whittling away at veteran homelessness. Even so, the National Coalition for the Homeless estimates between 130,000 and 200,000 veterans are homeless on any given night in the U.S.\n\n\u201cVets are twice as likely as non-vets to be homeless,\u201d said Ron Opsal, supervisor of the Health Care for Homeless Veterans program at the VA. \u201cFemale veterans are four times as likely.\u201d\n\nHe estimated about 40 homeless veterans in Umatilla County. The 2013 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress said Oregon had one of the highest populations of homeless veterans at about 1,500 - others were Hawaii, California, Montana and Florida.\n\nBrown and Nelson followed the River Parkway past an empty Stillman Park looking for any homeless person, veteran or otherwise. Brown noticed dilapidated trailers and recreational vehicles across the river.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a unit here that could be considered permanent housing,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe chose an RV that had a windshield covered by a blanket and knocked on the door. They chatted with several people living in various trailers - most described their situation as temporary.\n\nLater, they learned that HUD\u2019s definition of homeless is rather narrow and doesn\u2019t include such living situations, unless there is no electricity or water. The definition also doesn\u2019t include people living with relatives or in a motel - basically just those living in parked cars, abandoned buildings, outside or in emergency shelters.\n\nRichards and her partner didn\u2019t find any homeless in parks or popular camping spots on Tuesday. Though weather had likely chased them inside, Richards said she was confident most would end up on someone\u2019s radar.\n\n\u201cThere is a network of agencies helping us capture people - the warming shelter, Domestic Violence Services, food pantries and others,\u201d Richards said.\n\nThis year\u2019s numbers won\u2019t be available for a while. In 2013, HUD\u2019s point-in-time count identified 13,822 homeless persons in Oregon.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: East Oregonian, http://www.eastoregonian.info", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gary Brown approached the dilapidated yellow station wagon in the Walmart parking lot slowly.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/29/agencies-search-for-homeless-in-eastern-oregon/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Gary Brown approached the dilapidated yellow station wagon in the Walmart parking lot slowly.", "title": "Agencies search for homeless in Eastern Oregon"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gary Brown approached the dilapidated yellow station wagon in the Walmart parking lot slowly.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Agencies search for homeless in Eastern Oregon"}, "Author": "KATHY ANEY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Gary Brown, Jennifer Richards, Steve Nelson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1318\"", "article_summary": "Even so, the National Coalition for the Homeless estimates between 130,000 and 200,000 veterans are homeless on any given night in the U.S.\u201cVets are twice as likely as non-vets to be homeless,\u201d said Ron Opsal, supervisor of the Health Care for Homeless Veterans program at the VA. \u201cFemale veterans are four times as likely.\u201dHe estimated about 40 homeless veterans in Umatilla County.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude or bother you.\u201dHe explained he was participating in an annual survey to count homeless people.\nThe 2013 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress said Oregon had one of the highest populations of homeless veterans at about 1,500 - others were Hawaii, California, Montana and Florida.\nEach January, agencies across the nation take a day to help the Department of Housing and Urban Development count the nation\u2019s homeless population.\nBrown and Nelson both work in outreach to homeless veterans so they also looking for that subset."}
