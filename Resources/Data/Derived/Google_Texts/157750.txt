In a development that has surprised exactly nobody, it turns out that “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson is still saying ignorant things about gay people.

Robertson was the subject of plenty of negative attention — and high-profile support — late last year, when he revealed in an interview with GQ that you can just “Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men” and graphically explained to men that “a vagina — as a man — would be more desirable than a man’s anus.” His remarks earned him a brief suspension from his network A&E, which soon after described “Duck Dynasty” as “a show about family … a family that America has come to love.”

Hey, what’s not to love? What’s not to love about someone who concern trolls other people’s anuses? And if you loved that, there’s more where that came from! On Thursday, Radar revealed a new video of Robertson speaking at an Easter event, telling the crowd — in an epic 43-minute speech about birth, death, rebirth, demons and sin — that “they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins … Is homosexual behavior a sin? The guy asked me. I said, do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived.” He then paraphrased Corinthians, saying, “Neither the sexually immoral, nor the idolators nor adulterers nor male prostitutes, nor homosexual offenders, nor thieves, nor greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”
