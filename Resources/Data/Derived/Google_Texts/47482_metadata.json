Ted Cruz of Texas, who became the first Republican to formally announce for president on Monday, finished dead last.\n\nRelated: What Ted Cruz\u2019s Announcement Reveals About His 2016 Campaign\n\nIt may have been that many of the respondents still had fresh recollections of the freshman Texan\u2019s role in shutting down the government for 16 days in an effort to derail Obamacare. Cruz\u2019s antics in late 2013 enraged many in Washington, including his GOP colleagues. But it also may have been Cruz\u2019s exasperating tendency to straddle a line between the semi-isolationism of Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and other libertarians in their party and the hawkishness of Sens. John McCain of Arizona Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nAs Molly O\u2019Toole of Defense One observed yesterday, despite Cruz\u2019s service on the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, \u201cCruz is not widely seen as commander-in-chief material.\u201d In other words, despite his often tough talk on what he would do differently if he were running the country, many question whether Cruz would turn out to be a \u201cStraddler-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech to a group of cheering students at Liberty University in Virginia yesterday, Cruz offered a clarion call for a return to Republican principles and toughness on defense and national security matters, and offered himself as an antidote to what he characterized as the failed or misguided policies of the Democrats.\n\n\u201cInstead of a president who boycotts Prime Minister Netanyahu, imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel,\u201d Cruz declared. \u201cInstead of a president who seeks to go to the United Nations and end-run Congress and the American people, imagine a president who says, \u2018I will honor the Constitution, and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.\u2019 Imagine a president who says, \u2018We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism \u2014 and we will call it by its name.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Sen. Ted Cruz Attacks Obama During New Hampshire Visit\n\nHis campaign kickoff speech echoed an earlier charge that President Obama has yet to show a \u201cseriousness of purpose\u201d in confronting the ISIS terrorist group, and that the president instead had engaged in \u201cphoto op foreign policy \u2013 a bomb here, a missile there.\u201d Yet Cruz \u2013 like many of his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill \u2013 remains exasperatingly vague and non-committal over what new war powers Congress should grant the president, or whether more U.S. ground troops will be needed to ultimately defeat the terrorists in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThroughout his relatively brief career in the Senate, Cruz has vacillated between his party\u2019s isolationists and hardliners. For instance, he opposed Obama\u2019s request in September 2013 (later withdrawn) for authorization to attack Syria after President Bashar al-Assad allegedly used chemical weapons against his own people.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) once denounced Cruz as a \u201cwacko bird\u201d for filibustering against the nomination of CIA Director John O. Brennan because of opposition to President Obama\u2019s drone policy.\n\nThen Cruz sided with the hawks in opposing the administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran and pressing for more sanctions against Tehran. Like many others in his party, Cruz perceives Iran as an even greater threat to the Middle East and U.S. national security than ISIS.\n\nRelated: Why Congress Should Simply Bag the War Powers Debate\n\nCruz has sponsored legislation that would immediately re-impose tough economic sanctions against Iran, a strategy that the administration says would kill the negotiations that just now are coming to a head. He was one of 47 Republican senators who signed a recent letter to Iranian leaders warning that any deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be short-lived unless Congress approved it.\n\nHe offered more tough talk on Iran yesterday. \u201cInstead of a president who seeks to go to the United Nations and end-run Congress and the American people, imagine a president who says, \u2018I will honor the Constitution, and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon,\u2019\u201d he said yesterday.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last fall, the Government Business Council and Defense One surveyed nearly 430 nationa", "title": "Cruz\u2019s Forked Tongue Hurts His Presidential Chances", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/Cruz-s-Forked-Tongue-Hurts-His-Presidential-Chances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz-announcement_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/24/Cruz-s-Forked-Tongue-Hurts-His-Presidential-Chances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz-announcement_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last fall, the Government Business Council and Defense One surveyed nearly 430 nationa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4c56\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
