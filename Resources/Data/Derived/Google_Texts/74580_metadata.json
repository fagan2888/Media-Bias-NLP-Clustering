The court was unanimous about two-thirds of the time, and those cases revealed signs of compromise and restraint, which many Supreme Court specialists said was a testament to the leadership of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., 59.\n\n\u201cThe chief has done a remarkable job this term navigating divisions and dodging the most controversial of issues,\u201d said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter who argues frequently before the court.\n\nChief Justice Roberts, who completed his ninth term, does not get his way by backslapping or horse-trading, but by writing savvy opinions, making strategic opinion assignments to the other justices and sometimes working to protect the Supreme Court from accusations that it is a political institution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChief Justice Roberts\u2019s handiwork was apparent this term in major rulings on abortion protests and cellphone searches, both unanimous decisions.\n\nHis majority opinion striking down buffer zones around Massachusetts abortion clinics was much narrower than his earlier First Amendment jurisprudence would have suggested, narrow enough to attract the votes of all four liberal justices. And he wrote a muscular opinion for a unanimous court requiring the police to get warrants before they search the cellphones of people they arrest.\n\nAll of the justices are sensitive to the accusation that they are motivated by politics.\n\nThe current set of nine justices is, for the first time in history, firmly divided along partisan lines, with all of the Republican appointees more conservative than all of the Democratic ones. Their efforts to find common ground may have been partly an attempt to counter the charge that they are, in Justice Stephen G. Breyer\u2019s words, \u201cnine junior varsity politicians\u201d motivated by partisan agendas better left to elected officials.\n\nBut the number of unanimous decisions \u2014 a record for the Roberts court and the highest percentage since at least 1953 \u2014 masked some powerful disagreements, as the justices often agreed only on the bottom line, as was true in the abortion protest and recess appointment cases.\n\nWhat matters most in Supreme Court decisions is what legal principle commanded a majority, not which side won. Lower courts will apply those principles, and the divisions about the reasoning supporting decisions can be vital. They mattered so much to Justice Antonin Scalia that he all but created a new judicial genre \u2014 he wrote three furious concurrences.\n\nThe Roberts court\u2019s conservative majority has not retreated from several of its core concerns. It remains skeptical of campaign finance regulations, efforts to drive religion from public life and race-conscious decision-making by the government. It remains solicitous of corporate rights and of efforts to curb union power.\n\nWhen the chief justice was in the majority in such cases, most decided by narrow margins, another side of him emerged. In all of them, he wrote or joined opinions that claimed to be modest extensions of existing law but may well portend wrenching change.\n\nA More Unified Court This term, the Supreme Court justices voted unanimously in 65 percent of orally argued cases \u2014 the highest share since at least 1953. 60% of decisions 50% 9-0 rulings 40% 30% 20% 5-4 10% 0% \u201953 \u201960 \u201970 \u201980 \u201990 \u201900 \u201913\n\nBut the 5-to-4 splits dropped, to just 10. Of those, six featured the classic alignments, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joining either the court\u2019s four more liberal members or its four more conservative ones. He leaned right two-thirds of the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in a great many cases the justices found ways to agree. This was the fourth term together for the nine current justices. Its newest members, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have grown increasingly comfortable in their roles, and all of the justices seemed, mostly, eager to find common ground with their colleagues.\n\nIt did not hurt that the term lacked huge and profoundly divisive cases like those that ended the last two terms. In June 2012, months before the presidential election, the court narrowly upheld the Affordable Care Act. In June 2013, the court issued one major ruling on same-sex marriage but kicked an even bigger question down the road.\n\nThe story of the current term was somewhat anticipated in a book published last year by three political scientists: Pamela C. Corley, Amy Steigerwalt and Artemus Ward. It was called \u201cThe Puzzle of Unanimity: Consensus on the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIt is, after all, not obvious that the justices should ever all agree. The issues that reach them are complicated and usually susceptible to multiple plausible answers. Lower courts have almost always given varying answers. The justices themselves have differing judicial philosophies.\n\nBut the justices know that unanimous decisions have more force, which is why they worked hard to issue them in Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 school desegregation case, and United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision that hastened the end of the Nixon administration.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140701151550, "twitter": {"description": "Chief Justice John G.
