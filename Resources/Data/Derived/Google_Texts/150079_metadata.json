HuffPo came up with a simple yet brutally effective way of testing Republicans\u2019 tolerance for Trump\u2019s ideological heresies: They polled people on universal health care, affirmative action, the Iran deal, and Social Security and simply swapped out Trump\u2019s endorsement of the policy in each question for some prominent Democrat\u2019s. Would Republicans like the Iran deal any better if they thought it had Donald Trump\u2019s approval and not just John Kerry\u2019s?\n\nAs it turns out, they sure would. For some segment of the GOP, it seems, politics is nothing more than Team Red/Team Blue tribalism. Policy differences are mere details.\n\nWhich is to say, if it wasn\u2019t before, the \u201cMacGuffinization of American politics\u201d is now a bipartisan phenomenon.\n\nKerry\u2019s endorsement of the deal generates a 52/20 D/R split. Trump\u2019s endorsement turns that into \u2026 near parity, 54/53. By sheer coincidence, within 10 minutes of this HuffPo survey dropping yesterday, Charles Cooke went live on NRO\u2019s website with a new post agonizing over how Trumpmania seems to have convinced some conservatives to discard their principles overnight. How can it be, he wondered, that the segment of the GOP that\u2019s complained most loudly about RINO deviations from conservative orthodoxy over the past five years would suddenly clasp the biggest RINO of them all to its breast?\n\nA handful of months ago many of those who now make up Trump\u2019s rank-and-file were ideological perfectionists who hated the GOP\u2019s leadership, believed to their souls that the country was becoming a socialist hell-hole, and insisted vehemently that they had sat out the 2012 election because Mitt Romney was such a terrible squish. Today, by dint of some dark and unholy magic, these wannabe purists have hitched their wagons to Donald Trump, the greatest shape-shifter of them all. Thus it is that an array of self-described \u201ctrue conservatives\u201d have put themselves in the awkward position of supposing that an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban isn\u2019t that big a deal after all. Thus have the pioneers of litmus testing lined up obediently behind a guy whose position on Planned Parenthood is identical to Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Thus have the Scalia-citing \u201cconstitutional conservatives\u201d taken to lionizing a man whose primary criticism of the liberty-shredding Kelo v. New London ruling was that it didn\u2019t go far enough. Thus have the screaming eagles of Twitter and beyond taken to contending that the class-conscious tax hikes that the America-hating communist Bernie Sanders proposes are akin to apple-pie-and-motherhood when they\u2019re floated by Donald Trump. Little did we know how quickly \u201ctake America back\u201d would disintegrate in the face of a little pop culture.\n\n\u201cWe have reached a moment,\u201d Steve Schmidt told WaPo, \u201cwhere conservatism isn\u2019t defined by issues anymore for a big percentage of the country.\u201d Is that true? Is \u201cconservatism\u201d really more of a cultural attitude now, at least in its populist version, than a collection of policy principles derived from the conviction that the surest way to maximize individual freedom is to limit government? Cooke writes of Trump\u2019s heresies, \u201cHonesty requires us to acknowledge that had President Obama endorsed exactly the same policies and rhetoric, the reaction from the Trumpkins would have been little short of nuclear.\u201d He\u2019s right, and if he\u2019s right about that, how is Schmidt wrong? If anything, Cooke\u2019s error is in assuming that Trump convinced people to discard principles that were dearly held rather than considering that it was something else all along about conservatism that\u2019s been dearly held and that the principles were accepted only because they were assumed to be part and parcel of that something else. If Trump can protect that \u201csomething else,\u201d whatever it may be, who cares if the policies that have traditionally been bundled with it get thrown away?\n\nTwo important caveats to HuffPo\u2019s study, though. One: Trump was the only Republican they tested, a bad oversight given the assumption that he has some singular talismanic ability to move conservative opinion on policy through his cult of personality. I\u2019d be curious to see how voters would react if they thought Ben Carson or Marco Rubio or Scott Walker supported the Iran deal or universal health care or whatever. I doubt the effect on righty opinion would be as great as Trump\u2019s endorsement, but I bet it wouldn\u2019t be zero either. To some unknown extent, what you\u2019re seeing in these numbers isn\u2019t a \u201cTrump phenomenon,\u201d it\u2019s a partisan phenomenon. Tell a group of low-information Republicans that someone on their side, whom they respect, has endorsed affirmative action and you\u2019ll see the numbers move, assuredly. The question is, by how much?\n\nCaveat two: It ain\u2019t just Republicans who suddenly find themselves questioning their principles when they learn that some famous political figure supports or opposes one of their core beliefs. Which party moved more in this test of universal health care upon learning that Donald Trump thinks it\u2019s a good idea?\n\nRepublican support for universal health care rose 28 points thanks to Trump\u2019s seal of approval. Democratic support for universal health care dropped, however, by \u2026 36 points. How many Dems out there are true believers in the ObamaCare dream and how many are mindlessly in favor for no better reason than that Barack Obama thinks it\u2019s a keen idea? Note too that it\u2019s not just a matter of the sheer number of Dems changing their position here, it\u2019s a matter of going from heavy majority support to less than 50 percent in favor. Trump\u2019s backing can turn an 82 percent Democratic consensus into a 46 percent plurality. And if you think that\u2019s a fluke result, try this one:\n\nRepublican support for affirmative action rises 18 points with Trump\u2019s backing but it\u2019s still a small share of the party that\u2019s in favor. Democratic support for affirmative action drops 19 points with Trump\u2019s endorsement, once again crossing from a majority consensus (64 percent) to a plurality one (45 percent). Many more issues would need to be surveyed in this way to try to draw a firm conclusion about which party has more hacks willing to go along with whatever their leadership says, but there\u2019s at least as much reason from this to believe Democrats would win that contest as Republicans would. Any lefties out there up for some Cooke-style soul-searching about how quickly liberals drop their principles once they find out that the guy from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d agrees with them?\n\nExit question: How do you do a poll like HuffPo\u2019s and not test people on what Trump\u2019s support does to opinion on whether we should tax the rich? That\u2019s probably his most prominent break from conservative orthodoxy to date, one that threatens to upend partisan polarization in Washington if it catches on. Someone test that, please.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Principles.", "title": "Confirmed: Republicans like Democratic ideas better when they\u2019re Trump\u2019s", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/02/confirmed-republicans-like-democratic-ideas-better-when-they-think-theyre-trumps/", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/id.jpg", "height": 315}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-03T00:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-03T11:44:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "affirmative action, health care, Huffington Post, Iran, Obama, policy, taxes, trump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6c2a\"", "article_summary": "I doubt the effect on righty opinion would be as great as Trump\u2019s endorsement, but I bet it wouldn\u2019t be zero either.\nTrump\u2019s endorsement turns that into \u2026 near parity, 54/53.\nWould Republicans like the Iran deal any better if they thought it had Donald Trump\u2019s approval and not just John Kerry\u2019s?\nExit question: How do you do a poll like HuffPo\u2019s and not test people on what Trump\u2019s support does to opinion on whether we should tax the rich?\nDemocratic support for affirmative action drops 19 points with Trump\u2019s endorsement, once again crossing from a majority consensus (64 percent) to a plurality one (45 percent)."}
