The union and the university have been engaged in negotiations for the past several months regarding disagreements over modifications to the contract.\n\n\u201cThere are always difficult issues in negotiations of this sort, but both sides put in a lot of hard work,\u201d said UC spokesperson Rebecca Trounson. \u201cEveryone is happy there is a tentative agreement.\u201d\n\nIn mid-September, postdoctoral students, or \u201cpostdocs,\u201d protested at seven UC campuses, delivering signed petitions to their respective administrations urging for the university to adopt their terms in the upcoming negotiations.\n\nOne of the reasons the contract was extended was to better address uncertainties over a proposed U.S. Department of Labor regulation. This regulation increases the salary threshold for professional exempt employees, including UC postdocs. This means that employees below this threshold are eligible for overtime pay. Postdocs are often below the new proposed threshold and do not receive overtime.\n\nThe tentative agreement keeps postdoc wages attached to the National Institutes of Health scale, as they were before. Under this scale, pay is tied to experience and therefore increases about 6 percent every successive year. This increase includes a cost-of-living adjustment and a 4 percent step increase for each annual reappointment.\n\nRepresentatives of both sides agreed on several modifications to the contract. The discussion about subsidizing child care for postdocs, however, will continue with a joint committee of union and UC representatives, which will meet twice in the next year to discuss the possibility of subsidies.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem of gender equity,\u201d said Anke Schennink, president of the postdoc union. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that can be improved there.\u201d\n\nAlthough several changes were made to the contract, it is a short-term agreement. UC and union representatives will reconvene in June of next year to begin negotiations for a long-term contract.\n\nNew additions include changes to the health care plan for postdocs. The previous plan was developed before the Affordable Care Act was passed and therefore was not compliant with the law. Now postdoc health care is compliant with the ACA and includes coverage for pre-existing conditions and contraception.\n\nThe new contract also includes increased rights for international postdocs. Schennink said that previously, when international postdocs were terminated, they risked losing their visa. This meant they could not be present for the grievance process if they felt that they were unjustly fired. Under the new agreements, the university must provide these international scholars with help in obtaining a travel visa and the funds for travel expenses.\n\nMembers of the union will vote on the tentative contract in the next two weeks, and the contract will expire in September of next year.\n\nContact Anderson Lanham at [email protected].", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Californian", "description": "The University of California has reached an agreement with the postdoctoral researchers\u2019 union to extend their current contract for one more year while further negotiations occur.Read More\u2026", "title": "UC, postdoctoral researchers' union reach tentative agreement on contract | The Daily Californian", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2014/04/fbimage1410x738.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-18T21:51:14-07:00", "url": "http://www.dailycal.org/2015/10/18/uc-postdoc-union-reach-tentative-agreement-contract/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailycal", "section": "UC", "tag": "US Department of Labor", "published_time": "2015-10-18T20:02:37-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-18T21:51:14-07:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 877855486}, "twitter": {"description": "The University of California has reached an agreement with the postdoctoral researchers\u2019 union to extend their current contract for one more year while further negotiations occur.Read More\u2026", "creator": "@dailycal", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2014/04/fbimage1410x738.png", "title": "UC, postdoctoral researchers' union reach tentative agreement on contract | The Daily Californian", "site": "@dailycal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Members of the union will vote on the tentative contract in the next two weeks, and the contract will expire in September of next year.\nThe University of California has reached an agreement with the postdoctoral researchers\u2019 union to extend their current contract for one more year while further negotiations occur.\n\u201cThis is a problem of gender equity,\u201d said Anke Schennink, president of the postdoc union.\nUC and union representatives will reconvene in June of next year to begin negotiations for a long-term contract.\nThis regulation increases the salary threshold for professional exempt employees, including UC postdocs."}
