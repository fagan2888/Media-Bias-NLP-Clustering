Winters states that \u201cObamacare,\u201d \u201ctax reform,\u201d and \u201cimmigration reform\u201d never came close to the frequency of searches for \u201cCommon Core.\u201d\n\nWinters cautions that some \u201cCommon Core\u201d searches could have been teachers looking for Common Core-related materials for the classroom, and also observes that searches for \u201cgay marriage\u201d and \u201cSyria\u201d also spiked on key non-election-related news before dropping in search activity.\n\n\u201cBut this data still suggests that the Common Core was an issue important to politicians and voters in 2014,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur prediction is that this importance isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut, perspective is everything. Observing Google Trends for search activity about Justin Bieber, Winters points out that \u201ceven politics has no power over some forces of nature. Not a single issue can hold a candle to the search traffic generated by everyone\u2019s favorite pop star.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysis of big issues in the 2014 mid-term elections reveals that Common Core was at the top of the search charts.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Analysis of big issues in the 2014 mid-term elections reveals that Common Core was at the top of the search charts.", "title": "Google Trends: Common Core Tops Charts in 2014 Election Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mississippi-Common-Core-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-03-04T20:38:55-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/04/google-trends-common-core-tops-charts-in-2014-election-year/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Analysis of big issues in the 2014 mid-term elections reveals that Common Core was at the top of the search charts.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mississippi-Common-Core-AP.jpg", "title": "Google Trends: Common Core Tops Charts in 2014 Election Year", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, edSurge, Election 2014, Google Trends, Justin Bieber,Big Government, Data, Education,common core", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-04T20:38:05-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-03-04T20:38:55-07:00", "tag": "Justin Bieber", "categories": "Big Government,Education,Data"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac9c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut this data still suggests that the Common Core was an issue important to politicians and voters in 2014,\u201d he continued.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAnalysis of big issues in the 2014 mid-term elections reveals that Common Core was at the top of the search charts, according to Google Trends data.\n\u201cTo our surprise, the term \u2018Common Core\u2019 was searched for a lot more, in fact, than many other key issues in the 2014 election,\u201d he said.\nWhile \u201cCommon Core\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d took turns at the top of the search chart, the education initiative also led in searches between mid-August and the two weeks before the general election in November.\nObserving Google Trends for search activity about Justin Bieber, Winters points out that \u201ceven politics has no power over some forces of nature."}
