The shoes would be going to countries like Haiti, Somalia and South American countries.\n\n\"It's really sad when I look here, we have so much that we throw away here, and we look at them and they are barefoot, we look online and they have no shoes,\" said E. Jean Carter-Boniface, founder of HOPE Inc.\n\nLast year, the organization collected around 7,500 shoes.\n\nThe organization Funds2Orgs pays HOPE Inc. $0.40 per pound of shoe.\n\n\"Even though it doesn't sound like much, 40 cents a pound, we are not a federal funded or state or local funded organization\" Carter-Boniface said.\n\nHOPE Inc. works in the Wichita community to bring health fairs to residents and works with people in need. The money collected would fund their efforts.\n\nThe shoe collection started on January 1, 2015 and will end on December 31, 2015.\n\nHOPE Inc. is open Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nPeople wanting to donate shoes should call (316) 618-8652.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "HOPE Inc. is collecting used shoes for people in Haiti, Somalia and South American countries.
