Public bathrooms are probably one of the most bacteria-laden places, right?\n\nCommon sense may say yes, but most experts can agree that public bathrooms really aren\u2019t as dirty as you might think. And \u201csitting on a toilet isn\u2019t going to cause an infection,\u201d William DePaolo, assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California (USC), notes in a BuzzFeed video. \u201cA lot of those bacteria present on the surface of the toilet or other parts of the bathroom are not so easily transmitted by skin.\u201d\n\nHe points out that most of bathroom bacteria tend to thrive in moist places like mucous membranes. If you happen to sit on a toilet bare-butted, and you don\u2019t wash your hands afterwards \u2014 then you might be at risk of transmitting bacteria. But otherwise, it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. This is because our skin acts as a barrier of sorts against microbes.\n\nIn fact, other items in the bathroom \u2014 like the toilet paper roll, even \u2014 is far more filled with bacteria than the toilet seat itself. Your dish washing sponge, for example, can hold up to 200,000 times more bacteria than your average toilet seat. Experts consider this to be the most bacteria-laden objects in any household, even some of the cleanest ones. That\u2019s not mentioning kitchen sinks, video game controllers, or smartphones. And perhaps most importantly, purses, which are taken pretty much everywhere, dropped on the ground, placed on your desk, on the subway seat, and then plopped right onto your bed when you get home. And if you\u2019re really worried about dirty toilet seats, just remember that your office desk is way dirtier, harboring some 16 million microbes on just your keyboard.\n\nWill I still cover toilets with toilet paper before sitting down? Probably. But just in case you were grossed out every time you went into a public bathroom, this information should give you some perspective and remind you that washing your hands should solve the issue.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sitting on toilet, public toilet seats, bacteria", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A professor of immunology and microbiology explains why sitting your bare butt down on a public toilet seat isn\u2019t going to get you sick.", "title": "Go Ahead And Sit On Public Toilet Seats [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-you-wont-get-sick-sitting-public-toilet-seat-314172", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/12/sitting-toilet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A professor of immunology and microbiology explains why sitting your bare butt down on a public toilet seat isn\u2019t going to get you sick.", "title": "Go Ahead And Sit On Public Toilet Seats [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-you-wont-get-sick-sitting-public-toilet-seat-314172", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/12/sitting-toilet.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/12/sitting-toilet.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-12T16:47:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-12T16:47:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A professor of immunology and microbiology explains why sitting your bare butt down on a public toilet seat isn\u2019t going to get you sick."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad85\"", "article_summary": "Sitting on a public toilet without putting toilet paper on the seat first won't do you any harm; all you have to do is wash your hands afterward.\nIn fact, other items in the bathroom \u2014 like the toilet paper roll, even \u2014 is far more filled with bacteria than the toilet seat itself.\nYour dish washing sponge, for example, can hold up to 200,000 times more bacteria than your average toilet seat.\nWill I still cover toilets with toilet paper before sitting down?\nCommon sense may say yes, but most experts can agree that public bathrooms really aren\u2019t as dirty as you might think."}
