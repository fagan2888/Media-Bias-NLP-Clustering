The sports bar and grill chain has several locations throughout Florida, including Ocala, Orlando, Apopka, Tampa and Lakeland. On the menu are grilled gator and buffalo-style wings with 15 sauces.\n\nRobert Weinstein, project manager for Scherer Construction, said the new Gator\u2019s will have 6,000 square feet, 1,200 of which will be in an enclosed patio.\n\nThe restaurant will occupy a former movie rental store on the southernmost part of Lakewood Plaza and resemble others in the chain, he said.\n\nWeinstein said it will take three months to build and, depending on final approvals, could open by November.\n\nJerry Roberts, franchise owner of the new location, said he believes the U.S. 19 site will do well because it is in a secondary commercial area and not in the middle of the busy State Road 50 and Mariner Boulevard commercial hub.\n\nGator\u2019s will compete with Chili\u2019s and Applebees, he said, and yet have its own distinct menu fare. It will also have a full liquor bar.\n\nSponsored Links\n\nThe family-friendly restaurant will employ about 50 people, he said.\n\nRoberts said Hernando County is a natural extension of the Tampa market and there may be another site in Pasco County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about coming to the area,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThe Gator\u2019s Dockside Restaurant website said the chain applies a 1 percent surcharge on diners\u2019 meals and beverages to offset the increasing health care costs associated with President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nRoberts said some Gator\u2019s locations have the surcharge but the new Spring Hill site will not.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Chili\u2019s will sport the new look of the chain. Customers will be treated to more flat screens located throughout the restaurant and not just by the bar. There is new lighting, new seating, new wood tables, a new awning design and a new logo. The interior will also boast the new Southwestern color scheme.\n\nThe menu boasts a variety of entrees, including burger combos, fajitas, salads, barbecue and steaks.\n\nAs with other Chili\u2019s, this site will also have a full liquor bar.\n\nChili\u2019s Grill & Bar has 1,268 U.S. locations and does more than $3.5 billion in sales.\n\nmbates@hernandotoday.com\n\n(352) 544-5290\n\nSponsored Links", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chili\u2019s, Gator\u2019s Dockside submit building plans in Hernando", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "og": {"site_name": "Hernando Today", "description": "Chili\u2019s, Gator\u2019s Dockside submit building plans in Hernando", "title": "Chili\u2019s, Gator\u2019s Dockside submit building plans in Hernando", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T07:50:54+00:00", "url": "http://hernandotoday.com/chilis-gators-dockside-submit-building-plans-in-hernando/", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Hernando Today , Hernando sports , Hernando weath , Hernando business , Hernando health , Hernando travel", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2014-07-17T15:48:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T07:50:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82e7\"", "article_summary": "Chili\u2019s Grill & Bar and Gator\u2019s Dockside Restaurant submitted building plans to the county.\nAnother new eatery, Gator\u2019s Dockside Restaurant, is eyeing a parcel at 4329 U.S. 19, in the Lakewood Plaza in Spring Hill.\nGator\u2019s Dockside Restaurant would be new to Hernando County.\nRoberts said some Gator\u2019s locations have the surcharge but the new Spring Hill site will not.\nThe Gator\u2019s Dockside Restaurant website said the chain applies a 1 percent surcharge on diners\u2019 meals and beverages to offset the increasing health care costs associated with President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act."}
