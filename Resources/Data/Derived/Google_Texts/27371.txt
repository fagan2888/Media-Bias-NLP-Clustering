PARIS (AP) — Rising star Will Poulter, who stars alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated movie “The Revenant,” led the list of front row celebrities Sunday at Lanvin as the Paris menswear shows reached their final creative crescendo.

Here are the highlights of the fall-winter 2016-17 menswear collections at Paris Fashion Week — including reports from Lanvin, Hermes and Paul Smith.

LANVIN MENSWEAR

As Lanvin womenswear experiences seismic, identity-changing shifts with the departure of the hugely talented Israeli creative director Alber Elbaz — Lanvin’s menswear, under the care of Lucas Ossendrijver, seems to be doing just fine.

The Dutch-born designer once again channeled an ’80s vibe in a trendy, varied collection full of relaxed, loose-fitting silhouettes. The slight shift in gear this season was Ossendrijver’s injection of some color and his exaggeratedly voluminous pants, in the famed Oxford Bags-style.

Shoes in vivid jade green or orange contrasted nicely with his more muted clothes, often defined by multiple layers on coats with flowing shirts.

Lanvin is all about romance — even in menswear. There were some wonderful romantic moments — like a long swash-buckling belt or another look that almost evoked the poetry of John Keats with a ringlet hairstyle, loose, timeless red pants and a flowing blue jacket.

SAINT LAURENT PUTS A HOLE IN THE FASHION CALENDAR

Saint Laurent’s collection — normally the grand finale of menswear in Paris — is not happening in the French capital this season.

The fall-winter men’s show will take place instead in Los Angeles at the Palladium on Feb. 10.

The surprise move was a last-minute decision announced unceremoniously this month — only adding to persistent rumors that there might be a top level change at the house first founded by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge in 1961.
