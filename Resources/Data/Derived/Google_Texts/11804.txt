The Avalanche looked to the Swiss League for more defensive depth Monday, signing journeyman defender Maxim Noreau to a two-year, $1.25 million contract. He will make $625,000 each year of the deal.

Noreau, 27, scored eight goals and 24 points in 35 games last season for Ambri-Piota of the Swiss League. A former prospect in the Minnesota Wild organization, Noreau played six games for the Wild, his last NHL action coming in 2010-11. He has played the past three seasons for Ambri-Piota and posted close to a point per game in that span.

Noreau, 6-foot, 197 pounds, will take part in Avs training camp in September. Noreau is a native of Montreal who went undrafted, but signed with Minnesota in 2007.

Development camp. Top prospects of the Avs will take part in development camp this week. The camp is designed as an orientation process and does not include any on-ice activities. The Avs’ first-round pick this year, Conner Bleackley, will be on hand as well as this year’s third-round pick Kyle Wood and last year’s second-round pick Chris Bigras.
