Police killed a man near the campus of Colorado State University early Saturday, officials with Fort Collins Police said.

Officers responded to a call at 3:53 a.m. about a 22-year-old man who was threatening people and making suicidal statements at 1225 Prospect St.

The man, who has been identified as David Wheat Jr., was assaulting a woman with a knife when officers arrived, Fort Collins Police said in a release. Officers attempted to restrain Wheat and ordered him to put the knife down, but he did not comply and advanced on the officers.

Two officers shot and killed the suspect, the release said.

Larimer County Coroner James Wilkerson told 7NEWS Wheat died from multiple gunshot wounds.

The stabbing victim was transported to a nearby hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Neither of the officers involved in the shooting was wearing a body camera, said Administrative Deputy Chief Cory Christensen. Some 60 officers in the department are equipped with such cameras.

“We are interested in getting cameras on all officers, but it is a question of money,” Christensen said in an e-mail.

Neither Wheat nor the woman he stabbed were CSU students, Christensen said.
