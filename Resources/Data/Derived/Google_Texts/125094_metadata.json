Rush Holt announced in February that he would not seek re-election to a ninth term in Congress, citing \u201cmany reasons, all hopeful and positive.\u201d Running to replace him are Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Mercer) and Republican candidate Dr. Alieta Eck, of Franklin Township.\n\nFor both candidates, finding new ways to grow the economy \u2013 and bring more jobs to New Jersey \u2013 remains the chief issue on the campaign trail this year.\n\nIn addition to standard tax credits offered to large businesses as an incentive to stay on American soil, Watson Coleman suggested offering tax credits specifically for research and development companies.\n\n\u201cWe need a reliable plan of action to allow these start-up companies to analyze what they\u2019ll have in terms of support so they can make us a go-to place for job creators like this,\u201d Watson Coleman said in an interview last week.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Watson Coleman has focused on the importance of investing in infrastructure, which provides numerous jobs that often last longer than standard temporary work, she said.\n\n\u201cIt creates jobs for people that help them feel secure. They\u2019ll in turn use that money and create a desire for more consumables, which drives up the economy and creates more jobs in small businesses,\u2019 Watson Coleman said.\n\nAt the same time, the resulting transportation network not only helps to attract businesses \u2014 and more jobs \u2014 but, in the case of mass transportation, helps the environment as well.\n\n\u201cAll of these different strategies get cars off the road and decrease pollution in the air. It\u2019s a win-win-win,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Eck, the key to economic growth comes from going a bit further than tax credits, which she said she supports.\n\nIn addition to tax credits, Eck has called for removing \u201cburdensome\u201d regulations placed on businesses that she said have bogged down entrepreneurs enough that they\u2019re avoiding New Jersey.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey just happens to be the state with the highest property taxes and highest cost of living, so it\u2019s hard to attract companies. We need to make our government more efficient and just smarter,\u201d Eck said.\n\nBut like many issues she\u2019s focused on during her campaign, Eck said the best way to bring back jobs is through re-examining and changing President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Small businesses are less likely to hire that dreaded 51st employee, which requires employers to offer health insurance or face fines, and others are more likely to lower wages or lay off workers.\n\n\u201cPeople are being cut from full-time to part-time because of the act. Their wages can\u2019t go up if their employers are now asked to spend that much more on health insurance,\u201d Eck said. \u201cThey already can\u2019t afford health insurance and now their premiums will be higher and wages lower.\u201d\n\n\n\nEck hasn\u2019t pulled any punches when discussing the act, calling it at an Oct. 22 debate against Watson Coleman \u201canything but affordable.\u201d\n\nThe law has made health care an even more convoluted process for beneficiaries while simultaneously placing more of a burden on taxpayers by placing more people on Medicaid, Eck said.\n\nWhen discussing potential cuts in government spending, Eck immediately pointed to the $7 billion added in new Medicaid enrollment since the act was rolled out.\n\nShe recalled one retired woman at her Piscataway practice who had been spending $500 each month on her health insurance plan that, after the act was rolled out, was voided.\n\nInstead, the woman was placed on Medicaid, Eck said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. This woman is perfectly willing to pay $500 per month and is now paying nothing. The taxpayers are paying it now,\u201d Eck said.\n\nWatson Coleman said she was still in support of the act, which she said took a \u201cbig step forward\u201d in providing health insurance for those who would otherwise be without.\n\nBut there are definitely issues that need to be addressed, she said, including implementing an easier sign-up process, looking at additional surcharges and fees placed on previously existing plans and the removal of families from much-needed plans such as the Child\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s issues from insurance providers, medical providers and beneficiaries,\u201d Watson Coleman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most comprehensive health care policy we\u2019ve experienced since Medicare.\n\n\u201cMedicare has undergone improvements, Social Security has undergone improvements and so will this. But the notion of scrapping it and starting again is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d she said.\n\nOn other issues, Watson Coleman and Eck remain far apart, as expected. Watson Coleman has called for stricter gun laws, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, while Eck has said new gun laws wouldn\u2019t curb violence, only put more restrictions on law-abiding gun owners.\n\nBoth candidates have said the education system needs improvement, with Watson Coleman calling for more funding for science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs while Eck supports school choice programs.\n\n\u201cYou should put tuition in a child\u2019s backpack so you decide where they can go, where the better location is for this child,\u201d Eck said. \u201cIt might make those failing public schools go out of business, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nTheir backgrounds are different and each has used her experience as a talking point on the campaign trail.\n\nWatson Coleman was first elected to the state Assembly in 1998, serving as majority leader from 2006 to 2009 while also serving as chairwoman from the state Democratic committee from 2002 to 2006.\n\n\u201cCollaborating with people, sponsoring legislative initiatives and advocating for issues are things that I\u2019ve already ha experienced on the statewide level. That will be very helpful to me in hitting the ground running,\u201d Watson Coleman said.\n\nEck has never served in an elected office, running unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in the 2013 special U.S. Senate election.\n\nA practicing physician who runs a private practice in Piscataway and free clinic in Franklin Township, Eck said her private-sector experience makes her a \u201cspokeswoman\u201d for patients, physicians and taxpayers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the private sector, balanced budgets and solved problems,\u201d Eck said. \u201cI see the people who are hurting all the time and the public policy issues that are hurting them. I have to work to solve that hurting.\u201d\n\nUpon victory, either candidate would become the state\u2019s first congresswoman since former U.S. Rep. Marge Roukema (R-5th Dist.) left office in 2003. If Watson Coleman wins the seat, she will become the state\u2019s first African-American congresswoman.\n\nAlthough Holt was elected by close margins in 1998 and 2000, the 12th District has since been redistricted twice and leaned strongly Democratic ever since. Since 2001, Holt has won re-election with an average margin of about 25 percentage points.\n\nBut Eck said she represented unaffiliated voters who weren\u2019t as likely to simply vote for the same party now that Holt is leaving office.\n\n\u201cMore than half our district have no party affiliation and those are the people I believe I can attract this year,\u201d Eck said.\n\nMike Davis may be reached at mdavis@njtimes.com.
