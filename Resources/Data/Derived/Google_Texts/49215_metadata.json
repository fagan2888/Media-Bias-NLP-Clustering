The City Council voted to set a minimum price of $2.10 per cigarillo, even in packs containing as many as four cigars, now sold for at least $8.40.\n\n\u201cWe know that young people are particularly price sensitive and that they\u2019re looking for cheap tobacco products, versus a pack of cigarettes, which now days cost seven or eight dollars,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "These days, where there\u2019s smoke \u2014 or smokes \u2014 there\u2019s fire.
