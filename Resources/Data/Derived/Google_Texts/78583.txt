NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Federal prosecutors and lawyers for a Deepwater Horizon rig supervisor are ready to tell jurors what they expect to prove as 65-year-old Robert Kaluza is tried on a misdemeanor pollution charge from the BP oil spill.

A jury was chosen Tuesday for what’s probably the last trial from a sweeping Justice Department probe of the rig explosion and blowout. Opening arguments were scheduled Wednesday.

The well blew in April 2010, spewing an estimated 134 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before it was plugged months later.

Prosecutors say Kaluza and fellow supervisor Donald Vidrine botched a “negative pressure test” and missed clear signs of trouble before the blowout.

Vidrine pleaded guilty to the same charge: violating the Clean Water Act. He’s among 31 possible prosecution witnesses.
