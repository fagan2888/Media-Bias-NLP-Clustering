For example, over on Dorf on Law, Michael Dorf and I have now written a total of nine \u201cpost mortem\u201d posts analyzing Hobby Lobby, and Professor Dorf\u2019s Verdict column yesterday was also inspired by that case.\n\nCertainly the most fascinating aspect of the case, from my perspective, is the Court majority\u2019s holding that corporate \u201cpersons\u201d can hold sincere religious beliefs. Although the specifics of the case involved \u201cclosely-held\u201d corporations, the majority\u2019s logic obviously opens up the possibility\u2014indeed the likelihood\u2014that other large, for-profit corporations could declare themselves to be motivated by religious convictions. The majority claims that corporate law might provide a brake on the ability of corporations to invoke religious beliefs; but if a company does decide, through its internal processes, that it is a sincere believer in any particular religion, then there is nothing in Hobby Lobby that would prevent the corporation from being covered by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\nIn this column, I explore the possibility that companies will not only be able to invoke RFRA\u2019s religious protections after Hobby Lobby, but that many companies will essentially be all but compelled to take religious positions that will increase the companies\u2019 profits (by, for example, allowing the companies to be exempt from environmental laws). First, however, it is important to understand just how expansive the Hobby Lobby majority\u2019s opinion could turn out to be.\n\nThe Basics of RFRA Challenges: Hobby Lobby Puts Pressure on the \u201cSincerity\u201d Prong\n\nThe Hobby Lobby chain of stores, according to the Court\u2019s majority, is a corporate person that shares its majority owners\u2019 fundamentalist Christian beliefs. This \u201cperson\u201d won its challenge to a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which required companies either to provide health care coverage that includes a full range of contraceptive choices, or to pay fines to the government.\n\nThis corporate person believes that abortion is a sin, and that some of the contraceptive options required under the ACA cause abortions. As Professor Dorf noted in one of his essays on the case, that the corporation\u2019s religious beliefs were scientifically false does not matter under RFRA, because what matters under that law is that the religious person believe that something is true, not that it actually be true.\n\nThe analysis under RFRA works as follows: If a person can establish that his/her/its \u201csincerely held\u201d religious beliefs are being \u201csubstantially burdened\u201d by a neutral law of general applicability, then the believer will be exempt from the law unless the law achieves a \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d by the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d possible. In Hobby Lobby, the majority conceded (grudgingly) that there was a compelling governmental interest served by the ACA\u2019s contraceptive requirement, but it then held that there was a less restrictive way to achieve that compelling interest.\n\nThe Dorf on Law series of posts explains in some detail how the RFRA requirements, together with the majority\u2019s ruling in Hobby Lobby, will put enormous pressure on a threshold question that was not in dispute in that case. If a corporation\u2019s religious beliefs are \u201csincerely held,\u201d then the RFRA analysis proceeds. If not, then one need not even proceed with the formal prongs of the analysis.\n\nPart of the reason that a litigant\u2019s religious sincerity must become an important part of future cases is that there is no other point in the legal analysis to challenge the possibility that a religious belief might be invoked dishonestly or opportunistically. One might, for example, have imagined that an asserted religious belief could be scrutinized for its seriousness under the \u201csubstantial burden\u201d prong of RFRA. However, after Hobby Lobby, that prong is unavailable. As Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent points out, the majority essentially treats all religious burdens as substantial, removing a possible point at which a court could have said to a future litigant, \u201cYes, we understand that you have a religious belief that is being burdened by the law, but it is not substantial enough to quality under RFRA.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible to read the majority\u2019s opinion as saying that \u201csubstantial\u201d under RFRA refers to the seriousness of the penalty that the company would pay for violating the ACA, not the seriousness of the religious belief that is being burdened. Although I find such a reading of Justice Alito\u2019s words to be unpersuasive, it is a minimally plausible interpretation, at least if one focuses on some phrases to the exclusion of others. Even if that were the correct reading, however, then it would merely mean that the substantiality question was never available to challenge the seriousness of religious burdens or beliefs in the first place.\n\nEither way, the only way for a future court to police claims of religious burdens would be to inquire into whether the \u201cperson\u201d holding the asserted beliefs does so with sincerity. Otherwise, courts will find themselves proceeding to the analysis of \u201ccompelling governmental interests\u201d and \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d without any inquiry at all into whether the religious belief in question is in any way serious. This not only would defy logic, but it would also violate RFRA itself.\n\nThe Difficulty of Inquiring Into Religious Sincerity, and the Additional Complications When For-Profit Corporations Are Involved\n\nUntil now, courts have been understandably hesitant to question the sincerity of any litigants\u2019 asserted religious beliefs. Questioning another person\u2019s sincerity is a serious matter, and courts would prefer not to be forced to rule that a person really does not believe in the religious proposition that he has claimed\u2014on public record, no less\u2014to believe.\n\nEven if a court were willing to so inquire, moreover, it is very difficult to figure out what kind of evidence one would need to \u201cprove\u201d that someone is being insincere. Even a signed affidavit saying, \u201cI do not hold Religious Belief X,\u201d might not be enough, because a person\u2019s religious beliefs can change at any moment. Indeed, many religions teach that proselytizing about their faith to nonbelievers is essential, because nonbelievers simply need to be shown the error of their ways and be directed toward \u201ctruth.\u201d The revelation of truth is thought to be a deeply personal event, where a person suddenly sees what he could not see until that glorious moment. This is why deathbed conversions are so often respected, and why being \u201cborn again\u201d is a central part of the belief system of many Protestant denominations.\n\nMoreover, in the \u201cHobby Lobby post mortem\u201d series noted above, Professor Dorf added the additional nuance that it is possible to practice a religion without holding any particular set of beliefs about that religion. This makes it even more difficult to see how a court could inquire into the sincerity with which a litigant holds any given religious claim.\n\nWhen for-profit corporations are involved, however, one would think that a court\u2019s skepticism should rise, depending on the nature of the religious claim. If a company asserted that its religion prevents it from complying with a law, and that law just happens to increase the company\u2019s costs and thus reduce its profits, the suspicion would be unavoidable that RFRA was merely a new vehicle by which the company was padding its bottom line. Sincerity would be the key, but there is no useful guidance about how to determine sincerity. Indeed, the majority\u2019s opinion goes to great lengths to suggest that inquiries into religious beliefs are wholly unacceptable.\n\nThe Profit-Seeking Imperative: If a Law Can Be Challenged, Must a Company Challenge It?\n\nIn my contributions to the Hobby Lobby post mortem series on Dorf on Law, I have explained how a for-profit company could proceed through the relevant prongs of RFRA to challenge profit-reducing laws. The example that I discussed at the greatest length was the minimum wage, but certainly any law could be challenged on a religious basis. It is true that such companies could still lose on the other prongs, but they could also win, at least under some easily imaginable sets of facts.\n\nBased on that analysis, I ended up predicting that there could soon be a \u201cgold rush\u201d atmosphere, in which Hobby Lobby opens the floodgates to companies that test the boundaries of the new religious doctrine, to challenge laws that they dislike. Although there are some forces pushing in the opposite direction, I could easily picture a legal landscape in which many companies challenge under RFRA all manner of laws for purportedly violating their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\nBut what if I am wrong? What if companies for some reason find it unseemly to challenge secular laws on religious grounds, or have some other reason to leave well enough alone, no matter the open invitation that the Hobby Lobby majority sent out to corporate America? Arguably, such companies would be violating their duties to their shareholders.\n\nTo be clear, religious challenges by corporations will probably continue to \u201cseem weird\u201d to many people\u2014even to people who sympathized with the owners of Hobby Lobby on that company\u2019s particular claim. Other than on matters of reproduction, one might imagine that it would be difficult to find a religious reason to avoid providing a safe workplace, or to refuse to install pollution reduction devices, or to sell tainted food, or to challenge any of a number of other standard business-related laws.\n\nAs odd as it sounds, however, such claims could plausibly be supported by religious beliefs. There are plenty of people who hold what they claim to be religiously motivated beliefs, but whose beliefs would seem unsupported by the religion in question. American Protestant churches split over the question of slavery in the nineteenth century, for example. Some people read the Bible to require that believers provide charity to the poor, while others read the same Bible to say that we are required to allow poverty to continue. Does scripture require that heterosexuals love and accept homosexuals, or the opposite?\n\nThese difficult questions, moreover, arise even within established religions. RFRA, however, is not limited to those religions, and so long as someone sincerely believes in a religion, then even a brand-new religion is to be accorded respect. When people talk about \u201cfaith in the free market,\u201d we generally take that to be a metaphor; but what if a person says that her faith in unregulated commerce is a matter of religious conviction?\n\nAll of this, however, still presumes that the post-Hobby Lobby \u201cgold rush\u201d that I predicted would involve only companies that are eager to pursue religious claims, whereas others would be free not to do so. But what if it would actually be a breach of the fiduciary duty to a company\u2019s owners not to pursue such claims? In other words, what if companies would feel compelled to pursue religious claims\u2014even to the point of inventing new religions that embody their sincere beliefs in unregulated markets\u2014in order to fulfill their duty to their shareholders?\n\nThe renowned conservative economist Milton Friedman argued nearly a half-century ago that the managers of companies have no business \u201cdoing good,\u201d that is, that the executives who run a corporation have an affirmative duty not to \u201cgive away the shareholders\u2019 money\u201d by being good corporate citizens. Companies, under this view, would violate their solemn duties if they were to do anything more than what the law absolutely requires.\n\nThere is plenty of controversy over Friedman\u2019s views, of course. Even so, his logic suggests that companies are required not only to go to the edge of illegality in all of their dealings, but that they push the edge to see just how far it might go. Tax strategies that might later be found to be illegal, for example, are required business practice unless and until they lead to successful prosecutions. Similarly, spending company money to change the laws\u2014to lobby\u2014in a way that will pad the bottom line, even if doing so harms the political system and society at large, is merely a standard part of good business practices.\n\nOf course, corporate law in the United States gives management a great deal of leeway in deciding what is the best path toward maximizing profits. If a company could challenge an environmental regulation but chooses not to do so, the default assumption is that this was a judgment call by management that deserves to be respected. Maybe the managers thought that the suit would lose, or that the increased profits from winning were too small to matter, or any of a number of other reasons not to do something that could have increased the company\u2019s profits.\n\nThat default presumption, however, is still to be weighed against something like Friedman\u2019s view of fiduciary duty. If a corporate executive is handed a profit-making opportunity by the Supreme Court, and the company can avail itself of that opportunity simply by declaring its sincere fealty to religious beliefs that happen to increase the company\u2019s profits, then failing to pursue that avenue is potentially problematic.\n\nMoreover, even if companies\u2019 managers cannot be sued in a derivative lawsuit for failing to pursue RFRA claims, they will certainly now feel pressure to explore and pursue such claims. Internal debates over pursuing Hobby Lobby-like claims will surely arise, and it would be foolish to simply assume that only a tiny number of those debates will be won by those who wish to take an aggressive religious position.\n\nIf it turns out that there is merely a trickle of such litigation in the aftermath of Hobby Lobby, therefore, the most interesting question will not be to explain the cases that we see, but to understand why the trickle is not a flood. Or, to mix metaphors, if this dog does not bark, then sleuths will want to know why more companies are not following this new and promising path to free market salvation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://verdict.justia.com/2014/07/17/hobby-lobby-require-companies-find-religion", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/business_profits.jpg?resize=426%2C350&quality=90&strip=all&fit=1000%25", "description": "The Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the Hobby Lobby case continues to reverberate in legal and political circles, with seemingly every angle of the majority\u2019s bizarre decision being scrutinized, defen...", "title": "Does Hobby Lobby All But Require Companies to Find Religion?"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the Hobby Lobby case continues to reverberate in legal and political circles, with seemingly every angle of the majority\u2019s bizarre decision being scrutinized, defen...", "title": "Does Hobby Lobby All But Require Companies to Find Religion?", "url": "http://j.st/ZSzK", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/business_profits.jpg?resize=426%2C350&quality=90&strip=all&fit=1000%25", "site": "@VerdictJustia", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119529808075661}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "George Washington University law professor and economist Neil Buchanan discusses the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Burwell v.
