Coverage via the exchanges is looking a lot like Medicaid, despite the fancy bronze/silver/gold/platinum labels.\n\nThe vast majority of exchange plans won\u2019t allow access to many doctors and hospitals you prefer. Many plans exclude the top-drawer academic hospitals, like Cedars-Sinai in LA, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and New York Presbyterian here in the city.\n\nInstead, the law requires exchange plans to cover care at \u201cessential community providers . . . that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals\u201d [Sec. 1311c(1)C]. That means clinics, public hospitals and hospitals largely serving the Medicaid community.\n\nThe law\u2019s authors reasoned that exchange-plan customers should be able to shift back and forth between their plans and Medicaid, as their earnings fluctuate, without changing doctors and hospitals. That\u2019s good for those folks \u2014 but bad news for consumers who had access to esteemed hospitals and doctors under their old plans and then got pushed into the exchanges.\n\nMedicaid level care is, to use the president\u2019s word, substandard. For example, a review of the experiences of nearly 900,000 patients undergoing eight different surgical procedures found that Medicaid patients were 50 percent more likely to die in the hospital after surgery than patients with private coverage. This review, by researchers at the University of Virginia, is one of several studies showing that Medicaid patients get worse care than patients with private insurance.\n\nBut many of the plans offered on the exchanges are Medicaid with a private label slapped on. The McKinsey Center for US Health System Reform reports that Medicaid insurers are playing a large role in the exchanges.\n\nJust as many doctors refuse to accept Medicaid, they are also refusing to accept exchange insurance. In California, a Blue Cross plan on the exchange covers 47 percent fewer doctors than regular Blue Cross subscribers in California get now. In New York, only a quarter of physicians have decided to take exchange insurance, because the payments are so low.\n\nWhy so low? Because insurers know the low-cost plan will be king in nearly every exchange. All the plans offer the same, legally-mandated \u201cessential benefits package.\u201d Customers have no other way to compare than on price.\n\nYes, the law promised that exchanges would list each plan\u2019s quality rating and disclose which hospitals and doctors it covers. [Sec. 1311d(4)D and Sec. 1311c(1)B]. But so far, the info isn\u2019t listed \u2014 because, one suspects, ObamaCare administrators don\u2019t want us to see the truth.\n\nAnother problem with exchange coverage: Under ObamaCare\u2019s Section 1311, the health secretary has blanket authority to control how doctors and hospitals treat patients. So Kathleen Sebelius, the woman who says she should be held accountable for the Web site disaster, can set the rules for when your cardiologist uses a stent and when your ob/gyn does a Caesarean. That\u2019s supposedly for \u201cquality,\u201d but to ObamaCare\u2019s authors it really means cost.\n\nThis means that, if you enroll in an exchange plan, your care will be standardized by the federal government with an eye to reducing what you consume and how much it costs. Your doctor may have to choose between doing what\u2019s right for you and avoiding a penalty.
