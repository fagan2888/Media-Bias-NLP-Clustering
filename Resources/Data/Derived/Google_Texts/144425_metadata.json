The NTSB this fall recommended that railroads screen engineers for apnea to prevent the risk of falling asleep at the controls.\n\n\"Today Metro-North is taking another big step in our pursuit of best safety practices,\" Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti said in a statement. \"This pilot will go a long way to ensuring safety of our customers as well as improving the overall health of our employees.\"\n\nAn overnight sleep study at a medical center can cost thousands of dollars; in recent years at-home tests have become increasing popular with both patients and insurance companies. Aetna has estimated that at-home testing costs a third to a tenth as much as an in-lab exam.\n\nThe board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, parent of Metro-North, is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a proposed contract with Persante that the railroad said is worth up to $200,000.\n\nMetro-North created the testing policy in conjunction with the Long Island Rail Road, its sister operation, and the MTA's subway division.\n\nThe plan is to have the railroad's health services staff do an initial apnea screening of 410 current engineers and 20 who are in training. Based on the results, some will be referred to Persante for more extensive apnea testing.\n\nPersante will provide equipment and training for engineers to do their own at-home apnea tests, which typically involve far fewer sensors \u2014 and no staffing \u2014 compared with overnight tests at medical centers. The engineers will send the devices back to the company, which will analyze the results.\n\n\"If needed, employees will be referred to a sleep specialist for additional testing and/or treatment,\" the railroad said in a statement.\n\nRules about apnea screening vary widely in the transportation industry, but the risks have been known for years. In 2008, two pilots with Go! fell asleep during a flight and overshot the destination airport by 30 miles before waking up. The NTSB concluded that one, Scott Oltman, had undetected sleep apnea.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Metro-North Reaches Plan To Spot Apnea In Engineers", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Metro-North is on the verge of hiring a company to provide at-home sleep apnea tests for some of its 410 train engineers.", "title": "Metro-North Reaches Plan To Spot Apnea In Engineers", "url": "http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-metro-north-sleep-apnea-tests-for-engineers-1216-20141216-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-549026c4/turbine/hc-metro-north-sleep-apnea-tests-for-engineers-1216-20141216", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Metro-north railroad, connecticut news, apnea, engineers, sleep disorder, persante health care,", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/82302843", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-16", "Description": "Metro-North is on the verge of hiring a company to provide at-home sleep apnea tests for some of its 410 train engineers.
