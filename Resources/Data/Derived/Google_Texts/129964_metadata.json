That may strike some as a nice change of pace for a litigious society. But it is not the high court\u2019s role.\n\nWorse, this jury-rigged solution obscures a deeper issue: Our 229-year-old system of checks and balances is breaking down because of the continued refusal of Senate Republicans to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the open ninth seat on the High Court.\n\nThe court failed last week to rule on the merits of a case brought by religiously-affiliated non-profit employers who object to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that they provide female workers with contraception coverage in their health insurance. The Obama administration devised an accommodation: Non-profits could ask for a waiver, and women could still be covered. But some employers objected, saying that even applying for a waiver violates their religious beliefs if it ultimately enables women to obtain contraception. Seven cases in which lower courts around the country supported the administration\u2019s system were before the High Court.\n\nWith the court split between four conservatives and four liberals since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a 4-4 ruling would have effectively upheld the lower courts\u2019 decisions. Instead, the court punted, saying there appeared to be enough consensus on a possible compromise for the matter to be settled.\n\nHowever solomonic that may seem, it\u2019s not how the court is supposed to work. It\u2019s there to provide clarity on what is and isn\u2019t constitutional, not to say, \u201cWell, some say yes, some say no. Who are we to judge?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more to come. The court is weighing a case challenging Texas\u2019 requirements that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges and meet the standards for ambulatory hospitals. A deadlock would leave in place a lower court ruling in Texas\u2019 favor, keeping in place tactics clearly aimed at putting clinics out of business and making it harder for tens of thousands of women to exercise a constitutional right.\n\nAnd more may be on the way, with South Carolina banning abortions after 20 weeks \u2013 even in cases of rape or incest. Oklahoma on Friday averted a law making it a crime to perform an abortion at any time only because Gov. Mary Falin found it too vague and poorly written.\n\nThese attempts to erode a woman\u2019s right of choice underscore how essential a functioning court is. In ignoring a sitting president and declaring that \u201cthe American people should decide\u201d in the next election who should fill the court vacancy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his fellow Republicans are telling Americans that partisan politics trumps their rights, at least for the next eight months.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Observation Deck", "description": "The consequences of an evenly numbered \u2013 and too often evenly divided \u2013 Supreme Court grew more apparent last week as justices ventured into strange legal territory, taking on a role qu\u2026", "title": "A jury-rigged legal system", "url": "http://blog.timesunion.com/opinion/a-jury-rigged-legal-system/35315/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-22T07:08:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-22T07:08:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Seven cases in which lower courts around the country supported the administration\u2019s system were before the High Court.\nWorse, this jury-rigged solution obscures a deeper issue: Our 229-year-old system of checks and balances is breaking down because of the continued refusal of Senate Republicans to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the open ninth seat on the High Court.\nBut it is not the high court\u2019s role.\nIt\u2019s there to provide clarity on what is and isn\u2019t constitutional, not to say, \u201cWell, some say yes, some say no.\nThe Obama administration devised an accommodation: Non-profits could ask for a waiver, and women could still be covered."}
