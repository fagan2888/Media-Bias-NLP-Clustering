What more proof does the state need that Harden is a free woman than the fact that she talked to us in her living room on Friday.

"I haven't been arrested," says Harden. "I haven't escaped anywhere. I didn't do the helicopter thing like the guys in Canada. I'm not El Chapo. So, you know, I want my insurance."

We want her to have it too, that's why we sat down at my desk and emailed the state health department. We detailed Harden's story and asked -- how can this keep happening to this woman?

"This is the one that really got me," says Harden.

The notices she receives indicate her "disenrollment" because the state has proof that she is "currently an inmate in a correctional facility." Another notice wants Harden to prove her "incarceration status." The letters go back to 2014.

Brean: "Let's just be clear on one thing, you are not incarcerated right?"

Harden: "No."

Harden: "I go to work every day, okay, and I'm here. I don't have a -- what is it -- reward out for me."

Brean: "Warrant."

Harden: "Warrant or a reward. So nobody turn me in because you're not going to get anything."

Harden says she has prescriptions waiting for her that she can't get because of this.

The state says, "New York State of Health is required to rely on a federal database to verify incarceration. Since that database has Ms. Harden listed as incarcerated, we are required to seek verification when an eligibility determination is requested."

We checked the Bureau of Prisons. It has Ann Harden as released and that doesn't explain why it keeps happening after she fixes it. We told state health we need more clarity on this.

Ann Harden did serve time in the past, right?

Yes, in federal prison in Connecticut in the mid-90s for bank fraud. A violation of parole put her back in for a year in the mid-2000s. But the state is saying she's in prison now and it's clear she is not.
