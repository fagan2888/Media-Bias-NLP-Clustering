The pending exit will be the first out of HGGC\u2019s second fund that closed in March 2015 with about $1.3 billion in capital.\n\nSerena Software, based in San Mateo, California, provides software that can track and make changes to other application systems during the development process. The target helps more than one million users in about 2,500 business organizations. Under HGGC\u2019s ownership, Serena reduced its debt by about $100 million, reached double digit Ebitda growth and began generating about $30 million in annual software license revenue.

The two companies say there is a high demand for businesses to have up-to-date technology for their employees and customers. Micro Focus CEO Stephen Murdoch said with the purchase the company is \u201cfurther positioned to deliver richer solutions for the complex business demands customers are solving today.\u201d\n\nHGGC was founded in 2007 as Huntsman Gay Global Capital. The investors the firm was named for are Jon Huntsman Sr., chairman of chemical maker Huntsman Corp. (NYSE: HUN), and Robert Gay, a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They have no involvement in the current fund. The quartet running HGGC today includes three of the original founders, CEO Rich Lawson, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young and former Bain Capital executive Greg Benson, plus former Citigroup Inc.
