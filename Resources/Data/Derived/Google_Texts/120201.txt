Douglas County sheriff’s deputies on Friday arrested a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent on charges of domestic violence and criminal mischief.

Special agent Stephen Conor, 47, is in the county detention center through the weekend, a sheriff’s spokesman said, and is expected to appear before a judge Monday.

Conor allegedly slashed a car tire, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office said.

The sheriff’s office would not release the nature of Conor’s relationship with the alleged victim or say who owns the car.

Conor was arrested at work Friday afternoon without incident.
