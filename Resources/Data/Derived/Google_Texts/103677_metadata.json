The bill would also expand Medi-Cal so that undocumented immigrants who make under 138 percent of the poverty level -- about $32,000 a year for a family of four -- could receive that benefit.\n\nThere are an estimated 2 to 2.5 million undocumented immigrants in California, an estimated 1 million of them are uninsured. No word yet on how the bill would be funded; Lara said his office is working to come up with how much the proposal would cost taxpayers. Proponents of the proposal say the bill would save the state on healthcare costs in the long run.\n\nGuests:\n\nRicardo Lara, California State Senator (D-Bell Gardens) representing the 33rd District, which includes South Gate, Huntington Park, Vernon and Long Beach.
