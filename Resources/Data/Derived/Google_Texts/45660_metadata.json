We\u2019re giving control to the people to determine that, but what I do know is the path we\u2019re going on is not good for the state. There\u2019s got to be a better way.\u201d\n\nThe first of 40 stops Building a Better Colorado will hold around the state to see which ballot initiatives might fly are set for Sept. 21 in Glenwood Springs and Durango. In December, the organization will present \u201cconsensus policy recommendations\u201d that could be voted on next year, Brown said.\n\nWhile the solutions aren\u2019t yet fully formed, a fight over the state\u2019s constitutional Taxpayer Bill of Rights already is taking shape, especially among the hardline fiscal conservatives who are the common opinion-shapers in western Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to fly over here. This is just a vehicle to try to get rid of TABOR,\u201d Rep. Don Coram, a Republican from Montrose, said during Friday night\u2019s steak fry at a historic local ranch that teemed with fruit orchards.\n\nThe executive board for Club 20, a bipartisan organization, on Friday adopted a resolution in support of state transportation projects, even if it means raising the state gasoline tax. Another resolution backed moving a six-year-old state hospital provider fee out from under current state spending caps, which could free up $500 million for transportation and other needs instead of returning it to taxpayers in TABOR-mandated refunds.\n\nColorado voters passed TABOR in 1992 to apply some of the most restrictive taxing and spending limits in the country on state and local governments.\n\nBuilding a Better Colorado also wants to talk about whether unaffiliated voters should be allowed to participate in party primaries instead of only general elections.\n\nThe group also asks whether it\u2019s too easy to amend the Colorado constitution. Once there, citizen-led amendments are costly and cumbersome to change, even if they cause serious problems or conflicts with other constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a fiscal situation we\u2019re coming up on with funding Amendment 23, the negative factor,\u201d said Christian Reece, Club 20\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe\u2019re bumping up against TABOR, so I think there is a good reason to have this conversation to see if there\u2019s anything we can agree on to actually address that.\u201d\n\nAmendment 23 is the 2000 constitutional amendment and the negative factor is the controversial budgeting formula the legislature has used to restrict school budget increases. A pending lawsuit alleges about $850 million last year alone should have gone to schools under the amendment.\n\nMeanwhile, 1982\u2019s Gallagher Amendment has depressed residential property tax collections that would support schools.\n\nTo redirect that money to schools would mean the legislature must take money from other state services \u2014 such as transportation, public safety, economic development, environment and wildlife management and aid to the needy \u2014 to cover the increases for schools.\n\nDespite the acknowledged problems, it will remain a hard sell to find consensus on divisive, decades-old issues, numerous Western Slope leaders said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t get consensus on everything,\u201d Grand Junction City Councilman Duncan McArthur said. \u201cWe have problems in this state, but they\u2019re going to have a difficult time passing anything that takes money out of people\u2019s pockets.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Club 20 hears ideas on state amendments, elections and taxes at Western Slope event", "title": "Club 20 hears ideas on state amendments, elections and taxes at Western Slope event", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/12/club-20-hears-ideas-on-state-amendments-elections-and-taxes-at-western-slope-event/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150912_032152_club20-coram.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150912_032152_club20-coram.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T15:36:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T01:56:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd314\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI hope this is the right conversation,\u201d said Building a Better Colorado member Reeves Brown, the former Club 20 executive director.\nA new bipartisan, nonprofit civic organization called Building a Better Colorado is crafting its pitch to Colorado voters, who might vote on some of these changes during next year\u2019s general election.\nThe executive board for Club 20, a bipartisan organization, on Friday adopted a resolution in support of state transportation projects, even if it means raising the state gasoline tax.\nBuilding a Better Colorado also wants to talk about whether unaffiliated voters should be allowed to participate in party primaries instead of only general elections.\nColorado voters passed TABOR in 1992 to apply some of the most restrictive taxing and spending limits in the country on state and local governments."}
