The app, which project leader Dr. Andrew Bastawrous calls his \u201cEye-Phone,\u201d works with a special lens attached to the smartphone that can scan a person\u2019s retina and provide a magnified picture of the eye. Such an exam has sweeping benefits for the entire country of Kenya, which Bastawrous says is in dire need of optical health.\n\n\"Kenya was a natural test location,\" Bastawrous told Agence France-Presse. \"For a country with a population of more than 40 million, there are only 86 qualified eye doctors, 43 of whom are operating in the capital Nairobi.\"\n\nBastawrous and his team have developed the Nakuru Eye Disease Cohort Study, a comprehensive mission to provide Peek\u2019s service to people all around Kenya, many of whom are stranded outside city limits and cannot afford to travel for health care. Some 5,000 people have already benefitted from the app\u2019s capabilities.\n\nPeek has several components that allow researchers \u2014 and future consumers, the team hopes \u2014 to perform tests without standard requirements. Traditional eye exams, for instance, test a person\u2019s vision by asking the individual to read increasingly smaller lines of letters. This presupposes the patient can read, or at least read English. Bastawrous\u2019s app asks patients only to discern the orientation of a letter E; whether they know it\u2019s an E is irrelevant.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got normal vision, it gets the result very quickly,\u201d Bastawrous said in a recent LSHTM podcast. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve developed is an algorithm where you don\u2019t spent too much time on people with good vision, but it spends more time on people with poor vision.\u201d\n\nPeek also enables trained specialists to scan for cataracts and retinal damage on the back of the eye. Solar-powered charging packs allow the phones to function in remote settings that have no electricity, Bastawrous added. The team has successfully diagnosed ailments such as glaucoma, cataracts, myopia, and far-sightedness.\n\nTreatment proves somewhat more difficult, as only 200 of the 5,000 patients have received corrective surgery \u2014 the primary obstacle being location. The nearest large town, Nakuru, offers eye surgery at its hospital once every two weeks. It\u2019s during this window when patients can receive eyeglasses, eye drops, or more complex procedures.\n\nCataracts remain the largest cause of blindness around the world (47.9 percent of blindness cases), and the majority of cases take place in underdeveloped countries, like Kenya, which have minimal to zero access to viable health care. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 285 million people worldwide who have impaired vision. Of those, 39 million are blind. Bastawrous believes preventative measures \u2014 like those championed by Peek \u2014 can help to reduce this total immensely.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got scientific evidence that it changes practice and that it increases access to healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do in Kenya at the moment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smartphone app, peek, eye-phone, kenya, blindness, eye exam, cataracts, bastawrous", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A smartphone app called Peek lets specialists perform in-field eye exams without the clunky, costly use of professional equipment.", "title": "Smartphone App Gives Kenyans On-The-Spot Eye Exams", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eye-phone-sore-eyes-kenya-smartphone-app-lets-doctors-bring-eye-care-millions-africa-255507", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/peekafp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A smartphone app called Peek lets specialists perform in-field eye exams without the clunky, costly use of professional equipment.", "title": "Smartphone App Gives Kenyans On-The-Spot Eye Exams", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/eye-phone-sore-eyes-kenya-smartphone-app-lets-doctors-bring-eye-care-millions-africa-255507", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/peekafp.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/peekafp.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-04T15:07:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T15:07:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A smartphone app called Peek lets specialists perform in-field eye exams without the clunky, costly use of professional equipment."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddee4\"", "article_summary": "Such an exam has sweeping benefits for the entire country of Kenya, which Bastawrous says is in dire need of optical health.\nTraditional eye exams, for instance, test a person\u2019s vision by asking the individual to read increasingly smaller lines of letters.\nA smartphone app, called Peek, has seen immense success in preventing blindness among Kenyans thanks to doctors\u2019 breakthrough ability to perform mobile eye exams without the use of professional ophthalmoscopes.\nBastawrous\u2019s app asks patients only to discern the orientation of a letter E; whether they know it\u2019s an E is irrelevant.\nExperts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) have spent five years developing the technology that provides the on-site eye exam."}
