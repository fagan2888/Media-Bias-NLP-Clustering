Fresh off a few big announcements and a wave of publicized transgender harassment at the end of 2015, the TSA apparently is planning to kick it up a notch in the new year.

The huddled masses at airports will no longer be able to opt out of going through body scanners (which might be unlawful in the first place, but who's counting?). Also, if you have the misfortune of living in one of nine of states that have objected to the feds' REAL ID scheme, you may not even be able to use your driver's license to get on a plane. At least the DHS now says the TSA will give you 120 days' notice before invalidating your ID. Happy (first four months of) 2016!

And remember, no ID will save you if you try to bring a vehicle airbag or recreational oxygen aboard your flight, though your five pounds of dry ice are still welcome. Let's keep the fun reasonable, shall we?

Watch below for the behaviors you should and should not exhibit while traveling, lest you be confused for a terrorist.
