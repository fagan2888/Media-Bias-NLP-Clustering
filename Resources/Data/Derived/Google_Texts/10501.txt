A man suffered a significant blood loss late Sunday morning as he tried to defend himself from his knife-wielding attacker outside a south Topeka apartment complex, authorities said.

Topeka police and emergency responders were called at 11:39 a.m. to the Carriage House apartment complex, 1605 S.W. 37th Terrace, on a report of a stabbing.

Officers arrived to find the wounded victim lying on a sidewalk outside the apartment complex leasing office. He was taken by American Medical Response ambulance to a local hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening.

Police officer Brian Mooney said at the scene that the stabbing was the result of a fight that started in a second-floor unit at the apartment complex.

He said the victim and assailant knew each other.

Mooney said after the fighting had subsided, a man and woman left the building, then got into a white four-door Chevrolet car that was parked facing east in the 1600 block of S.W. 37th Terrace.

Mooney said the other person involved in the fight followed the man and woman outside, where he confronted the man as he was inside his car.

The assailant then produced a folding knife from his pocket and began slashing and stabbing at the victim, who tried to protect himself with his hands.

Mooney said the victim suffered apparent cuts to his hand and "lost a lot of blood" as a result of his wounds.

A witness who came upon the scene said the victim's sweatpants were "covered in blood."

A crime scene was set up in a relatively small area that surrounded the Chevrolet, including a short distance on the north lawn of the leasing office and north across S.W. 37th Terrace.

Blood could be seen smeared on the driver's side door of the Chevrolet. The folding knife was found on the street near the driver's door.

A sliding-glass door leading to the balcony of the unit where the fight occurred had been broken out.

Police were running a K9 trail at the scene, but as of 12:30 p.m. hadn't made an arrest.
