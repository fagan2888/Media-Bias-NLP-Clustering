The prosthesis, Osseo Anchored Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees (OPRA), is designed for amputees whose remaining limb is not long enough for traditional ball-and-socket prostheses. It's now available for all adults with above-the-knee leg amputations.\n\nThe OPRA device is surgically attached to a patient\u2019s remaining bone with two procedures. The first procedure involves surgically implanting a cylinder-shaped titanium fixture directly into the bone, Popular Science reported. For six months following the operation, patients are observed to make sure that the tissue has grown correctly around their new implant. After this waiting period, a second operation is conducted to implant a rod from the bone through the skin. This rod is then used to insert and fit a prosthetic limb.\n\nThe Swedish-made device allows amputees to attach a prosthetic limb directly to their remaining limb by attaching it to screws and a fixture implanted directly into the bone itself. The first-of-its-kind device will drastically improve the quality of life for amputees who are not viable for traditional prosthetics or who have had problems with other methods of rehabilitation. According to a 2014 study, along with storing an amputee\u2019s mobility, OPRA also offers amputees with more comfort and a greater amount of control over their prosthesis\u2019 function than available in current prosthetic models.\n\nInitial designs for OPRA have been around for years, but it wasn\u2019t until the implementation of Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis (ITAP), anti-infection technology, in 2013 that the FDA began to take the innovation seriously. Engineers modeled ITAP\u2019s design after the porous bone underneath deer antlers. The addition of ITAP to the OPRA not only helped to improve mobility but also seriously reduced the risk of infection by using the pores to help soft tissue seal off the connection between the bone and skin.\n\nFollowing the two operations, OPRA recipients are required to undergo six months of physical therapy. This involves the patient gradually putting his weight on the OPRA device while simultaneously learning how to move with a small training prosthesis limb. Only after this training period will amputees be fitted with their own customized prosthesis, according to the FDA press release.\n\nAlthough OPRA is built to be used on both upper and lower appendages, for now the FDA has restricted its use to individuals with leg amputations above the knee. According to Mark O\u2019Leary, one of the first amputees to be fitted with the new technology, the device has drastically improved his mobility.\n\n\"It's like they've given me my leg back,\u201d he told The Guardian.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "prosthesis, amputation, amputee, opra", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA has approved the use of OPRA, a prosthetic device that connects directly into the remaining thigh bone of amputees.", "title": "FDA Approves OPRA Prosthetic Leg, Which Connects Directly To The Bone", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approves-opra-prosthetic-leg-implanted-thigh-bone-above-knee-amputees-343840", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/20/opra.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA has approved the use of OPRA, a prosthetic device that connects directly into the remaining thigh bone of amputees.", "title": "FDA Approves OPRA Prosthetic Leg, Which Connects Directly To The Bone", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approves-opra-prosthetic-leg-implanted-thigh-bone-above-knee-amputees-343840", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/20/opra.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/20/opra.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-07-20T15:47:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T15:47:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA has approved the use of OPRA, a prosthetic device that connects directly into the remaining thigh bone of amputees."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0ec\"", "article_summary": "The OPRA device is surgically attached to a patient\u2019s remaining bone with two procedures.\nThe FDA approved a prosthetic device Thursday that implants in the thigh bone of an amputee.\nThe prosthesis, Osseo Anchored Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees (OPRA), is designed for amputees whose remaining limb is not long enough for traditional ball-and-socket prostheses.\nThe Swedish-made device allows amputees to attach a prosthetic limb directly to their remaining limb by attaching it to screws and a fixture implanted directly into the bone itself.\nThis involves the patient gradually putting his weight on the OPRA device while simultaneously learning how to move with a small training prosthesis limb."}
