This administration has had a policy of timid incrementalism. But under existing U.S. law, there are things we can do, because we have done them to other countries.\u201d\n\nSamore said Obama\u2019s strategy to confront North Korea has been similar to those of past presidents, whose diplomatic overtures were frustrated by a regime that ignores international pressure, while the most powerful potential partner in that effort, China, has proved unwilling to take major action.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is how consistent U.S. policy has been over last three presidents, and how consistently it has failed,\u201d said Samore, who also worked on nuclear issues in the Clinton and Reagan administrations. \u201cWe are really limited in what we can do as long as China has fundamentally different national interests.\u201d\n\nChina, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, has veto power over any resolution put forth by that body and is especially influential in the context of North Korea because it is Pyongyang\u2019s largest trading partner and economic provider.\n\nIn the past, China and Russia have objected to United Nations measures that could threaten the North Korean regime\u2019s survival, such as sanctions targeting financial transactions with the country or sales of commodities like coal.\n\n\u201cFor the Chinese, as much as they are uncomfortable with the North Korean nuclear program, their bigger fear is a collapse of the regime and unification under a government friendly to the U.S.,\u201d Samore said. \u201cThat would weaken China\u2019s geopolitical position. North Korea may not be much of an ally to China, but it\u2019s better for them than the Korean peninsula being dominated by a government friendly to the U.S.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting Wednesday, the Security Council vowed to \u201cbegin to work immediately\u201d on a resolution imposing additional measures against North Korea, and the American ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, called for a \u201ctough, comprehensive, and credible package of new sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Security Council has adopted four major resolutions since 2006 sanctioning North Korea for continuing to develop its nuclear weapons program and calling on Pyongyang to dismantle it.\n\nBut Samore said existing measures specifically target North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and don\u2019t strongly impact the country\u2019s basic economy.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the last resolution [from March 2013], there are bans on the sale of certain commodities to North Korea because of their potential use for nuclear activity, and a ban on financial transfers that people believe could support the nuclear program,\u201d Samore said. \u201cBut these are all targeted sanctions, so they are not important in influencing the overall economy. The big question is whether the Chinese would be willing to consider sanctions beyond targeted sanctions. I\u2019d be delighted if this last test would be enough to persuade Beijing to go a bit further, but we haven\u2019t seen much evidence of that.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Thursday said Congress would not wait to take action of its own, with plans next week for a sanctions vote against North Korea that will likely receive bipartisan support.\n\nOutside actions related to sanctions, South Korea is talking with the U.S. about deploying American strategic weapons on the Korean peninsula, according to Reuters.\n\nSouth Korea also said it will restart propaganda broadcasts into North Korea, Reuters reported.\n\nBruce W. Bennett, a defense analyst at the RAND Corporation focused on Northeast Asian military issues, said the U.S. is wise to consider nontraditional measures such as these.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is, we usually focus on economic responses with some form of sanctions,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cBut North Korea is largely isolated from the international marketplace and has not been affected much by U.N. actions. I think we have to ask if economic sanctions are the right approach. If we could also put political pressure on North Korea, that might change their incentives.\u201d\n\nIf North Korea doesn\u2019t change, the stakes are significant.\n\nNorth Korea is different from Iran, another nuclear threat, in that Pyongyang already has a small arsenal of nuclear weapons, while Tehran has only ambitions to obtain one.\n\nSome nuclear experts say North Korea could have more than 20 weapons by the end of this year.\n\nWhile Samore says North Korea is \u201cyears away\u201d from being able to deliver its nuclear arsenal into a weapon that could hit the U.S., Pyongyang has medium-range missiles that threaten allies South Korea and Japan sooner.\n\n\u201cThis particular test, this is the fourth one, so it\u2019s hard to get too excited,\u201d Samore said. \u201cBut the overall trend is North Korea is seeking to develop the nuclear weapons ability to attack us. There are no questions that is the objective.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test may be its most consequential, but the world is limited in how far it can respond because China must be on board.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test may be its most consequential, but the world is limited in how far it can respond because China must be on board.", "title": "China Makes It Hard to Stop North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Program", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/NorthKoreaChallenge.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T11:44:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JxpFd9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test may be its most consequential, but the world is limited in how far it can respond because China must be on board.", "title": "China Makes It Hard to Stop North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Program", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/NorthKoreaChallenge.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "nuclear", "published_time": "2016-01-07T17:32:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T11:44:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "North Korea, hydrogen bomb, Kim Jung-Un, China, Obama, South Korea, Japan, Paul Ryan, Iran, sanctions, U.N.
