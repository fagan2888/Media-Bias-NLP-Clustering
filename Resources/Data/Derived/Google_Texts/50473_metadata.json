Who knew it would turn out to be 40? My short-lived college experience pretty much resembled that nightmare you still have. You know, the one where you walk into a large hall, are handed a blue book and then realize you forgot to study or attend class? So, in 1968, after completing one year of college, I moved on to a satisfying life of writing jobs and political campaigns, marriage, raising children. Not having a college degree was by no means a serious issue, especially in Los Angeles where folks just want to know how many miles you ran that morning or if you have any good screenplay ideas. But upon moving to New York in 1983\u2014where inquiring and glittering minds immediately want to know, \u201cwhere did you go to school\u201d\u2014the diploma-less me began to feel the sting.\n\nI usually answered \u201cUniversity of California\u201d and left it at that. But it continued to gnaw at me and I began to crave closure. The unfilled hole also left a sour feeling of intellectual insecurity regardless of how many times I was reminded that Jobs, Zuckerberg, Gates, and countless artists didn\u2019t complete their four years. Eventually, I couldn\u2019t deny it anymore. I knew I had missed one of life\u2019s great social experiences, not to mention always feeling under-read, under-tested, and under-challenged. When I applied to Columbia\u2019s General Studies program (for those who did not complete college the first time for various reasons), my friends were astonished. Why now, when I wasn\u2019t looking for a new career? My answer was threefold: My husband and I would soon be entering empty nestdom, so it seemed a good time to fill it; I had always done everything late in life (marriage at 34, first child 39, braces in my 40s); I regretted not having had a real campus experience. Now that I am educationally embedded, folks generally first say, as did writer-publisher-Harvard grad James Atlas, \u201cI wish I could go back, when I know so much more about life. Books grow with us.\u201d Such sentiments are quickly followed by, \u201cBut I could never take a test or write a long paper.\u201d I am clearly not alone in my quest for academic validation: Well over half a million of the students enrolled in degree-granting institutions are over the age of 50. \u201cOne advantage about returning to college later in life is that the student will likely have a greater sense of purpose and focus and thus be able to capitalize better on what is offered,\u201d says Margaret Gatz, a psychology professor at University of Southern California. \u201cAnother advantage is that the older student brings a lifetime of experiences and knowledge to the new information being presented and thus can have a richer learning experience.\u201d Gatz points out potential barriers, including competing demands. (Every time I tell my adviser that I can\u2019t imagine how students could be taking four, even five classes at a time, he reminds me they are not also running a household and writing plays. Oh, that.) Another hurdle might be physical stamina. \u201cThe older student will be surrounded by college-age youth who have agile memories and who can stay up all night to cram for an exam or finish a paper,\u201d says Gatz. \u201cThis just means that the older student must be craftier.\u201d\n\nFortunately, there is increasing evidence that older students can succeed and that it will even keep our minds sharper. \u201cThere is as much variation in an aging brain as there is in a school child\u2019s brain,\u201d says New York psychiatrist Roger Gould. \u201cIf you and your brain are healthy, the only limitations to learning new mental skills and information are your motivation and natural intelligence.\u201d James Fallon, a neuroscientist at University of Irvine, claims \u201cpeople are at their maximum cognitive abilities are in their 60s. It\u2019s the ideal time to balance their executive functions, which younger students don\u2019t necessarily have yet, with intellectual techniques which are likely still there but haven\u2019t been used for a long time.\u201d Fallon, who is 66, says, \u201cI have never been more creative and productive.\u201d Fallon\u2019s views are corroborated by the Seattle Longitudinal Study, which tracked the cognitive abilities of thousands of adults over 50 years. The report shows that middle-aged adults performed better on four out of six tests than they did as young adults. Likewise, University of Virginia psychology professor Timothy Salthouse last year completed a comprehensive study entitled Consequences of Age-Related Declines and concluded, \u201ccognitive ability is important in daily life and there is currently little evidence that its importance declines with increasing age. In fact, there are some reasons to expect that the role of cognitive ability in late adulthoods is even more important now because individuals of all ages are being asked to take more responsibility for financial and medical decisions.\u201d Related Story 'We\u2019re Not This Alien Group': Chinese Students on Fitting In at U.S. Colleges Gatz offers us older students some key tips: Attend lectures; study actively (keep testing yourself along the way); focus on one thing at a time; look for opportunities to discuss the material. And, says Gatz, \u201cEmphasize understanding over memorizing: Older learners have an advantage in recalling the gist of what they have read or been told, so relate what you are learning to what you already know.\u201d That said, some \u201ccraftiness\u201d is called for. Before I went back to school, I didn\u2019t even know what mnemonics meant (let alone how to spell it), but I sure do now. I got through Music and Art Appreciation classes by attaching every composer or artist to a letter in the alphabet, or connecting them to some personal memory. I devise a way of organizing my notes and memorizing what the pages look like, so when handed the dreaded blue exam books, I immediately draw pictures of my studied pages. How much do I retain? Probably about 10 percent.
