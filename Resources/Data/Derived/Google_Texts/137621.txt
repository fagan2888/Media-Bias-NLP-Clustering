Trevor Brown and sisters Rebecca and Evelyn Irvin lit lanterns Sunday night for Kaylyn Rose Sommer at a memorial on James Island. The Irvins were neighbors of Sommer, who went overboard earlier this month during a cruise.

Family and friends of a missing Charleston woman who went overboard during a cruise off the coast of Cuba earlier this month gathered Sunday for a memorial service in her honor.

Chacha’s Mexican Grill on Folly Road on James Island was overflowing with Kaylyn Rose Sommer’s loved ones. The walls were lined with photos and a slideshow of images played on a large screen in front of the restaurant. It ended with the quote, “gone but not forgotten.”

Sommer, a 24-year-old mother, was on a Norwegian Pearl cruise from Miami to Cozumel when she went overboard Nov. 12. It is believed she went overboard from a height of more than 80 feet above the water while the cruise ship was underway, according to the Coast Guard, which responded to search for her.

That search was suspended a couple of days later after Coast Guard crews covered 1,378 square nautical miles looking for Sommer. The FBI continues to investigate Sommer’s death.

“I felt like they were going to find her because I just couldn’t believe it,” said Evelyn Irvin, a neighbor who frequently baby-sat for Sommer.

Irvin, her boyfriend Trevor Brown and her sister Rebecca Irvin lit lanterns to release Sunday night for Sommer. They described her as being like an older sister to them and friendly to everyone she met.

“They’re the kind of people where you only have to know them for a week and you’re (considered) family,” Rebecca Irvin said of Sommer and her husband. “Everyone who knew her loved her.”

She added that Sommer and her husband were married on the same cruise the year before and that they were celebrating their first anniversary.
