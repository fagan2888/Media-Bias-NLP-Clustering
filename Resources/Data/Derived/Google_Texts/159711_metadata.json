It\u2019s worth taking a look to see if there\u2019s something better for you.\u201d\n\nHooper said Take Command offers all the plans available on Healthcare.gov as well as many off-exchange plans. In addition, the company will help people see if they qualify for a federal tax credit.\n\nHooper, 31, runs the company with 22-year-old Matt McPhail, the chief technology officer and an electrical engineering major at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nConsumers can use Take Command\u2019s free service by first entering their ZIP code, then entering information about themselves and their family. They\u2019re then asked for their expected household income for next year.\n\nTake Command will tell them whether they qualify for the premium tax credit under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen shopping for health insurance, consumers should consider what plan covers them best for the care they know they need,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cIn our research, we found that over 75 percent of a person\u2019s health costs are completely predictable with a little thought. You know if you have a chronic condition, need to see a physical therapist, get seasonal allergies, etc. People panic worrying about major accidents and illness (which is why you get insurance), but they are rare events.\u201d\n\nThe website will return three possible plans for the consumer:\n\nThe Best Value \u2014 \u201cBest Value only considers cost factors such as plan premiums, estimates for care (prescriptions, doctor visits, etc.), tax credits and deductions,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cIt ignores any doctor information.\u201d\n\nMost Doctors \u2014 \u201cMost Doctors considers everything best value does and also looks to see if the doctors you requested in the interview are in-network,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cFor example, if a person lists three doctors, we\u2019ll look at all the plans that have all three of their doctors and then recommend the \u2018best value\u2019 from among those plans. If no plans have all their doctors, then we look at the plans that have 2 out of 3, and so on.\u201d\n\nThe Least Risky \u2014 \u201cYou have the lowest out-of-pocket expenses if you have various accidents or health scenarios,\u201d he said. \u201cWe usually recommend the Best Value one.\u201d\n\nTake Command is a health insurance broker and makes money from a commission it gets from selling insurance policies. Currently, it\u2019s selling coverage from Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, Humana and Cigna, and is negotiating with UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to get into the group market, too,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cRight now, this is just for individuals.\u201d\n\nThe idea for Take Command came from Hooper\u2019s personal experience with health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe genesis came when my wife and I moved to Philadelphia for grad school in 2011, starting an MBA program at Wharton [The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania],\u201d he said. \u201cWe found out the day we were driving to Philadelphia that we were pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe had to wait for the student health insurance to kick in, then found out it was twins, which was a double blessing and a double surprise.\u201d\n\nThey ran into a brick wall when they tried to find out how much it was going to cost to have twins.\n\n\u201cI was on the student health plan at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and I couldn\u2019t find out how much twins were going to cost,\u201d he said.\n\nHis experience spurred him to use his education to study the business aspects of health care.\n\n\u201cI spent the next two years at Wharton studying health insurance, health care transparency, collecting a bunch of data,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cThat\u2019s what led to Take Command Health.\u201d\n\nFollow Pamela Yip on Twitter\n\nat @pamelayip.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his job title, Jack Hooper calls himself the chief executive of takecommandhealth.com and \u201cVictim of Overpriced Insurance.\u201dIt\u2019s the latter moniker that he hopes will propel his fledgling Dallas-based...", "og": {"description": "In his job title, Jack Hooper calls himself the chief executive of takecommandhealth.com and \u201cVictim of Overpriced Insurance.\u201dIt\u2019s the latter moniker that he hopes will propel his fledgling Dallas-based...", "title": "Wharton grad launches health insurance shopping website", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20141121-wharton-grad-launches-health-insurance-shopping-website.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-11-22T04:05:24Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-11-22T04:03:49Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Wharton grad launches health insurance shopping website\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20141121-wharton-grad-launches-health-insurance-shopping-website.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2057425\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-22T04:03:49Z\", \"section\": \"General Business\", \"author\": \"PAMELA YIP\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-22T04:03:49Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI spent the next two years at Wharton studying health insurance, health care transparency, collecting a bunch of data,\u201d Hooper said.\n\u201cWe usually recommend the Best Value one.\u201dTake Command is a health insurance broker and makes money from a commission it gets from selling insurance policies.\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know it\u2019s open enrollment or they don\u2019t know this is their chance to look at new health plans,\u201d Hooper said.\nWhere consumers trip up when buying health insurance is when they get into the \u201cdetails, the fine print, the weeds,\u201d Hooper said.\n\u201cWhen shopping for health insurance, consumers should consider what plan covers them best for the care they know they need,\u201d Hooper said."}
