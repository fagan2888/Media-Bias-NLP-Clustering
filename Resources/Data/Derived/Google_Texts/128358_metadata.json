As they get older, however, it\u2019s important for them to take on some of that responsibility.\n\nSo what steps should parents take?\n\n\u201cFirst, the child needs to be aware,\u201d said Sharon Fuentes, the mom of a boy with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and co-author of \u201cThe Don\u2019t Freak Out Guide to Parenting Kids With Asperger\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOnce children with autism are armed with information about their specific challenges, they can advocate for themselves. But often, they lack the ability to filter how much they share, and with whom. So in addition to teaching them how to speak up for themselves, it\u2019s important to make sure they know there are times when they might want to keep information private, said Jim Ball, the executive chairman for the national board of the Autism Society.\n\nHere are suggestions from Ball and Fuentes on teaching your child when and how to disclose a diagnosis, and how to express what she needs:\n\n\u25a0 Make sure children understand the difference between needs and preferences.\n\nBefore she could teach her son to go to teachers or administrators and ask for what he needed, Fuentes had to teach him there is a difference between things he absolutely must have and things he would like.\n\n\u25a0 Have older children write a note to their teachers. Fuentes got a template from ImDetermined.org before the school year started, and had her son use it to write a letter to each of his teachers. The letter outlined who he is, what he likes and dislikes, what stresses him out and what he needs to succeed. Jay handed the notes to the teachers himself before the school year started.\n\n\u201cIt was huge for teachers to see that,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the mom saying this is what my son needs.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Include the child in IEP meetings.\n\nFuentes said her son has begun sitting in for parts of his individualized education plan meetings. She said it has helped him understand why he gets certain services or accommodations, but not others.\n\nIt also allows him to voice concerns about situations that may be problematic for him. Not every child has the language skills to verbalize needs, but Fuentes said that even a simple yes or no, verbally, through gestures or with an assistive communication device, can boost a child\u2019s self esteem.\n\n\u25a0 Talk about \u201csafe people\u201d when it comes to sharing information. Talk to your child about when to share her needs or disclose her diagnosis, Fuentes said. Otherwise she might start telling other students, unnecessarily, and bullies could use the information against her.\n\n\u25a0 Turn to a book.
