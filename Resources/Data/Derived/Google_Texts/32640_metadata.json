Over the past three years, he\u2019s spent most of his time staring through windows in Maricopa County\u2019s 4th Avenue Jail.\n\nOn the day he was arrested, police randomly knocked on his front door to confront him about a drug house shooting that happened more than a decade ago. Cruz, who was 19 years old when the shooting occurred, didn\u2019t pull the trigger. But two people died and his presence at the drug house landed him behind bars for first degree murder and drug possession.\n\nAlthough Cruz hasn\u2019t been diagnosed with a specific condition, his family is relatively certain he suffers from mental illness. He was always slower to learn in school \u2014 even in his special education classes. By the time he dropped out after eighth grade, he was only reading and writing at a second grade level. He turned to drugs when he was 12 years old, and due to his illness, Cruz has never been able to hold down a job.\n\nHis mother, an elderly, low-income Latina woman, could never afford to take Cruz to a specialist to determine what was wrong. She certainly couldn\u2019t pay the $450,000 bond to get him out of jail or hire private attorneys to help with the case. About one year after walking through 4th Avenue\u2019s doors for second-degree murder, Cruz\u2019 mental health deteriorated rapidly. The jail refuses to transfer him to a hospital, and his situation has become so dire that he may get a life sentence because he\u2019s too disabled to answer questions in court.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not alone.\n\nMaricopa County \u2014 notorious for anti-immigrant policing and barbaric jail conditions under Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 is neglecting inmates in desperate need of mental health treatment, according to an ACLU motion filed on Friday. Eighteen months after Sheriff Joe Arpaio and county commissioners asked a federal judge to lift a 2008 court order, which required the county to provide adequate medical and mental health services for prisoners, people behind bars are still denied basic care. Arpaio\u2019s efforts were futile, but little has changed.\n\nHe started losing his speech very bad. He wasn\u2019t really recognizing us.\n\nSome of those prisoners, including Cruz, are so mentally impaired that they aren\u2019t competent enough to go to court. Their cases can\u2019t move forward, so they\u2019ve been locked up for extended periods of time without a trial. Instead of sending them to local hospitals, Maricopa County jails are keeping them in solitary confinement.\n\nThat\u2019s a stark departure from the 2008 court order and 2014 renewal of that order requiring the jails to either give these detainees mental health services or transfer them to another facility that can provide treatment.\n\n\u201cLocked down for up to 24 hours a day, they deteriorate, refusing medication and treatment, living in squalor, and growing more symptomatic by the day,\u201d the motion reads.\n\nFor example, a man diagnosed with chronic psychosis smeared feces on the wall of his isolated cell, and experienced hallucinations. Jail staff once saw him stick his head in the toilet bowl. Instead of sending him to a psychiatric hospital, he remained in solitary for nine months. Another patient was similarly tossed into solitary for smearing feces on the wall. Staff watched him pour toilet water on his body and attempt to flood his cell. No medication was offered to him, even after he tore up his mattress and said he was Jesus. When he finally got out, he had nowhere to go but the streets.\n\nA female patient \u201crepeatedly smeared feces and blood in her cell and on her face\u201d and repeatedly pulled her hair out. She spent a year shuffling between solitary at the jail and outpatient segregation, and never took her medicine. She was released a year later.\n\nFriday\u2019s motion is an attempt to have the court rulings enforced and get patients the care they need. If it\u2019s granted, those deemed severely mentally ill and incompetent for trial would be sent to psychiatric facilities outside of the jails.\n\nMario Cruz with one of his two children CREDIT: Ebelia Cruz\n\nGoing In Circles\n\nEbelia Cruz, a Phoenix native, knows all too well that her brother, Mario, is suffering.\n\n\u201cHe started losing his speech very bad. He wasn\u2019t really recognizing us,\u201d she told ThinkProgress.\n\nWhen he\u2019s in court, she says, he becomes disoriented and doesn\u2019t know where he is. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re in the real world,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get up and try to walk to me, and then he gets in trouble and thrown out of court.\u201d\n\nTime behind bars has brought Mario physical and mental anguish. What was supposed to be a 20-day stint in solitary confinement turned into a full year, and his sister never learned why. According to emails and medical records obtained by ThinkProgress, his nose and eye socket were fractured, but it wasn\u2019t attended to for over a year.\n\nMario is now scared and distrustful of everyone except his attorney, so he\u2019s uncooperative with doctors. He also refuses to meet with psychiatrists more than once, so they\u2019re unable to write the report needed to prove he\u2019s not mentally competent to go to trial.\n\nEbelia has fought tooth and nail to get him the care he needs. She obtained guardianship to make necessary health care decisions for him, since he won\u2019t do so on his own \u2014 but the court says she can only get him medicine. That seemed like a valid option, until she was informed that jail staff would have to force it down with a syringe \u2014 a painful process that Ebelia won\u2019t cosign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been hurt enough,\u201d she said. She\u2019s been given the runaround by lawyers and jail representatives ever since.\n\nNow, three years after his arrest, Mario is unable to comprehend and answer questions in court. Like so many others, he hasn\u2019t been transferred to a psychiatric facility that can help restore competency before court. Despite his impairment, the prosecutor in his case is pushing hard for jail time. The best case scenario he\u2019s offered is a second degree murder plea that would lock Mario away for 10 years \u2014 three of which he\u2019s already served.\n\nGiven his mental state, that option seems more and more unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe judge says he cannot let the prosecutor offer a plea, because Mario is not understanding anything,\u201d Ebelia said. \u201cIn order for a prosecutor to offer that plea formally, Mario would have to go through all these questions that the judge asks of him \u2014 and answer them right.\u201d\n\nCruz is unable to take the plea, but the judge is still forcing him to go to trial. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to send him to trial and he\u2019s gonna go to jail forever,\u201d she said.\n\nCruz\u2019s attorney denied ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment.\n\nA National Failure\n\nThe latest ACLU motion may focus on Maricopa County specifically, but jails and prisons have become de facto mental health facilities nationwide, generally with disastrous results. Ever since the 1960s, when the government started slashed federal funding for mental health services, treatment facilities have shut their doors, prematurely released patients, and turned away people in desperate need of care. Unable to access treatment, people who show erratic or unstable behavior end up interacting with police officers more than doctors \u2014 and they usually get thrown in jail.\n\nHe\u2019s been hurt enough.\n\nThe number of inmates with mental illness has skyrocketed as a result.\n\nA 2015 Urban Institute report found that 64 percent of all jail inmates, 56 percent of state prisoners, and 45 percent of federal prisoners have a history of mental illness. Depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the most commonly cited illnesses.\n\nBut the criminal justice system is ill-equipped to treat the inmates properly. Prisons and jails are understaffed, underfunded, and don\u2019t have the medical infrastructure that hospitals enjoy. Some simply don\u2019t care. And people like Mario Cruz suffer.\n\nAll the while, states and smaller municipalities keep gutting mental health spending. States cut more than $4.35 billion between 2009 and 2012.\n\nDespite the court orders to provide medical and mental health care for inmates in its care, Maricopa County has dragged its feet on funding these services. That\u2019s why the ACLU filed the motion on Friday, and why Ebelia worries so much that she can\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cMario, when he was born, my mother was older. So I was kinda like the mom,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s kinda like my son instead of my brother. I have always taken care of him no matter what.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Locked down for up to 24 hours a day, they deteriorate, refusing medication and treatment, living in squalor, and growing more symptomatic by the day.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Locked down for up to 24 hours a day, they deteriorate, refusing medication and treatment, living in squalor, and growing more symptomatic by the day.\"", "title": "Ignoring Court Orders, Maricopa County Locks Up Mentally Ill People Too Impaired For Trial", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/04/02/3765379/maricopa-county-jails-mentally-ill/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/01150459/joe-graphic-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Locked down for up to 24 hours a day, they deteriorate, refusing medication and treatment, living in squalor, and growing more symptomatic by the day.\"", "title": "Ignoring Court Orders, Maricopa County Locks Up Mentally Ill People Too Impaired For Trial", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/01150459/joe-graphic-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/01150459/joe-graphic-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/01150459/joe-graphic-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-02T09:55:22+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "About one year after walking through 4th Avenue\u2019s doors for second-degree murder, Cruz\u2019 mental health deteriorated rapidly.\nDespite the court orders to provide medical and mental health care for inmates in its care, Maricopa County has dragged its feet on funding these services.\nAll the while, states and smaller municipalities keep gutting mental health spending.\nJustice Ignoring Court Orders, Maricopa County Locks Up Mentally Ill People Too Impaired For Trial CREDIT: Dylan Petrohilos/AP Photo/Ross Franklin/Charlie RiedelMario Cruz barely talks above a whisper, avoiding most conversations and mumbling on the rare occasion that he does choose to speak.\nMario Cruz with one of his two children CREDIT: Ebelia CruzGoing In CirclesEbelia Cruz, a Phoenix native, knows all too well that her brother, Mario, is suffering."}
