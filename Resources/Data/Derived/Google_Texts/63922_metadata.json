Combined, the three control more than 90% of the U.S. drug distribution market.\n\nAmerisourceBergen is due to report results on Oct. 30 for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect it to log full-year revenue of $118.8 billion, up 35% from fiscal 2013. That would be its biggest gain in at least a decade.\n\nIn contrast, McKesson posted a 13% fiscal 2014 revenue gain to $137.6 billion, while Cardinal logged a 10% decline to $91.1 billion.\n\nAll three stocks are part of IBD\u2019s Medical-Wholesale Drug/Supply group, which ranks No. 61 of 197 industries that IBD tracks.
