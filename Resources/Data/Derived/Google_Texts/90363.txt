A 21-year-old Boulder man was being evaluated for a potential mental health hold late Saturday after police responded to an apartment complex on reports of someone who was possibly armed and suicidal.

Boulder police were called to the GlenLakes apartments late Saturday morning, located at 2995 Glenwood Drive, and launched a search for the man who was threatening suicide and whom they said should only be approached with caution.

The situation was resolved about 2:35 p.m., according to Sgt. Dave Seper, after the man contacted his mother, who in turn got in touch with police.

Seper said contact with the man was coordinated through his mother, and that he surrendered peacfully. Seper said a "handgun was involved" in the incident, but he did not elaborate.

Despite the heavy presence of police with guns drawn at the Glenwood Drive address, residents were not evacuated, and Glenwood Drive was never closed down to traffic.
