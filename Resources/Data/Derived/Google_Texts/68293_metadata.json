Taken as a test case, some experts say this could bode well for Obamacare\u2019s impact on the financial health of American households.\n\nThere are many similarities between the health-care reform in Massachusetts in 2006 and President Obama\u2019s 2010 Affordable Care Act. Both aim to achieve near-universal coverage by combining a mandate for individual insurance with insurance market reforms and a broad expansion of subsidized coverage for low- and middle-income households, according to \u201cThe Effects of the Massachusetts Health Reform on Financial Distress\u201d by economists at the Federal Reserve of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame. \u201cThe context of our study is a major state-level reform that closely resembles the Affordable Care Act, making this analysis highly relevant for the ongoing debate surrounding the current federal program,\u201d economists Bhashkar Mazumder and Sarah Miller concluded.\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe impact of reform on personal bankruptcy, delinquency and even credit scores was far more pronounced for those whose credit scores were lower before the reform. But those with higher credit scores before the reform\u2014and better access to credit\u2014experienced a larger relative decline in total debt, the authors found after analyzing credit report data that covered one-fifth of the Massachusetts population. \u201cIdeally, full implementation of federal health care reform will lower the out-of-pocket costs of health care enough to cause a similar decline in medical debt, one of the leading causes, along with layoffs and divorce, of bankruptcy filings,\u201d says Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the non-profit U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study on health care reform to extend to measures of bankruptcy,\u201d says Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was also a principal designer of Massachusetts\u2019 health-care overhaul and consulted on the Affordable Care Act. It confirms findings from a randomized expansion of Medicaid in Oregon, which showed enormous reductions in financial stress, Gruber says. (In that earlier study, \u201cThe Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,\u201d published in 2012 in the \u201cQuarterly Journal of Economics,\u201d Medicaid recipients who gained health insurance coverage in 2008 through a lottery reported less financial strain and fewer medical bills than those who didn\u2019t receive any coverage through the lottery.)\n\nBut others doubt that the Affordable Care Act will have the same effect. \u201cSince Obamacare is extending Medicaid in 25 states, we would expect fewer medical bankruptcies amongst persons with incomes at or near the federal poverty line,\u201d says Stephanie Woolhandler, professor of public health at Hunter College in New York. \u201cFor the non-Medicaid-eligible population, the effect of Obamacare on medical bankruptcies is likely to be minimal. Even insured people may end up with ruinous out-of-pocket costs if they experience a prolonged or expensive illness.\u201d Woolhandler co-authored a 2011 study on bankruptcy in Massachusetts, which found that medical bankruptcies eased only slightly to 52.9% in 2009 from 59.3% in 2007, but it only surveyed 199 bankruptcy filings.\n\nAmericans also face some strong headwinds. Although it\u2019s slowing, health-care inflation is still running at a faster pace than stagnant wage growth, says Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health, a membership group for employers. \u201cThat\u2019s a big threat to financial security,\u201d he says. Obamacare will also reduce the total number of hours worked by about 1.5% to 2% from 2017 to 2024, according to data released this month from the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe Massachusetts study factored in unemployment rates as a variable to be controlled for rather than being affected by what they\u2019re measuring,\u201d Wojcik says. To be sure, the CBO report refers to labor supply and participation\u2014meaning new job opportunities could also be created\u2014not actual jobs.\n\nObamacare will certainly help those who in the past would have declared bankruptcy and could not afford health care, says Wendell Potter, a former vice president of corporate communications at health insurer Cigna. It puts limits on how much insurers can charge people because of their age, provides subsidies for those with low incomes and prevents insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, people under age 26 are covered under their parents\u2019 insurance. It won\u2019t protect them entirely, however. \u201cThe sad reality is that even with the protections in the Massachusetts law and Obamacare, people who are in low paying jobs and high deductible plans are still at risk of bankruptcy if they get sick or injured,\u201d Potter says.\n\nAlso see:\n\nNot enough young people bought Obamcare\n\nObamacare fix brings new complications\n\n10 things Obamacare won\u2019t tell you\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "New study suggests law could reduce personal bankruptcies.", "creator": "@Quantanamo", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT955_obamac_MG_20140204120111.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Quentin Fottrell", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "New study suggests law could reduce personal bankruptcies.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-obamacare-reduce-bankruptcies-2014-02-19", "author": "Quentin Fottrell", "parsely-title": "Is Obamacare really a wealth-care law?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-19T08:42:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "New study suggests law could reduce personal bankruptcies.", "title": "Is Obamacare really a wealth-care law?", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-obamacare-reduce-bankruptcies-2014-02-19", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT955_obamac_MG_20140204120111.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT955_obamac_MG_20140204120111.jpg"}, "article.id": "338AEE9C-9965-11E3-BFF6-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Taken as a test case, some experts say this could bode well for Obamacare\u2019s impact on the financial health of American households.\n\u201cThe Massachusetts study factored in unemployment rates as a variable to be controlled for rather than being affected by what they\u2019re measuring,\u201d Wojcik says.\n\u201cFor the non-Medicaid-eligible population, the effect of Obamacare on medical bankruptcies is likely to be minimal.\nAlso see:Not enough young people bought ObamcareObamacare fix brings new complications10 things Obamacare won\u2019t tell youMore from MarketWatch\nThere are many similarities between the health-care reform in Massachusetts in 2006 and President Obama\u2019s 2010 Affordable Care Act."}
