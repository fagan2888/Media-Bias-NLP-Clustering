The foundation is a co-holder of the easement on Boneta\u2019s farm.\n\nEach side made 20-minute presentations about the easement on Boneta\u2019s property and what she has called abuses on the part of the environmental council in its enforcement of the terms.\n\nEasements are agreements landowners enter into with conservation organizations such as the Piedmont Environmental Council. The property owners receive cash or tax breaks for agreeing to limits on development. Boneta did not receive tax breaks because the easement was attached when she bought the farm.\n\nAfter the presentations, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation\u2019s seven-member board voted 6-0 to adopt a resolution expressing its willingness to take over enforcement activities.\n\nBoneta, who has accused the Piedmont Environmental Council of colluding with government officials and realtors to force her off her property, said the resolution \u201cgives me hope for the future.\u201d\n\nStephanie Ridder, who is both chairman of the outdoors foundation\u2019s board and a member of the environmental council, abstained.\n\nUnder the current arrangement, the foundation is concerned with the land and outer appearance, and the council monitors the architecture and structures on Boneta\u2019s 64-acre Liberty Farm in the Paris section of Fauquier County.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the actions taken today by the [foundation] board members, as it offers a way forward,\u201d Boneta told The Daily Signal in an interview after the meeting.\n\nLeaders of the environmental council emerged from the meeting expressing their willingness to negotiate an arrangement with Boneta that would enable the outdoors foundation to assume control of the council\u2019s portion of the easement.\n\n>>> Breakthrough Eyed in Farmer\u2019s Property Rights Dispute With Green Group\n\n\u201cWe are willing to have this discussion,\u201d said Chris Miller, president of the Piedmont Environmental Council. Miller added:\n\nOur concern has been with our obligations under state law to enforce the easement. But we are very open to finding a solution. We are pleased to see Martha doing so well with her agricultural activities.\n\nThe resolution says the Virginia Outdoors Foundation is willing to take full control of the easement, but a formal proposal must be made with Boneta and the Piedmont Environmental Council in agreement.\n\nTurner Broughton, an attorney for the environmental council, suggested his clients would be willing to \u201center into negotiations with Boneta in response to today\u2019s action.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are certainly willing to discuss the resolution,\u201d Broughton said.\n\nState Del. Brenda Pogge, R-James City County, attended the meeting and told The Daily Signal afterward that she plans to introduce legislation in the upcoming session of the Virginia General Assembly to reform easements on public lands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a citizen legislator who is outraged by the abuse we have seen in this case,\u201d Pogge said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe way Martha was treated does not resemble truth, justice and the American way. That\u2019s what we need to get back to. My bill would address the use of easements on public lands that would include schools, firehouses and other public buildings. It\u2019s just a start. My bill would not address private lands.\u201d\n\nAbout 100 people were present for the foundation\u2019s board meeting, which was preceded by a rally in front of the General Assembly that included about 40 property rights activists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Virginia Outdoors Foundation approved a resolution Thursday that said it was willing to take over easement enforcement on Boneta's farm.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Virginia Outdoors Foundation approved a resolution Thursday that said it was willing to take over easement enforcement on Boneta's farm.", "title": "Virginia Outdoors Foundation willing to take over easement enforcement from Piedmont Environmental Council on Boneta Farm", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/marthaandbaby.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T09:30:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1qsfw2x"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Virginia Outdoors Foundation approved a resolution Thursday that said it was willing to take over easement enforcement on Boneta's farm.", "title": "Virginia Outdoors Foundation willing to take over easement enforcement from Piedmont Environmental Council on Boneta Farm", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/marthaandbaby.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "constitution,individual freedom", "published_time": "2014-11-07T03:01:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T09:30:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "property rights, Boneta, Boneta farm, Liberty Farm, Piedmont Environmental Council, Virginia Outdoors Foundation, Brenda Pogge, Virginia General Assembly"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4b8\"", "article_summary": "Boneta and representatives of the Piedmont Environmental Council appeared at a meeting of the Virginia Outdoors Foundation\u2019s board of trustees in the Virginia General Assembly building here.\nEasements are agreements landowners enter into with conservation organizations such as the Piedmont Environmental Council.\nThe resolution says the Virginia Outdoors Foundation is willing to take full control of the easement, but a formal proposal must be made with Boneta and the Piedmont Environmental Council in agreement.\n>>> Breakthrough Eyed in Farmer\u2019s Property Rights Dispute With Green Group\u201cWe are willing to have this discussion,\u201d said Chris Miller, president of the Piedmont Environmental Council.\nAfter the presentations, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation\u2019s seven-member board voted 6-0 to adopt a resolution expressing its willingness to take over enforcement activities."}
