John DiStaso is the most experienced political writer in New Hampshire and has been writing a weekly column since 1982.)\n\nA RECORD HAUL. The New Hampshire Republican Party\u2019s First-in-the-Nation Summit was not without its glitches.\n\nNot everyone was entirely pleased throughout the two-day \u201ccandidate-fest.\u201d But party chair Jennifer Horn and the party hierarchy are happy this morning.\n\nThe NHGOP confirmed to Primary Source on Wednesday it is going to net more than $200,000 from the event, based on actual receipts and sponsorship still outstanding, boosting its total fundraising for 2015 to $265,000. These totals are unprecedented for the state GOP at this point in the cycle.\n\nIn retrospect, the summit survived the onslaught of 19 candidates, more than 600 patrons and more than 200 journalists. The quarters at the Crowne Plaza Hotel were tight. Some complained because it wasn\u2019t held in a larger venue, such as the Radisson Hotel Armory in Manchester.\n\nAnd then there was The Wedding. At 4 p.m. on Saturday, just as Ted Cruz was wrapping up his speech in the ballroom, the hotel staff began breaking down the ballroom and the media room. People scattered. Media members bolted for the lobby to find any available chair and electrical outlet for their laptops to write their stories.\n\nIt was messy, but not the disaster that had been anticipated. People coped, the wedding reception went ahead as scheduled and the bride and groom ended up having their photos taken with Scott Walker.\n\nOverall, it was an impressive job by the NHGOP organizers who put on an event that, for them, was historic in its size and scope. See more about the summit below.\n\nHILLARY. Hillary Clinton has come and gone. What did all of us learn?\n\nFirst, we learned that everything we\u2019d heard about the controlled nature of her visit to Iowa last week was true. Because it was pretty much the same here.\n\nWe\u2019re assured by her campaign team that in future visits to New Hampshire, she will be more accessible not only to the media, but more importantly, to real voters. There was precious little interaction with \u201creal\u201d people on Monday and Tuesday. Her events were staged, packed with invited guests and Clinton kept, as expected, almost entirely on message.\n\nBut Clinton accomplished what she set out to do here \u2013 talk about how to create jobs for \u201ctomorrow,\u201d as her campaign put it, and about affordable education. She touched on the need to preserve Social Security. She talked about the need to close the gap between the rich and the middle-class, adhering to the call of those on her ideological left for a truly populist, Elizabeth Warren-style message.\n\nShe did not speak about her tenure as secretary of state, at least not in public. She did not address foreign policy, at least not in public. She did not mention the controversial Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, which has split President Barack Obama from liberals in her party.\n\nAnd in her very brief interview with WMUR, she brushed aside as \u201cdistractions\u201d questions about her deletion of about 30,000 emails and the charges in an upcoming book that she used her influence as secretary of state to curry donations for the Clinton Foundation.\n\nWhat Clinton did do this week was re-connect with many old friends and the political elite in the New Hampshire Democratic Party. The result was a sense of energy among Democrats, who have grown tired of watching the fun and games on the Republican side. For two days, at least, they were the center of attention. They were the ones being interviewed by the media. They were the ones being sought out for analysis of a presidential candidate\u2019s visit.\n\nUPDATE: VLACICH CALLS CLINTON TRIP A \u2018SUCCESS.\u2019 Hillary Clinton has been accused by political foes of being inaccessible during her two-day visit to New Hampshire this week, but her state campaign director says she engaged Granite Staters in a personal way and called the trip a \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe outlined the first of the \u2018four fights\u2019 that are at the center of her campaign, building an economy that works for tomorrow,\u201d Mike Vlacich wrote in a memo to \u201cinterested parties\u201d Thursday afternoon. \u201cFrom Keene to Claremont to Concord, Granite Staters sat down for conversations with Clinton about the issues impacting their communities and daily lives.\u201d\n\nVlacich wrote that Clinton\u2019s appearances in small venues \u201cgave Hillary Clinton the opportunity to interact with New Hampshire residents, one-on-one. The results were a series of productive conversations where everyday Granite Staters could share their thoughts and ideas with her.\u201d\n\nThe memo recounts each of Clinton\u2019s stops during her visit with positive comments from several of the workers and education with whom she met.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, Hillary Clinton has made clear that this campaign isn\u2019t about her, it is about everyday Americans. Two roundtables - one at Whitney Brothers, a small family-owned family-friendly manufacturing business in Keene, and the other at NHTI, Concord\u2019s community college - created opportunities for Granite Staters to engage Hillary in a personal way,\u2019 Vlacich wrote.\n\nPAYING HOMAGE. Clinton visited with many top Democrats \u2013 in Claremont at a house party at the home of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen staffer Bethany Yurek, and in Concord the home of former state Senate President Sylvia Larsen, with a small group of women Democratic leaders at the home of former state Sen. Mary Louise Hancock, and then with about 100 state lawmakers at New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters.\n\nAnd she paid homage to not only the 94-year-old Hancock, but to two other Democratic women dear to party insiders.\n\nAmong the invited guests at the roundtable discussion at Whitney Brother in Keene was Patricia Russell, the former Keene mayor and longtime outspoken activist.\n\nAt NHDP headquarters, party chair Raymond Buckley gave Clinton a tour of the Anita Freedman Conference Room, named after the late party secretary, Democratic National Committeewoman and co-chair of both of President Bill Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire campaigns.\n\nMuch of the memorabilia from Freedman\u2019s home was given to the party after she died in 2010 and is on display in the conference room.\n\nAccording to Buckley, Hillary Clinton loved the photos, particularly one from the annual \u201c100 Club\u201d dinner in 1992 showing her and former party chairman Chris Spirou presenting Freedman with a top award.\n\nAccording to Buckley, Clinton asked, \u201cDid Bill see all of this?\u201d\n\nSUMMIT WINNERS. Who impressed at the GOP summit? Uncommitted Republicans we\u2019ve spoken with since Saturday agreed there were no real losers. No one made any glaring mistakes or failed to get his or her message across.\n\nThe name we\u2019ve heard most often for being the most impressive \u2013 most \u201cpresidential,\u201d if you will \u2013 was Marco Rubio, who laid out a visionary message in his Friday night keynote address. Perhaps it was because Rubio had just announced his candidacy four days earlier, or perhaps it was because he was the closing speaker for that day and had the biggest audience, but he came across as ready for prime time.\n\nThe Saturday keynoter, Scott Walker, was more \u2013 let\u2019s just say, \u201cworkmanlike.\u201d And more than one Republican told us they believed Walker was upstaged by former Gov. John H. Sununu, who, introducing the Wisconsin governor, made a heartfelt case -- speaking off the cuff, without notes \u2013 for unifying after the voters decide on a nominee in the summer of 2016.\n\nOthers favorites of the non-committed activists we contacted were Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry and Rand Paul. And it goes without saying that Donald Trump made a huge impression, as only he can.\n\nPaul used the weekend particularly well, holding a series of meetings after his speech with conservatives and young people. And it was an overall good week in New Hampshire for Christie, who came in with accompanied by headlines such as \u201cDead Man Walking,\u201d and made news for laying out a specific entitlement reform program and his two town halls.\n\nGeorge Pataki had the most unique summit presentation, answering questions submitted to his PAC\u2019s website and on video in a town hall-style format.\n\nGIVE HIM THE HOOK? While The Donald was impressive on the summit podium, he and his entourage ruffled some feathers backstage.\n\nEvery candidate was afforded 30 minutes to make a speech and answer questions from the audience, and, according to several Republicans who were on the scene, when Trump arrived as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was about half-way through his presentation, Trump staffers told organizers, \u201cMr. Trump is ready to speak now,\u201d and demanded that Jindal be given the hook right away. NHGOP staff refused, insisting Trump wait his turn like everyone else.\n\nThere was no major blow-up, but party leaders were taking about it for the rest of the day.\n\nTrump national adviser Corey Lewandowski took issue with the description of the scene given to Primary Source by NHGOP sources.\n\n\u201cHe was honored to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had nothing to do with the logistics. We were hold that Mr. Trump would go on after Mr. Jindal, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nTRUMP-MENTUM? By all indications, Trump is moving toward a presidential run. As we first reported on Twitter, on Monday, he\u2019ll be the first Republican to return to New Hampshire since the summit when he holds three public events and a private meeting.\n\nIn Salem, he\u2019ll talk to area business owners at the Tuscan Kitchen, hosted by owner Joe Faro. He\u2019ll then meet privately with veterans at the Hudson VFW.\n\nHe\u2019ll hold his first town hall meeting at New England College and wrap up the day as the featured guest at a \u201cPolitics and Pie\u201d event in Concord, hosted by Republican National Committee members Steve Duprey and Juliana Bergeron and the Concord City Republican Committee.\n\nCARLY RETURNS. Carly Fiorina, moving toward an expected presidential declaration on May 4, will return to New Hampshire next Tuesday through Thursday for nine events. She picked up the endorsement of Bettie Lamontagne, wife of former candidate for governor Ovide Lamontagne, on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBARACK, BRADY AND DEMERS. When the New England Patriots are honored at the White House on Thursday for their Super Bowl XLIX championship, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte are expected to be there.\n\nSo will strategist/lobbyist Jim Demers, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s very first New Hampshire supporter back in 2006. Demers said he received an invitation from the White House for the ceremony.\n\nHe said he also has a connection to Tom Brady, through Best Buddies, an international nonprofit that raises funds for intellectually and developmentally disabled children and adults. Brady is also deeply involved in the organization.\n\nDemers said he has played golf twice with Brady at an annual event for Best Buddies and has a photograph of himself with Brady at the top of his Facebook page.\n\nWill he get a \u201cselfie\u201d with Brady and Barack? The pressure is on.\n\nTHE CONSERVATIVES\u2019 CAUCUS. A recently formed conservative group, the 603 Alliance, held its own summit at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Nashua the day after the Republican Party finished its event.\n\nA wrap-up memo to supporters obtained by Primary Source reported that the \u201cconsensus among the group\u201d was that \u201ceverybody is sick of losing and will support the GOP nominee and not stay home,\u201d \u201cThird party is definitely out\u201d and \u201c603 Alliance members will come together behind a conservative candidate and come up with a list of second, third and fourth choices.\u201d\n\nThe group intends to hold an Iowa-style caucus on Oct. 17 to \u201cdetermine who the conservative candidate is.\u2026Members will be encouraged to turn out 25,000 primary votes for the endorsed candidate.\u201d\n\nWhile no one questions the right of the Alliance \u2013 headed by some of the most prominent conservatives in the state \u2013 to hold such a caucus, GOP establishment-types are not happy at what appears to be an effort to choose a single candidate to challenge the likes of Jeb Bush, Chris Christie or perhaps John Kasich should he run.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all fine individuals and fine conservatives,\u201d said a top party activist, \u201cbut that\u2019s not how the primary operates. All of these candidates are pretty capable in their own right.\u201d\n\nQUICK HITS:\n\nO\u2019CONNOR\u2019S FUNDRAISING. Democratic 1st District congressional candidate Shawn O\u2019Connor reported first quarter fundraising receipts of $591,645, with $500,000 of it a loan from himself to his campaign committee. Of the additional $91,645, a total of $6,600 came from itemized contributions of $200 or more from New Hampshire.\n\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN? This didn\u2019t take long. No sooner had Hillary Clinton departed the NHDP premises on Tuesday when Buckley received another call \u2013 this one former Rhode Island Sen. Lincoln Chaffee, who is preparing for his first visit to the Granite State since announcing a presidential exploratory committee. Chaffee and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley are headed to South Carolina this weekend to speak at the South Carolina Democrats\u2019 state convention.\n\nGRASSROOTS TRAINING. The NHDP state committee meeting on Saturday at the headquarters of IBEW Local 490 in Concord will focus on \u201cgrassroots training\u201d with sessions on messaging, the online database VoteBuilder, local committees, candidate recruitment and (of course) fundraising.\n\nTHE THOMSON PLEDGE. Tom Thomson, the longtime anti-tax champion and son of the late Gov. Meldrim Thomson, Jr., is rolling out his \u201cPresidential Pledge\u201d for the second consecutive cycle. Those who sign it will promise to \u201cwork tirelessly to cut taxes, fees, regulations, spending, the national debt; to secure the borders \u201cby whatever means are necessary\u201d; to become energy independent; to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act; and to \u201cfollow and protect the United States Constitution. Who will be the first to sign?\n\nSUNUNU WITH KASICH. On the heels of his speech to the First-in-the-Nation Summit, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has set up a 527 group, called \u201cNew Day for America,\u201d with longtime friend former Sen. John E. Sununu as a director.\n\nNOT YET READY. Gov. Maggie Hassan is not yet ready to endorse Hillary Clinton for president, telling reporters on Wednesday, \u201cI\u2019m not making any decisions about 2016 until after the budget is done.\u201d Hassan backed Clinton in 2008 and was a campaign adviser on policies affecting children and families \u2013 and clearly, the news in this case would be if she does not back Clinton.\n\nBACK TO KELLY. With Hillary Clinton out of the state, the NHDP will resume its barrage against Sen. Kelly Ayotte on Thursday by accusing her of being \u201cat the center of Washington dysfunction with human trafficking victims and the confirmation of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer.\n\nCLOSEUP THIS WEEK. This week on WMUR\u2019s \u201cCloseUP,\u201d Political Director Josh McElveen will interview two Republican state lawmakers who are undecided on the gambling debate at the State House, Reps. Katherine Prudhomme-O\u2019Brien of Derry and John Tholl of Whitefield. He will also review the Hillary Clinton visit with her state campaign manager, Mike Vlacich, and the First-in-the-Nation Republican Leadership Summit with state GOP Chair Jennifer Horn. The program airs on Sunday at 10 a.m.\n\n(John DiStaso can be reached at jdistaso@hearst.com or distasoj@gmail.com.
