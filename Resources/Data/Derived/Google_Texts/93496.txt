ATHENS, Greece (AP) â€” Greek authorities say fugitive terrorist Christodoulos Xiros, who was arrested Saturday near Athens, was planning a major operation against an Athens prison in order to free other convicted terrorists.

Greek police chief Dimitrios Tsaknakis told reporters that a search in the safe house Xiros used turned up extensive notes on approaching, and safely getting away from, Korydallos prison, in a western Athens suburb

The house also contained rifles, explosives and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

Xiros was serving six life terms, plus 25 years, for his role in the Marxist group November 17, which killed 23 people, including Greek politicians, businessmen and British, American and Turkish diplomats and military officials, from 1975 to 2000.
