I\u2019m very happy to see girls playing,\u201d said Massar, 78, of Yuba City, California.\n\nCanada\u2019s Emma March and Philadelphia\u2019s Mo\u2019ne Davis Friday became the 17th and 18th girls to play in the tournament. It is only the third time in the series\u2019 68-year history that two girls are playing in the same series.\n\nDavis continued to impress. She threw a two-hitter to help Philadelphia beat Nashville 4-0. Davis had eight strikeouts and didn\u2019t walk a batter.\n\nDavis, who received a noticeably louder reception than any other player during introductions, said she noticed plenty of girls younger than her in the audience. The applause heightened significantly when Davis struck out the final batter, becoming the first girl to throw a shutout in Little League World Series history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unreal. I never thought at the age of 13 I would be a role model,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHopefully more girls play Little League.\u201d\n\nMarch did not fare as well.\n\nBatting cleanup ahead of her brother \u2014 Evan \u2014 and playing first base, she went hitless Friday in Canada\u2019s 4-3 loss to Mexico.\n\nBut March created some excitement when she stepped into the batter\u2019s box.\n\nShe drove a long fly ball to right field in the fourth inning that the crowd thought might be a home run. However, the hit sailed foul into the stands. Then in the top of the fifth, March stepped to the plate with the bases loaded and Canada down by two runs. After working the count to 2-2, she struck out looking on a pitch that caught the outside corner.\n\nAs March trotted back to the dugout, the crowd let the umpire know its opinion of the call as boos reigned down from the stands.\n\nMassar, slated to throw out the first pitch at one of Monday\u2019s games, believes more girls will start to play in Little League and beyond. She thinks eventually there will be a woman in Major League Baseball.\n\nMassar played in 1950, leading to a rule barring girls from playing. That rule was overturned in 1974. The self-described \u201ctrailblazer\u201d said she celebrates her role in history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m proud of,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not play baseball with the boys?\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett was in South Williamsport on Friday and watched Davis\u2019 dominating performance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on her, and she seems to be handling it very, very well for her age,\u201d Corbertt said during the Philadelphia game, adding that the 13-year-old has a nice delivery. \u201cIt goes to show you how sports have moved the last 30 or 40 years, and we wouldn\u2019t have thought of this 40 or 50 years ago. And today, she\u2019s out there pitching, doing a great job and I\u2019m sitting there thinking, \u2018Is she going to go into professional baseball?\u2019 I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s played as well as any kid out there right now.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press Writer Sean Carlin in Philadelphia and AP freelance writers John McGonigal and Michael Kilcoyne in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "1st female Little League player happy for Mo\u2019ne Davis, Emma March", "title": "1st female Little League player happy for Mo\u2019ne Davis, Emma March", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/15/1st-female-little-league-player-happy-for-mone-davis-emma-march/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815_053515_mo-ne-davis.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140815_053515_mo-ne-davis.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-15T17:32:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:12:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHopefully more girls play Little League.\u201dMarch did not fare as well.\nI\u2019m very happy to see girls playing,\u201d said Massar, 78, of Yuba City, California.\nCanada\u2019s Emma March and Philadelphia\u2019s Mo\u2019ne Davis Friday became the 17th and 18th girls to play in the tournament.\nThe applause heightened significantly when Davis struck out the final batter, becoming the first girl to throw a shutout in Little League World Series history.\nMassar, slated to throw out the first pitch at one of Monday\u2019s games, believes more girls will start to play in Little League and beyond."}
