Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is, in many ways, a clear win for Republicans.\n\nThe agreement establishes spending at $1.012 trillion in 2014 and $1.014 billion in 2015, up from the $967 billion as established by sequestration. It provides $63 billion in sequester relief, which is partially offset by a $23 billion mix of spending cuts and \u201cfees.\u201d It doesn\u2019t extend emergency unemployment insurance, or provide any other relieffor the long-term unemployed.\n\nYes, this deal precludes any entitlement cuts for the next two years, which, as Dave Weigel notes, is something of a win for liberals. But on the whole, it\u2019s hard to see how Republicans have lost with this agreement, which comes close to the budget levels set in Ryan\u2019s original \u201cPath to Prosperity.\u201d As the Wisconsin congressman argued this morning, \u201cWe got the Democrats, who are against any of the sequester, to agree to 70 percent of the sequester.\u201d Sequestration tore at our threadbare social safety net, and this deal leaves the damage intact. For liberals, it\u2019s a huge disappointment.\n\nBut to the conservative Republicans who forced a shutdown and two debt limit stand-offs, it isn\u2019t good enough. Within minutes of its announcement, Florida Senator Marco Rubio\u2014who is still mending fences after alienating right-wing opponents of immigration\u2014denounced the agreement. The conservative purists at the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks, and Club for Growth are also unhappy with the agreement. \u201cThis is a significant achievement for the president, who believes that government spending is a panacea to America\u2019s economic woes,\u201d writes Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham in an op-ed for USA Today. Likewise, in a letter to supporters, Americans For Prosperity railed against the deal, \u201cRight now Congress is making backroom deals to increase spending and the deficit to over a trillion dollars a year, which we can\u2019t afford. They promised to cut spending, but instead are trying to spend even more!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this right-wing outrage that explains opposition from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip John Cornyn. \u201cI remain convinced the Budget Control Act has done what it was supposed to do,\u201d said McConnell to reporters. \u201cIt has been a success, and I hope we don\u2019t revisit it.\u201d Likewise, Cornyn said that he was \u201cdisappointed that apparently some people are willing to give up the spending caps for just more spending and no entitlement reform.\u201d The problem for both is that they face primary challenges, and while they\u2019re likely to keep their seats, it\u2019s also true that established Republicans have been knocked out by more populist opponents.\n\nWhich gets to the core dysfunction of the modern GOP. In a healthy political system, the parties make a trade: Democrats will support Republican preferences if, in return, they win support for their own. This was the model for the Affordable Care Act: Democrats were \u201ctrading\u201d a market-based exchanges that preserved much of the status quo for near-universal coverage. The problem comes when one side\u2014in our case, the Republican Party\u2014rejects compromise as a matter of principle.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201312122004, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "The deal brokered by Patty Murray and Paul Ryan is a substantial win for conservative Republicans, but they're too stuck in ideological mania to see it.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Tea Party Republicans: The Biggest Sore Winners in Washington", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Tea Party Republicans: The Biggest Sore Winners in Washington\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/12/tea-party-republicans-the-biggest-sore-winners-in-washington.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/12/tea-party-republicans-the-biggest-sore-winners-in-washington/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46229294.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/12/tea-party-republicans-the-biggest-sore-winners-in-washington\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-12T20:04:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T20:04:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/12/tea-party-republicans-the-biggest-sore-winners-in-washington", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The deal brokered by Patty Murray and Paul Ryan is a substantial win for conservative Republicans, but they're too stuck in ideological mania to see it.", "title": "Tea Party Republicans: The Biggest Sore Winners in Washington", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/12/tea-party-republicans-the-biggest-sore-winners-in-washington.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/12/tea-party-republicans-the-biggest-sore-winners-in-washington/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1386878846199.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d3e\"", "article_summary": "But to the conservative Republicans who forced a shutdown and two debt limit stand-offs, it isn\u2019t good enough.\nThe budget deal brokered by Senator Patty Murray of Washington and Rep.
