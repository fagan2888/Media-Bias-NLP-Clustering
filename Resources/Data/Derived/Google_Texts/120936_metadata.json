Congress hasn\u2019t passed substantive cybersecurity legislation in years, despite a consensus among lawmakers that something should be done.\n\n\u201cThis is the state of cybersecurity policy today: growing urgency, but no metrics and little science,\u201d Weitzner said.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader effort at three universities to tackle cybersecurity challenges. The research is backed by a $45 million grant from the Hewlett Foundation, a charitable organization launched by the co-founder of tech giant Hewlett Packard.\n\n\u201cChoices we are making today about Internet governance and security have profound implications for the future,\u201d said Hewlett Foundation President Larry Kramer. \u201cWe view these grants as providing seed capital to begin generating thoughtful options.\u201d\n\nStanford University will focus on creating trustworthy networks, and the University of California, Berkeley will take the long view, determining what cybersecurity might look like decades from now.\n\nMIT will examine the immediate policy concerns, such as how to protect vulnerable financial and medical data, as well as emerging technologies like self-driving cars and drones.\n\nBreaches at banks like JPMorgan and at medical care facilities like Community Health Systems have technologists worried about private industry data security requirements.\n\nGovernment agencies have also experienced a slew of hacks, highlighting the outdated federal information security laws.\n\nAnd while some government regulators have started to issue initial rules for self-driving cars and drones, no long-term policy has been set.\n\nLawmakers have targeted these as pressing issues, but there is little research on the security of these systems, Weitzner said.\n\nWeitzner and his research team are well-equipped to bridge the gap between research and policy, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very good at understanding the system dynamics on the one hand, then translating that understanding into concrete insights and recommendations for policymakers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe university is home to some of the nation\u2019s most critical cybersecurity technology, including the cryptographic algorithm protecting most online financial transactions.\n\n\u201cThat gives us the ability to have our hands on the evolution of these technologies to learn about how to make them more trustworthy,\u201d said Weitzner.\n\nCongress has largely stalled on cybersecurity since former government contractor Edward Snowden disclosed a number of government surveillance programs more than a year ago.\n\nSince then, the focus on Capitol Hill has shifted to surveillance reform, with many worried cybersecurity legislation won\u2019t move until Congress curtails the National Security Agency\u2019s authority.\n\nTuesday night, the Senate failed to move forward on bill to do just that, the USA Freedom Act. The measure would have ended an NSA phone metadata collection program and increased transparency of the secretive court that oversees the agency.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Driverless cars, and health and financial data are also on the list.", "description": "Driverless cars, and health and financial data are also on the list.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Driverless cars, and health and financial data are also on the list.", "title": "MIT wants to set drone cybersecurity policy", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/224675-mit-wants-to-set-drone-cybersecurity-policy", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-19T12:45:23-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-19T12:45-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/224675-mit-wants-to-set-drone-cybersecurity-policy", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-19T10:18-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "undefined,Daniel Weitzner,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-19T10:18:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T12:45:23-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/224675-mit-wants-to-set-drone-cybersecurity-policy", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Driverless cars, and health and financial data are also on the list.", "card": "summary", "title": "MIT wants to set drone cybersecurity policy"}, "dcterms.title": "MIT wants to set drone cybersecurity policy"}, "article_summary": "Daniel Weitzner, President Obama\u2019s deputy chief technology officer from 2011-2012, will head a new cybersecurity policy initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\u201cThis is the state of cybersecurity policy today: growing urgency, but no metrics and little science,\u201d Weitzner said.\nA former top Obama administration official is hoping to help establish cybersecurity policy for driverless cars, delivery drones, and health and financial data.\nADVERTISEMENTPolicymakers are shooting in the dark with cybersecurity, Weitzner said.\nThe university is home to some of the nation\u2019s most critical cybersecurity technology, including the cryptographic algorithm protecting most online financial transactions."}
