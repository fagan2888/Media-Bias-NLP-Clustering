( Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call )\n\nAlthough illicit activity appears to have slowed down at a nuisance house at 330 Collyer, Longmont police are still keeping tabs on the property.\n\n\"In the course of a year-and-a-half, there were three search warrants for drug activity,\" Master Police Officer Augie Bernal said. \"It's got a very long history of drug activity.\"\n\nBernal said the house, which was formally listed as a nuisance house last April, has been associated with drug activity, people fighting and yelling at each other in the streets and trespassing at nearby homes and St. John the Baptist Church across the street.\n\n\"They've got a school at this church,\" Bernal said. \"When the kids are out on the playground, that is a big concern.\"\n\nPolice raided the home four times \u2014 once in 2011 and 2012 and twice last year.\n\nBernal said that activity at the home has slowed down, but police still respond there on a variety of calls.\n\nPolice arrested two people in February who had been staying at the home in defiance of the court order that only allows the owner, Silverio Nuanez, to have one blood relative living with him. It also limits the number of visitors he can have.\n\nNuanez, 75, told the Times-Call on Friday that there are no drugs in his house anymore and he has been keeping it cleaned up. Court records show he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge stemming from an arrest last year, but a felony charge was dismissed.\n\nHe said that the two people police arrested in February no longer live at the home, but his grandson lives with him.\n\nPolice calls to another property at 103 St. Clair Avenue have slowed to a trickle after the home was declared a public nuisance, according to Master Police Officer Dan Kilian.\n\nBoulder County District Court records show the owners signed a permanent injunction listing the home as a public nuisance in 2010.\n\nKilian said the home had become a haven for gang members \u2014 police responded 362 times between 1989 and 2008 \u2014 but calls to the home and neighborhood have slowed considerably.\n\nHe said police responded to numerous harassment and assault calls from neighbors who had been hassled for wearing colors that offended some of the gang members. City officials also reported being harassed when coming to the house.\n\nKilian said the owner of the home, Joseph DeHerrera, has largely complied with the nuisance order, which limits people who can live at the home to blood relatives and visitors who are not on probation or parole.\n\nHe added that a neighborhood clean up project helped spruce up and reunite the neighborhood.\n\n\"Since then, we have had very low calls for service in that whole neighborhood,\" Kilian said.\n\nDeHerrera told the Times-Call that there haven't been any problems at his house for a long time and the police \"haven't been here in a while.\"\n\nBernal said a nuisance house can be seized if the owner continues to violate a court order, but courts are reluctant to do so. He added that Nuanez' home was once up for sale but isn't any longer.\n\nHe said that police want to move forward with getting stricter regulations imposed on the home but cannot do so unless they can show more violations to the court.\n\n\"I really feel for the neighbors for what they have experienced in the past and what they are still experiencing,\" Bernal said.\n\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27938718/activity-at-longmont-nuisance-house-has-slowed-but", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0417/20150417__20TCATAKw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Although illicit activity appears to have slowed down at a nuisance house at 330 Collyer, Longmont police are still keeping tabs on the property.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27938718:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-19T13:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27938718/activity-at-longmont-nuisance-house-has-slowed-but", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0417/20150417__20TCATAKw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Although illicit activity appears to have slowed down at a nuisance house at 330 Collyer, Longmont police are still keeping tabs on the property.", "title": "Activity at Longmont nuisance house has slowed but police are keeping watch"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Although illicit activity appears to have slowed down at a nuisance house at 330 Collyer, Longmont police are still keeping tabs on the property.", "title": "Activity at Longmont nuisance house has slowed but police are keeping watch", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27938718/activity-at-longmont-nuisance-house-has-slowed-but", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0417/20150417__20TCATAKw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-19T13:00:00-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Activity at Longmont nuisance house has slowed but police are keeping watch", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0417/20150417__20TCATAKw~2.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2015-04-20T11:06:24-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-17T19:42:25-0600", "byline": "By John BearStaff", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-04-17T19:44:17-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc4d\"", "article_summary": "( Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call )Although illicit activity appears to have slowed down at a nuisance house at 330 Collyer, Longmont police are still keeping tabs on the property.\n\"In the course of a year-and-a-half, there were three search warrants for drug activity,\" Master Police Officer Augie Bernal said.\n\"It's got a very long history of drug activity.\"\nBernal said a nuisance house can be seized if the owner continues to violate a court order, but courts are reluctant to do so.\nBernal said that activity at the home has slowed down, but police still respond there on a variety of calls."}
