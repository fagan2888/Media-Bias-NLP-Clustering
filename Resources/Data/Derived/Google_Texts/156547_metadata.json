The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions.\n\nWithout relief, the Little Sisters would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government\u2019s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nPreviously, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily protected the Little Sisters from the mandate. The Little Sisters then went before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to extend that protection, but a panel of the appeals court ruled against them. Eventually the full appeals court ruled in its favor but the Obama administration appealed.\n\nYesterday, the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of Catholic nuns who care for the elderly poor, urged the Supreme Court to protect them from $70 million dollars in government fines for refusing to violate their Catholic faith. This is the second time the Sisters have been forced to ask the Supreme Court for protection from the government\u2019s efforts to make them to provide contraceptives to their employees. The Supreme Court gave the Sisters preliminary protection in January 2014, and it will hear their case in March of this year.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters spend their lives taking care of the neediest members of our society \u2014that is work our government should applaud, not punish,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, Senior Counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \u201cThe Little Sisters should not have to fight their own government to get an exemption it has already given to thousands of other employers, including big companies like Exxon and Pepsi Cola Bottling Company.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s brief, which was filed by the Becket Fund along with former Solicitor General Paul Clement, chides the government for its \u201cdeceptive labels and diversionary tactics\u201d designed to falsely suggest that the Little Sisters can \u201copt out\u201d of the mandate.\n\nThe brief also explains why the government does not need the Little Sisters at all: because it already has many other ways to get contraceptive coverage to those who want it. \u201cIndeed, the government has invested billions of dollars in creating exchanges for the express purpose of making it easy to obtain qualifying insurance when it is not available through an employer. The government cannot explain why those exchanges suffice to advance its goal of getting contraceptive coverage to the tens of millions of [other] people . . . yet are not good enough\u201d for the employees of the Little Sisters.\n\n\u201cAs Little Sisters of the Poor, we offer the neediest elderly of every race and religion a home where they are welcomed as Christ. We perform this loving ministry because of our faith and cannot possibly choose between our care for the elderly poor and our faith, and we shouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Sr. Loraine Marie Maguire, Mother Provincial of the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cAll we ask is that our rights not be taken away. The government exempts large corporations, small businesses, and other religious ministries from what they are imposing on us \u2013 we just want to keep serving the elderly poor as we have always done for 175 years. We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case, and pray for God\u2019s protection of our ministry.\u201d\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter.

The religious objectors are also represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, Locke Lord LLP, Professor Kevin Walsh of the University of Richmond, Ken Wynne, and Bradley Tupi.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous for the federal government to claim, in this day and age, that it can\u2019t figure out how to distribute contraceptives without involving nuns and their health plans.\u201d said Senior Counsel Mark Rienzi.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Christian-run Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t have to obey the HHS mandate that is a part of Obamacare that requires businesses to pay for abortion causing drugs in their employee health care plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Little Sisters of the Poor Ask Supreme Court: Don't Let Obama Force Us to Obey HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The Little Sisters of the Poor are asking the nation's highest court to ensure they do not have to comply with Obamacare\u2019s abortion mandate.
