The latest numbers tell two stories.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Aggressive prices are luring customers from competitors. For instance, Blue Shield \u2014 which had one of the lowest rate increases in the state \u2014 gained more than 17,000 renewing consumers from Anthem, which had the state's highest rate increase. However, about 88 percent of renewing customers kept their plan.\n\n\"Compared to much of the nation, where many consumers changed plans when they renewed, our success at keeping prices low allowed consumers to have a win-win \u2014 many got to keep their existing plan while getting a good deal,\" said Anne Price, the exchange's director of health plan management.\n\n\u2014 An early referendum on Oscar Health. The much-hyped insurance start-up expanded to California, but signed up just over 2,000 customers through the exchange and another 3,000 or so off-exchange. It's a very slow start for the New York-based company, which investors have valued at more than $1.75 billion \u2014 and which lost more than $40 million on its New York customers alone, according to company filings through the third quarter of 2015.\n\n\"Oscar has a good marketing pitch and attractive consumer-facing technology, but they don\u2019t yet bring much else to the table,\" Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt told PULSE.\n\nOn the other hand, Oscar can argue that it's rapidly growing. It now has about 145,000 members, up from 40,000 members last year. Is that enough to justify the valuation and the hype? My story for Pros.\n\nTracking health care's unicorns: Oscar's among a half-dozen startups that have emerged as so-called \"unicorns,\" all valued at $1 billion or more by investors. But as their values have shot up, their problems have mounted too. For example:\n\n\u2014 Zenefits: The founder stepped down earlier this month amid a growing compliance scandal.\n\n\u2014 ZocDoc: The CEO stepped down in November, and the company recently retooled its strategy.\n\n\u2014 Theranos: The lab-testing company's technology has faced widespread scrutiny, and CMS recently determined that its California lab was \"deficient.\"\n\nTHERANOS SUBMITS CORRECTION PLAN \u2014 Theranos submitted a remedial correction plan last Friday to FDA, company spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said on Wednesday, confirming a Bloomberg report. The embattled startup, which has faced questions from the government and skeptical scientists, has no sense of when CMS might rule on its plan, Pro's Darius Tahir reports.\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE TOWN HALLS \u2014 Wednesday's cable TV town halls allowed the candidates to expound on their health policies a bit:\n\nTrump repeated his attacks on the drug industry. Donald Trump, who again claimed that he would require Medicare drug negotiations that would \"save $300 billion,\" said other candidates wouldn't even bother proposing reforms. \"These candidates are all controlled by the drug companies,\" Trump said, pointing out that Jeb Bush's campaign finance chair is Woody Johnson \u2014 an heir to the Johnson & Johnson medical fortune.\n\nTrump also promised not to raise Medicare's eligibility age. \"I\u2019m not doing it,\" he told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. \"I don\u2019t want to do it.\"\n\nRubio vows to reform Medicare, as long as it doesn\u2019t affect his mom. Over on CNN, Marco Rubio called for reining in the costs of the nation's major entitlement programs, with one major catch. \"I am against any changes that are bad for my mother,\" Rubio said. \"Pretty good policy.\"\n\nCarson's not looking beyond his fading candidacy. Asked by a physician if he'd be interested in serving as HHS secretary or surgeon general, Ben Carson demurred. \"I'm not looking for a job\" beyond the White House, he said.\n\nOne questioner asked how Carson reconciled his Christianity with the GOP's criticism of welfare and ACA subsidies for the poor. \"We the people have the responsibility to take care of the indigent,\" Carson responded. \"It's not the government's job.\"\n\n\u2014 Carson did have two notable moments in arguing health care policy. He blasted the rise of \"rules and regulations\" that have made physicians less happy to practice medicine today. Carson also said there aren't enough resources for mentally ill patients. \"It would be a lot cheaper if we begin to take care of these people the way they should be taken care of,\" Carson said.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Expand seniors\u2019 access to prescription drugs. Right now Medicare drug plans force patients to make long trips for medication or to pay more to use their longtime pharmacy. Let Medicare beneficiaries choose the pharmacy that\u2019s best for them. Visit www.ncpanet.org/pharmacychoice. **\n\nBURWELL IN FLINT TODAY \u2014 The HHS secretary will tour the Hamilton Community Health Network, a federally qualified health center that's providing lead testing and other services, and she'll speak about the federal response to the city's toxic water's crisis.\n\n\u2014 And she's back on the Hill next week. She'll be testifying in front of the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday, Feb. 25 \u2014 her third stop in the series of hearings about the administration's budget request.\n\nTHIS IS THURSDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we're collectively buzzing over Gov. Paul LePage's claim that immigrants are bringing the \"ziki fly\" to Maine. (As a public health theory, this one kind of bites.) Send your news and tips to ddiamond@politico.com and @ddiamond.\n\nSTATE SUED OVER LIMITS ON HEP C DRUGS \u2014 A new class-action lawsuit accuses Washington state of illegally denying Medicaid patients access to hepatitis C treatments based on the cost of the drugs, Pro's Sarah Karlin reports. The state's health care agency is restricting the use of drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni to only the sickest patients \u2014 and the lawsuit alleges that the policy violates federal law requiring Medicaid drug programs to provide access to prescription drugs. Sarah's story for Pros.\n\nWhether or not the lawsuit prevails, it's worth noting that CMS has been worried about Medicaid programs imposing limits on the expensive hep C drugs: The agency sent letters to all 50 states just three months ago asking about restrictions.\n\nACADEMIC CENTERS FAILING TO POST CLINICAL TRIAL DATA? \u2014 That's the conclusion of a new study in the British Medical Journal, which found that only 29 percent of completed clinical trials led by investigators at major U.S. academic centers were published within two years of completion. Nearly 90 percent of results weren't posted to ClinicalTrials.gov, either. http://bit.ly/1QJZ0aw\n\n\u2014 Why it matters: \u201cThe lack of timely reporting and publication fundamentally impairs the research enterprise, violates the commitment made by investigators to patients and funders, squanders precious time and resources, and threatens to compromise evidence based clinical decision making,\u201d researcher Harlan Krumholz of the Yale School of Medicine and colleagues conclude.\n\nED USE STAYS FLAT \u2014 About 18 percent of adults age 18 to 64 visited the emergency department in 2014, in line with a decade-long trend, according to a new study out today from CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nMost patients, unsurprisingly, said they visited the ED because they were facing an urgent medical problem, although about one in five respondents said it was an access-related issue. (Either their doctor's office wasn't open, or they lacked access to other providers.)\n\n\u2014 One key takeaway: The study didn't find a significant change in emergency department use as the ACA coverage expansion took effect. However, researchers who have analyzed unrelated studies on ED use have suggested that it takes time for behaviors to change.\n\nDARTMOUTH: CARE FOR THE ELDERLY STILL FALLS SHORT \u2014 The latest Dartmouth Atlas report focused on health care for the aging population and flagged several potential improvements, including:\n\n\u2014 Reducing unnecessary screening for breast and prostate cancer after age 75.\n\n\u2014 More promptly referring patients to hospice.\n\n\u2014 Avoiding over-use of feeding tubes in patients with advanced dementia.\n\nHEALTH PLANS GEAR UP FOR ANNUAL FIGHT OVER MEDICARE ADVANTAGE \u2014 The Obama administration will get its last opportunity to make a dramatic impact on the Medicare Advantage system this week when it releases the preliminary rates for 2017, Pro's Paul Demko and Jennifer Haberkorn write.\n\nThe administration is expected to release its preliminary notice of MA rates on Friday, with final rates coming on April 4. That sets up nearly two months of intense lobbying over how much the government should pay for the plans administered by private insurance companies. The story for Pros.\n\nDO ANY PROMINENT LIBERAL ECONOMISTS SUPPORT BERNIE? \u2014 That's the question after four former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Christina Romer, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson \u2014 wrote an open letter on Wednesday that blistered Senator Bernie Sanders' economic proposals as unrealistic. \"Making such promises runs against our party\u2019s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic,\" the economists write. A slew of other liberal economists have raised questions about whether Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan and other economic policies are feasible.\n\nWALKER TO SLASH PLANNED PARENTHOOD MONEY \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker this morning will sign two bills defunding Planned Parenthood, Pro's Rachana Pradhan writes. The first would pull Title X family planning grants from the organization and the second would change how much clinics can get reimbursed under Medicaid for prescription drugs, including contraceptives. The bills would cut $7.5 million from Wisconsin Planned Parenthood clinics per year, according to local reports,\n\nDEMS ASK SCOTUS TO UPHOLD BIRTH CONTROL RULES \u2014 A group of 123 Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to uphold the health care law\u2019s birth control coverage requirement for religious-affiliated institutions. The court will hear oral arguments in the case, Zubik v. Burwell, in late March. The amicus brief: http://1.usa.gov/1QmIFIr\n\nAROUND TOWN \u2014 Nora Super, who served as the executive director of the White House Conference on Aging, has joined the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging as Chief, Program & Services.\n\nHEALTH REFORM ROILS 'DOWNTON ABBEY' \u2014 Art imitates life on this PBS television show, as a hospital merger has become a major plotline.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
