(Photo: Sean Gallup / Getty Images)\n\nIt is encouraging to note data from the United Network for Organ Sharing that show more than 30,000 organ transplants were performed in the United States last year, reaching the highest total in the country\u2019s history. Nevertheless, the supply of organs \u2014 donated by living and deceased donors \u2014 will fall short of the number of patients added last year to the transplant waiting lists.\n\nWith the persistent shortage, there are those who would seek to increase the organs available for transplantation by providing financial incentives as a motivation for organ donation. These financial incentives would represent a monetary gain or \u201cvaluable consideration,\u201d and are currently prohibited by the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) to buy and sell organs.\n\nThe financial incentives (valuable consideration) proposed include a contribution to the donor\u2019s retirement fund, an income tax credit or a tuition voucher or global health insurance. Even though cash would not be exchanged, these incentives have a monetary value and target individuals who otherwise would not have these resources/finances, for example, to secure their retirement or those not qualifying for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor those who are enticed by such incentives, they would simply be trading the commodity they have (a kidney) for a commodity they need (a mortgage payment or health insurance). One in 7 people in the U.S. live below the poverty line. The target group of donors/vendors becomes inescapable, it becomes the economically distressed to supply organs for transplantation.\n\nEvery other country in the world has wrestled with the dilemma of targeting the poor as the source of organs by such incentives, and only Iran permits such financial incentives.\n\nThe World Health Organization rejects a system that would foster a social stratification in obtaining transplant organs. WHO\u2019s transplantation guideline state clearly that \u201ccells, tissues and organs should only be donated freely, without any monetary payment or other reward of monetary value. Purchasing, or offering to purchase, cells, tissues or organs for transplantation, or their sale by living persons or by the next of kin for deceased persons, should be banned.\u201d\n\nHowever this WHO Principle emphasizes \u201cthe prohibition on sale or purchase of cells, tissues and organs does not preclude reimbursing reasonable and verifiable expenses incurred by the donor, including loss of income, or paying the costs of recovering, processing, preserving and supplying human cells, tissues or organs for transplantation.\u201d\n\nMaking reimbursement available for the actual costs or losses incurred, regardless of donors\u2019 financial resources, would not enrich donors but make donating a kidney a financially neutral act. Covering expenses results in neither a better \u2014 nor worse \u2014 financial situation for the donor.\n\nThus far, the government has not supported the provision of financial incentives as a motivation for organ donation \u2014 presumably because it does not want to be responsible for placing anyone at risk of kidney failure in their life time \u2014 as a result of being a donor.\n\nBut we can all agree that a program of financial neutrality is an ethically proper approach for those who wish to be a donor. Otherwise the stale arguments in the debate of financial incentives are going nowhere for the help of donors and the needs of the patients that would benefit from organ transplants.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1T9Mo29", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Others countries have wrestled with the dilemma of targeting the poor as the source of organs via financial incentives", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Others countries have wrestled with the dilemma of targeting the poor as the source of organs via financial incentives", "title": "Point: Ethical limits in any organ donation payment", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2016/02/08/organ-donation-ethics-money/80041222/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Others countries have wrestled with the dilemma of targeting the poor as the source of organs via financial incentives", "title": "Point: Ethical limits in any organ donation payment", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5dfeb3d2d80d6c4404eab35cc33c91caa4ba887f/c=500-0-2501-2001&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/08/DetroitNews/B99355694Z.1_20160208235551_000_GK7Q0BBT.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "organ donation, medical ethics, kidney donation,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ff9\"", "article_summary": "With the persistent shortage, there are those who would seek to increase the organs available for transplantation by providing financial incentives as a motivation for organ donation.\nWHO\u2019s transplantation guideline state clearly that \u201ccells, tissues and organs should only be donated freely, without any monetary payment or other reward of monetary value.\nSecuring more organs for transplantation would save lives, but there are ethical issues to navigate when discussion turns to compensation for donor expenses.\nOtherwise the stale arguments in the debate of financial incentives are going nowhere for the help of donors and the needs of the patients that would benefit from organ transplants.\nThese financial incentives would represent a monetary gain or \u201cvaluable consideration,\u201d and are currently prohibited by the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) to buy and sell organs."}
