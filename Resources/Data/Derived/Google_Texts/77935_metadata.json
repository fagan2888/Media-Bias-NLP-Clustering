Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal\n\n'THERE'S NOTHING WORSE than coming home to a room that looks like a catalog,\" said Jeremiah Brent. \"The spaces we live in should tell our story.\"\n\nMr. Brent, 28, follows an ethos of lived-in luxury for the work he does at his two-year-old interior design firm. His clients include stylist Rachel Zoe and hair stylist Rita Hazan; he also codesigned the Hollywood Hills home he shares with his fianc\u00e9, designer and television personality Nate Berkus.\n\nNow Mr. Brent is expanding his decorative repertoire with a collection of candles made with D.L. & Co., available Nov. 13 through e-tailer Gilt.\n\n\"I'm inspired by deep, earthy smells, especially of the outdoors,\" said Mr. Brent, who cited quenched fires and freshly watered herbs as references. The collection of soy-wax candles includes three scents: Figo, a mix of grapefruit and fig; Fogo, a spicy blend of tobacco flower and amber; and Rosa, which combines orange blossom and rose. Mr. Brent said it was important for him to get the gold-mirrored glass vessel just right: \"It's also a fantastic vase or tumbler when the wax is gone.\"\n\n\u2014Nicole Berrie", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2013-11-08T21:28:00.000Z", "article.section": "Life and Style", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Jeremiah Brent's new collection of glamorous candles.", "title": "Candles for Gold Diggers", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ604_FRESHP_G_20131107125848.jpg", "alt": "New holiday-ready gold candles from interior designer Jeremiah Brent", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ604_FRESHP_D_20131107125848.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303936904579179904263049802&headline=New%20holiday-ready%20gold%20candles%20from%20interior%20designer%20Jeremiah%20Brent&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303936904579179904263049802"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "Jeremiah Brent,fashion,technical services,design services,interior design services,business,consumer services", "news_keywords": "Jeremiah Brent,fashion,technical services,design services,interior design services,business,consumer services", "article.headline": "New holiday-ready gold candles from interior designer Jeremiah Brent", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ604_FRESHP_E_20131107125848.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ604_FRESHP_D_20131107125848.jpg"}}, "description": "Jeremiah Brent's new collection of glamorous candles.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303936904579179904263049802&headline=New%20holiday-ready%20gold%20candles%20from%20interior%20designer%20Jeremiah%20Brent&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303936904579179904263049802", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Life and Style", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "Jeremiah Brent's new collection of glamorous candles.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-08T21:28:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-6bf7", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"embed_count": 1, "image_count": 1, "word_count": 186, "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Jeremiah Brent's new collection of glamorous candles.", "title": "Candles for Gold Diggers", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303936904579179904263049802", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-AZ604_FRESHP_G_20131107125848.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Candles for Gold Diggers", "article.type": "Fresh Picks", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303936904579179904263049802", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-08T21:28:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0239\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Brent, 28, follows an ethos of lived-in luxury for the work he does at his two-year-old interior design firm.\nNow Mr. Brent is expanding his decorative repertoire with a collection of candles made with D.L.\n\"I'm inspired by deep, earthy smells, especially of the outdoors,\" said Mr. Brent, who cited quenched fires and freshly watered herbs as references.\nENLARGE Jeremiah Brent Design Candle, $28, gilt.com F.
