More importantly, my bone density test showed that I was slowly but surely losing strength in my lower body as well. Not good!\n\nMotivated by wanting to look terrific in my new jeans and the desire to keep osteoporosis far, far away, I embarked on a life-changing fitness program. It incorporates the \u2018three pillars\u2019 of overall fitness: cardio, strength-training and balance. The best part: I can do the program anywhere, anytime and it\u2019s free.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing these basic exercises \u2013 running with walk breaks, push-ups, balancing on one leg, and so on \u2013 for over five years and not only did I lose the post-menopausal 15 pounds, all my health check numbers (including my bone density test) improved or stabilized. I even convinced my husband to follow in my footsteps. Most days I catch him doing 20 push-ups, eating healthier foods, and checking his pedometer to make sure he\u2019s walked at least 10,000 steps, which is highly recommended for anyone at any age. I even have him eating Greek yogurt (I never thought I\u2019d see the day!)\n\nAnd, thanks to strengthening my lower body with the squat, I was able to actually try surfing this summer with my two teenaged daughters and stay on the board (kinda, sorta)! Here\u2019s a photo:\n\nI was able to try paddle-boarding, too, because of my stronger legs. Just call me \u201cGidget Grufferman.\u201d\n\nThe essential ingredient to starting any fitness program, though, is making sure you do it right. Countless exercise newbies end up hurting themselves, simply because they didn\u2019t take the time to 1.) get the \u2018green light\u2019 from the doctor; and 2.) learn the correct form when doing the exercises.\n\nWell, I\u2019m not going to let you make that same mistake! Before you start adding this key lower body strength-building exercise into your program, please take a few minutes to watch this video. The last thing you want to do is hurt your knees or lose your balance while doing the Squat, so please take a look before you start. Oh, and one extremely important tip: make sure you thrust your hips back as far as you can, as you\u2019re lowering your body. This will keep the pressure off your knees.\n\nI want to hear from you!
