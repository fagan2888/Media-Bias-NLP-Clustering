John Hickenlooper made good Friday on his promise to sue the federal government over its hotly contested move to list the Gunnison sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe Colorado Attorney General\u2019s office filed a notice of intent to sue with Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Fish and Wildlife Service director Daniel M. Ashe, arguing that the agency\u2019s Nov. 12 decision to list the bird as threatened was flawed and failed to appreciate fully the impact of aggressive state and local conservation efforts.\n\n\u201cThe Service failed to use the best available science in its listing decision,\u201d said the six-page notice by Assistant Attorney General Lisa Reynolds. \u201cThe best available scientific data indicates that the species is not warranted for protection under the ESA because the Gunnison basin population, which comprises the vast majority of the species\u2019 individuals and occupied range, is not in danger of extinction now or in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nThe decision to list the Gunnison sage grouse, found only in southwestern Colorado and eastern Utah, was closely watched by state officials and wildlife advocates who believe it may foreshadow the agency\u2019s action on the greater sage grouse, which has a far larger habitat extending across 11 Western states.\n\nA greater sage grouse listing could chill economic development throughout the rural West, including ranching, grazing and energy development.\n\nEnvironmental and wildlife groups had blasted the agency\u2019s decision on the Gunnison sage grouse, insisting it didn\u2019t go far enough. Two groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Western Watersheds Project, filed Nov. 20 a notice of intent to sue to compel the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the bird as endangered instead of threatened.\n\n\u201cBefore this stunning reversal, the Fish and Wildlife Service had recognized the Gunnison sage grouse as an endangered species for 14 years,\u201d said Amy Atwood, endangered species legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. \u201cThe reversal is not based on more grouse in more places but rather on vague promises by those with a direct stake in destroying the grouse\u2019s habitat. This is just too much of a fox guarding the henhouse situation.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 4,705 Gunnison sage grouse remain in Colorado and Utah, about 3,975 of which live in Colorado\u2019s Gunnison basin. The bird was declared a distinct species from the greater sage grouse in 2000.\n\nColorado and Utah officials point to massive undertakings at the state and local level to preserve sage grouse habitat. In Colorado, an estimated $40 million has been spent to protect the bird, including \u201cvoluntary conservation programs, land acquisition, research, monitoring activities, habitat treatments, translocations, and predator control,\u201d the motion said.\n\n\u201cThe Service accorded little weight to indications that the Gunnison basin population is stable and thriving, including the fact that the population now exceeds the targets set in the Rangewide Conservation Plan and the Gunnison basin lek counts are at an all-time high,\u201d the motion said.\n\nMr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, had vowed earlier this year to challenge the federal government in court if the Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Gunnison sage grouse as threatened or endangered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado Gov.
