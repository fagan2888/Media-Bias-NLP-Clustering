Multiemployer pensions are not only backed by federal insurance, but they also were thought to be even more secure than single-company pensions because when one company in a multiemployer pool failed, the others were required to pick up its \u201corphaned\u201d retirees.\n\nToday, however, the aging of the workforce, the decline of unions, deregulation and two big stock crashes have taken a grievous toll on multiemployer pensions, which cover 10 million Americans. Dozens of multiemployer plans have already failed, and some giant ones are teetering \u2014 including, notably, the Teamsters\u2019 Central States pension plan, with more than 400,000 members.\n\nKicking the can \u2018off a cliff\u2019\n\nIn February, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the federal multiemployer insurer would run out of money in seven years, which would leave retirees in failed plans with nothing. \u201cUnless Congress acts \u2014 and acts very soon \u2014 many plans will fail, more than 1 million people will lose their pensions, and thousands of small businesses will be handed bills they can\u2019t pay,\u201d said Joshua Gotbaum, executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., or PBGC, the federal insurer that pays benefits to people whose company pension plans fail.\n\n\u201cIf Congress allows the PBGC to get the money and the authority it needs to do its job, then these plans can be preserved,\u201d he added. \u201cIf not, the PBGC will run out of money, too, and multiemployer pensioners will get virtually nothing. This is not something that can wait a few years. If people kick the can down the road, they\u2019ll find it went off a cliff.\u201d\n\nSo far, efforts to keep multiemployer plans from toppling, and taking the federal insurance program down with them, are giving rise to something that was supposed to have been outlawed 40 years ago: cuts in benefits that workers have already earned.\n\nFor example, after Carol Cascio\u2019s husband died of a heart attack at 52, the pension office of his union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, told her his 33 years as a supermarket meat manager had earned her a widow\u2019s pension of $402.31 a month for life. It would start in three years, on what would have been his 55th birthday.\n\nShe waited, but just before her first payment should have come, she received a letter instead saying that the pension plan had been \u201cterminated by mass withdrawal\u201d and that she would receive nothing.\n\n\u2018The law hasn\u2019t caught up\u2019\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m in a real pickle,\u201d said Cascio, 62, a stay-at-home mother in Brooklyn who had already borrowed against the promised pension to pay for her daughter\u2019s education. \u201cI have no one. I have a mortgage on my house. I have my daughter. How do you do this to someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a few years ago, it would have been inconceivable that anyone would have their benefits reduced,\u201d said Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center, a watchdog group in Washington. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t caught up with what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\nThe law she was referring to is the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, the landmark federal employee-benefits law enacted in 1974. It contains a well-established provision known as the anti-cutback rule, which holds that companies can freeze their pension plans at will, stopping their workers from building up any additional benefits, but they cannot renege on benefits their workers have earned through work already performed.\n\nIn the multiemployer world, the anti-cutback rule was amended in 2006, permitting the weakest plans to stop paying certain benefits to people who had not yet retired, including disability stipends, lump-sum distributions, recent pension increases, death benefits and early retirement benefits. The goal was to help those plans conserve money while they try to rehabilitate themselves. Experts say the measures have helped, but some multiemployer plans may still fail if they cannot cut payments to retirees as well.\n\nCascio\u2019s pension turned out to be in a category subject to cutting: pensions for widows whose husbands died before retirement. They must be cut if their plans have fallen to \u201ccritical status,\u201d defined as having less than 65 cents for every dollar of benefits they owe. That is supposed to save money so the plan can keep on paying other retirees their \u201cnonforfeitable benefits\u201d while it negotiates bigger contributions from participating companies, or tries to attract new companies into the pool.\n\nThat could not happen in Cascio\u2019s case. A few months before her husband died, all the supermarkets in his plan decided to disband the pool. He told her not to worry. Each company was making a final contribution to what is known as a \u201cwasting trust,\u201d which would have enough money to pay everyone\u2019s pensions for the rest of their lives. Then the stock market crashed in 2008. Much of the money in the pool melted away, and there was no one left to turn to for more.\n\n\u201cI manage on a widow\u2019s Social Security,\u201d said Cascio, who receives a little less than $900 a month after her Medicare premiums are deducted. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard.\u201d\n\nAll it takes is one big failure\n\nCongress made the multiemployer insurance much less comprehensive than the single-employer version because multiemployer plans were supposedly so safe that they did not need much insurance.\n\nThe PBGC is supposed to be self-supporting, financing its operations with premiums paid by companies rather than tax dollars. Its single-employer program has the power to take over company pension funds before they run out of money so the assets can be used to help defray the costs. But the multiemployer program must wait until a failing plan\u2019s investments are exhausted, so it gets nothing but bills. It now has premiums of about $110 million a year to work with. All it would take is the failure of one big plan to wipe out the whole program.\n\nThe Central States plan, for example, pays $2.8 billion a year to retirees but takes in only about $700 million from employers. It must rely on investment returns to keep from exhausting its assets, but Thomas Nyhan, director of the pension plan, said it would take returns of at least 12 percent a year, every year, to come out even, and that is not realistic. Its modeling suggests that it will run out of money in 10 to 15 years \u2014 most likely around 2026, if nothing is done.\n\nLabor officials, business groups, members of Congress and others have been quietly discussing a proposal to extend multiemployer plans\u2019 life spans by letting them roll back even retirees\u2019 pensions. Such plans are often found in mature sectors, in which retirees outnumber active workers and cuts affecting only the existing workers do not produce enough of a saving as a result. And once a multiemployer plan gets to that stage, officials have discovered, new companies will not join the pool, because they do not want to be stuck paying for extinct companies\u2019 orphaned retirees.\n\n\u201cArithmetic is going to trump everything here,\u201d said Nyhan of the Central States plan, which has about five retirees for every current driver.\n\nMary Williams Walsh,\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "An aging workforce, unions\u2019 decline, deregulation and two big stock crashes have taken a grievous toll on the multiemployer plans that cover 10 million Americans.", "og": {"description": "An aging workforce, unions\u2019 decline, deregulation and two big stock crashes have taken a grievous toll on the multiemployer plans that cover 10 million Americans.", "title": "Once thought to be secure, pooled pensions teeter and fall", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140412-once-thought-to-be-secure-pooled-pensions-teeter-and-fall.ece", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140412-troubled_pensions.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TROUBLED_PENSIONS.jpg", "height": 405}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-04-13T04:38:07Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-04-13T04:25:39Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Once thought to be secure, pooled pensions teeter and fall\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140412-once-thought-to-be-secure-pooled-pensions-teeter-and-fall.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140412-troubled_pensions.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TROUBLED_PENSIONS.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1594182\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-13T04:25:39Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140412-troubled_pensions.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/TROUBLED_PENSIONS.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-13T04:25:39Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The pensions belong to people in multiemployer plans \u2014 big pooled investment funds with many sponsoring companies and a union.\nToday, however, the aging of the workforce, the decline of unions, deregulation and two big stock crashes have taken a grievous toll on multiemployer pensions, which cover 10 million Americans.\nLabor officials, business groups, members of Congress and others have been quietly discussing a proposal to extend multiemployer plans\u2019 life spans by letting them roll back even retirees\u2019 pensions.\nDozens of multiemployer plans have already failed, and some giant ones are teetering \u2014 including, notably, the Teamsters\u2019 Central States pension plan, with more than 400,000 members.\nMultiemployer pensions are not only backed by federal insurance, but they also were thought to be even more secure than single-company pensions because when one company in a multiemployer pool failed, the others were required to pick up its \u201corphaned\u201d retirees."}
