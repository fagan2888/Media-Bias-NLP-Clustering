(AP) - Most people wouldn\u2019t tie the quiet community of Stockbridge to bloody World War II fighting in South Pacific.\n\nBut a link is there. Since 2011, members of the Stockbridge High School underwater robotics team have been making yearly trips to the island-nation of Palau in an effort to find relics of the war, and, in part, to bring closure to MIAs\u2019 families, according to the Lansing State Journal ( http://on.lsj.com/1HXtIMq ). Even after all these years.\n\nThe word has been out on the Stockbridge students for some time. The team has been featured in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment.\n\nThis year\u2019s trip was March 30 to April 12. While there, the students aided in the finding of a missing aircraft.\n\n\u201cThere was an MIA case associated with it but we can\u2019t say any more than that until the families are notified,\u201d teacher Robert Richards said.\n\nThe heaviest fighting took place on the island of Peleliu, at the southern tip of the Palau chain, from Sept. 15 to Nov. 27, 1944. Some 1,500 American soldiers and Marines were killed taking the island, according to various sources, as well as about 10,000 Japanese troops.\n\n\u201cAbout 200 American aircraft were lost,\u201d Richards said. \u201cWe believe there are still around 70 MIAs from the battles around Peleliu.\u201d\n\nThe Stockbridge team and its camera-carrying robot - or remotely operated vehicle - work with the Scripps Institute of Technology and the University of Delaware, as well as with the BentProp Project, a team of volunteers dedicated to finding and identifying American POWs and MIAs from World War II.\n\nPalau is located due east of the Philippines. Ten students went this year, most of them for the first time. It was Maddy Armstrong\u2019s second visit, and Chloe Hypes and Jeremy Spink have made three trips.\n\nHypes, who plans to attend the University of Michigan and go into pre-med studies or bio-medical engineering, said \u201cwe had the best year we\u2019ve had yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really great experience, especially this year, seeing how far we\u2019re come as a team,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress with our engineering skills and our teamwork skills.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s also a great class to be in,\u201d Hypes said. \u201cWe have a lot more opportunities in this class to learn and explore our own interests than we would in any other class.\u201d\n\nSenior Mitchell Lilley, who plans to enroll in Alpena Community College\u2019s remotely operated vehicle technician program, said Stockbridge\u2019s robot has an aluminum frame, and syntactic foam is used for buoyancy. It works better than the Styrofoam used last year but it\u2019s a lot more expensive.\n\nLilley said he poked around the Internet and found a company that provides it. After a company official checked on the Stockbridge program and was impressed, the company sent $1,000 worth of the stuff for free.\n\nRichards said the remotely operated vehicle, its camera and its $1,000 worth of electronics can handle a depth of about 200 feet, although the deepest it\u2019s gone in Palau is 189 feet.\n\nHypes said the Scripps Institute has an underwater vehicle that scans the ocean floor with sonar, and if anything looks interesting \u201cit becomes our target.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it ends up being some interesting-looking coral,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found ship parts before, sometimes it\u2019s a field of barrels and then - very rarely - it\u2019s a plane.\u201d\n\nEven though many of the students are scuba certified, they stay put when that happens, Hypes said.\n\nInstead, BentProp and University of Delaware divers do the investigating after reviewing video from the students\u2019 remotely operated vehicle. And, if remains are found, only specially skilled divers go down.\n\n\u201cThe BentProp project has been pretty successful in identifying aircraft that have MIA cases associated with them,\u201d Richards said. \u201cThey found a B-24 several years ago that had a crew of nine.\u201d\n\nNot all of the searching is underwater. This year, the team brought along two drones.\n\n\u201cThose allow us to fly over new terrain, such as the mangrove swamps that we can\u2019t get into because of saltwater crocodiles,\u201d said Spink, who plans to study unmanned aircraft systems at Kansas State University.\n\nRichards said BentProp still is searching for three Navy frogmen who were captured by the Japanese, executed and buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nThe groups\u2019 effort does not involve the search for Japanese remains and relics, although when wreckage is found, the location is submitted to the Japanese Embassy in Palau.\n\nWhen the Stockbridge students aren\u2019t scanning the ocean floor they\u2019re working with college and elementary school students in Palau.\n\nAll of this costs money - some $50,000 is needed for each trip. And then there are the other robotics teams at Stockbridge High School. They need money, too.\n\nThe students generate the cash themselves through personal and local business contributions, corporate sponsorships and gofundme.com page donations, Richards said.\n\n\u201cIn the past we\u2019ve done multiple movie nights, a silent auction, we put on a presentation night for our community,\u201d Hypes said. \u201cThis year we had a movie night at the Michigan Theatre in Jackson.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this year, more than past years, we\u2019ve reached out to corporate sponsorships,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just continues to evolve as our program becomes more well-known.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lansing State Journal, http://www.lansingstatejournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most people wouldn't tie the quiet community of Stockbridge to bloody World War II fighting in South Pacific.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Most people wouldn\u2019t tie the quiet community of Stockbridge to bloody World War II fighting in South Pacific.", "title": "Stockbridge robotics team seeks WWII relics in Palau", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/6/stockbridge-robotics-team-seeks-wwii-relics-in-pal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/06/01a97efd4787aa14750f6a7067001f26.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/06/01a97efd4787aa14750f6a7067001f26.jpg", "description": "Most people wouldn't tie the quiet community of Stockbridge to bloody World War II fighting in South Pacific.", "card": "summary", "title": "Stockbridge robotics team seeks WWII relics in Palau"}, "Author": "CURT SMITH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "When the Stockbridge students aren\u2019t scanning the ocean floor they\u2019re working with college and elementary school students in Palau.\nInstead, BentProp and University of Delaware divers do the investigating after reviewing video from the students\u2019 remotely operated vehicle.\nThe word has been out on the Stockbridge students for some time.\nSTOCKBRIDGE, Mich.
