They plan to hold a second one next weekend at its Kendall campus. Trained counselors will be onsite to answer questions and help students enroll.\n\nEnticing young, healthy Americans to sign up for coverage is crucial to the success of so-called \u201cObamacare\u201d as insurers are betting on them to balance out the cost of caring for older, sicker adults.\n\nThe college has one of the highest numbers of Hispanic students in the country. Federal health officials say two-thirds of uninsured residents in the Miami-area are Hispanic and can take advantage of the exchange.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
