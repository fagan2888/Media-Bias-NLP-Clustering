Malloy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has led efforts to increase the minimum wage and tighten gun laws after the massacre of 20 elementary school students in Newtown, Conn.\n\nThe White House announced Obama\u2019s full guest list on Sunday, two days before he is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress with a speech that officials said would focus more on the issues and challenges that are shaping the future of the country than specific policy proposals.\n\nThe guests are intended to illustrate \u201cwho we are as Americans: inclusive and compassionate, innovative and courageous,\u201d according to the White House announcement. The invitees \u2014 some high profile, most conspicuously not \u2014 will sit in the House gallery with Michelle Obama.\n\nHamo, a scientist who fled his homeland amid civil war, settled with four of his children in Troy, Mich., on Dec. 18. After the Humans of New York, a photo blog, featured his story, readers donated more than $450,000 to support the family, and Obama publicly welcomed him to the country.\n\nVazquez, who was brought to the United States illegally as a child and went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering in 2009, decided to return to his home country of Mexico and re-enter the country legally. When he returned to the United States, Vazquez joined the Army and served one tour of duty in Afghanistan, eventually earning US citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObergefell, a real estate agent from Cincinnati, sued the state of Ohio, which had outlawed same-sex marriage, and ended up as the lead plaintiff on the Supreme Court case that last June guaranteed gay couples across the country the right to marry.\n\nThe president\u2019s other guests include the chief executive of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, whose company has pledged millions in education funding and increased paid leave for its employees, and Sue Ellen Allen, a former Arizona inmate who founded an organization that supports incarcerated and released women there.\n\nTwo of the guests have ties to Obama from his first presidential campaign.\n\nOne of them, Edith Childs, was a county councilwoman in Greenwood, S.C., when she met Obama in 2007 on the campaign trail and delivered what became an unofficial slogan in his two presidential campaigns: \u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d The other, Earl Smith, gave him a military patch he wore in Vietnam and that Obama carried with him for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThree of the guests, including Malloy, have links to the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s hallmark health care legislation, which remains a divisive issue almost six years after its passage. Others have links to other priorities of Obama\u2019s, like gun control, criminal justice reform, and climate change.\n\nStaff Sergeant Spencer Stone of the Air Force, who helped take down a gunman on a train in France last August, will also join Michelle Obama in the box, where the White House elected to leave one seat empty to represent victims of gun violence in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1975277697", "eomportal-id": 448489, "description": "A Syrian refugee and a former illegal immigrant who went on to serve in the US Army will be among the official guests at President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "A Syrian refugee and a former illegal immigrant who went on to serve in the US Army will be among the official guests at President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address.", "title": "Syrian refugee, Mexican immigrant to be among guests for State of Union - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/01/10/syrian-refugee-mexican-immigrant-among-guests-for-state-union/9614mOnKlRePriqAhTf9vO/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/01/11/BostonGlobe.com/National/Images/78e9f0e92591403cb88802520dfce68d-78e9f0e92591403cb88802520dfce68d-0.jpg", "longitude": "-77.03687070000001", "state": "DC", "latitude": "38.9071923", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "US,State of Union,Guests,Government and politics,Political refugees,United States Presidential Election,State governments,European Mass Migration Crisis,Veterans,State of the Union Address", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 10:15:09 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "US,State of Union,Guests,Government and politics,Political refugees,United States Presidential Election,State governments,European Mass Migration Crisis,Veterans,State of the Union Address,Military affairs,Campaigns,Recessions and depressions,General news,Human welfare,Social issues,Social affairs,National elections,Elections,Events,Military and defense,Human rights and civil liberties,Industrial products and services,Industries,Business,Economy,Executive branch", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "29bd5f56-b837-11e5-a434-35f8efec2d30"}, "article_summary": "The guests are intended to illustrate \u201cwho we are as Americans: inclusive and compassionate, innovative and courageous,\u201d according to the White House announcement.\nWhen he returned to the United States, Vazquez joined the Army and served one tour of duty in Afghanistan, eventually earning US citizenship.\nOthers have links to other priorities of Obama\u2019s, like gun control, criminal justice reform, and climate change.\nTwo of the guests have ties to Obama from his first presidential campaign.\nThe invitees \u2014 some high profile, most conspicuously not \u2014 will sit in the House gallery with Michelle Obama."}
