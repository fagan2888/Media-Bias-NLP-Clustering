And officials are worried that some of them could get hit with an unexpected tax bill next year.\n\nThe reason: The subsidies that help low- and moderate-income people buy health insurance are actually tax credits, paid in advance to insurance companies, based on each person\u2019s income. If their income increases, the tax credit they\u2019re entitled to gets smaller. But the federal government won\u2019t lower its payments to insurers until people report the change in income.\n\nThat means people who didn't report changes in income could be getting bigger discounts than they qualify for -- and they'll be required to pay some or all of the money back when they file their taxes next year.\n\nAccess Health CT, Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange, asks that people whose income changes notify the agency promptly so their subsidies can be adjusted.\n\nBut exchange officials and others worry that not all customers have done that.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a part-time worker and you suddenly pick up an extra five or six hours a week, that can really impact your income,\u201d said Deb Polun, director of government affairs and media relations at the Connecticut Association of Community Health Centers and a member of the exchange\u2019s consumer experience and outreach advisory committee. \u201cAnd later on in April, you could get dinged for something that was completely unintentional on your part.\u201d\n\nPolun thinks many people who went through the sign-up process found getting new coverage overwhelming enough. \u201cThe idea that they might have to call back and make a change at all is probably not one of the things that\u2019s being prioritized,\u201d she said.\n\nAccess Health has been receiving information on changes in income and other information from customers, spokeswoman Kathleen Tallarita said.\n\nStill, the prospect that some haven\u2019t kept their income information current and will end up getting big tax bills makes Access Health\u2019s acting CEO, Jim Wadleigh, nervous. He said it\u2019s a worry for his colleagues in other states too.\n\n\u201cThe average person has $300 in their savings account, and if someone all of a sudden has a tax bill that\u2019s in the thousands of dollars, even myself, I would freak out,\u201d Wadleigh said.\n\n\u201cThat is bad. It\u2019s bad for our business. It\u2019s bad for the Affordable Care Act for something like that to occur,\u201d he added.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe subsidies people receive to discount their premiums are based on estimates of their income, made at the time they applied for coverage. The actual amount they\u2019re entitled to is based on what they earn in 2014. Any discrepancies will be reconciled when they file their taxes.\n\nPeople whose actual income is higher than anticipated when the subsidies were calculated will have to pay back some or all of the difference. For people whose income falls below 400 percent of the poverty level -- the threshold for qualifying for the tax credit -- the repayment amounts are capped, based on income. At most, a family earning just below the subsidy limit could have to repay $2,500.\n\nBut people who end up earning too much to qualify for any premium discount will have to repay the full amount of the subsidy the federal government paid on their behalf, which could be thousands of dollars.\n\nPeople whose actual income entitles them to a larger tax credit than they received could get money back when they file their taxes.\n\n\n\nPotential confusion\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\nWadleigh said exchange officials have been thinking about ways to prevent people from ending up with unexpected tax bills once their subsidies and income are reconciled.\n\nRenewal packets sent last week to people who bought private insurance through the exchange included a section on the importance of keeping the information Access Health has on them current, noting that inaccurate information could lead people to have to pay back money they received as tax credits.\n\n\u201cWe are reminding people, pleading with them, to come back in and make sure that their account is up to date so that at least we\u2019ve saved them out of the fourth quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nAccess Health\u2019s television and print advertising campaigns will also mention the need to keep information up to date, Wadleigh said.\n\nExchange customers will get letters in January explaining what tax credits were paid on their behalf.\n\nChief Operating Officer Peter Van Loon said during a meeting last month that officials were anticipating confusion from people who get the letters. Some might get upset to be told they received a tax credit because they never saw the money, since the federal government paid it directly to their insurer. Some people don\u2019t realize the discounted insurance is the result of a tax credit, not a grant, he said, or don\u2019t remember that they received a subsidy.\n\nState Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri said she doubts most people have thought about the tax consequences of receiving subsidies.\n\n\u201cI think there has to be much more messaging about that and what is coming and what people can do about it,\u201d said Veltri, the vice chairwoman of the Access Health board. \u201cI think that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s going to hit.\n\nVeltri said it would also make sense to educate people about the tax credits when they first sign up for coverage, letting them know that they are receiving a tax credit from the federal government, paid in advance. (Access Health\u2019s current online enrollment system describes the discount as a \u201cpremium tax credit,\u201d but doesn\u2019t include a more basic description of how it works.)\n\n\u201cIt just feels to me like, without giving tax advice, because we can\u2019t do that, you have to somehow be able to artfully tell people what it is and give them more information about it before they enroll, and probably midyear,\u201d Veltri said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/09/obamacare-worry-unexpected-tax-bills-for-those-with-discounted-insurance/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Jim Wadleigh, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/09/obamacare-worry-unexpected-tax-bills-for-those-with-discounted-insurance/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Nearly 60,000 Connecticut residents get discounted health insurance as part of Obamacare.
