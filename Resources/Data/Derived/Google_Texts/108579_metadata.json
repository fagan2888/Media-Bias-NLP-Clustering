He was a little figure \u2014 five-foot-seven, 145 pounds, with hard blue eyes, receding brown hair, and a bulldog jaw. The New York Times columnist Arthur Brisbane introduced the two. Bennett was from Ann Arbor, Michigan, not far from where Henry lived. The twenty-four-year-old was just out of the navy, where he had served as a deep-sea diver and had boxed under the name \u201cSailor Reese.\u201d\n\nHenry took a liking to Bennett. The little man had sly eyes that were calculating and fearless and a picaresque past that made him sound like a character out of a gritty detective novel. Every scar on his face had a story. Harry Bennett had learned to brawl as a kid from his father. In fact, his father had been killed in a barroom fight.\n\n\u201cI could use a man like you at the Rouge,\u201d Henry said. \u201cCan you shoot?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure I can,\u201d said Bennett.\n\nThe men at the Rouge were \u201ca pretty tough lot,\u201d Henry said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any policemen out there.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Henry hurled Bennett into the iron jungle. \u201cThere may be a lot of people over there who want to fire you,\u201d he told Bennett, \u201cbut don\u2019t pay any attention to them. I\u2019m the only one who can fire you. Remember, you\u2019re working for me.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1892, Bennett was a year older than Henry\u2019s son Edsel. In his basement office in the Rouge, he kept a small desk, a fireplace, and a couch. He hung a picture of his daughter on the wall. Other than that, the office was spare. It had two doors, one in front of him controlled by a button under his desk, and another secret door behind him so that Henry could come and go without being noticed. Bennett hung a target in his office for .32 caliber target pistols. He and his boss Henry sat for hours firing away. According to Bennett, \u201cMr. Ford was a dead shot.\u201d\n\nEach morning Bennett dressed in a suit, his trademark bow tie (a hanging tie could be grabbed and used in a fight), a fedora, and a holster in which he packed a handgun at all times. He picked up Henry at his Fair Lane estate and took him to work. Whatever Henry needed done, Bennett was there for the doing. The fact that he couldn\u2019t change the oil of an automobile stirred confusion among the ranks. When asked what his job was, Bennett answered, \u201cI am Mr. Ford\u2019s personal man.\u201d And then: \u201cIf Mr. Ford told me to blacken out the sun tomorrow, I might have trouble fixing it. But you\u2019d see a hundred thousand sons-of-bitches coming through the Rouge gates in the morning, all wearing dark glasses.\u201d\n\nHenry paid Bennett \u201cpeanuts for a salary,\u201d according to the ex-navy man. But he had access to a safe full of cash for special expenses. He moved into a winged Gothic home owned by Henry on the Huron River in nearby Ypsilanti, where he threw wild parties and showed pornographic films with titles like \u201cThe Casting Director\u201d and \u201cA Stiff Game.\u201d He called his home \u201cThe Castle.\u201d\n\nIn the 1920s, Bennett began to amass a private security force called the Service Department\u2014a group of ex-boxers and ballplayers, cons, bad cops kicked off the force, and characters from Detroit\u2019s La Cosa Nostra, which during Prohibition ran a thriving booze trade, smuggling liquor over the Detroit River from Canada. Service Department men were noticeable for their size, rough language, and cauliflower ears, and for the fact that they hung around without do- ing any work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a lot of tough bastards,\u201d Bennett described his burgeoning Gestapo, \u201cbut every one of them is a goddamn gentleman.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Bennett had become Henry Ford\u2019s closest confidant. When asked by reporters one day who the greatest man in the world was, Henry smiled and pointed at the bow-tied brute. With Henry\u2019s power behind him, Bennett\u2019s star skyrocketed. Suddenly, if a reporter wanted to talk to someone at Ford Motor Company, he had to talk to Harry Bennett first. Nothing got done without Bennett\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get a message to anybody without him seeing,\u201d Ford engineer Laurence Sheldrick said of Bennett. \u201cOne could not hire, fire, or transfer a man. I could not send a man on a trip. I could not make a long-distance telephone call. I could not send a telegram if he did not wish me to do so. Regardless of where you were, he knew it. He had a spy system that was that thorough.\u201d\n\nEdsel regarded Bennett as a curiosity at first. He saw plenty of Harry and his \u201cService Men,\u201d as his father put Bennett in charge of all security detail. For Edsel, kidnapping threats were routine, for himself and his four kids. \u201cI can replace factories, but not grandchildren,\u201d Henry said. Edsel had his own bodyguards. Curiously, however, he began to notice that he was being followed. When he played golf, he saw men in the woods in suits and fedoras, watching him. When his eldest son Henry II drove his Lincoln Zephyr (he was at Yale now), he saw cars trailing him in his rearview.\n\nThe more Edsel learned about Harry Bennett, the more he realized the kind of things of which the Little Man in Henry\u2019s Basement was capable. Once, when a hoodlum threatened Henry II, Bennett said he would handle it. \u201cLater on,\u201d remembered Edsel\u2019s youngest, William, \u201cthe guy was found floating face down in the river.\u201d\n\nAn astute political creature, Edsel began to see Bennett as a rival for his father\u2019s affections. Edsel was an only child, but suddenly there were two sons in the Ford empire.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1929 fomented chaos in Detroit. No city was hit as hard with such immediacy in the first years of the Great Depression. From Black Tuesday on, America stopped buying cars. For three years, economists in Washington struggled for control over the monetary system. But in the end, Detroit\u2019s banks failed first, sending the ailing economy off a cliff in 1933.\n\nIn February, spurred by the insolvency of Detroit\u2019s banks, Michigan governor William Comstock declared a bank holiday, closing the doors to customers desperate to pull out their cash. Indiana\u2019s banks followed on February 23, Maryland\u2019s on the 25th, Arkansas\u2019s on the 27th, and Ohio\u2019s on the 28th. Banks in Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Oregon all locked their doors within the next week.\n\nBy this time, the auto industry had laid off more than half its workers. Detroit parking lots turned into shantytowns. Any business open all night became a homeless shelter. The jobless rate hit 40 percent by the time the banks closed; 125,000 Detroit families had no financial relief whatsoever.\n\nWhen reporters sought Henry out at Ford offices, they found that his dark alter ego had taken complete control. Henry called the Depression \u201ca good thing, generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them fail,\u201d Henry said on one occasion. \u201cLet everybody fail! I made my fortune when I had nothing to start with, by myself and my own ideas. Let other people do the same.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times sent Anne O\u2019Hare McCormick, one of the first powerful female journalists, to interview Henry. In a glass-walled office, he fidgeted for two hours. \u201cHenry Ford is the only American name more potent internationally than that of a movie star,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo the world at large, his is the image in which we live and move.\n\n\u201cSomething has happened to Ford,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand perhaps through him to the America which he represents.\u201d\n\nOne reporter called Henry \u201cthe Mussolini of Detroit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the height of his power, Henry Ford created a secret army of criminals to rule over his burgeoning empire", "title": "Henry Ford\u2019s reign of terror: Greed and murder in Depression-era Detroit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "At the height of his power, Henry Ford created a secret army of criminals to rule over his burgeoning empire", "title": "Henry Ford\u2019s reign of terror: Greed and murder in Depression-era Detroit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/01/henry_fords_reign_of_terror_greed_and_murder_in_depression_era_detroit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/henry_ford2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the height of his power, Henry Ford created a secret army of criminals to rule over his burgeoning empire", "title": "Henry Ford\u2019s reign of terror: Greed and murder in Depression-era Detroit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/henry_ford2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "A.J.
