Since then, support has dipped as low as 51 percent, in 2013. However, a majority of Americans have supported assisted suicide for the nearly two decades Gallup has asked the question.\n\nGallup theorized that the drop in 2013, which culminated in four years of diminished support, may have been due to the discussions of death panels as part of the Affordable Care Act. Likewise, Gallup's analysis of the poll's results said that \"this year finds an uptick in support for euthanasia after the high-profile story last year of 29-year-old Brittany Maynard.\"\n\n\"Dying from terminal brain cancer, Maynard left her home state of California, where physicians are barred from assisting suicide, and ended her life in Oregon, where the practice is legal,\" Gallup noted.\n\n\"Somewhat in response to this well-publicized story, the California state legislature is currently considering a bill that would legalize doctor-assisted suicide.\"\n\nAnti-euthanasia expert Alex Schadenberg told LifeSiteNews that \"the constant media barrage linked to the Brittany Maynard political campaign seems to have created enough fear in the public that they are moving away from caring for the vulnerable and towards killing the vulnerable.\"\n\nDespite the poll's results, Schadenberg says support probably isn't as high as Gallup indicates. \"Once legislators learn how the assisted suicide bills are worded and the effect of legalization, they are rejecting assisted suicide bills,\" he said.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\n\"The same effect occurred in Scotland, where the assisted suicide bill was defeated by a 82-36 margin. The Care Not Killing Alliance in Scotland was effective in explaining how the language of the assisted suicide bill was very dangerous and how the assisted suicide bill, if legalized, would effect the Scottish culture,\" he told LifeSiteNews.\n\nSupport climbed most quickly for 18- to 34-year-olds. Last year, 62 percent of young people supported assisted suicide; this year, 81 percent did.\n\nSupport among Republicans, Democrats, and Independents also climbed dramatically, with Independents jumping from 64 percent support to 80 percent.\n\nGallup also noted that while there is usually a drop in support for assisted suicide when the word \"suicide\" replaces the term \"ending a patient's life by some painless means,\" this year support was virtually identical even when Gallup used the more blunt world.\n\nThe survey also found that more Americans found assisted suicide to be a moral practice than ever before. Two years ago, 49 percent of the public found assisted suicide \"morally acceptable\"; today, that number is 56 percent.\n\nIn light of the poll, Schadenberg told LifeSiteNews that \"there needs to be a major campaign exposing the culture to the effects of legalizing assisted suicide, a campaign that would establish the problems with assisting suicide in the minds of the people.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "In all, 68 percent of Americans support assisted suicide, and a majority of Americans believe it is", "title": "Record number of Americans support assisted suicide: Gallup poll", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/ArrowPointingUpOnChart-810px_shutterstock_113781904.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/record-number-of-americans-support-assisted-suicide-gallup-poll", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "In all, 68 percent of Americans support assisted suicide, and a majority of Americans believe it is"}, "description": "In all, 68 percent of Americans support assisted suicide, and a majority of Americans believe it is", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d0e\"", "article_summary": "\"Once legislators learn how the assisted suicide bills are worded and the effect of legalization, they are rejecting assisted suicide bills,\" he said.\nThe survey also found that more Americans found assisted suicide to be a moral practice than ever before.\nHowever, a majority of Americans have supported assisted suicide for the nearly two decades Gallup has asked the question.\nThe Care Not Killing Alliance in Scotland was effective in explaining how the language of the assisted suicide bill was very dangerous and how the assisted suicide bill, if legalized, would effect the Scottish culture,\" he told LifeSiteNews.\n\"The same effect occurred in Scotland, where the assisted suicide bill was defeated by a 82-36 margin."}
