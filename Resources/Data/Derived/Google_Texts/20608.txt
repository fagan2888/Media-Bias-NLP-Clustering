Liberal ideals take a beating. Rejoice Colbert Nation!

Stephen Colbert took a victory lap on Monday’s edition of “The Colbert Report,” gloating that the technical problems that are hampering the rollout of Obamacare are validating Republican opposition to the legislation.

“Things are going pretty well for conservatives and we’ve handled this sudden good fortune with our trademark grace and humility,” Colbert said, cutting to a string of far right commentators saying, “I told you so.”

“Obamacare’s failure means liberalism is dead,” Colbert added.

To prove his point, Colbert did a stunning re-enactment in which he channeled a kale munching, Birkenstock sporting member of the far left.

“Just got back from the social justice rally, which I attended because I believe that all citizens share responsibility and human rights regardless of race, class, creed or orientation,” Colbert said. “Wait, what’s this? I can’t log on to Obamacare. Burn the gays. Burn them.”

Indeed, the implementation of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law has been so poorly handled that it’s rehabilitating the reputation of a certain Minnesota congresswoman with a colorful interpretation of facts.

“The Obamacare roll out is so bad that by comparison Michele Bachmann is a genius,” Colbert said.

“Bottom line: we were right about Obamacare therefore we were right about everything,” he added. “He was born in Kenya. He’s a secret muslim.”

What a great day for Colbert Nation.
