This movement has demonstrated more clearly that [young people] appreciate the values and strengths of Hong Kong and will continue to fight for general universal suffrage.\n\nChan oversaw the civil service as Hong Kong\u2019s second-highest official under British rule, then stayed on to lead the transition 17 years ago to control by China\u2019s Communist regime in Beijing.\n\nShe spoke recently with The Daily Signal via Skype to reflect on events. Her remarks have been edited only for length and clarity.\n\nThe Daily Signal: What is the legacy of the protest movement?\n\nChan: I have no doubt the Umbrella Movement will be seen as a watershed moment in Hong Kong\u2019s political development.\n\nThis generation of young people used to be regarded as politically apathetic and only focused on themselves and their careers. This movement has demonstrated more clearly that they appreciate the values and strengths of Hong Kong.\n\nThey don\u2019t like our \u201ctwo systems\u201d being eroded. They don\u2019t like the increasing interference of Beijing, the undermining of our freedoms. They will continue to fight for genuine universal suffrage.\n\n>>> Hong Kong\u2019s Former No. 2 Official Fields 7 Questions on the Future of Her City\n\nDemocratic members of the legislature, together with the students, have created a great deal of goodwill among the community. There is great admiration for their stamina and conviction.\n\nWe need to galvanize this energy and continue to press the government. Now that the international spotlight is back on Hong Kong, it will definitely help.\n\nQ: Now that the Hong Kong government has cleared the streets, what is the next step for the protest movement?\n\nA: We have to continue to shame the government into doing something. At the very least we should be looking at the composition of the nominating committee. I personally believe there is some room for movement and negotiations.\n\nIt all comes back to whether this government is willing to sit down and talk seriously. So far, they have made no attempt to talk with the Hong Kong people.\n\nThe government is very much mistaken if it thinks clearing the streets is the end of this particular problem.\n\n\u201cThe government is very much mistaken if it thinks clearing the streets is the end of this particular problem,\u201d says Anson Chan.\n\nAs long as the government doesn\u2019t show any sincerity and willingness to make changes, I think it could drive people back into the streets. The students are not prepared to give up without achieving anything.\n\nQ: What are some specific reforms you will be pushing in coming months?\n\nA: We will continue to do what we have been doing the last 18 months.\n\nOnce again, we will put forward some moderate proposals to make the nominating committee [that approves official candidates for office] more representative: replacing corporate votes with individual human beings.\n\nJust look at who is eligible to participate in the nominating committee today. There is no rhyme or reason for who or what can participate in the vote. There needs to be objective criteria to determine who can participate.\n\n>>> \u2018Never Discouraged\u2019: Pro-Democracy Newspaperman Joins Hong Kong Student Protesters\n\nFinally, we should press the government for a timetable. If the government says, \u2018Forget about the election,\u2019 then tell us when we are going to achieve this. Are we going to achieve it in 2022?\n\nThere may be divided beliefs [about how to proceed]. But what is not in dispute is that everyone wants general universal suffrage and choice and competition in 2017.\n\nEveryone wants to see better governance, greater transparency, better accountability and a willingness of the chief executive to defend \u201cone government, two systems.\u201d\n\nQ: The protests ended without any concessions by the Hong Kong government. What will happen if the government doesn\u2019t grant full universal suffrage?\n\nA: If there is no change, it will erode our strengths and Hong Kong will be marginalized very, very quickly.\n\nWe can\u2019t compete in terms of resources. Where we can compete is we have soft infrastructure that is very conducive to a favorable business environment: We have rule of law and freedom of expression, press and information.\n\nThere remain social problems such as income disparity and affordable housing. There is a failure to be held accountable. All of these issues need to be dealt with.\n\nQ: What are the risks for China in continuing to block Hong Kong\u2019s path to democracy?\n\nA: Beijing is very concerned that 17 years after the handover [from Britain], the hearts and minds of the Hong Kong people have not returned to the motherland. How will they do that if they see you are trampling on the promises you made?\n\nThey see for themselves how dissonance and the press are treated in the mainland. They have been brought up on very, very different values and that is supposed to be protected.\n\nBeijing should be concerned that they are failing to capture the hearts and minds of a whole generation of young people. Increasingly, [Hong Kong youth] don\u2019t like what they are seeing.\n\nWhatever Beijing says to your government in public, they do care about how they are viewed internationally, particularly how they are viewed in America.\n\nWhat mustn\u2019t be forgotten is that we are talking about China\u2019s obligations they made in an international treaty. If they can walk away with impunity, it doesn\u2019t say much about China\u2019s commitment to your country and many other countries.\n\nQ: How do you evaluate the role of the U.S. throughout the protest movement? How can the U.S. help Hong Kong achieve democracy?\n\nI welcome the Congress initiative for the State Department to resume national reporting of Hong Kong. I am glad they are paying greater attention [to] how China treats Hong Kong.\n\nI hope both Congress and the State Department are willing to speak up both publicly and privately.\n\nUnder the U.S.-Hong Kong policy act, there used to be annual reporting of Hong Kong until 2007. Congress asked the State Department to resume annual reporting.\n\n>>> Hong Kong Democracy Leader Faults China for Shattering Peace, City\u2019s Elegance\n\nI am glad that both the U.S. government [executive branch] and Congress are stepping up and taking notice of what happened.\n\nIt is in [the U.S.] self-interest to care. We have shared values and investments. Your nationals are living in Hong Kong. You give Hong Kong concessions and favorable treatment on the basis that we are different values than the [China] mainland.\n\nQ: Why are you so personally passionate about achieving democracy in Hong Kong?\n\nA: I\u2019ve been involved with the government for nearly 40 years. I have seen what Hong Kong has been able to achieve. There is rule of law. Our citizens enjoy rights and freedoms. I appreciate these as our strengths.\n\nI believe in promises both Britain and China made not only to Hong Kong but to the international community with the joint declaration.\n\nWhat we are seeing on the ground is a steady erosion of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d\n\nYou notice Beijing rulers are no longer talking about a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong. They are intent on tightening their grip on Hong Kong.\n\nWhat little autonomy Hong Kong people have, they take away at [their] pleasure. This isn\u2019t what we were promised at the point of handover. All we are asking is for Beijing to adhere to the promises they made.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Home Kong democracy advocate Anson Chan, a former top official, tells The Daily Signal that the youth of her city will not give up the fight for freedom.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Home Kong democracy advocate Anson Chan, a former top official, tells The Daily Signal that the youth of her city will not give up the fight for freedom.", "title": "Hong Kong Youth \u2018Not Prepared to Give Up\u2019 Freedom Fight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlsix545051.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-26T09:43:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xivfGY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Home Kong democracy advocate Anson Chan, a former top official, tells The Daily Signal that the youth of her city will not give up the fight for freedom.", "title": "Hong Kong Youth \u2018Not Prepared to Give Up\u2019 Freedom Fight", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlsix545051.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia,foreign policy", "published_time": "2014-12-26T08:30:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-26T09:43:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce66\"", "article_summary": "Under the U.S.-Hong Kong policy act, there used to be annual reporting of Hong Kong until 2007.\nA: If there is no change, it will erode our strengths and Hong Kong will be marginalized very, very quickly.\nThe pro-democracy protests that captured the energy of youth in Hong Kong \u2014 and earned sympathy around the world \u2014 ended flatly earlier this month, leaving hopes for free elections unsatisfied.\n>>> \u2018Never Discouraged\u2019: Pro-Democracy Newspaperman Joins Hong Kong Student ProtestersFinally, we should press the government for a timetable.\nIncreasingly, [Hong Kong youth] don\u2019t like what they are seeing."}
