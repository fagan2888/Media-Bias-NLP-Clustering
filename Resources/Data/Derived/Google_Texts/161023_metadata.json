No one deserves that. Of course, the state of the Republican campaign for president being what it is, Thursday night\u2019s debate was hardly the only shitshow in town. Just in case you missed them, right wingers spewed a variety of vile and ridiculous things in the past few days. Here are some other less-publicized low-lights.\n\n1. Bobby Jindal blames President Obama for the rise of Trump.\n\nDear Rhodes Scholarship Committee,\n\nPlease immediately rescind Bobby Jindal\u2019s Rhodes Scholar status. He is not a good look for you because he is a complete moron. This has been amply demonstrated in the past by his denial of fundamental realities like climate change and evolution and his insistence on making Louisiana youngsters ignorant of these basic realities as well.\n\nNow, this genius has penned an absurd op-ed in the Wall Street Journal blaming\u2014who else?\u2014President Obama for Trump\u2019s rise.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Jindal wrote, as if he knew how to be honest. \u201cThere would be no Donald Trump, dominating the political scene today if it were not for President Obama\u2026.After seven years of the cool, weak and endlessly nuanced \u2018no drama Obama,\u2019 voters are looking for a strong leader who speaks in short, declarative sentences.\u201d\n\nSoooo, Obama\u2019s sentence structure caused Trump. You read that right. Okay, here\u2019s a simple declarative sentence: You\u2019re nuts, Bobby Jindal, and a liar to boot. Sorry about those commas. Didn\u2019t mean to confuse you.\n\nNot that Jindal likes Trump, but being half right doesn\u2019t make you any less crazy.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama loves to construct straw men so he can contrast his heroic self against them. But Donald Trump needs no characterization; he is capable of being absurd on his own, no outside help required,\u201d Jindal wrote. \u201cWithout President Obama, there is no Donald Trump. Mr. Trump often diagnoses the ills Mr. Obama has caused, but his prescriptions are just as often wrong. America deserves better.\u201d\n\nRhodes Scholarship committee, we rest our case.\n\n2. Sarah Palin and Andrea Tantaros are, like, soooooo mad at Mitt Romney.\n\nThe Palinator and Fox Newsian Andrea Tantaros have this much in common: They both love them their Trumpster. So it stands to reason that they were sooooo mad at Mitt Romney this week for his point-by-point takedown of the Republican frontrunner. These ladies definitely know which billionaire they prefer, and it isn\u2019t Lord Mittens.\n\nFrom Sarah Palin\u2019s fevered brain came these words in the form of a Facebook video:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018machine\u2019s\u2019 deception and nonsensical attack on Trump isn\u2019t really an attack on the candidate. It\u2019s an attack on conscientious, hardworking, patriotic Americans who know we need a revolution to stop the complicit politicians who are fundamentally transforming America. We found the revolutionary. Donald Trump is the shock the Permanent Political Class needs to wake them up\u2026to destroy their selfish cabal\u2026to respect the will of the people\u2026to make America safe and solvent\u2026to make America great again.\u201d\n\nGot that?\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the bait, Mr. Trump,\u201d Palin warned her crush, before promising that she and her ilk have his back.\n\nAnd with friends like her\u2026we\u2019re not sure why Trump needs all those burly security people.\n\nFor her part, Tantaros did her best to come out as a reasonable person, with what passes for cool-headed analysis on Fox (yes, yes, low bar, we know): \u201cMitt Romney, smart guy, good family man, wrong messenger,\u201d Tantaros told her fellow panelists. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the coach who lost the Superbowl is now coming out and telling the winning coach what plays to call.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bobby Jindal blames the rise of Donald Trump on Obama's \"nuance,\" while Sarah Palin babbles incoherently about Mitt", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 The GOP is still lying to itself", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bobby Jindal blames the rise of Donald Trump on Obama's \"nuance,\" while Sarah Palin babbles incoherently about Mitt", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 The GOP is still lying to itself", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/07/5_worst_right_wing_moments_of_the_week_the_gop_is_still_lying_about_trump_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/bobby-jindal-donald-trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bobby Jindal blames the rise of Donald Trump on Obama's \"nuance,\" while Sarah Palin babbles incoherently about Mitt", "title": "5 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 The GOP is still lying to itself", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/bobby-jindal-donald-trump.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bobby Jindal, Donald Trump, Jeffrey Lord, slavery", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Bobby Jindal, Donald Trump, Jeffrey Lord, slavery, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetWe all got to think a little too much about Donald Trump\u2019s manhood this week.\nAnd with friends like her\u2026we\u2019re not sure why Trump needs all those burly security people.\nBut Donald Trump needs no characterization; he is capable of being absurd on his own, no outside help required,\u201d Jindal wrote.\n\u201cPresident Obama loves to construct straw men so he can contrast his heroic self against them.\nBobby Jindal blames President Obama for the rise of Trump."}
