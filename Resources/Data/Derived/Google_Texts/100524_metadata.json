But they sometimes misstated the facts.\n\nOne of the first questions was about the minimum wage. Moderator Neil Cavuto noted the presence of protesters asking for a $15 an hour wage outside the Milwaukee Theatre in Wisconsin.\n\nBen Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who\u2019s leading the polls, said he opposed increasing the minimum wage. \"Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases,\" Carson said.\n\nThat\u2019s not accurate. PolitiFact looked at the 12-month period following every minimum-wage hike since 1978. While joblessness did rise on seven occasions, it also fell on four occasions, contradicting Carson's sweeping claim.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s not at all clear that a minimum-wage hike was the primary culprit for the periods in which joblessness rose, since those periods also coincided with broader recessions in the economy. Finally, economists disagree on whether minimum wage increases reduce employment. In some cases, the increased wages promote spending, which offsets the higher labor cost. Overall, we rated Carson\u2019s statement False .\n\nRubio on welders vs. philosophers\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said the United States needs more vocational training.\n\n\"For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why we have stigmatized vocational training,\" Rubio said . \"Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.\"\n\nIt was a big moment in the debate for Rubio, but was he correct? Philosophically and statistically speaking, no.\n\nBoth government and private sector research show philosophy majors make more money than welders, and with much more room to significantly increase pay throughout their careers.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $37,420 -- about $18 an hour. According to Payscale , a company that collects salary information, philosophy majors make an average first-year salary of $42,200. The average mid-career pay for philosophy majors is even better: $85,000 per year. We rated Rubio\u2019s statement False.\n\nTrump on deportation\n\nDonald Trump, the billionaire developer, defended his immigration policy of urging mass deportation of illegal immigrants by turning to history.\n\n\"Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. \u2018I like Ike,\u2019 right?\" Trump said. \"Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn\u2019t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.\"\n\nTrump has some historical basis for his comments. Eisenhower did oversee a 1954 campaign that was actually called \"Operation Wetback.\" Did it result in 1 million deportations? Historians say that number is far too high for a variety of reasons, including the fact that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants would have had to self-deport. Also, it wasn\u2019t just a deportation program. The campaign accompanied more legal immigration opportunities. Overall, we rated Trump\u2019s claim Half True .\n\nPaul on Rubio's plans, income inequality\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky addressed inequality, defending GOP policies by noting that inequality \"seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats.\"\n\nHe has a point that one credible study shows a fairly strong correlation between high inequality and a Democratic mayor. But experts say it\u2019s a stretch to draw conclusions from this. The claim inflates the actual powers of mayors to shape inequality in their cities and it ignores the role of population size and suburbanization in driving inequality. It also glosses over the fact that metropolitan areas, as opposed to cities, show no such relationship.\n\nWe rated Paul's statement Half True .\n\nPaul also vehemently defended his reputation as a conservative and called out Rubio for proposing a new $1 trillion \"welfare program\" in tax credits and \"$1 trillion in new military spending.\"\n\nRubio\u2019s tax plan includes a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child. It is meant to offset income and payroll taxes and is considerably larger than the $1,000 credit that is currently available.\n\nRubio is proposing that the credit would be phased out at higher income levels -- beginning at $150,000 for an individual and $300,000 for a family. It\u2019s estimated that over 10 years, a common time frame for federal budget planning, Rubio\u2019s child tax credit would result in the loss of $1 trillion in tax revenue.\n\nRubio has backed more defense spending since at least March 2015, when he and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced a budget amendment to increase the Pentagon\u2019s budget. On his campaign website, Rubio says he would restore defense spending to the 2012 level, \"and begin to undo the damage caused by $1 trillion in indiscriminate defense cuts.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a stretch to call the tax credit welfare, and Paul didn\u2019t state that the $1 trillion costs would be over 10 years. Other than that, his statement is accurate. We rated Paul\u2019s statement Mostly True .\n\nTrump on China\n\nWhen talk turned to trade, Trump lamented that \"We\u2019re losing now over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China.\"\n\nThat number is too big. In reality, the United States' 2014 trade deficit with China totaled $343 billion. It\u2019s expected to be larger in 2015 but not more than $500 billion. Trump\u2019s statement rates Mostly False .\n\nTrump didn\u2019t stop there on China. When asked a question about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending trade agreement between the United States and 11 other Asian countries, Trump said the deal was \"designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.\"\n\nAs Rand Paul emphatically pointed out, China isn\u2019t actually a part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. While we considered Trump\u2019s assertion that China could try and take advantage of the deal, the experts we surveyed all said the deal would most likely hurt China\u2019s trade landscape.\n\nWe rated Trump\u2019s statement Pants on Fire .\n\nCruz on the Bible vs. the tax code\n\nCandidates also spent a good portion of the debate bemoaning the tax code and outlining their plans to improve it. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- who has pushed to abolish the Internal Revenue Service -- said, \"There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible.\"\n\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that the tax code is about 4 million words long, while the Bible is about 800,000. So we rated Cruz\u2019s statement True .\n\nFiorina on the health care law\n\nOn health care, Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, lashed out at President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help,\" she said. \"But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone.\"\n\nFiorina\u2019s statement is wrong. Even taking the low end of estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the law, in big ways (such as securing insurance for the first time) or smaller ways (paying less for drugs under Medicare Part D). One does not have to buy into every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price tag to acknowledge that lots of people have benefited from it. We rated Fiorina\u2019s statement Pants on Fire .\n\nCarson on Benghazi\n\nFinally, on foreign policy, Carson attacked Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, for what she said about attacks in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of state.\n\n\"When I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video. \u2026 Where I came from, they call that a lie,\" Carson said.\n\nCarson\u2019s hard-charging statement actually oversimplifies the many comments Clinton made in the wake of Benghazi.\n\nHe has a point that she told her daughter that terrorists attacked in Benghazi, and she told the Libyan president that a terrorist group had taken responsibility. But those were private comments made hours after the attack.\n\nCarson misleads when he said that she told everybody else that it was the result of a video. On the day after the attack, she told the Egyptian prime minister it had nothing to do with the film. At other times, Clinton talked about the video but didn\u2019t say it caused the attacks. She also blamed the video more broadly for protests in various places. A family member of a victim said Clinton blamed the video for his son\u2019s death, but we didn\u2019t find that same sentiment expressed in any of her public comments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican presidential candidates debated serious public policy on the economy, taxes and immigration on Tuesday night, steering away from personal attacks that defined earlier matchups.
