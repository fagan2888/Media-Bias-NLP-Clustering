A high-speed chase that began in Norman, early Tuesday morning, ended in a collision and standoff near the town of Davis, Okla. in Murray County. Police say that suspect is in custody as of 6 a.m.

Police officers, along Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP) troopers, got involved in the pursuit on the southbound side of Interstate 35, around 2:30 a.m. near the exit to Indian Hills Rd. in Norman.

The chase lasted well over an hour, with officers even attempting to use stop sticks on the vehicle.

A News 9 viewer, Cody Travis, shared some video he captured of the pursuit as it was still in progress.

Authorities asked drivers to avoid the area, and diverted traffic off the southbound side of the interstate at mile marker 55 in Murray County, where the chase ended in a collision. Emergency vehicles on the northbound side also disrupted traffic in the area.

Even after the chase ended in that crash, the suspect, who has not yet been identified, remained holed up inside of the crashed out vehicle for nearly two hours before finally surrendering to police just before 6 a.m. No weapons were found in the vehicle.

The interstate was shut down for about three and a half hours. It reopened just after 7 a.m.

Police tell News 9 the chase started because of a routine traffic violation.

The suspect has not been identified. Keep checking with News 9 and News9.com for more details.
