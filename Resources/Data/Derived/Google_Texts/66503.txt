Jodi Sturgeon and her daughter Kasey, 14, delivered 66 dozen — 792 — cookies to first responders Thursday afternoon in appreciation for everything they do to keep people safe.

“We drove 45 miles and made 15 stops in two-and-a-half hours,” she said.

The tradition started nine years ago and, according to Sturgeon, has always been spearheaded by her daughter.

“First it started with just the firefighters,” Sturgeon said, but the effort has grown over the years.

Now, the mother-daughter team sends out a call for cookies weeks before the delivery takes place. Kasey is responsible for all the organization, according to her mother.

“We have some people bake 6, 8, 10 dozen cookies,” she said.

The only thing the 14-year-old didn’t do was map the driving route. Sturgeon said her daughter let her decide the path they took around town.

And when the cookies were delivered, Sturgeon said, most first responders react with appreciation and amazement.

“They’re sacrificing time away from their families,” she said.

That was echoed by Topeka Fire Department Lt. Richard Moran at Station 8 at 2700 S.W. Fairlawn Road.

“It was awful nice of them to think of us,” he said. And although stations get cookies and sweets from several people, Moran said the firefighters know Kasey because she comes every year.

Moran was working with six other firefighters Thursday night.

For Sturgeon, it is a simple way to say thank you for the sacrifices first responders make in order to keep the community safe.

“I just think that more people need to understand and appreciate what first responders do,” she said.
