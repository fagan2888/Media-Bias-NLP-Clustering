Thanks to rules established in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- commonly known as “Obamacare” -- the Floresville Electric Light & Power System (FELPS) is able to realize a 10-percent savings on its employee health-insurance premiums. At its July 29 meeting, the utility’s board of trustees voted unanimously to abandon FELPS’ policy with Blue Cross-Blue Shield in favor of a comparable one with Humana.



General Manager Kyle Dicke said that by accepting the Humana policy, which has a benefit year starting Oct. 1 and ending Sept. 30, 2016, FELPS would get a one-year break from the price increases associated with Obamacare. Signing an extension at the end of the contract term would stretch that grace period for another year, he said.



Consultant Matt Amerman said that the Humana policy offers almost identical coverage to the current Blue Cross plan. However, FELPS’ monthly contribution for employee-only coverage would drop to $375 per month, per employee. Workers who purchase additional coverage for their spouses would be charged $825 per month, which is down from the $967-per-month Blue Cross premium.



Also during the meeting, the board amended a resolution approved July 23, related to the refinance of its 2005 bonds. The change related to striking language that reflected FELPS’ release of $1 million from a reserve fund, Dicke said. The utility had hoped to repurpose that money to fund capital projects. (See “Electric utility gets green light from Floresville to refinance bond,” July 29.)



Jeffrey Kuhn, bond counsel with the Norton Rose Fulbright law firm, said money cannot be moved because the insurers did not want to risk being sued by the bondholders for consenting to weakening the security of the bond.



In other business, the board:



Approved a contract with Survalent for the purchase of software for a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System, at a cost not to exceed $110,000. Additional hardware, which will be installed by FELPS workers, will be purchased at a later date.



Learned during a closed session that Dicke has tendered his resignation, effective Sept. 11. See article, page 1A.
