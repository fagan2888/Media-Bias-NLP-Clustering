Now, she is scheduled to return on that date only so that her subpoena can again be postponed \u2014 this time to Jan. 3.\n\nThe hearing could decide whether Winter will be ordered to testify about her sources for a story she wrote about the case.\n\nIf Winter is ordered to testify and she refuses, Judge Carlos Samour wrote in granting the delay on Tuesday, there is \u201cthe real possibility that Winter may face indefinite jail time in this case as a remedial sanction for her refusal to disclose her confidential sources.\u201d\n\nBecause of the stakes involved, Samour said Winter should be allowed to fully appeal her subpoena in New York before facing the crucial hearing.\n\nSamour also wrote in his order that the dispute could delay the trial date for theater shooter James Holmes. Postponing Winter\u2019s hearing could avert that, though.\n\n\u201cIf the Court proceeds with the hearing on September 30, the Court all but guarantees that the trial will be delayed because no matter what ruling the Court issues, it will very likely trigger an appeal that will stay the proceedings,\u201d Samour wrote.\n\nHolmes\u2019 trial is currently scheduled for February, a date that would remain in place if the appeals court in New York agrees to cancel Winter\u2019s subpoena.\n\nLast summer, Winter cited unidentified law enforcement sources in reporting that a notebook Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist before the attack contained violent drawings and plans.\n\nDefense attorneys say the disclosures, which appear to have violated the cases\u2019s gag order, bring the integrity of investigators into question.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fox News reporter wins delay in crucial theater shooting hearing", "title": "Fox News reporter wins delay in crucial theater shooting hearing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/03/fox-news-reporter-wins-delay-in-crucial-theater-shooting-hearing/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130903__jana_winter_fox_news_reporterp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130903__jana_winter_fox_news_reporterp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T16:33:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T06:23:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ceb\"", "article_summary": "Samour also wrote in his order that the dispute could delay the trial date for theater shooter James Holmes.\nA Fox News reporter facing possible jail time in a dispute over a story she wrote about the Aurora theater shooting has been granted a delay in a crucial hearing.\nJana Winter, who is based in New York, had been scheduled to return to court Sept. 30 for a hearing.\nThe hearing could decide whether Winter will be ordered to testify about her sources for a story she wrote about the case.\nNow, she is scheduled to return on that date only so that her subpoena can again be postponed \u2014 this time to Jan. 3."}
