Joe, Entertainment News\n\nThis story has been corrected since it was originally published.\n\nWhen the history of this period of comic books is written, we might have to reuse an old term. What could this be but a new Golden Age?\n\nHalf the reason for the current glory days is the bottomless hunger for comic book properties in movies and TV. Not only are comics \u2014 both corporate and creator-owned \u2014 desirable, but they\u2019re finally getting some goddamn respect. While actors making the early X-Men movies had to hide their comic books, now actual comic book art is now appearing in adaptations: like Michael Allred\u2019s pop art in \u201ciZombie\u201d and David Mack\u2019s moody painting in \u201cJessica Jones.\u201d The dweebs have finally inherited the earth.\n\nFortunately, comics themselves continue to be a diverse collection of stories and art unlike any other genre. Much of the best work is creator-owned, thanks to the ongoing renaissance at Image Comics, but you can find work that\u2019s weird, personal, cosmic and extraordinary at just about any publisher. Here\u2019s a look at some of the best comics that crossed my path this year. I just wish I had the telepathic powers of Professor X or Gorilla Grodd so I could already know about the ones I missed.\n\nBest Writer: Jason Aaron\n\nJason Aaron\u2019s year would be an impressive decade for most writers. He continued his creator-owned southern noir \u201cSouthern Bastards,\u201d a strong challenger to \u201cSaga\u201d and \u201cSex Criminals\u201d for overall best title. He complicated his classic run on \u201cThor\u201d by introducing former love interest and current cancer patient Jane Foster as the newest hammer-holder, boosting sales and creating a fresh and heartbreaking story. He took on Dr. Strange, showing how fascinating and weird this oft-neglected character can be. His new creator-owned series, \u201cThe Goddamned,\u201d is a vicious, black comedy Bible story that almost makes me sympathize with the Old Testament God. His run on \u201cWeirdworld\u201d was an unexpected delight and his \u201cStar Wars\u201d series was the best take on Lucas\u2019 characters in decades. What more can one guy do?\n\nMost Necessary Hero: Ms. Marvel\n\nSince the Paris attacks have made Muslim-bashing OK again for Moron Americans, I can\u2019t think of a hero more relevant to the current world than Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel. This teen hero is squarely in the tradition of Peter Parker, while completely of the present. It\u2019s refreshing to see Ms. Marvel join the Avengers and become a cornerstone of the Marvel Universe. Let\u2019s hope Kamala makes the leap to the movies well before Marvel Studios begins Phase Bazillion. We need her.\n\nBest Artist: Tom Scioli\n\nWhat artist/writer Tom Scioli and writer John Barber have accomplished with the ongoing \u201cTransformers vs. G.I. Joe\u201d series is astounding in its creativity, and most of that creativity comes from Scioli\u2019s art, which might require a whole new Scott McLeod volume to fully appreciate. In fact, this is the only comic that comes with a monthly \u201ccommentary track\u201d by the creators \u2014 and it\u2019s quite welcome, because there is more going on per page than in most anthologies. Scioli has always been heavily influenced by the great Jack Kirby, but in this series he\u2019s gone beyond Kirby to a type of non-realistic, busy but not cluttered, psychedelic yet tightly choreographed style that\u2019s among the most experimental in comics. The unrestrained exuberance of Scioli\u2019s art is a great reminder that even the best adaptation in the world will never have more to offer than the comics page itself.\n\nBest Piss-take on Superheroes: \u201cAll-Star Section 8\u201d\n\n\u201cPreacher\u201d co-creator Garth Ennis is one of the most prolific and successful comic book writers \u2014 and one of the few who not only avoids superheroes, but actively despises them. This hatred took sharp, satirical, often disturbing form in \u201cThe Boys\u201d and \u201cThe Pro,\u201d plus this year\u2019s \u201cAll-Star Section 8.\u201d The plot is simple: a group of drunken, deranged, degenerate losers try to recruit a real superhero \u2014 such as Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern or Martian Manhunter \u2014 to their team. Thanks to John McCrea\u2019s grotesque art and Ennis\u2019 batshit script, the results show DC might have a sense of humor after all.\n\nBest Single Issue by a Disappointing Company: Superman #39\n\nIn terms of sales and creativity, the past few years have been bleak for DC. Scott Snyder\u2019s dreary, pretentious, overwritten Batman (no matter who wears the cowl) is horrific for anyone who\u2019s read comics for more than a week, and most of the line (aside from bright spots like \u201cHarley Quinn\u201d and \u201cBlack Canary\u201d) is depressing to longtime fans of the company that invented superheroes. But this issue by Geoff Johns, John Romita Jr. and Klaus Janson is a gem, showing that the true heroism of Superman has nothing to do with laser eye beams or bulletproof skin. This one-and-done story is wonderfully analyzed by Oliver Sava, and it\u2019s worth tracking down for anyone who wants to see what Superman is really all about. Maybe we should send a copy to Zack Synder.\n\nBest Publisher: Image Comics\n\nWhen I asked comic book store workers for their favorite comics, I noticed a pattern: many had trouble naming great comics that were not from Image. Image has been ruling the roost for several years now, just by following a simple formula: letting talented creators own their work and do whatever the hell they want. At Image you can read about gods returning to life as pop stars (\u201cThe Wicked and the Divine\u201d), Canada going to war with America (\u201cWe Stand On Guard\u201d), a barbarian carrying around a talking witch\u2019s head (\u201cHead Lopper\u201d), a Presidential candidate who has literally sold his soul to the devil (\u201cCitizen Jack\u201d), 12-year-old girls fighting aliens in the 1980s (\u201cPaper Girls\u201d), a dwarf seeking Tarantino-style revenge (\u201cBig Man Plans\u201d), a 40-year-old woman stuck in a child\u2019s body and a Disney-ish hell world (\u201cI Hate Fairyland\u201d) and a Superman analogue with a touch of Forest Gump (\u201cHuck\u201d). If you\u2019re missing out on Image, you\u2019re missing out on life.\n\nTwo Marvel All-new All-different Titles That Actually Live Up to the Billing: \u201cKarnak\u201d and \u201cThe Vision\u201d\n\nMarvel\u2019s latest branding initiative \u2014 All-new! All-different! \u2014 has mostly been the same old crap. But a few titles have brought the distinct vision (no pun intended) of creator-owned books to the Marvel Universe. \u201cThe Vision,\u201d written by Tom King and illustrated by Gabriel Hernandez Walta, features everyone\u2019s favorite android living in the suburbs with a family he literally built himself. It\u2019s an oddball story that\u2019s kind of like the Stepford Avengers. Then there\u2019s \u201cKarnak,\u201d which is about an obscure member of the Inhumans who can spot the weakness in anything or anyone, much like your most evil relative. As always, writer Warren Ellis provides a deep, thoughtful look at a strange concept, while Gerardo Zaffino\u2019s scratchy, kinetic art creates terrific tension and release. While Marvel has been a bit gimmicky with diversity lately (The new Hulk is Asian! The new Wolverine is female!) it\u2019s nice to see them spotlight characters who are mentally diverse too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Kamala Khan to best adaptation \"Jessica Jones\" to the craziest crossovers, here are our Golden Age's top picks", "title": "The best comics of 2015: With Islamophobia rearing its ugly head, we need \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d now more than ever", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Kamala Khan to best adaptation \"Jessica Jones\" to the craziest crossovers, here are our Golden Age's top picks", "title": "The best comics of 2015: With Islamophobia rearing its ugly head, we need \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d now more than ever", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/06/the_best_comics_of_2015_with_islamophobia_rearing_its_ugly_head_we_need_ms_marvel_now_more_than_ever/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/ms_marvel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Kamala Khan to best adaptation \"Jessica Jones\" to the craziest crossovers, here are our Golden Age's top picks", "title": "The best comics of 2015: With Islamophobia rearing its ugly head, we need \u201cMs. Marvel\u201d now more than ever", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/ms_marvel.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Peters", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, alias, Archie vs Predator, bitch planet, Comic Books, Comics, Editor's Picks, Jason Aaron, jessica jones, ms. marvel, Tom Scioli, Transformers vs. G.I.
