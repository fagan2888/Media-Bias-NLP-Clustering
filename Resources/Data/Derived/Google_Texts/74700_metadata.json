But the H5N2 strain is deadly when it spreads to commercial poultry. It can wipe out a flock of tens of thousands of birds in a few days, as it did at a farm last month in Minnesota, the nation\u2019s top turkey-producing state. The same strain soon turned up on two farms in Missouri and one in Arkansas.\n\nThe vast majority of turkeys and chickens in the U.S. spend their lives confined indoors to protect against disease. Yet, as the infections show, viruses can still reach them \u2014 tracked in by humans or rodents; carried on trucks, equipment, crates and egg flats; passed from waterfowl to shore birds that find their way into a barn.\n\n\u201cThis new guy is a bad actor,\u201d said Dr. Carol Cardona, an avian influenza specialist at the University of Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota confirmed its outbreak March 4, the first H5N2 found in the Mississippi flyway, a major bird migration route. The Missouri and Arkansas cases were confirmed this week. The only known commonality is the flyway. Why it showed up at these locations simultaneously is a mystery, though Cardona and other experts suspect waterfowl or other wild birds.\n\nMeanwhile, officials are keeping an eye on the workers who had contact with the infected flocks, and producers are tightening their standard biosecurity measures, which include putting on sanitary clothing and showering on their way in and out of barns.\n\nThe new strain \u2014 along with other recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic strains in commercial turkey and chicken farms, backyard flocks and wild birds in the Northwest\u2019s Pacific flyway \u2014 also affects the industry\u2019s bottom line in the affected states. Dozens of countries have banned poultry imports from affected states, a common practice done mainly to protect their own flocks.\n\nThe World Health Organization says avian influenza viruses can survive in contaminated raw poultry, so it\u2019s possible to spread them via fresh or frozen products. But government and industry officials say the danger to humans is very low, and people can\u2019t catch it from properly cooked poultry or eggs. Cardona said the likelihood of bird flu entering a country through imported products is \u201cvery, very low.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New bird flu strain has poultry farmers scrambling", "author": "Steve Karnowski", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New bird flu strain has poultry farmers scrambling", "title": "New bird flu strain has poultry farmers scrambling", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/14/new_bird_flu_strain_has_poultry_farmers_scrambling/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/food-and-farm-bird-flu.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New bird flu strain has poultry farmers scrambling", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/food-and-farm-bird-flu.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "New bird flu strain has poultry farmers scrambling", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New bird flu strain has poultry farmers scrambling", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce37d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Animal health experts and poultry growers are scrambling to determine how a dangerous new strain of bird flu infected turkey flocks in three states \u2014 and to stop it from spreading.\nCardona said the likelihood of bird flu entering a country through imported products is \u201cvery, very low.\u201d\nWhy it showed up at these locations simultaneously is a mystery, though Cardona and other experts suspect waterfowl or other wild birds.\nBut the H5N2 strain is deadly when it spreads to commercial poultry.\nDozens of countries have banned poultry imports from affected states, a common practice done mainly to protect their own flocks."}
