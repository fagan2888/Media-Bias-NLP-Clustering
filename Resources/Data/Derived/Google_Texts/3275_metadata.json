According to Kratz that means \u201cpossible termination\u201d of the contract between the city and the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority.\n\nDuring a tense Tuesday meeting MECA upped its terms from the current five year appointment with possible re-appointments, to a \u201cone and done\u201d seven-year stint.\n\nFollowing Kratz\u2019s legal threat MECA\u2019s Jim Vokal insisted the board acted properly.\n\n\u201cWe have the right to amend our by-laws which are our governing structure,\u201d said Vokal, a former member of the Omaha City Council. \u201cThe contract between MECA and the city is a completely different document.\u201d\n\nMECA Chairman John Lund, who fought the extension, now hopes to avoid a legal fight.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I want is a court battle,\u201d said Lund.\n\nBoard member Dana Bradford who proposed the seven-year term, argued Tuesday that without \u201ctenured talent\u201d \u2014 keeping current board members around longer \u2014 MECA would lose experience and suffer.\n\nBoard member Willy Theisen countered that longer terms would make MECA\u2019s poor public image problems worse. \u201cWe have to hit the reset button\u2026 this is self-serving.\u201d\n\nMECA\u2019s lawyer, Robert Freeman, said the board could vote to increase the terms and in the end the board voted 3-2 for longer limits.\n\nBradford, Jay Noddle and Vokal voted yes. Vokal\u2019s term was supposed to end next month, now he\u2019d serve until 2016.\n\nFollowing the vote Mayor Jean Stothert also called the board\u2019s plan \u201cself-serving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it surely hurts any effort to work with MECA. It\u2019s very difficult to work with them if they are making these unilateral decisions.\u201d\n\nStay with Nebraska Watchdog for more on this developing story.\n\nContact Joe Jordan at joe@nebraskawatchdog.org and listen to Joe every Monday morning at 7:40 on KFAB radio in Omaha.\n\nTo subscribe to news updates from Nebraska Watchdog at no charge, click here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Joe Jordan | Nebraska Watchdog Updated: 11 p.m. OMAHA\u2014Fix it or else.
