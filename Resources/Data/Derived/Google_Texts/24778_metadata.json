Though there will be an $875 billion increase in spending on programs geared toward the elderly or poor \u2014 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 the amount budgeted for children will only increase by $6 million.\n\nCanada, whose organization seeks to give children in Harlem opportunities to attend college and \u201clive the American dream,\u201d said he was appalled to discover that national fiscal policy might make this dream impossible for them.\n\n\u201cMy generation set out to leave this (country) a better place than we found it,\u201d Canada said. \u201cIn the end, (the next generation is) going to get ripped off. This is something to me that\u2019s un-American, and I felt that we need to do something about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one group in America you don\u2019t have to worry about being taken advantage of are the seniors,\u201d he added, noting that AARP has successfully elicited national support for entitlements and is set to maintain its influence.\n\nThe youth, who \u201cdon\u2019t really vote and don\u2019t really have a lot of financial power,\u201d have been overlooked in terms of budget policy, Druckenmiller said.\n\nLack of government transparency about revenue and debt allows the issue to be buried, he added. The $17 trillion national debt jumps to $205 trillion when the calculation includes promised future payments on Social Security and Medicare, he said. \u201cThe only company I know that does their books like the (United States) is Enron.\u201d\n\nThe crisis point might be more than a decade away, but \u201cif you wait, the cost of fixing the problem (rises) exponentially over time\u201d as interest on outstanding loans accumulates, Druckenmiller said, presenting several hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the problem of the country\u2019s growing debt. Though a 55 percent tax hike could pay off all debt this year, a 65 percent increase would be needed if the country waits 20 years. In 30 years, taxes would have to increase by 72 percent to cover all debts, he said.\n\nYoung people have great power to spur large-scale change, Druckenmiller said. \u201cEven though your generation doesn\u2019t vote as much as mine,\u201d young people\u2019s advocacy has impacted President Obama\u2019s environmental policy, and \u201cwe have gay marriage pretty much cascading throughout the country now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou guys need to put pressure on both parties,\u201d he told the audience of students and professors. This way, one of the parties will see the issue of entitlement spending matters to voters and take measures to effect change, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have time to address this, and we need to address it now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe speeches were followed by a question-and-answer session, in which Druckenmiller and Canada addressed the issue of health care.\n\nThough health care policy must be \u201cworked out in the political area,\u201d Druckenmiller said he believes the country should \u201cget consumer choice back into the healthcare system\u201d through direct customer payments, which would hold providers more accountable for prices.\n\nCanada said he supports universal health care but still thinks the Affordable Care Act is fraught with problems.\n\n\u201cBut I daresay if we put 20 young people from this college in a room, they would come up with ideas,\u201d he said, adding that giving young adults more input in the future of health care is important because their generation will fund whatever plan is implemented.\n\nSome audience members raised concerns that prioritizing youth could take needed money away from seniors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about equity, not about whether or not we should have entitlements,\u201d which are necessary in some form, Canada said.\n\nThe event\u2019s objective \u2014 which mirrors CSA\u2019s overall goals \u2014 was to bring \u201cDemocrats, Republicans, students for liberty \u2026 and all other relevant political groups\u201d together to discuss important issues, said Sam Gilman \u201915, president and co-founder of CSA.\n\n\u201cWe all realize that our generation needs to start a conversation and take action on these issues\u201d to avoid the long-term consequences, he added.\n\nCSA will discuss entitlement reform at its weekly meeting today, said Oliver Lyman \u201915, director of policy for CSA. This discussion, as well as discussions about other current political issues, will be used to create an advocacy agenda for Brown CSA.\n\nStudents who attended the lecture said they appreciated the focus on numbers and facts rather than more generally biased statements.\n\nGroups co-sponsoring the event included the Political Science Department Undergraduate Group, College Democrats of Rhode Island, College Republican Federation of Rhode Island, Brown Democrats, Brown Republicans, the Janus Forum, Brown Political Review, the Brown Political Forum, Brown University Students for Liberty and Brown Socially Responsible Investment Fund.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "The talk emphasized today\u2019s budget policy and its consequences for the next generation.", "title": "Speakers call on youth to spur economic reform", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Perelman_Promises_Brittany-Comunale-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-31T23:25:59+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/10/16/speakers-call-youth-spur-economic-reform/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "University News", "published_time": "2013-10-16T00:01:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-31T23:25:59+00:00"}, "description": "The talk emphasized today\u2019s budget policy and its consequences for the next generation.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Sarah Perelman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9929\"", "article_summary": "Groups co-sponsoring the event included the Political Science Department Undergraduate Group, College Democrats of Rhode Island, College Republican Federation of Rhode Island, Brown Democrats, Brown Republicans, the Janus Forum, Brown Political Review, the Brown Political Forum, Brown University Students for Liberty and Brown Socially Responsible Investment Fund.\nThe youth, who \u201cdon\u2019t really vote and don\u2019t really have a lot of financial power,\u201d have been overlooked in terms of budget policy, Druckenmiller said.\nThe $17 trillion national debt jumps to $205 trillion when the calculation includes promised future payments on Social Security and Medicare, he said.\nCSA will discuss entitlement reform at its weekly meeting today, said Oliver Lyman \u201915, director of policy for CSA.\nStudents who attended the lecture said they appreciated the focus on numbers and facts rather than more generally biased statements."}
