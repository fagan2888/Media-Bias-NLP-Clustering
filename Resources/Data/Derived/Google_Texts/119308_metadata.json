As their own employers, they cover the cost of premium payments to insure themselves and their three children.\n\nThe damage has typically been about $1,000 per month. For years, the Gibsons have been budgeting accordingly.\n\nThey understand the value of doing so \u2013 after she gave birth to her third child, Samantha was hospitalized for thyroid cancer. Her insurance plan covered every penny of the $100,000 visitation.\n\nBut several years ago, the Gibsons\u2019 insurer raised its rates. The family\u2019s premiums jumped to $1,800 per month and their deductible to $8,000. In 2012, they spent $28,000 out of pocket, despite their coverage plan. The year prior, medical expenses and insurance payments combined cost them about $20,000.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to buy a house, and we just couldn\u2019t afford that,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cIt was getting crazy, insane.\u201d\n\nShopping for a different plan proved troublesome; insurers were reluctant to cover her family on account of its three pre-existing conditions \u2013 Samantha\u2019s cancer, her daughter\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis, her son\u2019s ADHD.\n\n\u201cNobody wanted to insure us. We felt like we were handcuffed to this company that was increasing its rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary, living in fear that you won\u2019t be able to afford insurance and something will happen.\u201d\n\nFor her, the rollout of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2013 newly enacted legislation that aims to make healthcare more affordable for all Americans, and to insure the 40 million people who lack insurance coverage \u2013 is timely.\n\nFor her family, it manifests as similar monthly payments but thousands less in out-of-pocket expenses. It also means peace of mind. Pre-existing conditions will no longer preclude her from shopping for insurance.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable [Care] Act does not seem perfect,\u201d she wrote in an email, \u201cbut I feel it is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe act heralds the farthest-reaching reform of the healthcare system since Medicare was legislated in 1965. For three years, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2013 also called Obamacare \u2013 has been the subject of heated debate in Congress and at millions of dinner tables.\n\nOn both sides of the American political spectrum, strong opinions color discussion of the healthcare system. Some applaud the act as a step in the right direction, at long last; others vehemently believe it will have disastrous consequences. One Louisiana congressman called it the most \u201cdangerous\u201d piece of legislation ever passed.\n\nPolitics notwithstanding, the fact remains that the Affordable Care Act has been signed into law, and now the Beach Cities \u2013 and all of America \u2013 must recalibrate.\n\nThe resource\n\nNow, like millions of other Americans, Beach Cities residents have a choice: get private insurance, apply for government-sponsored Medi-Cal, or incur a penalty.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all Americans will be required to sign up or pay up.\n\nBeginning in 2014, someone without insurance has to pay a fine \u2013 one percent of his or her yearly income or $95, whichever is greater. A child without healthcare will cost his or her parent $47.50. With each successive year, the fine will increase; by 2016, the cost will be 2.5 percent of income or $695 for a single person, and $2,085 for a family.\n\nThe act holds insurance companies to different standards. Now they have to cover the cost of services that used to be optional, including mental healthcare and preventive services like cancer screenings. They are also banned from cancelling a policy if a holder gets sick.\n\nFor many people, insurance policies and jargon are new concepts. Some have never been insured; some are recently unemployed and uninsured. To avoid fines, all of them have to find an insurance plan, and they don\u2019t have much time to figure it out.\n\nOn Oct. 1, the national healthcare insurance exchange \u2013 a web-based marketplace \u2013 went live and the machine of reform rumbled to life. Now, just over two months later, the deadline for getting coverage looms. Americans have until Dec. 23 to purchase insurance if they want coverage effective Jan. 1, and until March 31 if they want coverage in 2014.\n\nAs with any major transition, this one is fraught with complications. Headlines decry the shortfalls of the online exchange. People are confused.\n\nFortunately for local residents, Beach Cities Health District (BCHD) in Redondo Beach, the nation\u2019s largest preventive health agency, wants to make the shift as painless as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new program, so we\u2019re anticipating bumps, but we want to make sure people in the community are supported in the [transition],\u201d said Dr. Lisa Santora, chief medical officer at BCHD.\n\n\u201cEffective January, it\u2019s a mandate that an individual must have health insurance, and we\u2019re working with the community to make sure everyone can meet that new mandate. Just like you have to have car insurance if you drive a car in California, now there\u2019s a mandate that you have to have health insurance.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 18, BCHD announced its certification as an enrollment site through Covered California \u2013 the state-run online marketplace created to facilitate the buying and selling of healthcare insurance. Covered California aims to enroll more than 700,000 people before the March deadline \u2013 as of Nov. 19, 80,000 California residents had chosen a coverage plan \u2013 and BCHD has signed on to be part of that effort.\n\nFour staff members have undergone training to qualify as enrollment counselors. Their certification can be verified on the Covered California website.\n\n\u201cWe want to help [guide] people the correct way through what could be a very complicated healthcare system,\u201d Santora said. \u201cAs simple as the exchange has made it, it can be confusing. What\u2019s a deductible? What\u2019s a premium? If you\u2019ve never had health insurance in your life, you might not know what those are. We want to make sure people are not only able to have health insurance but also to understand it and fully utilize it.\u201d\n\nThe district is uninvolved with the politics healthcare reform, but resolute in its commitment to ensuring that all Beach Cities residents have access to affordable healthcare, Santora said.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether someone supports [healthcare reform] or doesn\u2019t, our thing is that it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d added Eric Garner, BCHD\u2019s communications specialist.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always made it our duty to make sure our residents have access to healthcare and health services. We\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years and this is just another arrow in our quiver. If it\u2019s connecting people with healthcare, we\u2019re on board.\u201d\n\nAs testament to that, the district has for more than a decade operated the Center for Health Connection, which provides need-based and fee-based medical, dental, and counseling services to local residents who qualify.\n\n\u201cOne of our priorities at the health district has always been ensuring 100 percent access to healthcare coverage,\u201d Santora said. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t be 100 percent healthy if you don\u2019t have access to a medical home or if you don\u2019t have healthcare insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nSantora sees the district\u2019s certification as a Covered California enrollment site as another manifestation of that basic commitment to connect people with healthcare.\n\nShe adds that there is one particular aspect of healthcare reform that aligns with the BCHD vision: the requirement that all insurance plans cover preventive services. As a preventive healthcare agency, BCHD operates according to the principle that by pre-empting sickness and disease \u2013 getting check-ups, pap smears, and cancer screenings, for example \u2013 patients save money and live longer.\n\n\u201cHaving insurance will help people access preventive services that will increase their life expectancy,\u201d Santora said. \u201cWe strive to connect people with healthcare resources that prevent them from developing conditions that could be seriously debilitating.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re working with a lot of residents who\u2026 might not understand the need to have health insurance. If you\u2019re 27, health insurance might not be your top priority. We want to work with the community to help them see it\u2019s better to be insured.\u201d\n\nThe numbers\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit healthcare policy watchdog with no relationship to Kaiser Permanente, California entered the reform era with a percentage of uninsured residents that was greater than the national average.\n\nOf its nonelderly population, 22 percent of California lacked coverage. The national figure was 18 percent. The coverage gap in the Beach Cities was less than half that.\n\n\u201cThe majority of Beach Cities residents do have access to health insurance or self fund [coverage], but always there has been a population in the Beach Cities of people who have not had that access,\u201d Santora said.\n\nIn the Beach Cities of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Redondo Beach \u2013 an affluent area with a combined population of more than 120,000 \u2013 seven percent of residents lacked insurance in 2010, according to a Gallup Well Being Index survey. At the time the survey was conducted, the majority of the Beach Cities\u2019 uninsured population comprised people between the ages of 18 and 30 \u2013 a statistic, Santora said, that corresponded with the high numbers of young service industry workers in the area whose employers do not sponsor their health insurance.\n\nOver 17 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 were uninsured; just over eight percent of people aged between 45 and 64 years old lacked coverage. Thousands more, like the Gibsons, were barely hanging on to their insurance plans.\n\nAnother Gallup Well Being Index survey conducted in 2012 revealed a change in the demographic of people without coverage. Already, the Affordable Care Act was allowing everyone under the age of 26 to remain under their parents\u2019 insurance coverage (even if they lived away from home), which manifested as a decrease in the number of young adults without insurance.\n\nNow, 11 percent of people between 18 and 29 lacked coverage, compared to nearly 18 percent two years earlier. But the survey revealed a new trend: the percentage of uninsured people between the ages of 45 and 64 had jumped almost 4 points, from 8 percent to nearly 12.\n\n\u201cThere was the economic decline and a lot of older people facing layoffs and economic shifts \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot harder to find a job when you\u2019re over 50, but you still don\u2019t qualify for Medicare, so that was a new gap we found,\u201d Santora said.\n\nOver 7,000 people were still without access to healthcare \u2013 the bulk of that population in Redondo Beach.\n\nBut because the gap is significantly smaller locally than it is in other, lower-income areas, resources for uninsured people are scarce.\n\n\u201cOften in places of higher need \u2013 Venice, Santa Monica, South L.A. \u2013 that\u2019s where the county places services for people who don\u2019t have access to healthcare,\u201d Santora said. \u201cFor a Beach Cities resident, it\u2019s always been very challenging to get access to healthcare when they weren\u2019t insured.\u201d\n\nThese are the people BCHD had in mind when it applied to become a certified enrollment site \u2013 people like one of Santora\u2019s patients, an unemployed 27-year-old student who recently used the BCHD counseling service to sign up for healthcare coverage that will cost him less than $70 per month.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, an appendectomy [would have] cost him $12,000,\u201d Santora said. \u201cNow he\u2019s paying less than he pays for his iPhone and if something like that happens he\u2019s not going to be forced into bankruptcy for something that was unexpected.\u201d\n\nThe appointment\n\nBefore she was laid off, Redondo Beach resident Serena Smith* didn\u2019t pay much attention to healthcare insurance.\n\nHer boss covered her premiums. She didn\u2019t know how much they cost; she didn\u2019t have to.\n\nBut then the recession struck and, like thousands of other Californians, Smith was laid off. Now, she is engaged in a job hunt, but until it bears fruit she has no income. Her expenses include rent for an apartment in Redondo Beach and tuition for a graduate program at UCLA that she hopes will increase her chances of finding a job she wants.\n\nUntil this month, she had no healthcare coverage.\n\nRecently, Smith learned from her next-door neighbor about the service being offered at BCHD. Eager to better understand the process of applying for coverage, she made an appointment.\n\nBecause she arrived with the necessary documents in hand, Smith was able to complete the application within a half hour and walk away insured and reassured.\n\n\u201cIt was so quick,\u201d Smith said of her visit to BCHD. \u201cThey were able to give me an appointment right away, which was important to me, especially during the holidays. I wanted to get this done and over with.\u201d\n\nAfter answering a series of questions \u2013 \u201cso simple a middle school student can do them,\u201d she said \u2013 and choosing a plan to suit her needs, she is breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m much more optimistic about my future,\u201d she said.\n\nAll appointments are free and one-on-one.\n\n\u201cWe help people digest all of this information because it\u2019s a lot, especially for someone who hasn\u2019t had health insurance for awhile or is just getting familiar with some of the terms and what they mean,\u201d said certified Covered California counselor Heather Hocking. \u201cIt can be kind of overwhelming. This is a big decision for a lot of people, and they often don\u2019t even know what they qualify for, so this is a good way to figure that out. And it\u2019s our job to help them.\u201d\n\nHocking and the BCHD staff are sensitive to the great weight of the decision to purchase long-term coverage, and make it a point not to rush their clients.\n\n\u201cWhen people say, \u2018This is great but I have to talk to my husband\u2019 or \u2018I have to think about this,\u2019 we totally understand that,\u201d Hocking said. \u201cWe know this is a big decision and are happy to make a follow-up appointment. There\u2019s no pressure to make a decision right then and there.\u201d\n\nBehind closed doors, Hocking and her colleagues show their clients how to use coveredca.com, which features a Shop And Compare tool that juxtaposes insurance packages and informs users as to whether they qualify for subsidies and tax credits.\n\nThe tool requires users to input their yearly income, age, ZIP code, and the number of their dependents; it then shows a comparison of healthcare packages and their total cost.\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll have a conversation about how often they go to the doctor or whether they have an ongoing chronic health condition,\u201d Hocking said. \u201cWe think about different plans where you pay a certain percent and the plan pays a certain percent, based on what you think your needs are going to be.\u201d\n\nPackages fit into one of four categories \u2013 bronze, silver, gold, and platinum \u2013 based on affordability and level of coverage. Under the Affordable Care Act, every plan is required to cover the following: ambulance services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventive and wellness services, and services for children, including dental and vision care.\n\nExamples of these are alcohol screening and counseling, diet and obesity counseling, aspirin use, blood pressure and cholesterol checks, cancer screenings, depression screenings, diabetes checks, HIV screening, immunization vaccines, sexually transmitted infection screening and counseling, tobacco cessation counseling, and preventive health services for women, like breast cancer screening and well-woman visits.\n\nSubsidies are available for people who earn relatively low income \u2013 less than $45,000 per year for a single person, or less than $94,000 per year for a family of four. A person like Smith who earns less than $15,856 per year qualifies for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program that pays for children and adults with limited income to receive medical services.\n\nSmith will have no monthly payments.\n\nGiven the national outcry over the technical shortfalls of the enrollment website, Hocking has been pleasantly surprised at how smoothly it has worked for her.\n\n\u201cThe website has been really smooth, actually,\u201d Hocking said. \u201cCovered California notifies people when the website is going to be down for scheduled maintenance, but when they take the website down we can still use the Shop and Compare tool. We might have to wait a day to apply, but we can still browse through plans. And scheduled maintenance is few and far between.\u201d\n\nIt is a service that will benefit someone like Jessica Lambert, a 27-year-old emergency room nurse, who lost her benefits when she scaled back to part-time in order to devote time to pursuing a new career in the real estate industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had to go out and get my own insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cI always got it through work. This is a new experience for me.\u201d\n\nShe is anxious to sit down and find a plan that suits her needs; her work has impressed upon her the great value of being insured.\n\n\u201cI see what can happen\u2026 I see major, major injuries working in a trauma center,\u201d she said. \u201cUnexpected things, car accidents, random accidents \u2013 I know how important insurance is.\u201d\n\nSantora shares that perspective.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a family physician,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the downside of not having insurance and delaying healthcare\u2026 most doctors have similar war stories about people who haven\u2019t had health insurance and delayed seeking care because they didn\u2019t have access to it.\u201d\n\nTake steps\u2026\n\nCall BCHD at (310) 374-3426 ext. 256 to schedule an appointment on any business day between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Bring with you to your appointment the following: social security numbers, recent income tax filings and, if applicable, legal immigration information or information related to your status as a member of a federally recognized tribe.\n\nFor more information about appointments, visit www.bchd.org.
