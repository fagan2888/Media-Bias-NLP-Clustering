This isn\u2019t hate.\u201d\n\nScott Hudson said that he wanted people to understand that he was not part of a \u201chate group.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery bit of this is about respect an honor for our ancestors and the nation that they built, the grounds that they bled red for us,\u201d Hudson insisted. \u201cAll of our heritage relies on us being united and staying strong, always and forever. Being with each other, whether you are white, black, Korean, Asian, Chinese.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t matter, we are all brothers under God\u2019s eyes,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is God\u2019s country. This is not yours or mine. It\u2019s his, and we have to keep God alive in our country.\u201d\n\nBut Hudson told WPLN that he agreed with the president on at least one point: Obamacare works.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I would love to meet the man, I would love to shake his hand, say hi,\u201d Hudson explained. \u201cTell him thank you for the Obamacare because it allowed me to get back surgery, and it helped me out a lot. And it helped my family out a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, if the man would shake my hand on national TV with me wearing this [Confederate flag] shirt, he just does not know how many southerners would start to smile at him again.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from The Tennessean, broadcast July 1, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They want to meet the President and shake his hand.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "They want to meet the President and shake his hand.", "title": "Tennessee Protesters Confront Obama Waving Confederate flag \u2014 But They Love Obamacare", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/tennessee-protesters-confront-obama-waving-confederate-flag-they-love-obamacare", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/tennessean_flag_150701c-edit-800x430.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "Tennessee Protesters Confront Obama Waving Confederate flag \u2014 But They Love Obamacare"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T17:42:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8733\"", "article_summary": "Tennessee Protesters Confront Obama Waving Confederate flag \u2014 But They Love ObamacareThey want to meet the President and shake his hand.\nGroup of protesters in Tennessee waved Confederate flags at President Barack Obama on Wednesday while praising his health care reform law.\n\u201cPersonally, I would love to meet the man, I would love to shake his hand, say hi,\u201d Hudson explained.\nIt\u2019s his, and we have to keep God alive in our country.\u201dBut Hudson told WPLN that he agreed with the president on at least one point: Obamacare works.\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure to meet the president of the United States,\u201d Martin explained."}
