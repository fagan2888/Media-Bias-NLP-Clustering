Apart from taking questions from the audience, they will also address the following questions:\n\n\n\nIs workers\u2019 compensation experiencing case/cost shifting from group health insurance to the workers\u2019 compensation system?\n\nHow will accountable care organizations and value based reimbursements impact workers\u2019 compensation?\n\n\u201cAs always, the workers\u2019 compensation community has relied on WCRI\u2019s research and analyses to keep us informed and to provide context to the content.
