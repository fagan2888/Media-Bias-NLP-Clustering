For instance, in some places, they can conduct routine physical exams and write prescriptions.\n\nAnd although most nurse practitioners and physician assistants work under a physician's guidance, in 19 states, one or both can function independently of a supervising doctor, he said.\n\nFor this study, investigators evaluated the care of heart patients seen at 130 VA facilities between 2013 and 2014. Nearly 935,000 patients were attended to by physicians, while more than 252,000 were seen by either a nurse practitioner or physician assistant.\n\nAll had a history of heart attack, stroke, arterial blockage and/or stent surgery. But all were deemed \"stable\" outpatients during the study time-frame.\n\nAll were seen in a primary care setting (rather than by specialists), and the analysis focused solely on three heart health services: blood pressure monitoring and control; cholesterol control; and statin and beta-blocker prescriptions and adherence.\n\nOverall, only about 54 percent of patients had all three measures of care appropriately handled, the researchers found.\n\n\"However, in terms of who was attending patients, we saw only small differences in the quality of care here and there, and the differences were not statistically significant,\" Virani said.\n\n\"While there's clearly a lot of work to be done in terms of improving effective care delivery for all cardiovascular disease patients, the delivery of basic services is comparable among both physicians and non-physicians,\" he added.\n\nVirani cautioned, however, that the study does not speak to situations involving \"crisis\" care. \"If patients are not stable and have any cardiac symptoms that we did not look at, we just don't know yet how they do if cared for by a non-physician provider,\" he warned.\n\nNallamothu said the VA study findings seem to support use of physician assistants or nurse practitioners in terms of typical quality measures.\n\nHowever, he added, it's not known if the study findings would hold true in non-VA settings, since the roles of nurse practitioners and physician assistants vary from state to state. That could be explored, he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThere's more on heart disease treatment at the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/general-health-information-16/doctor-news-206/routine-heart-care-similar-from-nurse-practitioners-doctors-study-698986.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/prescription_18142.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "No differences seen in basic measurements for those with chronic cardiac disease", "title": "Routine Heart Care Similar From Nurse Practitioners, Doctors: Study"}, "description": "No differences seen in basic measurements for those with chronic cardiac disease", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0edb\"", "article_summary": "For this study, investigators evaluated the care of heart patients seen at 130 VA facilities between 2013 and 2014.\nNallamothu said the VA study findings seem to support use of physician assistants or nurse practitioners in terms of typical quality measures.\nAnd although most nurse practitioners and physician assistants work under a physician's guidance, in 19 states, one or both can function independently of a supervising doctor, he said.\nWhile traditional nurses cannot prescribe medicine or provide patient care on their own, nurse practitioners and physician assistants undergo extra training that allows provision of a broader range of services, he explained.\nHowever, he added, it's not known if the study findings would hold true in non-VA settings, since the roles of nurse practitioners and physician assistants vary from state to state."}
