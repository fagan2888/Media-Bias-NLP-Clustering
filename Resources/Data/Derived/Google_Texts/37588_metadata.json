Before posting bail he will have to take care of some child support issues and other matters, officials said.\n\nCriss attempted to elude law enforcement officers after being given a signal to stop, the criminal complaint said, adding that Criss was speeding for nine blocks through a congested area.\n\nUnion City Police Chief Richard Molinari said at 7:30 p.m. Thursday officers were checking car speeds with radar at Kennedy Boulevard at 18th Street when Criss blew past them in his Cadillac Escalade at 55 miles per hour in the 25-miles-per-hour zone.\n\nWhen the officers pulled out to stop Criss, he hit the gas and headed north on the Boulevard, flying through four red lights before finally stopping on the Boulevard at 29th Street, Molinari said.\n\nUpon stopping, Criss jumped out of his vehicle and ran to the police car and the officers drew their weapons and ordered him to return to his vehicle, Molinari said.\n\nCriss later complied with the officers\u2019 orders, Molinari said, adding that he was cited for reckless driving, speeding and driving with a suspended license.\n\nOfficers also found there was a warrant for his arrest out of Essex County for failing to appear at a hearing related to child support, and warrants out of Union City and Secaucus for failing to appear at hearings related to motor vehicle violations, Molinari said.\n\nCriss\u2019 attorney, Darryl Smith of Jersey City, said he had no comment.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jersey-city,union-city", "title": "'Treach'
