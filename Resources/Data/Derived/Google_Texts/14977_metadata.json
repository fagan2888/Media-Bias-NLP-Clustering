Press) would surely be it.\n\nMore than a dozen contributors came to town for a fascinating day of panel discussions surrounding the book. As we all scrummed up at Boston College to compare genetic notes on Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntingtons, fragile X, cancer, deafness, blindness, and cystic fibrosis, my family\u2019s schizophrenia was, for once, in fine company with other writers shaped by genetic identity.\n\nPlus, it was the first time we essayists have had a chance to meet in person since last month\u2019s publication of this neat little classic in the burgeoning field of medical humanities.\n\nBecause writers tend to be an isolated lot to begin with, it felt like an interesting social experiment to see us emerge for a day of jaw boning. What we found was that, just by having personal essays in the same anthology, we automatically draw closer together. Instantly, through our mutual points of discovery, bonds were formed.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising are the many cross currents found through waters as varied as Huntington\u2019s, Tay Sachs, fragile X, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer, genetic deafness and blindness, hypertrophic cardiomythopathy, and schizophrenia. We\u2019re all more watchful than tearful, over time, looking for many of the same silent sharks that cross our bows.\n\nA natural kinship develops in all of us having some genetic \u201cit\u201d to write about. To one degree or another we write about the \u201cit\u201d of genetic mutation because, as Kelly Cupo puts it, we\u2019re interested in having those \u201cuncomfortable conversations\u201d about the \u201cit\u201d sharks.\n\nUncomfortable but oh so necessary.\n\nI hail from a clan chock full of psychosis, in addition to most of the other mental issues known to man, yet I\u2019d heard the s-word uttered but once and only once in our household before the schizophrenia came crashing back, into our generation, engulfing two of four sibs when I was 17.\n\nMy sense is that all of these writers who have said so much still have an awful lot more to say yet about \u201cit.\u201d I know I do. I feel we all have an \u201cit\u201d of one form or another; it\u2019s just that genetic \u201cits\u201d seem endlessly compelling.\n\nCommunity of Compassion\n\nIn her essay, Mara Faulkner, a Benedictine nun who heard teaches literature and writing at the College of St. Benedict/St. John\u2019s University, explores the notion of community and her family\u2019s genetic blindness.\n\nFaulkner views compassion fatigue as the enemy within that she cops to herself. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it,\u201d she writes in her essay Community and Other Ordinary Miracles, \u201cbut this comforting phrase gives us an easy out, so we don\u2019t have to look with empathy and respect at the third starving child, the third blind person tapping her cane across our broken lives.\u201d\n\nI warned you the writing was stunning. You should check out her 2010 memoir Going Blind.\n\nLavish praise is hard to believe so I\u2019ll say it again. These essays, all sixteen of them, make this anthology an instant classic.\n\nChristine Kehl O\u2019Hagan carves indelible imagery about her Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s family\u2019s long struggle with Duchenne Muscular Dsystrophy. Her prose will leave you breathless. No one family should suffer so much.\n\nMichael Downing\u2019s Life With Sudden Death: A Tale of Moral Hazard and Medical Misadventures is a harrowing account from a whip-smart medical implant survivor that could make you think twice about ever seeing a doctor again. The irony here is that the medical intervention meant to save the life of the best-selling novelist and Tufts writing professor quite nearly killed him.\n\nJennifer Rosner\u2019s If A Tree Falls: A Family\u2019s Quest to Hear and Be Heard unflinchingly examines family, science and what it means to be heard. Her experiences as a hearing person negotiating the politics of deaf culture have echoed my own in dealing with the politics of mad culture.\n\nHer training in philosophy guides her through some tricky political shoals. In an essay entitled String Theory, she takes us through assimilation issues unpopular in parts of the deaf community that feel that deaf babies are \u201caltered\u201d by technology or \u201cmutilitated\u201d in surgery.\n\n\u201cWe felt like we\u2019d stumbled through a minefield: any answer carried a prejudicial judgment,\u201d Rosner writes of weighing her responsibility as a mother with her respect for her children\u2019s Sophia and Juliet and their deaf identity.\n\nThere\u2019s no sentimentality\u2013mostly unsparing examinations\u2013and not an ounce of self-pity in this collection. I think we all bridle at the notion.\n\nThe rawness here comes from first-hand experience, the sharing of which seems to be the best nostrum for despair.\n\nThere are a fair few surprises. Some of the writers are downright contrarian. \u201cWas I suffering when I was gasping for air?\u201d asked Isabel Stenzel Byrnes, born with cystic fibrosis, and author with her recently departed sister Anabel Stenzel of the memoir The Power of Two: A Twin Triumph Over Cystic Fibrosis, which was made into a multi-award-winning documentary. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like I was suffering.\u201d\n\nFive hours a day of back-pounding treatments every day to cough up mucus was somehow not seen as suffering. That\u2019s something else.\n\nClare Dunsford\u2019s memoir Spelling Love With an X: A Mother, a Son, and the Gene That Binds Them, may be the tenderest tale of all. She takes us into her world with her son J.P., who shows acrobatic verbal dexterity, a trait not uncommon in those with fragile X. Mother and son bring out the best in each other, making the best of a bad situation with perfect charm. No BS, this is how good mothering gets done.\n\nOne brave memoir, The Gene Guillotine: An Early-Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Memoir, tells of five family members in one family struck by Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201dBeing here isn\u2019t easy for me,\u201d author Kate Preskenis told the conference participants. \u201cIt is like pulling off the scab that covers my soul. A wound that never heals, but crusts over when I leave it alone.\u201d\n\nFor the collection\u2019s editor Amy Boesky\u2013a visionary professor of literature at Boston College and author of What We Have, which explores one family\u2019s relationship with the BRCA mutation associated with breast and ovarian cancer\u2013genetic information has untold power to shape the way we see ourselves and our children\u2019s lives personally.\n\nAlice Wexler, author of Mapping Fate, uses the writing process to inform choices\u2014in her case, whether to be tested for Huntington\u2019s, an exploration that\u2019s led her into the field of disability studies. Alice, like many of us, says she has used writing almost therapeutically to let go of the rage.\n\nSeveral of us remained unmarried and childless. Some have made decision to get tested\u2014or, more often than not, to forgo testing. (There is no blood test for schizophrenia yet.)\n\nThe leading light is the legendary Charlie Pierce, who you may know as the guy who shouts \u201csports\u201d every Saturday on NPR\u2019s Only a Game and writes the brilliant politics blog for Esquire.\n\nYou might not know that his Esquire piece on his family\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s was a 1996 finalist for a National Magazine prize. Pierce expanded the feature story into his 2002 book Hard to Forget: An Alzheimer\u2019s Story.\n\nHis essay Driving North reminds us that our genetic identities evolve and change as new information surfaces around the disorder that nearly tore his family apart. There has been an explosion of research in Alzheimer\u2019s, yet thousands upon thousands do not know one way or another if they carry it .\n\nMany prefer uncertainty to diagnosis, another big theme in these essays. \u201cDo they want to know?\u201d Pierce asks. \u201cDo they want their employers to know? Their health insurance companies?\u201d\n\nHe points out that it\u2019s the uninsured\u2013not the folks on Obamacare\u2013who would become their own death panel. Pierce is angry at the way people have shanghaied the health care debate to manipulate families that know no better. We should all be.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing about these illnesses is thinking you\u2019re alone,\u201d he tells us today in a follow-up email. \u201cThe best thing is finding out that you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all still afraid of the human genome,\u201d Misha Angrist told the conference. Angrist believes, reassuringly, there may be less to fear as more pioneers make the trek into the genetic wilderness with the dawning realization that \u201conly some of what we are is genetic and that part will not enslave us.\u201d\n\nHis family suffers from no identifiable genetic disorders, but as one of the very first human beings to have his entire genome sequenced, an experience chronicled in his 2010 book Here Is a Human Being: At the Dawn of Personal Genomics, he\u2019s the best possible lookout.\n\nSo run, do not walk, to purchase The Story Within today Amazon.
