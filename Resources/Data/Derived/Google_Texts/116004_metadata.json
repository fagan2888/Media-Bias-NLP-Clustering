Jesse Jackson was one of many Apple stockholders who showered CEO Tim Cook with praise Friday during the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\n\nCook has led Apple\u2019s defiance of an FBI court order directing the company to help unlock an iPhone used by one of the people who opened fire on a holiday party last year in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhere we stand in times of controversy is a measure of our character,\u201d said the longtime civil rights leader. \u201cSome leaders only follow opinion polls. Others stand up for their principles, refuse to compromise, and mold opinion. We have such a leader of Apple, Tim Cook.\u201d\n\nThe Apple chief received a standing ovation when he took the stage on Friday before even starting his speech.\n\nIn his remarks, though, Cook only touched briefly on his company\u2019s standoff with the FBI.\n\nThe bureau is asking Apple to create software to disable a failsafe feature that triggers the phone to wipe its own memory after 10 failed attempts to enter the pass code. Such a change would allow investigators to hack into the phone.\n\nApple \u2014 backed by other tech companies and privacy advocates \u2014 has characterized such software as a \u201cback door\u201d that hackers could use to crack into other iPhones. Complying would also set a dangerous precedent, the company argues, allowing the FBI to ask for more help hacking phones in future cases.\n\n\u201cWe do these things because they are the right things to do,\u201d Cook said, according to The New York Times. \u201cBeing hard doesn\u2019t scare us.\u201d\n\nJackson, who ran for president twice in the 1980s, lauded Cook\u2019s stance, calling him \u201ca man of integrity and character.\u201d\n\nThe onetime shadow senator for the District of Columbia tied Apple\u2019s fight back to the government\u2019s surveillance overreach during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n\n\u201cI recall the FBI wiretapping of Dr. King and the civil rights and black movements and organizations,\u201d said Jackson, who served as an adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cWe cannot go down this path again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we oppose terrorism \u2013 terrorism, both domestic and global \u2013 and we mourn the loss of life from the deadly assault unfolded in San Bernardino,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we oppose the unprecedented government overreach that threatens the civil liberties of all Americans.\u201d\n\nApple has not received such universal praise on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhile a vocal group of civil libertarians and tech-focused lawmakers have strongly defended the tech giant\u2019s decision, a bipartisan coalition of policymakers has called on the company to comply. Many want Congress to step in and take the issue out of the court\u2019s hands.\n\nApple on Thursday officially filed its motion to reject the FBI\u2019s court order. A hearing is scheduled for next month.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The civil rights leader called Apple CEO Tim Cook \"a man of integrity and character.\u201d", "description": "The civil rights leader called Apple CEO Tim Cook \"a man of integrity and character.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The civil rights leader called Apple CEO Tim Cook \"a man of integrity and character.\u201d", "title": "Jesse Jackson praises Apple at shareholder\u2019s meeting", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/270977-jesse-jackson-praises-apple-at-shareholders-meeting", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/jesse-jackson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-26T16:44:02-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-26T16:44-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/270977-jesse-jackson-praises-apple-at-shareholders-meeting", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-26T16:29-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "San Bernardino,Tim Cook, Jesse Jackson,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-26T16:29:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-26T16:44:02-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/270977-jesse-jackson-praises-apple-at-shareholders-meeting", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The civil rights leader called Apple CEO Tim Cook \"a man of integrity and character.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Jesse Jackson praises Apple at shareholder\u2019s meeting"}, "dcterms.title": "Jesse Jackson praises Apple at shareholder\u2019s meeting"}, "article_summary": "Jesse Jackson was one of many Apple stockholders who showered CEO Tim Cook with praise Friday during the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\nWe have such a leader of Apple, Tim Cook.\u201dThe Apple chief received a standing ovation when he took the stage on Friday before even starting his speech.\n\u201cWe do these things because they are the right things to do,\u201d Cook said, according to The New York Times.\nApple on Thursday officially filed its motion to reject the FBI\u2019s court order.\nApple \u2014 backed by other tech companies and privacy advocates \u2014 has characterized such software as a \u201cback door\u201d that hackers could use to crack into other iPhones."}
