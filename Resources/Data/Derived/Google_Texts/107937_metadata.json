As a result, law firms are building bigger teams and focusing more attention on data privacy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a constant evolution that really drives a lot of new levels and methods of integration,\u201d said Ross D\u2019Emanuele, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney who works in the firm\u2019s health care practice. \u201cThat creates new legal issues constantly. \u2026 Health care reform and the resulting move from fee-for-service payments to value-based care means more information sharing among health care providers, which creates greater potential for privacy issues.\u201d\n\nFor example, a hospital and a nursing home may want to share patient information to help identify problems early on to prevent the patient from having an emergency that sends him or her the hospital, but they\u2019re limited by HIPAA regulations on what can be shared, D\u2019Emanuele said.\n\n\u201cWe have these competing interests,\u201d said Andresen, who last month joined the Minneapolis firm Nilan Johnson Lewis, where she specializes in data privacy matters.\n\nHIPAA security and privacy rules HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, provided national standards for protecting health information at a time when the health care industry was starting to move away from paper processes and rely more on electronic information systems in light of technological advances. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing HIPAA. Privacy rule: sets standards for the protection of individuals\u2019 medical records and other personal health information by health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers; requires safeguards and limits on the disclosure of health information without patient authorization; gives patients rights over their health information Security rule: sets standards for protecting individuals\u2019 electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity; requires appropriate administrative, \u00adphysical and technical safeguards to ensure security of electronic protected health information; requires security risk assessments Breach notification rule: requires covered entities and their business associates to provide notification of a breach of unsecured protected health information Enforcement rule: contains provisions on compliance and investigations, the imposition of financial penalties for HIPAA violations, and procedures for hearings\n\nDoctors are texting patients to make appointments and sharing test results online, said Heidi Christianson, who also works at Nilan Johnson, where one of her specialties is health care regulation and governance.\n\nAnd now, instead of mainframe computers, data are kept on laptops or other portable devices or sometimes not kept by the owner at all but by another company in a separate location with the help of cloud computing. The lack of information control can lead to breaches, sometimes inadvertent.\n\nIn March, North Memorial Health Care agreed to pay $1.55 million to settle charges that it violated federal health privacy law in connection with the 2011 theft of a laptop computer that contained patient data.\n\nData breaches are a common threat that many health care companies have learned to treat as a priority in recent years. There were 1,673 reported data breaches in 2015, which resulted in more than 707 million records being compromised worldwide, according to information collected in the Breach Level Index. The health care industry led all sectors, accounting for 22 percent of all data breaches.\n\nIn the Alaris incident, Andresen was able to help the company confirm that its policies and practices were correct for data privacy and security, but the review did identify a technological improvement that would allow the management firm to respond better to a future investigation and give the company the ability to isolate and address a possible breach down to a specific case.\n\n\u201cWe initiate Kate\u2019s services even on fairly simple incidents to ensure that we are correctly handling these incidents and mitigating risk to all parties,\u201d said Alaris\u2019 CEO Marijo Storment, in a statement stressing the firm\u2019s commitment to privacy and security.\n\nThe health care team at Nilan Johnson Lewis has grown 30 to 50 percent in the last few years to respond to the increase in business from clients, Christianson said.\n\nThe firm has increasingly conducted risk assessments for clients\u2019 privacy and security protections and also helps draft agreements and policies with third-party vendors.\n\nAt Dorsey & Whitney, the firm not only has health care attorneys but it also founded Dorsey Health Strategies, a consultancy that provides business advisory and regulatory services to health care clients, such as how to use big data.\n\nD\u2019Emanuele said it\u2019s important for law firms to provide services that \u201cactualize the legal advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe try to find ways that we can add value on both sides,\u201d he said.\n\nLaw firm Fredrikson & Byron also has a consulting subsidiary, Fredrikson Healthcare Consulting, that is based in Minneapolis. That is in addition to the local office\u2019s team of health care lawyers.\n\nBriar Andresen, a shareholder at Fredrikson & Byron who primarily provides services related to health care, data protection and compliance, said she spends a great deal of her time on helping clients with privacy issues.\n\nPart of the push by clients to address privacy concerns is due to recent increased HIPAA enforcement efforts by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Briar Andresen said. In March, the OCR announced the second phase of its audit program that will entail review of policies and procedures adopted by HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates.\n\n\u201cNow we are seeing a lot more enforcement of it, which always makes people care a lot more about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we can expect more of the same with OCR continuing to wield a big stick on the enforcement side of it.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @nicolenorfleet", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies are enlisting law firms to help them navigate reform and privacy issues.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Companies are enlisting law firms to help them navigate reform and privacy issues.", "title": "Health care changes keep Minnesota lawyers busy", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-law-firms-growing-health-care-businesses/379407251/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_146318807240148.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_146318807240148.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Companies are enlisting law firms to help them navigate reform and privacy issues.", "title": "Health care changes keep Minnesota lawyers busy", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-law-firms-growing-health-care-businesses/379407251/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_146318807240148.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_146318807240148.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "data breach"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "health care,data breach"}, "article_summary": "That is in addition to the local office\u2019s team of health care lawyers.\nAt Dorsey & Whitney, the firm not only has health care attorneys but it also founded Dorsey Health Strategies, a consultancy that provides business advisory and regulatory services to health care clients, such as how to use big data.\nData breaches are a common threat that many health care companies have learned to treat as a priority in recent years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a constant evolution that really drives a lot of new levels and methods of integration,\u201d said Ross D\u2019Emanuele, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney who works in the firm\u2019s health care practice.\nThe health care industry led all sectors, accounting for 22 percent of all data breaches."}
