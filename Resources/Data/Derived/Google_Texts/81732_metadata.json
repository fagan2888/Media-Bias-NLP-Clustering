Don't miss your opportunity to find out how much you could save on your health insurance.\"\n\nBataille says technicians worked over the three-day Veteran\u2019s Day weekend to add more data storage and to make software fixes that \u201caddressed dozens of outstanding issues.\u201d These have \u201cenhanced the user experience,\u2019 she says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that ... their experience will be a positive one.\"\n\nHealthCare.gov, the centerpiece of health reform efforts under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, fell apart as soon as it went live on Oct. 1. It was supposed to be a seamless, online system to allow people to comparison shop for health insurance policies, contrasting prices, and checking right away to see if they qualified for a generous federal government subsidy to buy a plan.\n\n\n\nIt has to take in details of a person\u2019s income and employment, connect with state insurance regulators and various insurance companies, as well as the Internal Revenue Service to check income, the Department of Homeland Security to check for legal residency, and various other government departments.\n\nSeveral different contractors put together parts of the system and when it went online, the parts didn\u2019t work together. The result: Hardly anyone managed to sign up, critics said \u201cI told you so\u201d and Congress launched several investigations.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has promised to fix it and appointed his new chief economic adviser, a management expert named Jeff Zients, to lead the repair effort. It\u2019s on track to be running smoothly for \u2018the vast majority of users\u201d by the end of the month, Bataille says.\n\nIn the meantime, people can keep trying. This week, CMS will send out 275,000 emails. \u201cThose are the individuals that were stuck in that initial enrollment period trying to create their accounts,\u201d she says.\n\nThey'll be told it's safe to try again. \"In the last several days, we've made a number of upgrades to resolve issues like the one you may have encountered with our system -- and hundreds of thousands of Americans have successfully created accounts since the Marketplace opened,\" the email reads.\n\n\"Note: It may take a few minutes for pages to load. If this happens, it may help to clear your browser\u2019s history and cache, close the browser completely, and try again,\" it cautions. \"Thanks for your patience. We're committed to making sure you get the quality, affordable coverage you need.\"\n\nFederal officials say they\u2019ll release their first estimates of how many people have managed to sign up on Healthcare.gov by the end of this week. They have tried to lower expectations.\n\n\"I can tell you our early enrollment numbers will be very low,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last week when she testified before a Senate committee.\n\n\n\nThe federal government is running the exchanges in 34 states. The rest are either running their own, or are getting federal help in operating one.\n\nOne analysis showed that 49,000 people had signed up in 12 of the states that have been running their own online exchanges. New York, one of the biggest states, said Tuesday it has signed up nearly 50,000 people.\n\n\u201cSince October 1st, 48,162 New Yorkers have enrolled in and 197,011 New Yorkers have completed the full application process and been determined eligible for low-cost health insurance plans,\u201d the state department of health said in a statement.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has forecast that about 7 million people should sign up for health insurance on the state and federal exchanges by next year. Another 9 million or so should newly qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance plan for low income people, in states that have opted to expand the benefit.\n\nMore than 40 million Americans \u2014 15 percent of the population \u2014 don\u2019t have health insurance now.\n\n\u00b7 Follow NBCNewsHealth on Facebook and on Twitter\n\n\u00b7 Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is sending out emails starting Tuesday to invite 275,000 people who failed to enroll at the new health insurance website to try again.The HealthCare.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/come-back-healthcare-gov-feds-urge-2D11577468", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/__new/nn_04pa_obamacare_131112.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The federal government is sending out emails starting Tuesday to invite 275,000 people who failed to enroll at the new health insurance website to try again.The HealthCare."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The federal government is sending out emails starting Tuesday to invite 275,000 people who failed to enroll at the new health insurance website to try again.The HealthCare.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/__new/nn_04pa_obamacare_131112.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Come back to HealthCare.gov, feds urge those seeking insurance - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-12", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/come-back-healthcare-gov-feds-urge-2D11577468", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23dd\"", "article_summary": "Don't miss your opportunity to find out how much you could save on your health insurance.\"\nMore than 40 million Americans \u2014 15 percent of the population \u2014 don\u2019t have health insurance now.\nThe Congressional Budget Office has forecast that about 7 million people should sign up for health insurance on the state and federal exchanges by next year.\nAnother 9 million or so should newly qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance plan for low income people, in states that have opted to expand the benefit.\n\u201cSince October 1st, 48,162 New Yorkers have enrolled in and 197,011 New Yorkers have completed the full application process and been determined eligible for low-cost health insurance plans,\u201d the state department of health said in a statement."}
