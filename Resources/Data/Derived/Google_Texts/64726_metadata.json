Now imagine this friend happens to be a doctor, and she\u2019s your doctor. Since she\u2019s your bestie, she lets you swing by the office for impromptu visits. She emails you, she patiently answers all your questions even if it takes an hour, and she encourages you to call her personal cell \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s cool, I promise!\u201d \u2014 even on Sunday morning when she\u2019s at the farmers market.\n\nThis is concierge medicine. It\u2019s a growing niche of health care that provides longer office visits, customized treatment and 24/7 access to your doctor. The term itself might be misleading, as the word concierge has the whiff of the upper crust, suggesting white-gloved servants, $9 bottled water and vaguely European accents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like the name concierge medicine because it connotes this elitist mentality,\u201d says Michael Tetreault, the editor-in-chief of Concierge Medicine Today. \u201cWe hear things like, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s the expensive care. That\u2019s what Paris Hilton and the celebrities get.\u2019 Nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nThe average cost of a concierge plan \u2014 which, to clarify, is not comprehensive insurance \u2014 is roughly $150 a month, paid directly to the doctor. According to Tetreult, half of the patients have a household income of less than $100,000, and top-level executives account for less than 3 percent of the members.\n\nRoughly 5,500 doctors practice concierge medicine with an estimated 1.5 million patients nationwide. Why so few? Tetreault chalks it up to a PR problem. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s affordable, that it\u2019s not just for the rich.\u201d And they can be hard to find: In more rural areas like South Dakota or Mississippi, sometimes only a handful of doctors serve an entire state. And while critics question its basic fairness \u2014 Are the rich getting healthier while the poor get sicker? \u2014 concierge doctors say they can now spend more time helping patients, less time mucking with paperwork, and they point to new studies suggesting it can actually lower the cost of health care.\n\nHamster-wheel medicine\n\nCrowded lobbies, long waits and squabbles over insurance followed by 6-minute visits while the doctor skims your file and tries to remember your name: These are the standard complaints of most patients, and things are just as bad for many physicians, who are practicing what Tetreult calls hamster-wheel medicine.\n\nTake Dr. Kristine Burke, who had a traditional practice in Sacramento for 13 years. \u201cThat old model is based on higher volume, more patients. As time went on, I became increasingly frustrated with the lack of time to really help people change their health,\u201d she says. Then, in 2009, she attended a conference for the American Academy of Private Physicians (AAPP). She saw it as a game-changer. \u201cI was in a room of happy, satisfied, passionate doctors. It was a novel experience.\u201d She made the switch and hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nSome doctors are switching as a matter of necessity.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see a patient in five or six minutes. That\u2019s just impossible if you\u2019re really going to do your job,\u201d says Dr. Marcy Zwelling, who practices in Los Alamitos and goes by Dr. Z. \u201cI was constantly behind; it was almost a running joke. When I saw a patient at midnight \u2014 it was the only time that I could see her, and I had to see her because her nephew had just committed suicide \u2014 it was clear that I couldn\u2019t do my job. Patients weren\u2019t getting the care they needed.\u201d She then overhauled her practice, slashing her patient list from 4,000 to 500.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of Andy Griffith-style medicine, the doctor had a clinic in the local town. It\u2019d be strange for him to say, \u2018What kind of insurance does Opie have?\u2019\u201d Michael Tetreault, editor in chief, Concierge Medicine Today\n\nVisits are longer. The waits are shorter. This gives physicians like Dr. Burke the bandwidth to personally field phone calls from patients \u2014 even on a Saturday night. Skeptical, I asked Dr. Burke if it was really (really?!?) OK to call her on the weekend.\n\nAdmittedly, she says the idea of allowing patients access to her cell phone number scared her at first. \u201cBut because you have a small number of patients and you know them very well, we\u2019re able to take care of almost everything during business hours, since we have time to address them and we have a relationship. So they don\u2019t want to bother me unless it\u2019s important, and if it\u2019s important, I want to hear about it.\u201d When a patient called her recently on the weekend about a urinary tract infection, she was happy to get the call because she could immediately diagnose the problem and prescribe treatment.\n\nBut how will this impact the overall health care market? The industry is already pinched by a shortage of primary care physicians, and when a doctor guts his roster from 4,000 to 500, what happens to the other 3,500? Tetreault says that the impact is unlikely to result in a mass of untreated patients, as 85 percent of concierge doctors also take traditional insurance. So the only affected patients are from the 15 percent of concierge doctors who switch entirely (fewer than 1,000 have done so), a small enough figure that, according to Concierge Medicine Today, it can be absorbed by standard providers. Still, critics wonder if this exacerbates a divide between the healthy and the sick, the rich and the poor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a concierge kind of guy. If I were to join, how many of my patients would lack the resources to join me?\u201d wrote Dr. Steve Dudley in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019d have to leave Ann Marie behind. She has a developmental delay and has been my patient ever since I started in practice. I\u2019d leave the scores of young adults who are just starting out in their careers and find it a stretch to come up with their co-pays.\u201d\n\nTo be blunt, are doctors just switching to concierge medicine so that they can work cushier hours and make more money? Dr. Zwelling says she actually makes less money with concierge medicine. \u201cMy marketplace is absolutely middle class,\u201d she says. She priced her plan by calculating the number of patients she could see in a year, allowing time for at least one annual 90-minute session, and then worked backward to arrive at $125/month. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the same business strategy. We don\u2019t nickel and dime. Patients pay once, and that\u2019s it. And they can see me whenever they want.\u201d\n\nDr. Chris Ewin, a Texas-based concierge advocate, bristles at the notion that he only serves the rich. He says many of his patients are unemployed or blue-collar workers and that, in some ways, his services can prove more affordable than other alternatives. \u201cI have a patient who had a Vicodin addiction, and he spent $50 a day on his drug habit and he worked at Taco Bell,\u201d he says. \u201cNow his addiction is gone, and I only charge him $5 a day. I had someone come in \u2014 an immigrant \u2014 who mows lawns for a living. He has diabetes. He looked at me and said, \u2018Wait, all I have to do is mow two lawns a month, and I can call the doctor all I want?\u2019\u201d\n\nConcierge medicine may prove fiscally responsible as well. A study from MDVIP, a network of private physicians, found a 72-percent reduction in hospital admissions for concierge patients and a savings of more than $2,000 a year for each concierge patient. Doctors who engage in this practice can save the economy billions of dollars, according to Dr. Zwelling, by working with their patients on preventative care, staving off serious ailments and trips to the ER.\n\nToo good to be true? Possibly. Skeptics question whether these results have selection bias, meaning concierge patients are wealthier and healthier and therefore less likely to go to the hospital in the first place. Dan Hecht, the CEO of MDVIP, says the selection bias is \u201cvery minimal,\u201d but, like most issues with health care, there is debate.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nSince concierge medicine is not insurance (it wouldn\u2019t cover a trip to the hospital) many patients combine it with a high-deductible plan. Tetreault suggests that consumers think of health insurance more like auto insurance or fire insurance; it should be used for emergencies, not the day-to-day. You wouldn\u2019t use car insurance to change your oil, rotate the tires or buy wiper blades. In the best-case scenario, the sum of the concierge fee ($150/month, for example) plus the bare-bones premiums for a high-deductible plan ($110-ish, theoretically) would pencil out to less than $328 per month, or what the Department of Health and Human Services cites as the \u201caverage\u201d cost of health care.\n\nBut is there really a health benefit to switching, or is this specialized service just pampering?\n\nAccording to Dr. Burke, the benefits can actually save lives. \u201cI now have the time to listen to a patient\u2019s story, not just hear the bullet-list of symptoms,\u201d she says. She can work with patients to discover how their life experiences impact what she calls \u201cthe web of their biological system.\u201d\n\nThis does two things: 1) It boosts the odds of catching a problem; and 2) It nudges patients toward healthier behavior. As an example, she points to the cheeseburger. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Burgers can be bad for you.\u2019 But that doesn\u2019t really change anyone\u2019s behavior. Now, I have the time to help them understandspecifically how that burger impacts their bio-chemistry. I can explain how the refined carbs in the flour of the hamburger bun set off a cascade of chemical signals that make your cells more resistant to insulin which, in turn, leads to diabetes. Now that means something.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the benefit of what Dr. Ewin calls fine-tuning, working with a patient to make incremental changes to their blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol. And when something bigger comes up, the concierge doctor can tap into her connections and route patients to the right specialist.\n\n\u201cI had a 12-year-old with a thyroid nodule who needed surgery. It was just a phone call for me to get her into the surgeon,\u201d Dr. Ewin says. \u201cOtherwise, it could have taken forever \u2014 and it was a mass that could have been cancerous.\u201d\n\nWhen I called Dr. Ewin\u2019s office, I was charmed to find that his outgoing voicemail includes his cell number. He views his accessibility as the potential difference between life or death. \u201cThey\u2019ve got their best friend on the phone when they call me. And if something comes up and they don\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll say, \u2018What are you doing?! If you called me the first day you saw symptoms, I could have treated you!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Future is The Past\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s the Affordable Care Act. While the jury is still out on whether the overall cost of health care will rise or fall as a result of the ACA, there seems to be consensus that some patients, at the very least, will see a rise in premiums. If this is the case, then concierge medicine might look more appealing by contrast. Tetreault is already seeing that impact, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve found that since Obamacare, so many more patients are looking for an alternative to their current way of insurance. They\u2019re finding that their employer plans are too expensive, so they would rather find a high-deductable option at considerable savings. Given this dynamic, Concierge Medicine Today predicts the annual growth rate to be somewhere between 7 to 15 percent.\n\nIn a sense, concierge medicine is simply a throwback to a bygone era. Look at health care before the 1960s, when doctors toted stethoscopes and actually paid house calls. \u201cThis is not a new concept of medicine. It\u2019s more of an old-fashioned medicine brought into a modern marketplace,\u201d says Tetreault. \u201cWhen you think of Andy Griffith-style medicine, the doctor had a clinic in the local town. It\u2019d be strange for him to say, \u2018What kind of insurance does Opie have?\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Comstock's magazine", "description": "How concierge medicine is changing the health care marketplace", "title": "Convenient Care - Comstock's magazine", "url": "http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/convenient-care", "image": "http://www.comstocksmag.com/sites/main/files/imagecache/medium/main-images/0414_health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "umVpM1cBr-I5rMMhPezFzbIn0D4VT8Q78uD5_x_ctvQ", "msvalidate.01": "62E808F8EECF5694F9DD5332F07E0E03", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4af\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t like the name concierge medicine because it connotes this elitist mentality,\u201d says Michael Tetreault, the editor-in-chief of Concierge Medicine Today.\nGiven this dynamic, Concierge Medicine Today predicts the annual growth rate to be somewhere between 7 to 15 percent.\nTetreault suggests that consumers think of health insurance more like auto insurance or fire insurance; it should be used for emergencies, not the day-to-day.\nIf this is the case, then concierge medicine might look more appealing by contrast.\nDan Hecht, the CEO of MDVIP, says the selection bias is \u201cvery minimal,\u201d but, like most issues with health care, there is debate."}
