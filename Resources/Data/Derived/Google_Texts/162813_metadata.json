He has long been a proponent of a single-payer health care system, which can be simply described as government-funded health care. The United States already has a limited form of single payer health care through Medicare.\n\nThere is a lot to be excited about in Sanders\u2019 proposed health care plan. The most exciting part of this plan is the idea that the U.S. could finally have universal healthcare. Virtually all of the developed world has universal health care, even Cuba.\n\nSanders\u2019 plan is a combination of tax reform and Medicare expansion. The plan heavily taxes people making over $250,000 and closes some very important loopholes, including a long overdue tax on capital gains. As for the middle class, nothing comes for free. A 2.2 percent income tax would all be imposed on middle-class citizens, which really isn\u2019t that bad. Someone making $50,000 would pay $1,100 for a year of health care. Forbes is projecting the average American will spend about $10,000 a year on health care under the current system.\n\nThe U.S. is so far behind the times when it comes to healthcare, it\u2019s nauseating. The great U.S. spends the most out of any country on health care, according to a USA Today report. Even though we are outspending every other country in the world, Time ranked the U.S. dead last in health care quality among developed nations. I really wish I could say that Sander\u2019s health care reform is going to be the saving grace for our country's embarrassing health care system, but I just don\u2019t see that happening.\n\nMedicare for all is really what this country needs. There\u2019s no hiding the fact that a Medicare for all plan would cost a lot, but what people don\u2019t seem to realize they are currently spending so much more than the rest of the world. The words \u201ctax increase\u201d turn people inside out, but they really shouldn\u2019t. Taxes are no different than buying a service, and universal health care would be just another service, only this one guarantees everyone quality health care.\n\nThe plan would give all Americans health coverage, but it just doesn\u2019t seem likely Congress will jump on board. Barring a dramatic flip to a Democrat-controlled Congress, Berniecare is doomed to failure.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://www.westernherald.com/opinion/article_655c341c-cc21-11e5-b21d-17dd074b83b7.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Western Herald", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is known for his passionate speaking and his democratic socialist views.", "title": "Opinion: Sanders\u2019 universal healthcare plan is a pipe dream"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WesternHerald", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is known for his passionate speaking and his democratic socialist views.", "fb": {"app_id": 895455503839051}, "keywords": "bernie sanders,universal healthcare,politics,2016 election,2016 presidential race,alexander farr,opinion,national_issues", "news_keywords": "bernie sanders,universal healthcare,politics,2016 election,2016 presidential race,alexander farr,opinion,national_issues"}, "article_summary": "He has long been a proponent of a single-payer health care system, which can be simply described as government-funded health care.\nTaxes are no different than buying a service, and universal health care would be just another service, only this one guarantees everyone quality health care.\nThere is a lot to be excited about in Sanders\u2019 proposed health care plan.\nVirtually all of the developed world has universal health care, even Cuba.\nThe United States already has a limited form of single payer health care through Medicare."}
