Former Democratic Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear is criticizing Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and the Obama administration for negotiating in private as Bevin seeks to replace the state's expanded Medicaid program.

Beshear sent a letter to Bevin and federal Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Monday demanding that they "pull back the curtain" and "stop the back room deals" as Bevin seeks a federal waiver for Kentucky's expanded Medicaid program.

Beshear expanded the program while he was governor under the federal Affordable Care Act. Bevin says the program is too expensive and needs to be replaced. He has had several meetings with Burwell and plans to announce his plan this summer.

The governor's office says it is meeting with advocates and the plan will have a public vetting process.
