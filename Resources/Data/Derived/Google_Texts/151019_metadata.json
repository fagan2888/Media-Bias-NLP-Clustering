In essence, he sort of let himself have it.\n\nShe got the opportunity to talk to Trump recently. She chose to open the conversation by letting him know that his recent attack on Heidi Trump had lost him her sister\u2019s vote. Trump responded by admitting, for once, he actually made a mistake:\n\n\u201cYeah, it was a mistake,\u201d he said, sounding a bit chastened. \u201cIf I had to do it again, I wouldn\u2019t have sent it.\u201d\n\nShe continued to press him on topics that related to women. She brought up his recent remarks on \u201cpunishment\u201d for women who would seek out an abortion if it were illegal and his flip-flops on the issue, too. And there was kind of an amazing moment when Trump just outright tried to change the subject when asked a pretty big abortion question:\n\nGiven his draconian comment, sending women back to back alleys, I had to ask: When he was a swinging bachelor in Manhattan, was he ever involved with anyone who had an abortion? \u201cSuch an interesting question,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s your next question?\u201d\n\nShe brought up his poor poll numbers among women, and got him to admit that maybe Corey Lewandowski should have probably apologized to Michelle Fields.\n\nInterestingly, her subtle characterization of him in the interview said a lot. She wrote that he \u201cmurmured\u201d an answer. She described some of the things he said as having a tone of self-deprecation. She called him subdued. In the seemingly endless profiles and thinkpieces inspired by Trump, this one stands relatively alone in creating a human character free of bombast or scorn, all thanks to the deliberate word choices of Dowd, who ended the piece by calling on Trump to finally act presidential.\n\nRead the entire thing here.\n\n[image via Twitter]\n\nFor more from Lindsey, follow her on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an op-ed for The New York Times called \"Trump Does It His Way,\" Maureen Dowd really let Donald Trump have it, but merely by detailing a conversation they had", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-02-at-4.13.29-PM-650x438.jpg", "title": "Trump Finally Admits a Mistake, Dodges Big Abortion Question in Maureen Dowd Interview"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an op-ed for The New York Times called \"Trump Does It His Way,\" Maureen Dowd really let Donald Trump have it, but merely by detailing a conversation they had.", "title": "Trump Finally Admits a Mistake, Dodges Big Abortion Question in Maureen Dowd Interview", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-02-at-4.13.29-PM-650x438.jpg", "creator": "@lindseydawn_", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2016-04-02T16:14:03+00:00", "keywords": "election 2016,online,print", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In an op-ed for The New York Times called \u201cTrump Does It His Way,\u201d Maureen Dowd really let Donald Trump have it, but merely by detailing a conversation they had.\nTrump responded by admitting, for once, he actually made a mistake:\u201cYeah, it was a mistake,\u201d he said, sounding a bit chastened.\nShe chose to open the conversation by letting him know that his recent attack on Heidi Trump had lost him her sister\u2019s vote.\n\u201cIf I had to do it again, I wouldn\u2019t have sent it.\u201dShe continued to press him on topics that related to women.\nShe brought up his recent remarks on \u201cpunishment\u201d for women who would seek out an abortion if it were illegal and his flip-flops on the issue, too."}
