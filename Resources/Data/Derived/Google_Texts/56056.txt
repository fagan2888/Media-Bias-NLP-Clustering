Agbogbloshie, a neighborhood of Accra, Ghana, is where European gadgets go to die. Ghana imports some 237,000 tons of computers, cell phones, televisions and other electronics annually, mostly from Europe, making Agbogbloshie one of the largest e-waste dumps in Africa. It may already be the dirtiest. The site has earned the dubious distinction of joining Chernobyl and the industrial hub of Noril’sk, Russia, on the Blacksmith Institute’s list of the world’s 10 most polluted places. Workers at Agbogbloshie burn insulated electrical cables to recover the valuable copper inside, releasing lead and other heavy metals in the process.

“Everybody wants a laptop, wants the modern devices,” Jack Caravanos, a professor at the City University of New York School of Public Health and a Blacksmith technical adviser, said during a press conference last November. “Stopping e-waste is proving very complicated and difficult.”

The Blacksmith Institute, along with Green Cross Switzerland, compiled the new rankings after surveying more than 2,000 sites in 49 countries. The organizations estimate that toxic pollution threatens the health of more than 200 million people in the developing world.
