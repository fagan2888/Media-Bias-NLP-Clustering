A new poll shows a staggering 64 percent of voters in the most competitive 2014 elections believe America is “out of control” and are concerned mostly about terrorism, Ebola, and partisanship in Congress.

The Politico poll published Monday questioned voters in the most contentious districts of the midterm elections. 50 percent said the nation is “off on the wrong track,” while only 20 percent said the country is headed in the right direction.

On Monday’s Morning Joe, co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski elaborated on Americans’ negative sentiment.

“Look at that!” Scarborough said of the poll, “America–a runaway beer truck.”

Those polled named a range of political grievances including, terrorism, health care, presidential management, and the Ebola crisis, as cause for the country’s instability.

“The atmosphere of fear and anxiety has not produced a decisive advantage for either party on the congressional ballot,” POLITICO reported Monday.

The poll also showed continued negative views of Obamacare. 57 percent of voters said they believed their personal costs would be rising due to Obamacare while only 7 percent said they would decrease.
