The honest assessment is it's impossible to tell. It's just one of those quirks in the numbers that shows how weird the data can get. Giant companies don't really move all that much because of an election. They move because of what's happening in the market.\n\nFor a real counterexample, look at healthcare stocks.\n\n\n\nThey might have seemed like an obvious loser from the government overhaul of insurance. But after the Affordable Care Act, they turned out to be big winners in the final product of the bill. UnitedHealth stock is up 264 percent from the day President Barack Obama signed the ACA into law, through Jan. 31, 2016. That makes it the second-best performer in the Dow 30.\n\n\n\nTrying to predict a good stock to pick based on the election?
