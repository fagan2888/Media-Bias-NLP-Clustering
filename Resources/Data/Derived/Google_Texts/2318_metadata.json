Marco Rubio to \u201clie\u201d his way out of his financial past.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel seconded the opinion of MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, who said, \u201cMarco just flat-out lied to the American people,\u201d about his financial past. Both contend moderator Becky Quick\u2019s questioning of the Republican candidate\u2019s previous cash problems was legitimate.\n\n\u201cSenator Rubio, you yourself have said that you\u2019ve had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally intermingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year you liquidated a sixty-eight-thousand-dollar retirement fund,\u201d Quick said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this seventeen-trillion-dollar economy. What do you say?\u201d\n\nRubio said the question was born out of a \u201clitany of discredited attacks\u201d by Democrats and political opponents. He then spoke on his need to take out student loans as a young man and the expensive nature of raising a family in 2015.\n\n\u201cI was stunned that the moderators didn\u2019t stop there and go, \u2018Wait a second, these are court records. What are you talking about?'\u201d Scarborough said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Oct. 29, Mediaite reported.\n\nThe Sentinel echoed that sentiment Saturday, saying, \u201cRubio has a string of financial messes, personal and political. And anyone who watched his record in Florida knows it. He was mired in debt, even while living a life of limo rides and travel and telling others to live within their means. Don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from court documents. And investigative reports.\u201d\n\nWho do you love? Get your favorite presidential bumper sticker here!

But last week facts became \u2018discredited attacks.\u2019 Listen, people can forgive financial pitfalls. But they don\u2019t like dishonesty,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nCNBC\u2019s line of questioning was gleaned in part by a June 9 investigative report by the New York Times titled, \u201cMarco Rubio\u2019s Career Bedeviled by Financial Struggles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe New York Times today attacked Marco because he could not afford to pay for college, arrogantly describing his student loan debt as \u2018a deep financial hole of his own making.\u2019 The attack from the Times is just the latest in their continued hits against Marco and his family,\u201d Rubio Communications Director Alex Conant said in response to the piece, Fox News Latino reported.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

The decision puts a Feb. 26, 2016, Houston, Texas, debate in limbo, WND reported.\n\n\u201cThe CNBC network is one of your media properties, and its handling of the debate was conducted in bad faith. We understand that NBC does not exercise full editorial control over CNBC\u2019s journalistic approach. However, the network is an arm of your organization, and we need to ensure there is not a repeat performance,\u201d Priebus said in a statement released last Friday. \u201cWhile debates are meant to include tough questions and contrast candidates\u2019 visions and policies for the future of America, CNBC\u2019s moderators engaged in a series of \u2018gotcha\u2019 questions, petty and mean-spirited in tone, and designed to embarrass our candidates. What took place Wednesday night was not an attempt to give the American people a greater understanding of our candidates\u2019 policies and ideas.\u201d\n\nThe RNC left open the possibility of negotiating new debate rules with the network.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "CNBC\u2019s media bias in Boulder, Colorado, last Wednesday night may have allowed Florida Sen.
