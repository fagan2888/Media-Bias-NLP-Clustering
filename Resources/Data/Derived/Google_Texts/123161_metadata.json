The clinic also provides practical advice, such as how eligible families can secure food-stamp benefits.\n\n\u201cWhen they come, they get everything,\u201d Bunik said.\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado Foundation spokeswoman Monique Bronner said the organization serves patients in a seven-state region with multiple locations throughout the area. In addition to its children\u2019s health clinics, the organization has urgent-care facilities.\n\nFunded through donations, the foundation is solely focused on advancing the mission of Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado.\n\nFor people such as Halvarson, the Child Health Clinic is a godsend. She takes Joel to the clinic every two weeks or so to make sure he\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of people call and check up on me. I love this family,\u201d Halvarson said of the clinic staff. \u201cI will never change.\u201d\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or twitter.com/cillescasdp\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado Foundation\n\nAddress: 13123 E. 16th Ave.\n\nIn operation since: 1978 (foundation); 1908 (hospital)\n\nNumber served last year: 186,277\n\nStaff: 5,000 plus\n\nYearly budget: $765 million (hospital)\n\nPercentage of funds directly given to clients and services: 100 percent", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Children\u2019s clinic provides medical help with side of family wellness", "title": "Children\u2019s clinic provides medical help with side of family wellness", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/08/childrens-clinic-provides-medical-help-with-side-of-family-wellness/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140109__20140109_A2_CD09STSCHILDRENSHOSPp1.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140109__20140109_A2_CD09STSCHILDRENSHOSPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-09T01:16:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:17:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe043c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey have awesome support here.\u201dThe clinic, funded in part by the Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado Foundation, is a past recipient of Denver Post Charities Season to Share funding.\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado Foundation spokeswoman Monique Bronner said the organization serves patients in a seven-state region with multiple locations throughout the area.\nAURORA \u2014 Little Joel Fernandez had some respiratory problems recently, mainly wheezing, so his mother, Lindsay Halvarson, took him into the Child Health Clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado.\nFunded through donations, the foundation is solely focused on advancing the mission of Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado.\n\u201cI will never change.\u201dCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or twitter.com/cillescasdpChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado FoundationAddress: 13123 E. 16th Ave."}
