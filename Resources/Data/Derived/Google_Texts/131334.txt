National Review to sue Cory Booker

Rich Lowry, National Review's editor, announced Wednesday they will be suing Newark Mayor Cory Booker along with the Newark Police Department and the City of Newark.

National Review is suing for records they have been trying to obtain related to Booker's claims that he held in his arms a dying Wazn Miller after Miller was shot on the streets in Newark in 2004.

In a post on National Review, Lowry, also a columnist at POLITICO, says their reporters tried to access documents related to Miller's unsolved murder in order to substantiate Booker's claims he was with Miller as he died.

"It should be easy to get more information about the Miller case. New Jersey is an open-records state. Yet for weeks now, we have been stonewalled and given the run-around by everyone we’ve asked for help in obtaining the relevant police records. We’ve asked nicely, we’ve asked firmly, we’ve asked in every way imaginable, but gotten nowhere. It is much easier to learn about the most sensitive aspects of top-secret national-security programs than it is to get Newark police records related to that day," Lowry writes.

"Enough is enough. Yesterday we filed suit against the Newark Police Department, the City of Newark, and Mayor Booker to obtain the records in keeping with New Jersey law. This suit shouldn’t be necessary, but the official obstruction in Newark has made it so. In such an instance, everyone should favor openness."
