Volunteers made over 100 Valentine cards, then headed to visit Ashton, Ormond and Luling nursing homes to hand out the valentines and sweet treats. The children's tone chime choir also performed songs for residents.\n\nSingers needed\n\nThe Community Chorus of the River Parishes is looking for new members to begin its 2015 spring season. The chorus, directed by Brian Martinez Jr., is open to all, from middle school age through adults.\n\nFour concerts are usually performed each season, two each in December and April/May. Rehearsals are held on the second and fourth Thursdays of every\n\nmonth, 7 to 9 p.m. at R. K. Smith Middle School, 281 Judge Edward Dufresne Parkway in Luling.\n\nNo auditions or previous experience necessary. For more information, call 985.652.0162 or email ccrpsings@gmail.com.\n\nHeadpieces win again\n\nFor several years, myself and a group of residents from Luling participate in the Muses parade in New Orleans. Our float did it again. We received second place for our headpieces. Last year, our group won first. The headpiece was in line with the theme, \"Are You There, God? It's Us.\" The piece sat on blue wigged heads.\n\nMembership drive\n\nLuling residents are invited to join the St. Charles Council on Aging Inc.
