Washington Metrorail trains were delayed Thursday morning due to â€œa medical emergency" after a young woman jumped onto the tracks at the Eastern Market station.

The woman jumped in front of a train, Metro officials said, but suffered "no visible injury" because the train operator was able to stop.

ADVERTISEMENT The Orange, Blue and Silver line trains are single-tracking between the Eastern Market and Federal Center SW stations, Metro said.

All outbound trains are bypassing the Capitol South and Eastern Market stops in order to reduce single tracking delays.

Metro encouraged riders to use inbound trains for those stations.
