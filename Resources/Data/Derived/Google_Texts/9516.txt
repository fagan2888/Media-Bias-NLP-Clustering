A vet says Pig is missing seven inches of her spine, and her joints, hips are at the top of the spine.

The mutt has gangly legs, a body that appears to have been chopped in half and no neck.

An 8-month-old dog is turning heads even though she can't turn her own. The dog goes by the name of "Pig" and is turning into a viral sensation.

Pig was adopted by Kim Dillenbeck who lives in Alabama. The mutt has gangly legs, a body that appears to have been chopped in half and no neck.

A vet says Pig is missing seven inches of her spine, and her joints, hips are at the top of the spine. The veterinarian who treats Pig said none of the vets who care for the dog have ever seen another animal with the same condition.

"I don't think Pig really knows that she looks different. She runs around, she plays. The only thing with Pig is she has respiratory issues so when she's running around, she gets a little more tired than most dogs," Dr. Rachael Hudson-Breland said.

Tens of thousands have watched internet videos of Pig online since her debut about a month ago.
