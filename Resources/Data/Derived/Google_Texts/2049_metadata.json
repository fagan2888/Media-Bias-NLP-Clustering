Jack Kingston did on Tuesday, you\u2019ll see that it has already started. The Savannah Republican earned his spot in U.S. Senate runoff by creating a flood in his coastal congressional district.\n\nIn today\u2019s Georgia Report, Tom Crawford notes that the prime casualty was former secretary of state and last tea party hope, Karen Handel. Here\u2019s some serious number-crunching:\n\nIn Chatham County (Savannah), Kingston\u2019s hometown, he won 13,988 of the 17,859 votes cast in the Senate GOP primary. Handel had 1,232 votes. That trend was repeated in counties throughout South Georgia \u2013\n\nGlynn County (Brunswick): Kingston got 5,655 out of 8,853 votes, while Handel got 994. Wayne County (Jesup): Kingston got 2,865 out of 3,651 votes, Handel 185.\n\nBulloch County (Statesboro): Kingston got 3,325 out of 4,375 votes, Handel 296. Lowndes County (Valdosta): Kingston got 3,649 out of 5,176 votes, Handel 617. Liberty County (Hinesville): Kingston got 1,132 out of 1,412 votes, Handel only got 90. Effingham County (Rincon): Kingston got 3,221 out of 4,284 votes, Handel 371. McIntosh County (Darien): Kingston got 1,520 out of 1,980 votes, Handel 117.\n\nWare County (Waycross): Kingston got 2,579 out of 3,319 votes, Handel 210. Handel ran well in Metro Atlanta, as she was expected to, but the turnout in those counties was not as robust, on a percentage basis, as the counties in Kingston\u2019s old district. She also was not carrying them by 10-to-1 margins as Kingston was down south: Cobb County: Handel got 14,682 votes to Kingston\u2019s 6,320. Gwinnett: Handel 14,625 to Kingston\u2019s 5,792. Fulton: Handel 14,221 to Kingston\u2019s 5,482. Forsyth: Handel 6,762 to Kingston\u2019s 3,005. Cherokee: Handel 6,894 to Kingston\u2019s 2,881.\n\n***\n\nIn today\u2019s Crystal Ball, Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz makes two sobering points for Democrats lining up behind U.S. Senate nominee Michelle Nunn. His first:\n\nKentucky hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, and Barack Obama lost the state by 16 points in 2008 and 23 points in 2012. Georgia hasn\u2019t been quite as unfriendly to Democratic candidates in recent years. Still, no Democrat has won a Senate contest in the state since Zell Miller in 2000, and the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state was Bill Clinton in 1992. Obama lost Georgia by five points in 2008 and eight points in 2012.\n\nBut you knew that. What ought to worry Democrats more is the nationalization of U.S. Senate races, Abramowitz writes. He linked presidential approval rating to recent Senate results:\n\nThis relationship set a new record in 2012. Ninety percent of voters who approved of President Obama\u2019s job performance voted for a Democratic Senate candidate while 82% of voters who disapproved of the president\u2019s performance voted for a Republican Senate candidate. This trend portends problems for Democratic candidates in red states like Georgia and Kentucky. Recent polls put Obama\u2019s approval rating at 44% in Georgia and 34% in Kentucky. Moreover, in midterm elections like 2014, voters who disapprove of the president\u2019s performance tend to turn out at a higher rate than those who approve of his performance.\n\n***\n\nMichelle Nunn, now the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, turned a victory lap with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed on Wednesday. These paragraphs were among those filed by our AJC colleague Katie Leslie:\n\nJust whether Reed will show similar support for Democratic state senator Jason Carter, who is challenging Republican Gov. Nathan Deal for the state\u2019s top job, isn\u2019t yet known. Reed and Deal are longtime allies, thus Carter\u2019s race puts the mayor in a tight spot. And though Reed has said he\u2019s primarily focused with his second term, having won re-election last November, some believe Reed is also eyeing a 2018 gubernatorial run. Reed said he plans to call Carter sometime Wednesday to congratulate him on his nomination, but said \u201cmy time and energy is going to be spent on Michelle Nunn\u2019s campaign because I think she can win and it\u2019s my priority to keep a Democratic U.S. [Senate].\u201d Asked whether he plans to appear with Carter at future events, Reed said: \u201cI haven\u2019t given it any thought at all. Last night, the races I cared about were Michelle Nunn\u2019s and Hank Johnson\u2019s.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIt should come as no shock to anyone, but Democrats voted overwhelmingly to support four ballot questions that reinforce their policy direction. And although the questions are non-binding, they send Michelle Nunn and Jason Carter an unequivocal message of what the base wants to see.\n\nThe biggest margin of victory, at 95 percent, was for the question of whether to raise the minimum wage above $5.15 an hour. About 88 percent of Democrats want Medicaid expanded under the Affordable Care Act to provide coverage for more low-income residents.\n\nAnd 85 percent of partisans supported creating a more independent ethics commission and amending the state Constitution to make education funding the first priority. The latter is Carter\u2019s top initiative.\n\n***\n\nWe heard Carter\u2019s spin on the election results on Tuesday: One in four Republicans who cast a ballot spurned the incumbent governor.\n\nDeal offered this take on the outcome: He earned about as much support as Carter and Nunn combined. Granted, there was a high-profile GOP Senate competition while Carter faced no opposition, and Nunn had three little-known rivals. But Deal\u2019s camp interpreted the low turnout as a clear lack of enthusiasm for the Democrats.\n\nEven with oppo, @GovernorDeal got more votes than the total number that voted in the #gadems primary. Almost double Carter/Nunn combined. \u2014 Brian Robinson (@LordTinsdale) May 21, 2014\n\n***\n\nWord that the state must shell out more than $1.1 million to Georgia\u2019s former top ethics official and her attorneys prodded Jason Carter\u2019s campaign to again call for the investigation into the governor\u2019s 2010 election machine to be reopened. From Carter\u2019s statement:\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s voters deserve to know exactly what Gov. Deal\u2019s campaign did that they worked so hard to hide from public view \u2026 Like any Georgia citizen, I think it\u2019s unacceptable that taxpayers are on the hook to pay more than a million dollars for the improper cover-up of the investigation into Gov. Deal.\u201d\n\n***\n\nA pair of Georgia U.S. House Democrats, John Barrow and David Scott, called for the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki amid the unfolding scandal about \u201csecret wait lists\u201d for vets to get health care services. The Hill has why this matters:\n\n\u201cBarrow\u2019s move is no surprise \u2014 he\u2019s the last remaining white Democrat in a Deep South congressional seat and often splits from Obama. But the angry House floor speech from Scott, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, is the first major sign that the president\u2019s party could be fracturing over his handling of the scandal.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Scott has called for Shinseki to resign. He agitated for Shinseki to go after a scandal at the Atlanta VA when an audit blamed four patient deaths on mismanagement.\n\n***\n\nDavid Perdue and Jack Kingston will have nine weeks to beat the tar out of each other on the airwaves and otherwise, but Republicans are trying to keep at least some of the negative spotlight on Democrat Michelle Nunn.\n\nAmerica Rising, the Washington-based Republican research Super PAC, has launched MeetMichelleNunn.com to highlight unflattering stories and the like.\n\n***\n\nWe imagine this will be fixed quickly. From a piece by The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball on the U.S. Senate primary\u2019s top Republican vote-getter, David Perdue: \u201cAs a testament to the swiftness of his rise, Perdue does not yet have a Wikipedia page.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn today\u2019s Washington Post, Paul Kane compares Republican Bobb Barr\u2019s second place finish in the 11th Congressional District primary \u2014 even though he still has a shot in a runoff against Barry Loudermilk \u2014 to Democrat Marjorie Margolies\u2019 loss in a Pennsylvania Congressional race, concluding that Clinton-era nostalgia fell flat on Tuesday:\n\nNeither of these races will say much about Hillary Clinton\u2019s prospects in 2016 should she be the Democratic nominee for president, but they showed the limits for those hoping to ride the coattails of this always-polarizing family into office. Margolies, 71, and Barr, 65, served as opposing sides of the same political coin, one with Bill Clinton\u2019s mug on it, and they banked largely on their connection to past glory being enough to vault them into office again.\n\n***\n\nAttention, Port of Savannah enthusiasts and press release writers: The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote this afternoon on the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, authorizing the deepening project to begin with state funds.
