The launch of the online health insurance exchange (HIX) has been plagued by multifactorial technical failures that have severely hampered enrollment across the country. The Obama administration claims that the issues that consumers are encountering are being aggressively addressed and should be corrected by the end of November.\n\nCOMMONWEALTH FUND SURVEYS HIX SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nTo gain some insight into what Americans experienced during the first month of shopping for a health plan on the HIX, the Commonwealth Fund conducted a telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of 682 adults age 19-64, who are either uninsured or purchasing individual coverage on their own and potentially eligible for the law\u2019s new coverage options, whether private plans or expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund, a private U.S. foundation whose stated purpose is to \u201cpromote a high performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d has been an advocate of the ACA.\n\nFindings of the Commonwealth Fund ACA Tracking Survey, which was conducted over a nineteen-day period, October 9-27, are as follows:\n\nQ: Are you aware of the HIX marketplace, where people who do not have a\ufb00ordable health insurance through a job can shop and sign up for health insurance?\n\n60 percent said yes, 39 percent said no.\n\nQ: Are you aware that financial assistance for health insurance is available through the ACA?\n\n53 percent were aware, 46 percent were unaware of assistance.\n\nQ: Have you gone to the HIX (on the internet, by mail, on the phone or in person) to shop for health insurance?\n\n82 percent said no, 17 percent said yes.\n\nQ: Were you able to enroll in a health plan?\n\n21 percent said yes, 76 percent said no.\n\nThose who did not enroll were asked:\n\nQ: Why didn\u2019t you enroll in a health plan or Medicaid when you visited the HIX?\n\nNot certain can afford a plan\u201448 percent\n\nTrying to decide which plan to purchase\u201446 percent\n\nDeductibles and copays were too high\u201442 percent\n\nWebsite failures\u201437 percent\n\nInformation on financial assistance or Medicaid not available\u201429 percent\n\nNot eligible for financial assistance or Medicaid\u201428 percent\n\nDesired doctors not available in offered plans\u201421 percent\n\nQ: How likely are you to go to/go back to the HIX by March 31, 2014 when open enrollment through the HIX ends, to enroll in a health plan or find out if you\u2019re eligible for financial assistance to pay for the plan or for Medicaid?\n\n58 percent said they are likely to shop for coverage, 39 percent said they would not.\n\nQ: How easy or difficult was it to:\n\nFind a plan with the type of coverage needed\u201456 percent difficult, 38 percent easy\n\nFind an affordable plan\u201461 percent difficult, 30 percent easy\n\nCompare benefits covered\u201458 percent difficult, 30 percent easy\n\nCompare premium costs\u201452 percent difficult, 37 percent easy\n\nQ: Overall, how would you describe your experience in trying to purchase health insurance through the HIX?\n\nFair or poor\u201470 percent\n\nExcellent or good\u201427 percent\n\nIS \u2018GLASS HALF FULL OR HALF EMPTY?\u2019\n\nInterpretation of these survey results is very dependent on your perspective related to the ACA. The headline that went out from the Commonwealth Fund e-Alert was: \u201cSurvey of Experiences with Marketplaces in October: Americans Needing Coverage Are Determined to Keep Trying,\u201d and the brief overview of results in that email focuses on the 17 percent who visited the HIX (116 out of the 682 survey participants), the \u201cone out of five\u201d (24 total) who were then able to overcome the website disaster and actually enroll in a plan, and the findings that awareness of the HIX was up substantially since last summer.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s the \u201cglass half full or half empty\u201d idiom, but I have a very difficult time reading anything optimistic about the vast majority of survey participants\u2019 experience into these findings.\n\nGranted, the overall numbers in this survey are relatively small and drawing statistically significant conclusions from the findings is a bit suspect. However, just looking at the raw numbers certainly should not instill a great deal of confidence in the hearts of ACA proponents.\n\n60% HAVE ISSUES WITH HIX HEALTH PLAN AFFORDABILITY\n\nAlthough the number of people aware of the HIX and its potential benefits in October was higher than previous Commonwealth Fund surveys, it is clear that there remains a very substantial segment of those eligible to shop on the HIX who are uninformed.\n\nOnly 116 of the 682 eligible survey participants visited the HIX through one or more of the available venues, and only 24 (less than 4 percent of the total surveyed) of those enrolled in a health plan. Surprisingly, at 37 percent, the website debacle was not the most frequent reason why survey participants who went to the HIX did not enroll. Affordability involving premiums, deductibles and copays were primary factors in 40-50 percent of survey participants\u2019 decision not to enroll, and over 60 percent said that it was difficult to find an affordable plan on the HIX.\n\nACCEPTANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ACA HIX REMAINS TO BE SEEN\n\nIt\u2019s been said many times in the past three and a half years that there would be some winners and some losers as Obamacare becomes the \u201claw of the land.\u201d\n\nThe disastrous roll out of healthcare.gov, the revelation that millions of Americans are losing health coverage they liked, the questionable HIX \u201caffordability\u201d for shoppers of various demographics, the preponderance of HIX shoppers in many states moving into Medicaid, the limited provider networks in available plans on the HIX, and the overarching question of \u201cwho\u2019s paying for this?\u201d continue to plague the ACA.\n\nFundamentally, the ACA is supposed to insure the uninsured, improve patient care and better manage the health of the American population. Perhaps the glass is half full, and solutions to the many problems that afflict President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law will be forthcoming in the near future. Until then, as the Commonwealth Fund survey shows, there are some significant challenges to overcome related to the acceptance and effectiveness of the HIX marketplace.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "aca,commonwealth fund,health insurance exchange,hix,obamacare,ppaca,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shopping-for-health-care-resized-600.png"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Space Coast Daily is Brevard's own social community news platform with the latest in news, articles, events, obituaries and more.
