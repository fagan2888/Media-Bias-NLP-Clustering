Among those was the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, a chain-smoking convert to Islam who once led the CIA\u2019s hunt for Osama bin Laden and inspired a character in the Hollywood blockbuster \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d All three of those men were officially undercover officers and are protected by law.\n\nThe CIA had asked the Times not to publish the names of the officials, but the newspaper declined the request \u201cbecause they have leadership roles in one of the government\u2019s most significant paramilitary programs and their roles are known to foreign governments and many others,\u201d it said in its story.\n\nIn a subsequent interview published on Lawfare, a blog about national security law, Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said the decision was about \u201caccountability\u201d and made, in part, because the drone program is a \u201cmilitary operation,\u201d even if it's run through the CIA.\n\nA \"really remarkable\u201d event had occurred, Baquet said. \u201cThe President of the United States got up and apologized for a mishap in the drone program, occasioning a story that looked more deeply at the drone program. And I think that warrants identifying the guy who ran it.\u201d\n\nThe names were also known to governments in other countries and had been on the Internet before. Outlets, including Gawker, had previously published the name of the ex-National Counterterrorism Center head, as had bloggers and security experts online.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd indicated that the agency had no role in the new letter and declined to comment on the men\u2019s identities.\n\n\u201cThe letter was written at the initiative of the former senior CIA officials who signed the letter,\" he said. \u201cWe have no comment on whether the persons named by the New York Times have any affiliation with CIA.\n\n\u201cAs a general matter, the identities of undercover CIA officers are protected by federal statute,\u201d Boyd added, referring to the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, which protects undercover officers.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The ex-agency heads \u201cprofoundly disagree\u201d with publishing undercover officers' names.", "description": "The ex-agency heads \u201cprofoundly disagree\u201d with publishing undercover officers' names.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The ex-agency heads \u201cprofoundly disagree\u201d with publishing undercover officers' names.", "title": "Ex-CIA chiefs scold New York Times for outing secret officers", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/241688-ex-cia-heads-scolds-nyt-for-outing-secret-officers", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/ciafloor_090214getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/241688-ex-cia-heads-scolds-nyt-for-outing-secret-officers", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-11T19:07-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Central Intelligence Agency, New York Times,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T19:07:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/241688-ex-cia-heads-scolds-nyt-for-outing-secret-officers", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The ex-agency heads \u201cprofoundly disagree\u201d with publishing undercover officers' names.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ex-CIA chiefs scold New York Times for outing secret officers"}, "dcterms.title": "Ex-CIA chiefs scold New York Times for outing secret officers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd113f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs a general matter, the identities of undercover CIA officers are protected by federal statute,\u201d Boyd added, referring to the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, which protects undercover officers.\n\u201cThe President of the United States got up and apologized for a mishap in the drone program, occasioning a story that looked more deeply at the drone program.\n\u201cWe have no comment on whether the persons named by the New York Times have any affiliation with CIA.\n\u201cThe letter was written at the initiative of the former senior CIA officials who signed the letter,\" he said.\nThe story identified by name three officials who have been integral to the agency\u2019s development of its lethal drone program."}
