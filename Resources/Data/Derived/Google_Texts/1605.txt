What caused more than 300 children in China’s Hunan province to test positive for lead poisoning, with levels of the heavy metal in their blood as high as three times the national standards?

It could have been the nearby chemical plant, the sort of which we’ve known have been emitting dangerous levels of pollution for awhile now. Or, as one official suggested, it could not be the factory, and instead be because “students, when they’re studying at school, they chew on pencils.” That, as Su Genlin, the head of the Dapu township government, explained, “can also cause lead poisoning.”

Quick explainer: although we call them “lead pencils” (as do the Chinese), your trusty No. 2’s are actually made of graphite, which is non-toxic. That’s because we’re not typically in the habit of giving children educational materials that could severely harm their mental and physical development (although China is, apparently, in the habit of allowing them to be exposed to such toxicants by other means).
