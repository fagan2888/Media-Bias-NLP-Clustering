That was after Ecuador and Brazil did the same last week.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Bolivian President Evo Morales declared Israel a \u201cterrorist state.\u201d\n\nLots of world leaders have denounced the violence on both sides of Israel\u2019s 3-week-old war against Hamas in Gaza.

Our situation doesn\u2019t really have any effect on them, and their action, it goes without saying, has no effect on our region.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More and more of the region's governments are yanking their ambassadors out of the country in protest", "author": "Simeon Tegel, Alex Leff and Noga Tarnopolsky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "More and more of the region's governments are yanking their ambassadors out of the country in protest", "title": "Why Latin American diplomats are pulling out of Israel", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/02/why_latin_american_diplomats_are_pulling_out_of_israel_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/israeli_tank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More and more of the region's governments are yanking their ambassadors out of the country in protest", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/israeli_tank.jpg", "title": "Why Latin American diplomats are pulling out of Israel", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why Latin American diplomats are pulling out of Israel", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bolivia, Evo Morales, GlobalPost, Israel, Jews, Latin America, Middle East, Palestine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebee\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Bolivia, Evo Morales, GlobalPost, Israel, Jews, Latin America, Middle East, Palestine, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostLIMA, Peru and JERUSALEM \u2014 Latin American nations are expressing their revulsion at the bloodshed in Gaza \u2014 and squarely pinning the blame on Israel.\nChile, Peru and El Salvador said this week they are recalling their ambassadors from Israel for consultation.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Chile condemned Hamas for launching rockets at Israeli towns, but slammed the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 bombardment of Palestinian civilians.\nBut the Latin Americans appear to be leading a diplomatic storm, flying envoys out of Tel Aviv.\nPalestinian casualties have reached 1,328, according to Gaza health authorities, while the Israeli death toll is close to 60."}
