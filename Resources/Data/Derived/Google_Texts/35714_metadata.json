Sadly, most of the writers were too uptight and dignified to comply; they wrote blah-blah-the-decades-to-come stuff. But I threw myself in with a little piece titled White Collars Turn Blue. As the title suggested, one theme of the essay was a pushback against the notion that advancing technology would mean ever-growing demand for highly educated workers; I argued that computers would take over many of the cognitive tasks we find difficult, but that human beings would continue to be wanted for jobs that require common sense, including many forms of manual labor.\n\nOr as one friend described it at the time, my thesis was that we\u2019ll always need maids and gardeners.\n\nAnd it\u2019s happening. I missed this paper by Beaudry, Green, and Sand when it was first circulated, but it\u2019s right on that issue:\n\n[W]e argue that in about the year 2000, the demand for skill (or, more specifically, for cognitive tasks often associated with high educational skill) underwent a reversal. Many researchers have documented a strong, ongoing increase in the demand for skills in the decades leading up to 2000. In this paper, we document a decline in that demand in the years since 2000, even as the supply of high education workers continues to grow. We go on to show that, in response to this demand reversal, high-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers.\n\nAn obvious implication is that belief that income inequality is all about, and can be fixed by, education is even more wrong than you thought.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150411105438, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 11, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Matter Over Mind ( 20150411 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Who needs cognition?", "title": "Matter Over Mind", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/matter-over-mind/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Who needs cognition?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 11, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1428764078, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T14:54:38-04:00"}, "utime": 20150411145438, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150411, "pdate": 20150411, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Who needs cognition?", "title": "Matter Over Mind", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/matter-over-mind/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/matter-over-mind/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Matter Over Mind", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Way back in 1996, on the 100th anniversary of the New York Times magazine, the Times had a clever idea: they asked a number of people to write essays pretending to look backward a century from the perspective of 2096.\nWe go on to show that, in response to this demand reversal, high-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers.\nMany researchers have documented a strong, ongoing increase in the demand for skills in the decades leading up to 2000.\nSadly, most of the writers were too uptight and dignified to comply; they wrote blah-blah-the-decades-to-come stuff.\nIn this paper, we document a decline in that demand in the years since 2000, even as the supply of high education workers continues to grow."}
