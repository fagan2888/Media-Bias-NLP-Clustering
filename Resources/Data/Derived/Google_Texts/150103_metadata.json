The player they left waiting on the board? Michael Jordan.\n\nThat was 30 years ago this week \u2014 June 19, 1984. Jordan, of course, was selected by the Chicago Bulls, beginning an ultra-successful professional career that would include six championships and the building of a brand that still transcends the basketball court. As the NBA Draft gets underway Thursday night, an elite handful of prospective draftees can only hope to emulate Jordan\u2019s success.\n\nJordan played his last NBA game in 2003. Ten years later, he earned a cool $90 million, according to Forbes, thanks largely to royalties from his deal with Nike. That was more than he earned in any year during his playing days \u2014 and more than any other athlete, retired or active, except for boxer Floyd Mayweather. (Fortune estimates that Mayweather will earn $105 million this year, and says that\u2019s a \u201cvery conservative\u201d approximation.) The Jordan brand now generates about $2 billion in revenue for Nike, with the 51-year-old superstar getting a cut of every sale.\n\nThat earnings power helped Jordan\u2019s net worth climb past the billion-dollar threshold earlier this month, but his ownership stake in the Charlotte Hornets is his most valuable asset. Forbes estimated Jordan\u2019s net worth at roughly $600 million and valued his ownership share of the team, which has reportedly climbed from 80 percent to 89.5 percent, at roughly $400 million.\n\nRelated: 9 Sports Superstars You've Never Heard Of\n\nJordan\u2019s legend still carries weight from the sports fan\u2019s perspective, too. In a Grey Flannel Sports Memorabilia auction that ended June 18, a Michael Jordan 1984-85 game-used road jersey \u2014 from a rookie season in which he started all 82 games and averaged 28.2 points per game \u2014 sold for $20,897 ($25,076 including auction fees).\n\nIn the same auction, a signed pair of Jordan\u2019s game-used sneakers from Game 3 of the 1996 NBA Finals sold for $14,272 ($17,126 including auction fees). By comparison, the next two NBA memorabilia pieces offered in the auction \u2014 a Magic Johnson rookie jersey and a Shawn Kemp jersey \u2014 sold for a combined $15,112.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s a well-known story in sports lore: After Hakeem Olajuwon was taken first in the 1", "title": "How Michael Jordan Made His $1 Billion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/How-Michael-Jordan-Made-His-1-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06052014_Michael_Jordan_Suit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/How-Michael-Jordan-Made-His-1-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06052014_Michael_Jordan_Suit.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It\u2019s a well-known story in sports lore: After Hakeem Olajuwon was taken first in the 1", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1d6\"", "article_summary": "The Jordan brand now generates about $2 billion in revenue for Nike, with the 51-year-old superstar getting a cut of every sale.\nJordan played his last NBA game in 2003.\nMichael Jordan.\nBy comparison, the next two NBA memorabilia pieces offered in the auction \u2014 a Magic Johnson rookie jersey and a Shawn Kemp jersey \u2014 sold for a combined $15,112.\nIn a Grey Flannel Sports Memorabilia auction that ended June 18, a Michael Jordan 1984-85 game-used road jersey \u2014 from a rookie season in which he started all 82 games and averaged 28.2 points per game \u2014 sold for $20,897 ($25,076 including auction fees)."}
