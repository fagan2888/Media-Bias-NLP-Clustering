At every available opportunity, the Tea Party-era GOP has sought to stymie the Obama administration\u2019s initiatives on health care reform, economic stimulus, the minimum wage, climate change, and immigration reform. But to hear the conservative movement\u2019s leading rabble rousers tell it, the Obama years have witnessed repeated betrayals by the Republican establishment, notwithstanding its near-lockstep opposition to every major Obama policy. With the GOP set to assume unified control of Congress tomorrow morning, right-wing shock jock Rush Limbaugh is predicting further betrayal \u2014 and in Limbaugh\u2019s demented telling, it has a great deal to do with the president\u2019s race.\n\nOn his radio program Monday, Limbaugh chastised incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his statement that his goal over the next two years is to convince American voters that electing a Republican president in addition to a Republican Congress in 2016 need not be a \u201cscary outcome.\u201d Though McConnell pledged to confront the administration on issues like health reform, energy, and the environment, Limbaugh decried the Kentuckian\u2019s remarks as evidence that the GOP will \u201cthrow in\u201d with Obama and the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think that means? That means throwing in with the Democrats,\u201d Limbaugh said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be scary. We don\u2019t want to be seen as extremist kooks. Remember, all you have to do to be seen as an extremist kook is oppose Obama, pure and simple,\u201d he added.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s broadside then took a bizarre turn, as he proceeded to connect the establishment GOP\u2019s alleged betrayals with the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to think \u2018Hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 happened than to try to tell people the truth that it didn\u2019t,\u201d Limbaugh said, referring to Brown\u2019s reported last words before he was shot and killed by Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson. \u201cIt\u2019s no more complicated than that. It\u2019s easier to fall in with Eric Garner was killed in a chokehold rather than died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital of a heart attack,\u201d he continued. Medical examiners concluded that Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold after resisting arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island, died from \u201ccompression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"His race, by the way, is a clear factor in this.
