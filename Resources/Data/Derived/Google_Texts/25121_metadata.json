About 140,000 people will get colon or rectal cancers this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and about 50,000 will die from the diseases.\n\nYet an estimated 25 million people who should be screened don\u2019t have the procedure done. That\u2019s about 40 percent of the people who should.\n\nWhy? Well, there\u2019s a lot of fear, both of what the test might show and the preparation itself, according to this 2011 survey. There\u2019s also squeamishness about the procedure, which involves insertion of a thin, flexible instrument that allows a doctor to look at the inner lining of your large intestine. Cost used to be a big issue, but the Affordable Care Act now requires that many colonoscopies be covered without cost to the patient.\n\nCleaning the colon generally involves skipping dinner and breakfast before the procedure and drinking 2 to 4 liters of a viscous liquid. It contains laxatives as well as electrolytes and various other things your doctor wants you to have.\n\nWhen faced with that, it\u2019s not hard to understand why a lot of people simply put the whole thing off. Even among people who start the preparation process, about 15 percent don\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cAll of the preps that are currently available require some combination of prolonged fasting, which we know patients hate ... and also drinking 2 to 4 liters of salty, viscous, foul-tasting liquid, or taking a pill and drinking roughly the same amount of liquid,\u201d said L. Campbell Levy, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College.\n\nThe first glimmer of an alternative way to prepare for the procedure emerged at the Digestive Disease Week conference, where Levy presented the results of a study on 10 people that involved the same generally-used laxative and a carefully prepared diet of solid foods and liquids.\n\nThe patients, aged 46 to 73, were given measured portions of cereal, pasta salad, pudding, juices, chicken consomm\u00e9, a vanilla smoothie and a pi\u00f1a colada-type drink spread across a normal lunch-dinner-breakfast eating schedule. Eight of the first 10 patients ate it all, and the other two consumed 95 percent of it. None reported bloating, nausea, vomiting or cramping.\n\nWhen they examined the patients, doctors rated 9 of the 10 cleansings good and one excellent.\n\nYes, 10 people is too small a sample to conclude anything. The researchers had intended to test 30 patients but stopped the pilot study because the success rate was so high. Next will be a Phase II study involving 80 subjects. If that is successful, Levy said, a large Phase III clinical trial would follow.\n\nThe diet-laxative combo was put together by two Dartmouth researchers and approved by the FDA. Levy believes it had not occurred to anyone to stop to assess the way preparation for colonoscopy has been conducted for decades, even as the technology of the procedure itself advanced. Now, the possibilities are at least promising.\n\nThe Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"description": "A small study suggests a replacement for the nasty cleansing that happens before the life-saving screening.", "og": {"description": "A small study suggests a replacement for the nasty cleansing that happens before the life-saving screening.", "title": "One part of your colonoscopy might become easier to digest", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20150608-one-part-of-your-colonoscopy-might-become-easier-to-digest.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-06-09T02:15:02Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-06-09T01:51:39Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"One part of your colonoscopy might become easier to digest\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20150608-one-part-of-your-colonoscopy-might-become-easier-to-digest.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2326877\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-09T01:51:39Z\", \"section\": \"Health\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-09T01:51:39Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Cleaning the colon generally involves skipping dinner and breakfast before the procedure and drinking 2 to 4 liters of a viscous liquid.\nLevy believes it had not occurred to anyone to stop to assess the way preparation for colonoscopy has been conducted for decades, even as the technology of the procedure itself advanced.\nWell, there\u2019s a lot of fear, both of what the test might show and the preparation itself, according to this 2011 survey.\nThe researchers had intended to test 30 patients but stopped the pilot study because the success rate was so high.\nWhen faced with that, it\u2019s not hard to understand why a lot of people simply put the whole thing off."}
