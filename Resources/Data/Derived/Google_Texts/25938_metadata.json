The Redskins out-gained the Eagles, 185-95, and possessed the ball nearly three times as long as the opponent, to take a 13-0 lead.\n\nThen the Redskins got outscored, 13-3, in the third quarter, as Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford connected with receiver Riley Cooper and tight end Brent Celek for touchdowns. Cooper\u2019s was a dagger \u2014 a 62-yard bomb against a hobbled Chris Culliver and Redskins strong safety Trenton Robinson wasn\u2019t playing deep enough on the play.\n\nAfter the Cooper touchdown on the Eagles\u2019 first drive of the third quarter, the Redskins went three-and-out. Rookie cornerback Quinton Dunbar hit Eagles running back Darren Sproles after he signaled for a fair catch, drawing an unnecessary roughness penalty. The Eagles started at their own 44-yard line and Celek scored four plays later.\n\nThough the Redskins were outscored 20-3 in the second half, quarterback Kirk Cousins led a 15-play, 90-yard scoring drive for the victory. Nonetheless, the Redskins\u2018 inability to adjust after halftime is concerning.\n\nIn a 24-10 win against the St. Louis Rams, the Redskins led, 17-0, at the half. The Rams scored 10 points in the third quarter before the Redskins pulled away in the final frame. On the Redskins\u2018 first drive of the third quarter, the offense went three-and-out. On the second possession, running back Matt Jones fumbled. The Rams recovered and scored two plays later on Sam Bradford\u2019s 40-yard pass to Kenny Britt.\n\nAgainst the Giants, the Redskins trailed, 15-6, at halftime, and trailed 18-6 after the first drive of the third quarter. On the Redskins\u2018 first offensive possession, they worked to the New York 34-yard line, only for Cousins to throw an interception. The Giants\u2019 next drive ended with a 30-yard touchdown to receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\n\u201cAny time that you\u2019ve been able to start the games the way we have in the first half, you want to try to carry that over into the second half,\u201d offensive coordinator Sean McVay said on Friday. \u201cCredit to some of the defenses that we played. Last week against Philadelphia, we come out with two runs. They stop us in a short-yardage situation.\n\n\u201cThey did a nice job there, but we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to create some momentum coming out of the half, whether that be creating some explosive plays or just being more efficient on first and second down so that we can move the chains and come away with points. And, obviously, we\u2019d like to come away with touchdowns. Then, some of those other situations, there\u2019s always a little bit of an individual thing and circumstance that comes up, but that\u2019s certainly a point of emphasis for us is coming out of that half with a little bit better momentum.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins have led opponents in halftime in three of their first four games.
