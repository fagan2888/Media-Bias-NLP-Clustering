Air cleansers, her grandmother calls them. Her mom lays out Robitussin cough syrup and a glass of Alka-Seltzer, substitutes for the prescription pills they can no longer afford.\n\nRodriguez was born with asthma and Middle Lobe Syndrome, which causes mucus to build in her lungs. Two years ago, her right lung collapsed; surgeons removed half. Her monthly medical bill to ward off fluids, including Pulmozyme and Albuterol, can hit $4,000.\n\nShe slipped into what policy analysts call the coverage gap. Three months before her 20th birthday, on an otherwise ordinary July day, the state declared Rodriguez independent and no longer eligible for Medicaid. Her mother, legally the head of their household, made $9,000 last year working part-time \u2014 a few thousand dollars short of qualifying the family for premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNearly 4 million Americans and 800,000 Floridians live in this limbo of patchwork health care: They are not eligible for Medicaid; they don\u2019t make enough money to afford ACA coverage. Florida, like many states that recently elected (or reelected) Republican governors, has decided not to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a result, many low-income Americans with chronic illnesses are bracing to make it work for the next four years \u2014 or simply through the day. They swap prescriptions for CVS bargains. They rely on family remedies: whiskey for a sore throat, tea leaves for asthma. They tumble into debt when an ailment demands medical attention.\n\n\u201cThey come to us with high hopes,\u201d said Santra Denis, community health director of the nonprofit Catalyst Miami, \u201cand expect to find a solution, a way to get insurance. We have to let them down.\u201d\n\nOn this December morning, Rodriguez drowns her over-the-counter medley with red Powerade. She sits at a wooden table and breathes into the plastic nozzle of a Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilator. Bursts of air and medicine open her airways. Medicaid funded the $10,000 machine. Refills, however, still cost hundreds. She often skips the recommended daily doses to extend her supply.\n\nThe sun climbs over Little Havana, creeping through her blinds, touching the poster of a white Porsche Cayenne and, above her bed, advice from her favorite writer, Henry Miller: \u201cEvery man has his destiny; the only imperative is to follow it, to accept it.\u201d\n\nHer destiny, Rodriguez believes, starts with auto mechanic training \u2014 with or without health insurance. Even if car fumes trigger asthma attacks. Even if asthma attacks send her to the emergency room. Even if a mere upper respiratory infection kept her home last week.\n\nShe quit running to avoid coughing fits. She ditched salsa dancing at the Batting Cage. She missed Art Basel, the annual Miami gallery parties.\n\nBut she won\u2019t give up school.\n\n***\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Medicaid eligibility requirements differed across the country. A low-income family could qualify for the benefit in California, for example, and lose coverage if they moved to Texas. In most states, poor adults without children did not qualify for Medicaid.\n\nObamacare sought to curb the nation\u2019s eligibility discrepancies with the Medicaid expansion, opening coverage to people earning 138 percent of the federal poverty line \u2014 and providing health insurance to millions more poor Americans.\n\nBut the Supreme Court struck down the provision, granting states the power to opt out. Twenty-seven states have since expanded Medicaid eligibility, providing no-cost care to a larger pool of low-income workers. Florida has not.\n\nDemocratic leaders say the expansion was meant to protect poor adults, who typically have no safety net unless they become parents. Republican leaders argue that it could strain state budgets and discourage people from working.\n\nThe coverage gap became a hot-button issue in Florida during last year\u2019s midterm elections. Then-gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist, a Democrat, vowed to fight for the Medicaid expansion.\n\nRodriguez, meanwhile, emerged as a reluctant symbol in Florida\u2019s Medicaid debate. In September, Crist visited her apartment, a subsidized housing unit above a public library. Her mother, Mariamee (who works part-time for minimum wage and also lacks insurance) sent him a letter about her family\u2019s conundrum: \u201cWe\u2019re too rich for Medicaid, too poor for Obamacare.\u201d (Rodriguez missed the politician for school. She had a quiz.)\n\nCrist lost to Gov. Rick Scott by a narrow margin. Scott, a conservative, publicly supports the expansion but has done little to push it through the Florida legislature. When he was reelected in November, Mariamee recalls Rodriguez saying: \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\nThat month, Rodriguez applied for disability insurance, her last-ditch hope for stable coverage until she graduates from auto mechanic training in June and, hopefully, lands a full-time job with benefits.\n\nWeeks later, she caught the respiratory infection, couldn\u2019t breathe and landed in the emergency room. The trip cost about $1,900. The antibiotics, $170. Mariamee sent the bills to the Department of Children and Families, which reopened her daughter\u2019s Medicaid through Florida\u2019s Medically Needy Program for the remainder of the month.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s day, Rodriguez lost her insurance again. Mariamee started collecting January bills to send to DCF and prove her daughter\u2019s need again. That week, the state denied Rodriguez\u2019s disability application.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they need you to be in bed, covered in tubes,\u201d Mariamee said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they need you to quit school and become a coach potato and lose any progress you\u2019ve made for this to happen.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThis afternoon is Rodriguez\u2019s first day back to class since the respiratory infection struck. Anxiety grips her: I\u2019m at least three lessons behind, she thinks. The five-pound \u201cModern Automotive Technology\u201d textbook in her crossbody satchel helps. Learning, however, clicks in the garage.\n\n\n\n2. Rodriguez builds a circuit with a classmate at Braman Motors Miami. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n\nShe\u2019s the only woman in her class at Braman Motors Miami, a partner of the Lindsey Hopkins Technical Center, and starts a year-long internship this month at a Braman dealership. Someday, she wants to open her own body shop.\n\nFor now, she works on her \u201994 Honda Civic: Beastie, a near-junkyard purchase for $1,000. She painted it matte black and installed red rims. It\u2019s not ready to drive \u2014 yet. For now, she takes the bus.\n\nRodriguez ties her dark, waist-length curls into a topknot. Mists herself with Axe Body Spray, \u201cjust like a man.\u201d Buttons up her blue, short-sleeved mechanic\u2019s uniform, which hides the tattoo over her heart: Veni, vidi, vici.\n\n\u201cStay warm, okay?\u201d Mariamee calls. \u201cCome home if you keep coughing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have your inhaler?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n***\n\nNearly 55 percent of Americans in the coverage gap work part-time or full-time, according to Kaiser data. Two-thirds live in a household with at least one breadwinner. The majority work for firms with less than 50 employees, which aren\u2019t legally required to provide health coverage. Seventeen percent live in Florida, Kaiser reported. Many earn minimum wage. Many can barely afford to pay the rent.\n\nFlorida, like most states that did not expand Medicaid, offers no assistance to people without dependent children, except in rare cases. Young adults who grew up receiving the benefit often stop seeing their regular doctors once coverage halts.\n\nWhen Crist lost in November, Catalyst Miami\u2019s Denis said, reality sank in. Floridians, she believes, will likely stay four more years in the coverage gap: \u201cWe felt defeated.\u201d She works with 400 clients monthly. Ninety percent, Denis said, fall in the coverage gap. She can connect them to charities. To free mammograms, for example. But some require surgeries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they need you to be in bed, covered in tubes,\u201d Mariamee said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they need you to quit school and become a coach potato and lose any progress you\u2019ve made for this to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the norm around here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see people who\u2019ve always gone to doctors and need their prescriptions. \u2026 They lose access to that and don\u2019t have a way to get it back.\u201d\n\nShahriar Shahzeidi, a Miami pediatric pulmonologist, has treated Rodriguez for nearly five years. Dozens of his patients, he says, live in the murky world between Medicaid and subsidies.\n\n\u201cMany are worse off than Genesis,\u201d he says. \u201cMany need a ventilator, which keep them breathing. Or maintenance on a ventilator. \u2026 There are countless needs not being met.\u201d\n\nShasehdi wrote a recommendation letter to Florida\u2019s Department of Social Security: \u201cGenesis\u2019s condition is chronic. \u2026 There is no cure. [It could] interfere with her daily life and job.\u201d He worries about patients who search for insurance without relief. He watches them fall out of jobs, into hospital beds \u2014 and into debt.\n\n\u201cGenesis is a very careful person,\u201d Shasehdi said. \u201cShe goes out of her way to avoid environmental allergens. But, I tell her, she needs to stay on her medicine. If she doesn\u2019t take her medicine properly. \u2026 Within six months, I\u2019d expect she\u2019ll lose another part of a lung.\u201d\n\n***\n\nToday\u2019s lesson in Braman Motors Miami garage: Build a circuit. Rodriguez jots shorthand instructions on her right wrist:\n\nSalt\n\nTase\n\nReady\n\nLand\n\nGround\n\nShe puts on plastic goggles and studies a printed diagram. Students in black work boots stand below an elevated PT Cruiser, fiddling with red gauge wire. Someone whistles \u201cPop Goes the Weasel.\u201d A poster on the gray wall reads: DRIVEN.\n\n\u201cWanna work together?\u201d a classmate asks.\n\nRodriguez nods. They put the wire in a vice. She holds one end in her pink glitter fingertips. He aims the soldering gun. Smoke rises. Into her nose. Into her throat.\n\n\u201cAh! It smells bad. Burnt plastic.\u201d\n\nThe coughing starts. Rodriguez forces it down. Her mind wanders to a class she missed last week. Her classmates fashioned metal into rings. She stayed home playing Kingdom Hearts.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be here when you guys made jewelry,\u201d she tells her classmate. \u201cThat would have been my favorite class.\u201d\n\nHe laughs. The urge to cough vanishes. Victory, for now. She reaches for the soldering gun. Her turn. \u201cIt\u2019s really soft metal,\u201d Rodriguez says, staring up-close at the wire. \u201cIt melts really fast.\u201d\n\nIn these moments, she forgets her lungs. She thinks about her Honda Civic, Beastie. She\u2019ll fix the push-start button soon. The cylinders next. The process, like her health-care options, will be slow and uncertain.\n\nShe will apply soon to body shops across South Florida \u2014 or get hired at Braman, if she\u2019s lucky. She will send medical bills each month to the state and hope to qualify for the Medically Needy Program. She will start sick days with Robitussin and Alka-Seltzer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some 4 million Americans are left in the cracks of our health care system, and many turn to over-the-counter remedies just to get by.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Some 4 million Americans are left in the cracks of our health care system, and many turn to over-the-counter remedies just to get by.", "title": "Treating chronic illness with cough syrup: Life in the coverage gap", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/09/treating-chronic-illness-with-cough-syrup-life-in-the-coverage-gap/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2015/01/2Gen1.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dpaqreport"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/09/treating-chronic-illness-with-cough-syrup-life-in-the-coverage-gap/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Health care, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Coverage gap, Medicaid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Health care, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Coverage gap, Medicaid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93d8\"", "article_summary": "Her mom lays out Robitussin cough syrup and a glass of Alka-Seltzer, substitutes for the prescription pills they can no longer afford.\nFloridians, she believes, will likely stay four more years in the coverage gap: \u201cWe felt defeated.\u201d She works with 400 clients monthly.\nA low-income family could qualify for the benefit in California, for example, and lose coverage if they moved to Texas.\nThe coverage gap became a hot-button issue in Florida during last year\u2019s midterm elections.\nMIAMI \u2014 Genesis Matos Rodriguez wakes at 6:30 a.m. and shuffles to the kitchen, where garlic ropes hang on beige walls."}
