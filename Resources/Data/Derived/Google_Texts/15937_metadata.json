The average number of people who worried about losing wages from 2009-2013 was higher (30%), but from 1997-2008 the average number was lower (16%).\n\nLosing hours was another concern for 23% of respondents. From 2009-2013 an average of 27% of American workers worried about getting their hours cut. The average number of American workers who worried about losing work hours from 1997-2008 was 14%.\n\nThough getting laid off was the least worried about topic for respondents, the results varied by age.\n\nYounger employees (18- to 34-year-olds) were more worried about being laid off, with 29% of younger respondents expressing concern about losing their jobs compared to 15% of 35- to 54-year-olds and 13% of respondents 55 years old and older.\n\nIn almost every category of the Gallup survey, the younger employees were the most concerned about their careers. The only category that the 18- to 34-year-olds were not the most concerned about was having their benefits reduced.\n\nThe 35- to 54-year-olds were the most worried about losing benefits, with 40% of respondents in that age bracket worrying about potential benefit loss.\n\nGet Free Updates!
