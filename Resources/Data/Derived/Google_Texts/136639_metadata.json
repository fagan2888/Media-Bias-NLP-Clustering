With this being Barack Obama\u2019s last State of the Union, the final list of V.I.P.\u2019s set to sit with Michelle Obama on Tuesday night is naturally overflowing with meaning and compelling, if not politically expedient, stories.\n\nAs such, Obama has had to choose the most poignant people with the most tear-jerking tales. In anticipation of the C-SPAN cameras panning to them upon being mentioned in the address, it doesn\u2019t hurt to be easy on the eyes, either.\n\nHere, according to a list released by the White House, are some of the beautiful people chosen by the president to comprise his human platform:\n\nAn Empty Chair\n\nThis chair will remain empty to symbolize the lives lost to gun violence\u2014accidents, murders, mass shootings, and suicides\u2014which he hopes to end by enacting reform limiting gun purchases. (Expect Fox News commentators to crack jokes about how someone forgot to attend the State of the Union.)\n\nJim Obergefell\n\nThe plaintiff in the landmark case that legalized gay marriage, Obergefell became the face of the gay-rights movement after he filed a lawsuit to be listed on his husband\u2019s death certificate as his husband.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s C.E.O. landed himself a spot in the First Lady\u2019s box for his commitment to bringing technology and computer-science programs to American public schools. The White House also highlighted the tech giant\u2019s new family-leave policies, which grants up to 20 weeks of paid leave to new parents.\n\nBraeden Mannering\n\nBy tradition, a Very Adorable Child must be in the First Lady\u2019s box during the State of the Union address. This year, the honor goes to the 12-year-old Mannering, who started his own nonprofit to address food insecurity in impoverished communities, a key part of the Obamas\u2019 Let\u2019s Move! program, embodied by a precious little boy.\n\nRefaai Hamo\n\nA former engineer, Hamo was one of millions of refugees who fled the violence in Syria. Hamo ended up, after years of turmoil and migration, in Troy, Michigan. His story landed him on the Humans of New York Facebook page, and Obama, whose administration approved 10,000 refugees to enter the United States, personally welcomed him to the country via a Facebook comment. (Several Republican governors and legislators fought against his order, saying that the State Department could not guarantee that these refugees were not secretly terrorists.)\n\nEdith Childs\n\nBack in 2008, a fresh-faced Obama would be greeted at campaigns with the chant \u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d Edith Childs is the woman who invented that unofficial slogan, and her presence at Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address brings the whole improbably journey full-circle.\n\nSpencer Stone\n\nThe Air Force sergeant was one of three American men who prevented a mass shooting on a Paris train earlier in 2015, subduing a would-be terrorist armed with an assault rifle meaning to kill dozens of people. For his efforts, he received the Purple Heart and a personal commendation from the president.\n\nCedric Rowland\n\nA navigator for a Chicago health-care service, Rowland was invited to the First Lady\u2019s box for \u201chelping Americans enroll in quality, affordable health care under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Yes, people are employed full-time to help other people choose the right health insurance. Health insurance is hard.\n\nDespite all these compelling stories, Obama will have to struggle with a public more engrossed in the presidential-election psychodrama than they are with his swan song, as well as the fact that presidents don\u2019t really see any increase in popularity due to the State of the Union address:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every guest is meaningful.
