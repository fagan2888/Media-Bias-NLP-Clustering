The table below shows the top 100 diagnosis-related groups in the United States in 2013 based on total inpatient discharges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services released the data Monday as part of a push to make the costs for these treatments more transparent. The data only includes treatments billed in a fee-for-service model and not part of any value-based purchasing model.

Click on the table below to sort by total cost and amount reimbursed my Medicare. Clicking on the green dot opens more data for each DRG.

[Also: Medicare billed $90 billion in 2013]
