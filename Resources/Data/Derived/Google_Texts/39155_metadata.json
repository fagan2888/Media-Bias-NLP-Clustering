The news tickers shout \u201cMusic Legend David Bowie Dies at 69,\u201d but that simple epitaph feels inadequate. Obituaries and tributes highlight the artist\u2019s protean fluidity, simply because there is no other way to classify him.\n\nWrite a four-chord pop song with sugary harmonies and critics will scream \u201cBeatlesque,\u201d blues it up and it\u2019s \u201cStones-y.\u201d But Bowie, alone among the boomer rock icons, remains unclassifiable.\n\nTo talk about Bowie\u2019s music, though, you need to embrace the much remarked upon transitions -- the psychedelic folk of the Space Oddity days and the nasty guitar and gender fluidity of the Ziggy Stardust period, the Philly Soul singer, the German electronica enthusiast, the MTV pop star, the industrial noise maker and, finally, the avant-jazz torch song balladeer.\n\nRelated: 2015: The Year Snobbery Died and Technology Finally Won in Movies, Music and TV\n\nAnd even if a single article could encapsulate his contributions to music, there was much more to Bowie\u2019s artistry, including his multiple film roles, many of which have been quite good. He also played in a significant role in fashion and as a public persona, a sort of icon of restless artistry forever seeking the new.\n\nBowie\u2019s fluidity is so much a part of his persona that it\u2019s written into his name. Born David Jones, early in his career he feared confusion with Davey Jones of the Monkeys and adopted the new last name, picked from the American frontiersman Jim Bowie. It\u2019s difficult to think of two more different men. During the recording of Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cTake a Walk on the Wild Side,\u201d which Bowie produced, he brought in his childhood saxophone tutor, Ronnie Ross, to play the now-iconic solo. When Ross nailed the song in a single take, Bowie went in to thank his former teacher.\n\nCurious as to who had recommended him, Bowie responded, \u201cRonnie, it\u2019s me, David Jones from Brixton.\u201d\n\nRoss\u2019 response was allegedly, \u201cHoly sh*t, you\u2019re David Bowie!\u201d\n\nHowever, for all of Bowie\u2019s reputation as a trailblazer (one thing he has in common with his namesake), it is important to note the degree to which he was actually an interpreter of the vanguard. Whether he was aping Dylan or the Velvet Underground or Kraftwerk, Bowie was rarely doing something entirely original. He was simply doing an original thing better and with broader popular appeal. And he always had the extraordinary enthusiasm of the first fan to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note Bowie\u2019s lack of cynicism about these changes. Archival footage from his Philly years shows not a man who\u2019s decided to make a \u201csoul album\u201d but a man who honestly believed that he now WAS a soul singer. When the Stones were chasing disco, fairly late in the game, Bowie was freezing his tail off in Berlin with Brian Eno and a stack of Stone Age computers.\n\nEven his MTV years (and, to a lesser degree, his 90\u2019s industrial experiments) were not opportunistic attempts to stay relevant, but legitimate interest in an evolving art form.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t trying to keep up with the kids to make money. Instead, he was trying to keep up with the kids because he was legitimately interested in what they were doing. (None of this excuses the \u201cDancing in the Street\u201d video, which remains one of the worst things ever on MTV. But I\u2019ve come to praise, Bowie not to bury him.) By and large, Bowie acquitted himself in the dawn of the MTV age with far more grace than, say, Jagger or McCartney. His videos were alive with the vibrant visuals of 80\u2019s SoHo pop art.\n\nRelated: Why the Massive Success of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Will Be Terrible for Movies\n\nAnd Bowie was always a multimedia artist. His Ziggy Stardust-era stage show was every bit as legendary as the epic album. Hollywood made use of his otherworldly appearance frequently, casting him (effectively) as a decadent alien, a modern vampire, and as the Goblin King. Christopher Nolan made him a very dignified Nikolai Tesla, lending gravitas to the moment the film The Prestige tips into science fiction. Martin Scorsese made him a very-chilly-indeed Pontius Pilate.\n\nAnd of course, there is this \u2026\n\nBowie turned 69 just last Friday. On the same day he released a new album, Blackstar, a jazzy, atmospheric creation that was showered with praise by critics around the world. Rumors of his illness had been circulating for a number of years, and sad though his passing may be, it is fitting that he would go out on a high. While others of his generation continue to rake in the cash on their greatest hits tours, Bowie proved that true immortality comes with a restless spirit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Monday mornings are already enough of a struggle without waking up to discover that so", "title": "Here\u2019s What Set David Bowie Apart", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/11/Here-s-What-Set-David-Bowie-Apart", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Bowie-Covers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/11/Here-s-What-Set-David-Bowie-Apart", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Bowie-Covers.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Monday mornings are already enough of a struggle without waking up to discover that so", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The news tickers shout \u201cMusic Legend David Bowie Dies at 69,\u201d but that simple epitaph feels inadequate.\nBorn David Jones, early in his career he feared confusion with Davey Jones of the Monkeys and adopted the new last name, picked from the American frontiersman Jim Bowie.\nBowie\u2019s fluidity is so much a part of his persona that it\u2019s written into his name.\nWrite a four-chord pop song with sugary harmonies and critics will scream \u201cBeatlesque,\u201d blues it up and it\u2019s \u201cStones-y.\u201d But Bowie, alone among the boomer rock icons, remains unclassifiable.\nWhen Ross nailed the song in a single take, Bowie went in to thank his former teacher."}
