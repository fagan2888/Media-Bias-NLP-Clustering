EDISON - The Edison police officer who asked a woman to put on lingerie for him has been reinstated by the township.

The township fired patrolman Anthony Sarni in October. Sarni admitted to authorities that he went to a hotel room in uniform and with his sidearm and asked a woman to try on underwear for him.

NJ.com reports that a request to give Sarni full pay and benefits if he agreed to stay home was denied on Tuesday.

Sarniâ€™s attorney said his client, who has been suspended since 2013, risked losing some skills and would have to go back to the police academy after three years of suspension.

A township attorney says Sarni will be retrained and returned to work if he passes a fitness test.
