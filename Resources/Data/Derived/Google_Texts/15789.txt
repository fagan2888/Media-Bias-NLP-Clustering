Before Obamacare went into effect, clinic pharmacist Stephanie Scott says many patients would fill only prescriptions they considered absolutely necessary.

"Now, they're getting more medicines filled," said Scott, who works at the Eula Hall Health Center, a sliding-scale clinic in Floyd County, Ky., that has traditionally served the uninsured. "They'll get everything that was prescribed versus just the pills they could afford before."

That's because most previously uninsured patients are on Medicaid, and a few have gotten private plans through Obamacare — which Scott sees as a positive development that should help them stay well.

But Scott is a little concerned about the financial health of the clinic where she works and its parent company, Big Sandy Health Care. The Eula Hall clinic is a federally qualified health center, eligible to receive certain federal funding under the ACA — funding Scott worries won't last forever.

"We're for the uninsured. That's who we've served," Scott said. "So we don't know what the future is going to hold."
