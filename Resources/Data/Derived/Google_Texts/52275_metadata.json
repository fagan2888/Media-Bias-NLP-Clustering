Wood, his parents and his four siblings moved into one of the housing project's 54 units after being homeless for six months. Nicholas Johnson / The News-Review / AP\n\nFor the fourth year running, the number of former U.S. servicemen and women living on the street this Veterans Day is down. Nonetheless, tens of thousands of Americans who served in the Armed Forces will be sleeping rough tonight, prompting homelessness activists to urge for \u201caggressive\u201d measures to defeat the persistent scourge.\n\nFigures from the Department of Housing and Urban Development show a 33 percent drop in 2010 and 2014, down from 74,770 at the turn of the decade to 49,933 in January this year.\n\nThe decline \u2014 due in part to an uptick in spending on housing programs \u2014 has raised hope that a problem long associated with those leaving active service could one day be all-but eliminated.\n\nBringing the figure down to zero is unrealistic, but making homelessness among veterans \u201crare, brief and non-recurring\u201d by the end of 2015 is a reachable goal, according to said Laura Zeilinger, the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s within reach. It\u2019s going to take a lot of intense focus and aggressive and extraordinary efforts, but we believe that it\u2019s achievable.\u201d\n\nYear-on-year drops in the rate of homelessness among veterans have occurred since 2010, and the overall drop is outpacing that of the wider homeless population.\n\nThe drop is thought to be largely down to the Opening Doors initiative, which President Barack Obama announced four years ago in a bid to eliminate chronic and veteran homelessness and decrease risks of homelessness by 2015.\n\nSince 2011, 66 communities across the country have already decreased veteran homelessness by more than 50 percent, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness based on data submitted yearly to HUD by communities across the country.\n\nThe decrease in homelessness has also followed an increase in spending in housing programs. Veterans Administration (VA) efforts in the area have increased home-buying by 25 percent from 2010 to 2014 in order to meet goals set by the Opening Doors initiative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal effort has resulted in a 33 percent drop in former service members sleeping rough since 2010", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/11/11/veteran-homelessnessdownbuttensofthousandsstillonstreet.html", "image": {"width": 990, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/blogs/scrutineer/2014/11/11/veteran-homelessnessdownbuttensofthousandsstillonstreet/jcr:content/blog/mainpar/textimage/image.adapt.990.high.homeless_veterans_housing.1433195918118.jpg", "height": 618}, "type": "article", "description": "A federal effort has resulted in a 33 percent drop in former service members sleeping rough since 2010", "title": "Veteran homelessness down, but tens of thousands still on street"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/blogs/scrutineer/2014/11/11/veteran-homelessnessdownbuttensofthousandsstillonstreet/jcr:content/blog/mainpar/textimage/image.adapt.990.high.homeless_veterans_housing.1433195918118.jpg", "description": "A federal effort has resulted in a 33 percent drop in former service members sleeping rough since 2010", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Veteran homelessness down, but tens of thousands still on street"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "War, Veterans, Poverty, Homelessness, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc24e\"", "article_summary": "Since 2011, 66 communities across the country have already decreased veteran homelessness by more than 50 percent, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness based on data submitted yearly to HUD by communities across the country.\nThe drop is thought to be largely down to the Opening Doors initiative, which President Barack Obama announced four years ago in a bid to eliminate chronic and veteran homelessness and decrease risks of homelessness by 2015.\nThe decrease in homelessness has also followed an increase in spending in housing programs.\nThe decline \u2014 due in part to an uptick in spending on housing programs \u2014 has raised hope that a problem long associated with those leaving active service could one day be all-but eliminated.\nBringing the figure down to zero is unrealistic, but making homelessness among veterans \u201crare, brief and non-recurring\u201d by the end of 2015 is a reachable goal, according to said Laura Zeilinger, the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH)."}
