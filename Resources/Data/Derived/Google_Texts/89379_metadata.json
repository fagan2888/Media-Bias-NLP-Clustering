I think it was a clever and bold collection.\u201d\n\nTemperley opened her show with androgynous looks that played with men\u2019s suiting, but these looks were chic and feminine instead of manly, coming in monochrome checks, a pastel pink and blue palette, and floaty chiffons. A cropped trench coat was cut high in the back to reveal a glimpse of bare waist.\n\nDresses, separates and kimonos in vibrant checks, stripes and marine prints followed, taking the audience from city nights out to cocktails by the beach.\n\nThe collection was classy as always, and would likely appeal to a wider clientele than the typical Temperley customer.\n\n___\n\nDAME VIVIENNE SPEAKS OUT ON SCOTLAND\n\nVivienne Westwood may be staging a catwalk show, but Scotland \u2014 not clothes \u2014 is foremost on the designer\u2019s mind.\n\nNever one to shy away from making a political statement, the eccentric 73-year-old used her runway Sunday to urge Scots to vote \u201cYes\u201d to breaking away from the United Kingdom in Thursday\u2019s referendum.\n\nWestwood proudly wore a \u201cYes\u201d badge, and sent her models down the catwalk sporting the same badge prominently on their lapels or hats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "London Fashion Week Day 3: Temperley, Westwood", "title": "London Fashion Week Day 3: Temperley, Westwood", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "London Fashion Week Day 3: Temperley, Westwood", "title": "London Fashion Week Day 3: Temperley, Westwood", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/14/london_fashion_week_day_3_temperley_westwood/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/britain-london-fashion-week-vivienne-westwood.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "London Fashion Week Day 3: Temperley, Westwood", "title": "London Fashion Week Day 3: Temperley, Westwood", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/britain-london-fashion-week-vivienne-westwood.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sylvia Hui", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd074c\"", "article_summary": "You know flat shoes are in when a designer like Alice Temperley, who specializes in ladylike occasion wear, makes her models wear lace-up canvas sneakers with everything.\nAnd amid the blur of models and catwalks, British fashion\u2019s grandest dame Vivienne Westwood was keen to draw the fashion crowd\u2019s attention to politics, using her runway to help campaign for Scottish independence.\nFashionistas were spoilt for choice, with Temperley, Topshop Unique, Paul Smith and Pringle of Scotland all showing their spring and summer collections.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLONDON (AP) \u2014 London Fashion Week swung into Day 3 Sunday, packed from morning to night with next season\u2019s womenswear offerings from dozens of designers.\nWestwood proudly wore a \u201cYes\u201d badge, and sent her models down the catwalk sporting the same badge prominently on their lapels or hats."}
