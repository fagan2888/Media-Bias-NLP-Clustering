A pair of maintenance workers used leaf blowers to push inches of water off graduates' chairs before the procession.\n\nThough Saturday was wet \u2014 really wet \u2014 and cold, graduates and their families made the most of a bad situation by stocking up on hot coffee inside Balch Fieldhouse and frolicking joyfully on the campus's soggy sidewalks and grass.\n\nThe rain did not let up for the ceremonial early-morning drink at The Sink, nor did it stop when students lined up on Norlin Quad before heading to the stadium.\n\nIt kept pouring when longtime publishing executive Cathleen Black delivered her commencement address, which she pared down to less than five minutes.\n\n\"You'll be glad to know that I have three versions of my speech today,\" said Black, decked out in a poncho covered with the CU logo. \"One about 15 minutes, one about 10 and the Noah's Ark version.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack described how her now-graduating daughter, Alison Harvey, fell in love with Boulder and CU's campus.\n\n\"That was before the admissions speaker said there are 300 days of sunshine in Colorado,\" Black said, pausing. \"I think you must have used them all up.\"\n\nBlack offered brief pieces of advice to graduates \u2014 be kind and compassionate, over-deliver at your first job and follow your passion \"no matter what your parents want you to do,\" she said.\n\nEmma Friedland, left, and Tara Kengott try to stay dry by wearing bags to no avail during the University of Colorado spring commencement ceremony at Folsom Field on Saturday . (David R. Jennings )\n\nAll told, CU conferred 4,545 bachelor's degrees, 908 master's degrees, 149 law degrees and 325 doctoral degrees.\n\n'It's freezing'\n\nBefore the ceremony, Aijiana Zanders took cover near Norlin Library, looking out across the sopping quad in her graduation regalia.\n\nShe said she was \"thrilled\" to be finishing her undergraduate studies at CU in speech, language and hearing sciences, but added that the rain was putting a damper on the festive mood.\n\n\"I was going to wear a dress and heels and everything, but now I'm wearing jeans and boots,\" Zanders said. \"And I'm still wet.\"\n\nOutside the Sink an hour before the start of the ceremony, Ramisa Faruque held a pair of strappy turquoise heels in her hands while waiting to get inside for a Bloody Mary.\n\nOn her feet instead were rubber flip flops \u2014 not exactly what she had envisioned for her graduation-day outfit.\n\n\"I'm freezing,\" said Faruque, who earned a degree in computer science.\n\nLike Faruque, many students and their guests coped with the moisture and cool temperatures by imbibing mimosas and other breakfast beverages before heading to campus.\n\nA long line of umbrellas snaked up the sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue, even as heavy rains fell.\n\n\"I hear there's breakfast burritos and I wanna get hammered before the ceremony,\" said Roman Sammartino, who received a degree in math. \"It's miserable out.\"\n\nFor father Jim Von Dreel, whose daughter Julia received a degree in studio arts on Saturday, a bit of bad weather wasn't enough to dampen his pride.\n\n\"We've been working too hard,\" he said. \"A little bit of rain isn't gonna slow us down.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28083882/nonstop-rain-fails-dampen-spirits-at-cu-boulder", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28083882:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-09T12:03:28-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "This year, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" was accompanied by the rhythmic and unrelenting \"drip, drip, drip\" of  rain that fell all morning during the University of Colorado's commencement ceremony.", "title": "Nonstop rain fails to dampen spirits at CU-Boulder graduation", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28083882/nonstop-rain-fails-dampen-spirits-at-cu-boulder", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0509/20150509_121354_grad7.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "modificationDate": "2015-05-09T23:32:05-0600", "endDate": "2025-05-09T12:01:45-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-05-09T12:08:17-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-09T12:03:28-0600", "sailthru.title": "Nonstop rain fails to dampen spirits at CU-Boulder graduation", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0509/20150509_121354_grad7_300.jpg", "description": "This year, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" was accompanied by the rhythmic and unrelenting \"drip, drip, drip\" of  rain that fell all morning during the University of Colorado's commencement ceremony.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28083882/nonstop-rain-fails-dampen-spirits-at-cu-boulder", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "This year, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" was accompanied by the rhythmic and unrelenting \"drip, drip, drip\" of  rain that fell all morning during the University of Colorado's commencement ceremony.", "title": "Nonstop rain fails to dampen spirits at CU-Boulder graduation"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0509/20150509_121354_grad7.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab41\"", "article_summary": "(David R.
