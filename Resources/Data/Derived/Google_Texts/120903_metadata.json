So let\u2019s not begin there. Let\u2019s begin at the end. At the end there is only Michael Brown Jr.\u2019s dead body, no justice, and weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nFor his parents, there is only grief.\n\nThey are undone. We are undone. I am undone. This is what American democracy coming apart at the seams looks like. Our frayed, tattered edges are showing. The emperors are the only ones who can\u2019t see it. Where can we begin so that we don\u2019t end up here?\n\nIs anyone else tired of wandering in this wilderness? Surely this land of broken promises isn\u2019t what Dr. King had in mind for us. Hopefully, from the fiery furnace of Ferguson, the floating embers will spark and spread and blaze us a new trail \u2013 up out of this madness.\n\nDid you expect me to call for peace? Did you expect me to condemn looting and property damage? Did you expect me to preach at the people about being constructive rather than destructive?\n\nPeaceful protests have been happening for over 100 days. But white folks only really pay attention if they fear they have something to lose. Smoke flares in their nostrils, because then they are confronted with the possibility of charred, burning, white flesh. No more water. The fire next time.\n\nI woke up in black skin this morning. Frustrated, because for the first time in a long time, I felt the weight, the scourge of this skin. Had visions of being able to unzip myself, climb out of myself, and lay aside this weight, but the woman who climbed out was darker still. Since black is beautiful, we are never supposed to admit that we are sometimes tempted to believe what white supremacy tells us to believe about ourselves. But you caught me in a moment of weakness.\n\nUtterly undone. Put out trying to pull it together. Still trying to put together \u2013 piece together \u2014all these pieces. Of \u201cevidence.\u201d\n\nMany things are evident this morning.\n\nOur black president says that first and foremost, we must \u201crespect the rule of law.\u201d I watch, as he says this, a split screen of unruly protesters smashing the windows of a police cruiser. It is evident what they think about \u201cthe system.\u201d\n\nIt, too, is evident what the system thinks about us.\n\n(Do you feel the struggle in these words? The utter inadequacy of them? The struggle to contain and train my rage on the proper (white) people, and not all of them? The challenge of trying to narrate black rage, and black pain, and black fear, and black freedom dreams deferred \u2013 again\u2014in hopes that white folks would really understand? The resentment at my failure? The rage at my having to do so in the first place?)", "article_metadata": {"description": "I woke up in black skin today -- and felt its scourge.
