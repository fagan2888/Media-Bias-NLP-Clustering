Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cleared of any wrongdoing in the Dec. 20 incident when they let their kids walk home from the park in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Washington Post reports:\n\nA Maryland couple investigated for neglect after they let their two young children walk home alone from local parks have been cleared in one of two such cases, according to the family\u2019s attorneys and documents. The new Child Protective Services finding, which follows an appeal, comes as the experiences of \u201cfree range\u201d parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have drawn national attention, sparking debate about parenting choices and how far local officials should go to enforce laws designed to protect children. It overturns a previous CPS decision that held the Meitivs responsible for \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d child neglect, a finding typically made when there is conflicting or insufficient information for a more definitive conclusion. The change came as a welcome surprise to the Meitivs, who were informed in letters they received May 18 that neglect was \u201cruled out\u201d in the case, which dates to their children\u2019s December walk from Woodside Park. \u201cIt was an enormous relief and vindication,\u201d Danielle Meitiv said in a Washington Post interview, the family\u2019s first in six weeks. \u201cOf course there\u2019s no neglect here. There never was. There was never even a hint of it.\u201d\n\nThe Meitivs aren't in the clear yet, however; there's still a charge against them stemming from that other time they allowed their kids to walk home from a local park (the little recidivists). The kids were held for five hours, and the authorities didn't even notify the parents until about three hours in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful it will be resolved in the same way,\u201d Danielle Meitiv said. \u201cThe facts of the two are the same. They\u2019re the same kids, we\u2019re the same parents. They were walking in the same neighborhood. . . . Neither case is neglect so we\u2019re hopeful that CPS will just see that and move on.\u201d Danielle Meitiv said she stopped giving interviews April 13, both at the advice of lawyers and because the most recent experience became upsetting to talk about. She said she\u2019s speaking out now in hopes the new ruling may assuage the fears of other parents who want to let their children venture outdoors to walk or play, but are worried about CPS involvement. \u201cIt\u2019s also really good news,\u201d she said. The Meitivs advocate free-range parenting, which encourages independence and exploration. The term was first coined in 2008 by New York journalist Lenore Skenazy, who developed a following for pushing back against what many saw as a hypervigilant \u201chelicopter parent\u201d culture.\n\nThat New York journalist would like to clarify that she is not pushing back against helicopter parents\u2014she feels parents can raise their kids however they see fit. She is (I hear) pushing back against an entire culture that sees children only through the lens of danger, trauma, and fragility, which then tends to overreact to any threat, no matter how remote.\n\nJust sayin'.\n\nBut first, a woot of joy for justice, and for kids everywhere. Ye Olde Founding Mother suggests: Why not celebrate by having them walk to school today?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Victory for the Meitivs", "title": "Free-Range Maryland Family Cleared of Child Neglect Charge", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/26/free-range-maryland-family-cleared-of-ch", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1432650318483.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1432650318483.jpg", "description": "Victory for the Meitivs", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Free-Range Maryland Family Cleared of Child Neglect Charge"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-26T14:35:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lenore-skenazy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was an enormous relief and vindication,\u201d Danielle Meitiv said in a Washington Post interview, the family\u2019s first in six weeks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful it will be resolved in the same way,\u201d Danielle Meitiv said.\nDanielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cleared of any wrongdoing in the Dec. 20 incident when they let their kids walk home from the park in Silver Spring, Maryland.\nThe Washington Post reports:A Maryland couple investigated for neglect after they let their two young children walk home alone from local parks have been cleared in one of two such cases, according to the family\u2019s attorneys and documents.\nIt overturns a previous CPS decision that held the Meitivs responsible for \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d child neglect, a finding typically made when there is conflicting or insufficient information for a more definitive conclusion."}
