He\u2019s designed a 3D printed device that will help you wake up gradually with the morning sunlight rather than a blaring alarm clock. It\u2019s reminiscent of another Instructables project we saw back in December to open the blinds, though this one is powered with Bluetooth.\n\nMoberg\u2019s device works with an app on your smartphone that you can set to open the blinds in your bedroom gradually, before the alarm goes off. In order to complete this project, you\u2019ll need to have some basic knowledge of electronics\u2013experience with Arduino would help, but those aspiring makers eager to learn shouldn\u2019t shy away. You\u2019ll also need to have some basic CAD skills or, again, a willingness to learn. Fortunately, Moberg has provided excellent, detailed instructions. Check out the blind control in action:\n\nBefore jumping in, be sure that you have the following: An Android phone with Bluetooth, a soldering iron, and a multimeter (an instrument for measuring voltage, current, and resistance with electronics). You will, of course, also need a 3D printer and about a day to print the parts, build the device, and install the app. Don\u2019t despair if you don\u2019t have a 3D printer. You can upload Moberg\u2019s .stl files to a web-based service like Shapeways or find a 3D printer in your neighborhood via 3D Hubs using the button right on the Instructable.\n\nAnother thing you\u2019ll need if you don\u2019t already have them is window blinds. Moberg bought some very affordable ones from Ikea. Rather than using the mounting brackets provided with the blinds, however, you will be switching things up a bit. One bracket will hold the blinds in place and the other will hold the step motor, which rotates the curtain axle.\n\nSo how does this device work? Essentially, the step motor is connected to the component box with a cable. The component box, which houses the step motor drivers, the Bluetooth receiver, and an Arduino, can be installed either on the floor or secured to the wall.\n\nWhen you start the app on your Android phone, you will calibrate the blinds (this is a one-time thing). This will signal the device to start rolling down the blinds. When they are fully extended\u2013that is, covering the window completely\u2013you press \u201cstop calibration\u201d and the app obeys. This means you will never have to stop the app manually again, which is probably all for the best as this will be happening every morning when you\u2019re still mostly asleep.\n\nThe system Moberg has designed is nearly foolproof, too. There\u2019s an alarm and, when you set it, the app will set the current time on the Arduino so it can keep track of the time without actually being connected to your phone\u2013another plus for those of us who are less-than-lucid either at night when it\u2019s time to set the alarm or in the morning when it\u2019s time to wake up!\n\nShort of having a front desk to give you a friendly wake-up call each morning\u2013and maybe a servant to open the blinds\u2013Moberg\u2019s 3D printed, app-assisted device should be a welcome tech-age convenience. Also conveniently, he has provided a thorough shopping list with links to sources for materials and components you\u2019ll need to complete this project. The only thing missing is your morning coffee!\n\nAre you a morning person-or would this device help you pretend to be one?
