She remembers the moment the psychiatrist said \u201cthe antidepressant isn\u2019t going to work right away. Can you promise to be here next week and not kill yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told her no,\u201d Kate says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t promise my doctor I\u2019d make it a week. That\u2019s how bad my life had to be before I got help. When you\u2019re struggling to stay alive every single day, and then your doctor tells you it\u2019s going to take two to six weeks before the medications they give you are going to work, it\u2019s devastating.\u201d To make matters worse, after those weeks, the drug didn\u2019t work. Kate went through five different anti-depressants over the course of six months before confirming that none of them worked. The debilitating disorder kept her out of school for extended periods of time.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics estimates more than one in 10 Americans over the age of 12 took antidepressants between 2005 and 2008, the last time period for which the data are available. The rate of antidepressant use increased 400 percent from 1998 to 2008.\n\nTraditional antidepressants go after serotonin transporter proteins. These regulatory proteins take serotonin back into the nerve cell after it has been released in the process of signaling other neurons. Antidepressants keep the transporters from performing this function.\n\nAlthough nowadays, most scientists feel that serotonin release and reuptake are fairly normal in depressed patients, many scientists nonetheless believe the changes in serotonin signaling caused by antidepressants, induces the alleviation of symptoms, says Gary Rudnick, professor of pharmacology at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nStill, antidepressants stop the process of serotonin transporters sucking up released serotonin fairly quickly, so researchers don\u2019t understand why it takes weeks for the medications to take effect, Rudnick says. Scientists believe the behavioral effects of antidepressants may be due to other changes that occur as a reaction to the changed serotonin levels. However, researchers don\u2019t know what reactions include, and therefore cannot create medications that target them directly.\n\nTargeting proteins\n\nA large portion of depression research is associated with trying to ascertain the role of neurogenesis, the process by which the brain generates new neurons. Researchers have noticed that the hippocampus of a depressed person\u2019s brain tends to be smaller than average. Some researchers hypothesize that a problem with neurogenesiscauses both the small hippocampus as well as depression; others caution that the causal arrow may be reversed, with a small hippocampus leading to problems withneurogenesis and depression.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers can\u2019t understand why it takes weeks for the medications to take effect.
