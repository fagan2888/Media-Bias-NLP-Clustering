It’s hard to believe Labor Day has come and gone. Where did the summer go?

But for many, fall is the ideal time to be in coastal Delaware. It’s not too hot outside and the ocean is still pretty usually warm. There’s much less traffic, yet there’s still plenty going on.

Here we share a few tips and a few events to keep on the radar as you enjoy your pumpkin spiced food or beverage of choice and look for things to do.

•Restaurant specials: It’s time for some locals to emerge from hibernation and check out what they’ve missed over the course of the summer at their favorite local restaurants. Many offer specials that can’t be beat in the fall.

•Coast Day: The annual celebration of our maritime culture, hosted by the University of Delaware at its Hugh R. Sharp Campus in Lewes, takes place Sunday, Oct. 4.

•Events for the dogs: October brings a pair of dog-friendly events to coastal Delaware, just days apart from each other. Greyhounds Reach the Beach is set for Oct. 8-11, while the fifth annual Bark on the Boards in Rehoboth Beach is Saturday, Oct. 17.

•Apple Scrapple Festival: Punkin Chunkin may have moved to Dover for 2015, but the other popular rhyming fall festival in Sussex County is still in full swing Oct. 9 and 10 in Bridgeville.

•Sea Witch: Rehoboth Beach’s annual Halloween celebration is going 26 years strong in 2015. This year, it takes place Oct. 23-25. More information can be found at Beach-fun.com.

•Rehoboth Beach Film Festival: The event may not be taking place at Movies at Midway this year, but that’s not stopping the popular event. Screenings are set for Nov. 7-8 and 11-15. More information can be found at RehobothFilm.com.
