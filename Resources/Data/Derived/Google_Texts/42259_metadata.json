Instead, they doubled down and showed off a slate of great upcoming games on the platform, that somehow looks even better than everything we already have.\n\nIn this list, we look at those upcoming games- there\u2019s an amazing lineup of new Wii U games announced for 2015, and here, we will look at just which of these are the ones you should be looking forward to the most in the coming year.\n\nReady? Okay, here we go.\n\nProject Guard/Project Giant Robot\n\n\n\nExactly what these games are, we\u2019re not quite sure yet, which is a bit surprising, given that Nintendo is so insistent that they are coming next year. We actually don\u2019t even know if they are two separate games yet- but given that Nintendo has always shown them off and referred to them together, we\u2019re going to go ahead and assume that they\u2019re both part of the same package.\n\nUndoubtedly, these were the weakest part of Nintendo\u2019s otherwise stellar E3 showing. We had been hearing a lot about the new mysterious project Miyamoto had been working on, and how it would utilize the Wii U Gamepad in innovative ways, but their E3 debut, at least, left a lot to be desired, and the games just ended up coming off looking rough and unpolished, and also unconvincing proof of concepts. The Treehouse stream, which you can see above, was a little better, as they started to look like some interesting and innovative takes on existing genres. Although right now, it may be easy to just dismiss them as unpolished tech demos, it would probably be unwise- from these rough tech demos, Miyamoto has wrought masterpieces before such as Pikmin, or crowd pleasers such as Wii Sports.\n\nWhether or not Project Giant Robot/Project Guard end up in that same list of successes for him remains to be seen, but the man has earned our benefit of the doubt- if anyone can innovatively make a compelling case for the Wii U Gamepad, Miyamoto is it, so we\u2019re going to watch just how this pet project of his turns out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://gamingbolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wii-u--300x168.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "HlQ8pg5xv9D6mSe_VQi4-7e3amvI2SxvyoIcyBX68dk", "twitter": {"description": "It's got the best library on the market, and it doesn't look like that will change in 2015 either.", "title": "Wii U Games Line Up For 2015 Is Nothing Short of Spectacular", "url": "http://gamingbolt.com/wii-u-games-line-up-for-2015-is-nothing-short-of-spectacular", "image": "http://gamingbolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wii-u--300x168.jpg", "creator": "@Pramath1605", "site": "@GamingBoltTweet", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9e1\"", "article_summary": "Instead, they doubled down and showed off a slate of great upcoming games on the platform, that somehow looks even better than everything we already have.\nProject Guard/Project Giant RobotExactly what these games are, we\u2019re not quite sure yet, which is a bit surprising, given that Nintendo is so insistent that they are coming next year.\nIn this list, we look at those upcoming games- there\u2019s an amazing lineup of new Wii U games announced for 2015, and here, we will look at just which of these are the ones you should be looking forward to the most in the coming year.\nThe Treehouse stream, which you can see above, was a little better, as they started to look like some interesting and innovative takes on existing genres.\nUndoubtedly, these were the weakest part of Nintendo\u2019s otherwise stellar E3 showing."}
