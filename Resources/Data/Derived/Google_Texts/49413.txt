K-9 Max and his handler searched the area of Dublin and Union late Friday night, but found no sign of the man who had just robbed a convenience store.

The robbery was reported at the Kwik Way on the 2800 block of Dublin Boulevard in Colorado Springs just after 11:20 p.m. The suspect did not use a weapon, but witnesses told police that the suspect claimed to have one. He walked away from the area after the robbery.

Police called Officer Donovan and K-9 Max to help with the search, but they were unable to track him down.

The suspect is described as a heavyset man, race and age unknown, wearing a gray hoodie, dark-colored pants and red bandana.

If you have any information on his whereabouts, you're asked to call CSPD at 444-7000 or Crime Stoppers at 634-STOP.
