Following the incident James Hand has been organizing black lives matter rallies since Johnathan Sanders died. The black lives matter movement has swept across the nation in the wake of police brutality against African-American's.\n\nSanders died when an officer pursued him while he was riding his horse. Hand said, \"It didn\u2019t have to go down like that\". Which left Hand to question the encounter between Sanders and officer Kevin Harrington.\n\n\"He followed him a mile way in the dark and stopped him. Why didn\u2019t he stop him right out here? Why did he have to follow him down to the dark? He was on a horse. It\u2019s not like you couldn't catch him,\" said Hand.\n\nThe death of Sanders is still under investigation. The Stonewall police department has turned the case over to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAmeily Hahn is a protester who drove from Jackson to honor the memory of Sanders.\n\n\u201cThere is a family with no answers. There is a city in danger while a murdering cop is walking the streets. There is a state in turmoil because of the notion that black lives don\u2019t matter and black lives most definitely matter. Right here in the state of Mississippi and it\u2019s time that people stand up and speak out,\u201d said Hahn.\n\nThose who showed up said they will continue to protest until they get answers. Meanwhile Hands encouraged everyone to become a registered voter and take action at the ballot.\n\n\"I am a registered voter. They need to come out and vote in numbers. They can change things with a vote,\" said Hand.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A group of people protest at Stonewall Town Hall in support of Johnathan Sanders.", "language": "english", "author": "Amicia Ramsey", "og": {"description": "A group of people protest at Stonewall Town Hall in support of Johnathan Sanders.", "title": "Black Lives Matter Rally For Johnathan Sanders", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Black-Lives-Matter-Rally-For-Johnathan-Sanders--329672201.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A15/646/A1564601A5EC490086C4B6707057F378", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DCC/578/DCC578D8BF90450FAD19D3473D2A9104.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A group of people protest at Stonewall Town Hall in support of Johnathan Sanders.", "title": "Black Lives Matter Rally For Johnathan Sanders", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Black-Lives-Matter-Rally-For-Johnathan-Sanders--329672201.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/sanders.PNG", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Black Lives Matter Rally For Johnathan Sanders", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Black Lives Matter Rally For"}, "article_summary": "There is a state in turmoil because of the notion that black lives don\u2019t matter and black lives most definitely matter.\nThe black lives matter movement has swept across the nation in the wake of police brutality against African-American's.\nFollowing the incident James Hand has been organizing black lives matter rallies since Johnathan Sanders died.\nWhich left Hand to question the encounter between Sanders and officer Kevin Harrington.\nSanders died when an officer pursued him while he was riding his horse."}
