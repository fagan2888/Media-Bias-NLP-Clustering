They are not protected for disclosures made to the public, nor are they are protected when they question judgments of legality or propriety concerning public policy matters through internal channels,\u201d PEN said.\n\nThe report criticizes the Obama administration for invoking the 1917 Espionage Act in prosecuting leakers, and describes retaliation against whistleblowers at the Justice and Defense departments\u2019 inspector general\u2019s offices.\n\nThe advocates recommend strengthening protections across national security agencies and the contractor community; reforming the Espionage Act to allow defendants to raise a public interest defense; and adding more protection against retaliation, including greater access to courts.\n\nTo make its case against the status quo, PEN uses statistics to argue that would-be whistleblowers in the Defense and intelligence communities face long odds for getting traction for their complaints. According to the DoD IG Semiannual Report to Congress, that office during the first half of fiscal 2015 received 591 whistleblower reprisal complaints and closed 671, PEN noted. The Pentagon\u2019s IG substantiated only 9 percent of whistleblower reprisal complaints investigated. The intelligence community watchdog investigated nine reported in-house whistleblower reprisal cases and 52 reprisal cases among contractors, substantiating none.\n\nMany whistleblower advocates have praised Dan Meyer, the government\u2019s executive director for intelligence community whistleblowing and source protection, PEN stated. Meyer is point man for implementing internally the principles of President Obama\u2019s October 2012 Presidential Policy Directive 19, which added new protections for whistleblowers facing possible retaliation (the applicability of which is debated among whistleblower advocates), and more came in with the 2014 Intelligence Authorization Act.\n\nBut Meyer\u2019s office has \u201conly token resources,\u201d which makes protections \u201chopelessly unrealistic,\u201d in the phrase of Tom Devine, legal director for the Government Accountability Project.\n\nMeyer\u2019s office, in a statement to Government Executive on Wednesday, said the office is suitably staffed, though a deputy director\u2019s slot is currently vacant. The PEN report erroneously created the impression that Meyer had a half-dozen staffers when in fact he works alone with assistance from the intel community IG\u2019s counsel, investigations division and other IG offices across the intel community, including CIA, NSA and Defense Intelligence Agency watchdogs, Meyer\u2019s office said in an email. If the whistleblower goes through their own agency\u2019s process to file a reprisal complaint and isn\u2019t happy with the finding, they can then appeal to the IC IG\u2019s office, at which point Meyer gets involved.\n\n\u201cIntelligence community contractors do have avenues to make legal, protected disclosures to the inspectors general, the agency head and/or Congress,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIC contractors are specifically protected from reprisal when it comes to any action affecting eligibility for access to classified information (security clearances), and these protections are outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 19. IC contractors are also protected from reprisal affecting access to classified information if they make a lawful disclosure to Congress through the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA),\u201d he said. But \u201cneither contractors nor government employees are protected when they disclose to the media. Unauthorized sharing with the media is leaking, and not whistleblowing.\u201d\n\nGovernment employees in all agencies are protected against adverse personnel actions under Presidential Policy Directive 19 for making authorized disclosures, he added, but \u201cexpanding this protection to IC contractors, to include adverse personnel actions by private corporations, would likely require authorities that do not exist in statute.\u201d\n\nMeyer added that since his whistleblowing program was created in July 2013 by the intelligence community inspector general, \u201ca number of government and contract employees have made protected disclosures and it increases every year. We believe this demonstrates growing confidence and familiarity with IC whistleblowing provisions.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
