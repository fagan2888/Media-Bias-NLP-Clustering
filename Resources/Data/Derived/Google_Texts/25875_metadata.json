They made sure their presence was felt.\n\nDemonstrators circled the governor\u2019s mansion in protest of the state\u2019s compliance with federal immigration authorities, who want to be informed when someone targeted for deportation is released from jail.\n\nZorayda Moreira-Smith, who works in CASA community development, suggested the program was unfair in nature because it is based on racial profiling.\n\n\u201cAnd what it does is incentivize racial profiling and individuals that look like me can be stopped and arrested and notify ICE to pick me up.\"\n\nA detail lost on these activists, is the fact that Hogan is simply following the Obama administration's instructions. The governor's office said as much in a statement, suggesting the protesters' message would be better directed toward the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cThe Baltimore City Detention Center is simply complying with a request from the Obama administration in regard to individuals who have already been detained. If CASA has concerns about Obama\u2019s Priority Enforcement Program, I would recommend they take those concerns to the White House.\u201d\n\nAlso tragically ironic, is the fact that CASA de Maryland protested Hogan's decision on the same day another illegal immigrant was charged with murder.\n\nAnother illegal charged with murder You picked quite a day to protest @LarryHogan doing the right thing, @Somos_CASA pic.twitter.com/bMO0SB86UF \u2014 Cameron Gray (@Cameron_Gray) August 14, 2015\n\nFox 5 DC has the details on that fatal encounter:\n\nPolice say on Tuesday night, Miguel Angel Rodriguez-Gaona fatally stabbed William Palacios and then ran to Baltimore where they arrested him.\n\nCASA de Maryland would be wise to read about Kate Steinle, William Palacios, and other victims of illegal immigrants before knocking down Hogan's door.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An ill-timed protest..05/26/2016 4:26:14AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "An ill-timed protest.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Activists Protest Gov Hogan for Detaining Deportation Targets Same Day Illegal Immigrant Charged with Murder", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/08/14/immigration-activists-protest-gov-hogan-for-following-obama-admins-instructions-n2038944", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/8/14/0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "An ill-timed protest.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Activists Protest Gov Hogan for Detaining Deportation Targets Same Day Illegal Immigrant Charged with Murder", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/08/14/immigration-activists-protest-gov-hogan-for-following-obama-admins-instructions-n2038944", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/8/14/0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Activists Protest Gov Hogan for Detaining Deportation Targets Same Day Illegal Immigrant Charged with Murder, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1c5\"", "article_summary": "CASA de Maryland would be wise to read about Kate Steinle, William Palacios, and other victims of illegal immigrants before knocking down Hogan's door.\nA detail lost on these activists, is the fact that Hogan is simply following the Obama administration's instructions.\nZorayda Moreira-Smith, who works in CASA community development, suggested the program was unfair in nature because it is based on racial profiling.\nThe immigration activist group CASA de Maryland, along with the ACLU and 20 other angry groups, stormed Governor Larry Hogan's mansion Thursday to protest his action to detain individuals cited for deportation.\nThe governor's office said as much in a statement, suggesting the protesters' message would be better directed toward the Oval Office."}
