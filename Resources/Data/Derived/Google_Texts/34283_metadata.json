Cornell University scientists found no significant biochemical differences between the two.\n\nLed by Cornell professor Owen Hoekenga, the researchers extracted roughly 1,000 biochemical metabolites from a group of tomatoes that had been genetically modified to ripen more slowly. Then they compared the metabolic profile of these GM tomatoes to those of unmodified modern and heirloom tomato varieties.\n\nAside from the GM tomatoes differing in metabolites related to fruit ripening, as they were designed to, there were no significant biochemical difference between the GM and other tomatoes. The results, published in The Plant Genome, challenge the growing belief that GM foods are inherently less nutritious than conventional counterparts.\n\nThe findings suggest little or no accidental biochemical changes due to the genetic modification process, Hoekenga said. He hopes the research\u2014which can be adapted and applied to any plant or crop\u2014will prove a \"useful way to address consumer concerns about unintended effects\" with GM foods.\n\nFor more on GMO food safety, see Ronald Bailey's dismantling of five persistent anti-biotech lies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A new study comparing genetically modified (GM) and conventional tomatoes lends further support to the pro-GM food movement.
