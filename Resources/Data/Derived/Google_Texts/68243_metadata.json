Iowa Commissioner Nick Gerhart, who obtained a court order placing the company into rehabilitation in late December, concluded that \"further efforts to rehabilitate the company would be futile.\"\n\nCoOportunity's demise could cost taxpayers at least $145.3 million, money the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gave the cooperative in start-up loans beginning in 2012 and a $32.7 million \"solvency funding\" loan awarded on Sept. 26, according to federal records.\n\n\n\nCMS also provided $15.4 million last year to help cover the cash-starved cooperative's operational costs, according to the petition for rehabilitation filed in December.\n\nOperational losses are continuing at CoOportunity, and liabilities exceed assets by at least $48 million. \"It is difficult to predict if there will be sufficient funds to repay solvency and start-up loans from CMS,\" IID officials said via email on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "One of the fledgling insurance cooperatives developed under the healthcare reform law has taken a financially fatal turn in Iowa.
