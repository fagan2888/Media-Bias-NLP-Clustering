With its pipeline full of promising new drugs, that growth may continue.\n\nThe region's pharmaceutical and medical instruments manufacturers do face some uncertainties in this presidential election year, Johnson cautions.\n\n\"There will be a lot of discussion about pharmaceutical pricing,\" he predicted.\n\nBut a federal tax that medical instrument manufacturers found onerous \u2014 it was levied as part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 was removed in the most recent congressional budget, said Mark Eagan, CEO of the Capital Region Chamber. That's expected to save companies such as Latham-based AngioDynamics millions of dollars.\n\nManufacturers who depend on export markets were relieved when Congress reauthorized the Export-Import Bank, which had been allowed to expire earlier in the spring. General Electric Co., which exports more than 80 percent of its Schenectady-produced power generation equipment, had warned that the loss of the bank would cost hundreds of local jobs.\n\nBut Eagan said businesses that had been encouraged by the Cuomo administration's plans to cut property taxes and business costs were dismayed by the increase in the state's minimum wage, which he said will raise their costs.\n\nEagan said that might lead to less hiring and a reduction in employee hours.\n\nAnother headwind manufacturers may face is the rise in interest rates. Not only might it make financing more expensive, it also has strengthened the dollar, putting domestic manufacturers at a disadvantage as their products rise in cost.\n\nSo far, rates have edged up only slightly, and Johnson doesn't yet see them hurting such rate-sensitive sectors as the housing market.\n\n\"I don't think rates will be a problem for the housing market or the economy in general,\" he said last week.\n\nThat said, he doesn't expect much change in what has been a lackluster market for home sales.\n\n\"Sales may be somewhat flat,\" he said. \"It's not going to be a really strong year. It's positive but uninspiring.\"\n\nAnother critical sector of the local economy is higher education. Here, too, the outlook is mixed.\n\nEnrollment is down at many area schools, Johnson said. \"The pressure on colleges and universities is going to become more intense.\"\n\nAt least some of this is the result of demographics. The number of people reaching college age nationwide has been declining.\n\nThe financial squeeze has led to layoffs and the elimination of programs at several area schools, most recently the College of Saint Rose in Albany, where several less popular programs were dropped.\n\nThe transportation sector may see plenty of changes over the coming year, with new, larger locks at the Panama Canal set to open in April. This is expected to send more container traffic to East Coast ports, with the Port of Albany receiving some of the shipments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian Pacific Railway, which last year sold its tracks south of Albany to Norfolk Southern Railway, is in the midst of an effort to acquire Norfolk Southern. The Capital Region is one of only a few places nationwide where the two carriers intersect.\n\nOn the passenger rail side, several Capital Region projects are nearing completion, although Eagan said the business community would like to see shorter travel times to New York City, one of Amtrak's busiest routes.\n\n\"It hasn't become a priority of the state,\" he said.\n\nThe Capital District Transportation Authority will introduce its mobile ticketing technology sometime this year. It also plans two new bus rapid transit routes, one from Albany to Watervliet, Troy, Cohoes and Waterford, and the other from Albany to the University at Albany, SUNY Polytechnic Institute and Crossgates Mall.\n\nEagan lauded what he described as CDTA's focus on economic development.\n\nAt the airport, American Airlines plans to restore nonstop service to Chicago in March, a route it and its predecessors served for eight decades before American quit the route in 2008.\n\neanderson@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5323", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Johnson will present his annual economic forecast at a breakfast meeting of the Capital Region Chamber at 7:30 a.m. Jan. 15 at the Desmond Hotel and Conference Center in Colonie.
