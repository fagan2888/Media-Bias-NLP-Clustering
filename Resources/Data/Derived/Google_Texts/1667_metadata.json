Atheists and non-religious are now given the same protection against discrimination as religious people.\n\nFrom the Associated Press:\n\nIn what is believed to be the first statute of its kind in the United States, Madison banned discrimination against the non-religious on April 1, giving them the same protections afforded to people based on their race, sexual orientation and religion, among other reasons. It's hardly surprising that such a statute would originate in Madison, an island of liberalism in a conservative-leaning state and the home of the Freedom from Religion Foundation. But the ordinance's author, Anita Weier, said it didn't arise from an actual complaint about alleged discrimination based on a lack of religious faith. \"It just seems to me that religion has spread into government more than I feel comfortable with,\" said Weier, who left the council after the statute passed. \"It just occurred to me that religion was protected, so non-religion should be, too.\"\n\nAt what point does an ordinance become so broad that it effectively renders itself useless? Also, does this indicate that a lack of belief is considered to be a system of belief?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interesting. .05/26/2016 18:24:08PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Interesting.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Wisconsin Capital City Bans Discrimination Against Atheists", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/05/03/wisconsin-capital-bans-discrimination-against-atheists-n1993827", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/314/b0e301a6-30c6-43f2-aae4-7f2cabea555f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Interesting.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Wisconsin Capital City Bans Discrimination Against Atheists", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/05/03/wisconsin-capital-bans-discrimination-against-atheists-n1993827", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/314/b0e301a6-30c6-43f2-aae4-7f2cabea555f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Wisconsin Capital City Bans Discrimination Against Atheists , Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In a bit of odd news coming out of Madison, an ordinance was passed that protects atheists and people lacking religious beliefs from discrimination.\nAtheists and non-religious are now given the same protection against discrimination as religious people.\nBut the ordinance's author, Anita Weier, said it didn't arise from an actual complaint about alleged discrimination based on a lack of religious faith.\n\"It just seems to me that religion has spread into government more than I feel comfortable with,\" said Weier, who left the council after the statute passed.\nAlso, does this indicate that a lack of belief is considered to be a system of belief?"}
