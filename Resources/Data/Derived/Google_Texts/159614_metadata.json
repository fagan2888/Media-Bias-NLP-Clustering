Photo: James Alcock\n\nSo that\u2019s the way you do it. The government spin doctors tell the Commonwealth Bank to make a heartfelt apology and set up a Mickey Mouse compensation scheme while our guys bluster about them dragging the chain (\"Bank's plan received with scepticism\", July 4). Consequently, no royal commission. But it\u2019s got to be heartfelt.\n\nMark Ryding Banora Point\n\nIan Narev, CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, has published a mea culpa in the Herald using hard-to-read spidery print on a brown background. It demonstrates the lack of clarity and transparency that was offered to its customers by its financial advisers.\n\nNedra Orme Neutral Bay\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Poor advice\" is a weasel phrase crafted by highly paid lawyers to avoid an admission of liability for alleged deceptive conduct and criminal behaviour. And it took them a week to do it. Given this level of investment, and our severe budgetary constraints, I expect the phrase will be sub-contracted out to other community leaders when their devious activity threatens to land them in court. Are you listening, Scott Morrison?\n\nIan Brown Mount Victoria\n\nJohn Collett refers to customers\u2019 expectations when buying a car (\u201cBanks must do more to help restore trust in planners\u201d, July 4). Customers also expect to have confidence that car manufacturers will recall all cars which develop a fault. The Commonwealth Bank has a similar duty to inform all their customers who have been misled by rogue planners\u2019 advice between 2003 and 2012.\n\nDiana Wyndham North Sydney\n\nMost organisations when under attack, whether it is the police, Catholic Church, or the military, respond by setting up an internal body to deal with the issues. It should not shock anyone that the Commonwealth Bank wants to do the same; they all have a copy of the same playbook. The real question to be resolved is whether the federal government wants to look after all Australians and not just those at the big end of town.\n\nJoe Weller Lewisham\n\nA report in the Herald states quite clearly that at least two Commonwealth Bank financial planners forged clients' signatures on documents (\u201cVictims outraged over response to scandal\u201d, July 4). I have always understood that forgery is a criminal offence. If that is so, why are the police not involved in this matter?\n\nDavid Fraser Ballina\n\nIf only the victims of the CBA had ignored the dodgy financial advice they were offered and bought CBA shares instead. They'd be streets ahead. Better to side with the predator than the prey.\n\nDes Mulcahy Orange\n\nI wish someone would pay me $7.8 million a year to shaft everybody.\n\nPaul Duncan Leura\n\nWhile in a compassionate mood, the CBA might decide to pay interest on saving accounts.\n\nMustafa Erem Terrigal\n\nIn 2001 all executives at the CBA were offered financial planning advice from within the bank. That which I received was rubbish so was immediately binned. Pity the unsuspecting public who were greenhorns to the financial planning advice arena.\n\nAlastair Browne Cromer Heights\n\nIt would be a test of the banks\u2019 bona fides if henceforth their investment advisers\u2019 directory listings, desk name plates and business cards were to say \u201csales representative\u201d instead of \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d.\n\nRichard Ure Epping\n\nTime to return to drawing board over city\u2019s theatres\n\nI am old enough to remember when Sydney had a very rich fabric of theatre buildings and all the related activity that comes with such venues. Sadly I have slowly watched just about every one of them demolished to be replaced by offices and apartments. One has only to wander from the site of the old Tivoli theatre, up to Quay Street where the old Her Majesty\u2019s stood to realise what a lifeless cultural void exists in these once vibrant areas.\n\nWhat a shame it is that it takes a visiting theatre impresario, Sir Cameron Mackintosh, to tell us we have got it all wrong (\u2018\u2018Producer calls for theatre at Barangaroo, saying Sydney risks losing out\u2019\u2019, July 4). You only have to visit Melbourne to see what a rich diversity of city life and culture that its old and still-standing theatres have brought to that city.\n\nLondon\u2019s West End and New York\u2019s Broadway have a policy plan that if an existing theatre is threatened with a redevelopment a new theatre should be included in the future building. Clover Moore, is it too late to twist the arm of a developer or two to recognise that, yes, a new building would be great, but this area would also benefit from a live theatre as well?\n\nLet\u2019s hope that there could be a space down at Barangaroo for such an inspired plan.\n\nGreg Vale Kiama\n\nAbbott's brain snap on Aborigines enough to make anyone unsettled\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s claim that Australia was \u2018\u2018unsettled or, um, scarcely settled\u2019\u2019 at the time of the British invasion of Australia not only resuscitates the racist doctrine of terra nullius, which the High Court of Australia repudiated in the Mabo case (\u2018\u2018Tony Abbott's comments on Australia being 'unsettled' before the British 'silly', says Warren Mundine\u2019\u2019, smh.com.au, July 4). It is also wrong.\n\nHistorical demography has shown conclusively that, before the British invasion, the east and south-east of Australia (including Tony Abbott\u2019s electorate), were well populated by indigenous people. Their numbers became much scarcer as a result of the violence, disease and resource depletion that the invasion brought about. Aboriginal depopulation was a consequence of white invasion, not a justification for it.\n\nPatrick Wolfe Healesville (Vic)\n\nTony Abbott says that we all benefited from British foreign investment because Australia was \"unsettled\" before the British arrived. Perhaps he could explain how Australians will benefit from us allowing foreign governments such as Qatar and China to purchase our fully developed premium farmland in order to grow food for their citizens. Surely it would be in Australia\u2019s best interests to retain ownership of these farms and sell the produce ourselves.\n\nJock Munro Rankins Springs\n\nTony Abbott says Australia was unsettled before the British arrived? I don't agree, but the locals were definitely unsettled after the British arrived.\n\nMichael Stanbridge Bonnet Bay\n\nPM's not fooling us\n\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott promised a \"transparent and open\" government and that \"the last thing we want to do is hide anything from the Australian people\". The latest attempt by the government to circumvent established practice for screening of refugees demonstrates the government is treating the Australian people with anything but transparency (\u2018\u2018Commission slams transfer at sea as clear rights breach\u2019\u2019, July 4).\n\nIrrespective of your views on the asylum seeker question, the Australian people should question whether our government has any compassion when dealing with the rights of genuine refugees. Our Prime Minister would have us believe asylum seekers from Sri Lanka would not face persecution on return to their homeland. I doubt many Australians expect Sri Lanka refugees would be accepted back in their country with open arms.\n\nStewart Manson Greystanes\n\nSociety must change for racism to end\n\nThe despicably vile racist tirade captured on a Sydney suburban train points to a deeply flawed undercurrent of inhumanity that is tearing the social fabric of this nation apart (\"Racist tirade woman had \u2018rotten day\u2019 \u2019\u2019, July 4). It comes on top of a University of Melbourne-led study involving more than 260 Victorian school students aged from eight to 17, which found that 22 per cent experienced one or more form of direct racism at school every day.\n\nBut most telling is the response of the two children at the centre of this incident. The fact that they were reported as crying after witnessing the racial abuse directed at a woman of Asian appearance, testifies to the moral truth that, like them, this woman had also suffered undeservedly.\n\nAll such racism is undeserved, and until we as a society resolve to rid ourselves of this scourge that undermines the dignity of us all, our beloved children will continue to pay the price.\n\nVincent Zankin Rivett (ACT)\n\nIs it so surprising that racial slurs and vilification are becoming frequent on public transport? A nation's ethos comes from the very top, and when high-ranking cabinet ministers alternately promote bigotry and the virtual guillotining of any refugees with sights set on Australia, such credo will sooner or later trickle down to the humble bus deck.\n\nElliott Savdie Darlinghurst\n\nBurnside has company\n\nIf Julian Burnside is in a \u2018\u2018classic ivory tower\u2019\u2019, Rosemary O'Brien (Letters, July 4), then there are a lot of us squashed in there with him\n\nPat Rayner Blackheath\n\nSurfing with safety\n\nEvery time a swimmer/surfer commits to the surf without supervision by either professional lifeguards or lifesavers they do so knowing there is a greater risk than if they were in attendance (\"Lack of lifeguards has locals baffled after death\", July 4). Thousands of our beaches face changing seasonal conditions, changing currents and rips, unseen hazards, a lack of seasonal attendance and a continuing failure of many to follow rules of simple beach safety.\n\nAny death or accident on our beaches is a tragedy, but increasing lifeguard supervision by councils on a small number of Sydney beaches is not enough. Personal responsibility from each individual and responsible supervising adult of children is necessary to ensure beach safety on all our beaches. We cannot always depend on others to save us.\n\nJanice Creenaune Austinmer\n\nHow BANANA works\n\nI would like to thank Tony Abbott for explaining why his government, and Treasurer Joe Hockey in particular, are so opposed to wind turbines \u2013 it's BANANA syndrome (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone) (\u2018\u2018BANANA on the nose for Abbott\u2019\u2019, July 4). Or does BANANA only apply if you are building casinos, motorways and coal-loading facilities without proper consultation or cost/benefit analysis?\n\nPeter Newberry Rose Bay\n\nConfused? No wonder\n\nAre we getting mixed messages from the nation\u2019s top bureaucrats? Treasury secretary Dr Martin Parkinson, who presumably played an important role in formulating what programs were or were not hit in the budget, has been criticised on the grounds that he would have little understanding of how the budget has or will affect those targeted by the Coalition (\u201cLabor takes aim at top bureaucrat's critique\u201d, July 4).\n\nOn the other hand Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens is issuing warnings to property investors regarding potential property bubbles in Sydney (\u201cRBA bursts bubble\u201d, July 4). As much of the Sydney property market is driven by investors using negative gearing, perhaps Mr Stevens could have advised Dr Parkinson to target this tax concession in the search for budget savings.\n\nRonald Binder Hurstville\n\nTelling the truth about women's shelters\n\nI was very disappointed to read the opinion piece by Anne Summers last Saturday (\"Fresh struggle to save women's services\", June 28). The St Vincent de Paul Society\u2019s ethos is to help everyone who turns to us regardless of creed, ethnicity, health, gender or political opinions. The society is neither controlled nor funded by the Catholic church. We are a lay Catholic organisation whose members and volunteers live out their faith by assisting people in their community.\n\nMs Summers\u2019 attempt to link the society with the royal commission into sexual abuse was inflammatory, untrue and potentially damaging and has nothing to do with any discourse on the allocation of funds as a result of the tendering of homelessness services.\n\nThe society has over 30 years\u2019 experience providing programs specifically tailored for women and children escaping family violence. Our aim is to operate all services in a way that will get the best outcomes for the families and individuals experiencing homelessness and family violence. Elsie Women\u2019s Refuge will remain open and continue to provide crucial support and assistance solely to women and children.\n\nRay Reynolds President, St Vincent de Paul Society NSW, Lewisham\n\nAnne Summers\u2019 column about homelessness funding last Saturday contained inaccuracies and innuendo. Many organisations provide quality crisis accommodation, but prevention is better than the cure. That is why the Baird government is also focusing resources on prevention and early intervention.\n\nFor the first time a competitive tender has been run to ensure taxpayer dollars are getting the best results for vulnerable people. A tender will always create winners and losers. However when $140 million is spent per annum while homelessness climbs, it is high time that evidence and results outweigh history and nostalgia.\n\nSummers' claims that 60 refuges are set to close and that women's-only services are not provided for are false. She is regurgitating Labor\u2019s deceitful claim that every unsuccessful tender equals a refuge closure. These refuges will now be managed by providers who have been independently assessed to do a better job. There are 1300 government-owned properties used for homelessness services in NSW. None of them will close.\n\nLabor\u2019s \u201cSave Elsie\u201d campaign is a furphy \u2013 Elsie was never going to close. Homeless people deserve our undivided support, not misinformation.\n\nGabrielle Upton Minister for Family and Community Services, Sydney\n\nStatistics on abuse Jack Robertson (Letters, July 4) asks if the statistic that \"one in three women\" is a victim of sexual or physical abuse is valid, or if it has been plucked from thin air. As a medical student undertaking my women and children's health term, I can assure him the data is valid, and that the definitions underlying these terms are appropriately broad \u2013 ranging from violent, physical acts to sexual acts or showing pornographic images to children. And as a man, I'm not going to stand with Jack and play the victim to the \"excessive rhetoric\" on these issues. I believe the rhetoric is quite appropriate. Because at the end of the day the statistics are academic \u2013 if one woman is a victim of physical or sexual abuse, it is one too many. James Lawler Rutherford\n\nPrepare for the US model and learn to go cap in hand\n\nYes, Danielle Ecuyer (Letters, July 4), the Tea Party ideology has arrived in Australia. Instead of having a fair and decent safety net, we are heading towards the US model where apparently 20 per cent of households are on food stamps.\n\nOur government has set aside millions to cover emergencies once its draconian budget policies are implemented. So, we will now have to go cap in hand begging for assistance. God help us.\n\nLiesma Lieknis Bondi\n\nAdding to the pain\n\nAs if the pain of losing a daughter in such horrendous circumstances was not enough, a mother needs to defend the daughter over allegations about her sex life in a \u2018\u2018character assassination\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018Murder victim\u2019s mother tells court: \u2018I hear her screaming\u2019 \u2018\u2018, July 4). What does a woman's private sex life have to do with it and when will we see the end to condemning women in this way?\n\nJanet Maddison Newcastle West\n\nThe perfect teacher\n\nTony Abbott's lack of negotiating skill is well known, but that's exactly what he'll need over the next couple of years if he wants to get his legislation through. May I suggest he call on one Julia Gillard? Her team attitude, negotiating skills and ability to carry legislation across a difficult political landscape while keeping her dignity are legendary.\n\nAnne Cooper Callala Beach\n\nFeeling off colour\n\nRicky Muir\u2019s Tory blue tie (Letters, July 4) pales into insignificance when you consider Jacqui Lambie was sporting a bright yellow scarf, which I suspect might be part of the PUP corporate wardrobe.\n\nAllan Gibson Cherrybrook\n\nPostscript\n\nNo doubt your mother told you never to discuss politics or money, but that has gone by the board this week. Everyone wanted to talk about money (corporations and their taxes, or lack thereof) and politics (Scott Morrison, are your ears burning?), not to mention the indiscretions of a certain sportsman.\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s letter from Corporation X defending its royalties and tax-paying record, exposed in a story the week before, the reader letters poured in, acidly pointing out that royalties and taxes are different and cannot be lumped together as a defence. Also that the government should stop chasing pensioners and the disabled for a few pennies when rivers of gold could be squeezed out of large corporations rather than let them get away with perfectly legal avoidance.\n\nThe Minister for Immigration and Border Protection copped a beating as well, for his arrogance in telling people that they couldn\u2019t be told what they wanted to know for \u2018\u2018operational reasons\u2019\u2019 and other jargon responses, and his perceived lack of care for desperate human beings adrift in the ocean. Not to mention a perceived lack of his much vaunted Christianity when it came to caring for unfortunately foreign people.\n\nRegarding the sportsman and \u2018\u2018that\u2019\u2019 picture, many many letters arrived with every possible joke about the less polite word for urination, but, seriously, not one was suitable for publication in a respectable newspaper, so we stuck with discussion about whether or not he should have been fired (generally speaking, readers are against the firing but still think he needs to go into the hall of mirrors and take a good long look at himself).\n\nHarriet Veitch Acting letters co-editor", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "SMH Letters", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "So that&rsquo;s the way you do it.
