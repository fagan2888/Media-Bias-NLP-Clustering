CLEVELAND, Ohio -- January 2014 is determined to leave its mark on the record books, and that means round two is just around the corner.

Most are dreading it.

"Last time when it hit negatives, I was stuck in my car and I was afraid the windshield would get broke or bust," said Saef Ottallah, of Lakewood.

He, like many, is hoping mother nature will spare us from another deep freeze.

Avon resident Michelle Greg is keeping a close eye on her car battery these days, and with good reason.

"My car wouldn't start, so roadside assistance came out a couple times, but they couldn't get it done so they had to take the battery out and have it charge for an hour," she said of the last arctic blast we saw.

Looking at zero degrees in the days ahead, a little preparation never hurt anybody. Some are taking it all in stride.

"I'm used to it, I'm from New England. This is great stuff, I just wish we had more snow," said George Bender.
