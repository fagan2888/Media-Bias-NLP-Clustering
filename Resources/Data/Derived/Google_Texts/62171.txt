Nautic Builds Up IPS Portfolio Company with Integra Adhesives Purchase

Recent construction acquisitions have come from Accella, Distribution International and Hennessy

Nautic Partners-backed IPS Corp. has acquired Integra Adhesives from management for an undisclosed amount. The PE firm partnered with management to purchase IPS in 2015.

Integra, based in Abbotsford, British Columbia, produces adhesive materials that are used in natural stones to build surfaces such as countertops. IPS says the acquisition will expand the company’s customer base and product offerings.

IPS, located in Compton, California, manufactures adhesives for the plumbing, construction and plastic fabrication sectors. The company owns the Weld-On, Water-Tite, Guy Gray and TrueBro brands.

Nautic is a Providence, Rhode Island-based middle market PE Firm that usually makes up to $100 million in equity investments. Earlier in 2016, the firm made an undisclosed investment in property restoration company Response Team 1 and in 2015, Nautic announced plans to buy airplane parts manufacturer Aerostar Aerospace Manufacturing LLC.

Growth in the homebuilding market is likely to increase in tandem with sales, making for attractive targets in the sector. In February, the sale of new single-family homes increased by two percent over sales recorded for January, according to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Some recent deals include Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II (Nasdaq: HCAC, HCACU and HCACW) saying it will acquire United Subcontractors Inc. (USI), a provider of insulation systems; Arsenal-backed Accella Performance Materials has purchased Quadrant Chemical Corp.’s spray foam division; and Advent-owned Distribution International added insulation distributor 3i Supply Co.
