California is throwing more money, men and material into its war with an invader: the water hyacinth. by Gene Beley, CVBT Delta CorrespondentRIO VISTAMarch 22, 2015 9:01pmCalifornia is throwing more money, men and material into its war with an invader: the water hyacinth. Christopher Conlin, deputy director of the California Department of Parks and Recreation and essentially the states general in the war against the weeds, says work began in early March to spray and harvest the hyacinth, along with sponge plant, and egeria densa. Watch a video of the meeting here. Our story continues below the video window. California war on hyacinth update by Chris Conlin to Delta Protection Commission in Rio Vista, March 19, 2015 from Gene Beley on Vimeo. Weve already covered 89 surface acres of water hyacinth, pulling out 36,000 cubic yards, and treated 300 acres for egeria densa, he told a March 19 meeting of the Delta Protection Commission in Rio Vista. And he says the days of half-hearted measures against the invasive weeds are over. We are attacking it in a more aggressive manner this year, Mr. Conlin said. We have a requirement to control the invasive species. It is a control problem  not an eradication problem. Why? Because, he said, these kinds of invasive species cannot be eradicated. They are always going to be there. Youre not going to get rid of the seeds. Even if you emptied the Delta and sprayed, you would probably not get rid of it. He also said that control efforts are limited because spraying is limited from March to November. But due to climate change, hes trying to get more flexibility in the laws to do a better job, he said. We think some of these envelopes can be pressed if we have good scientific data that shows we can do it in a safe manner and not damage the Delta. Mr. Conlin said China has been spending $1 billion a year on their hyacinth problem in a similar area. The scary thing about that is you can throw as much money as you want into it but it stays. We try to do the best we can to allow people to do what they want to do in the Delta. The way the legislation is written it directs us to go in and do the control but we are not required to cover every square inch or every area. We are required to go in and see if it is interfering with navigation, recreation, or critical infrastructure in the Delta. Then we make a call to go in and balance all those priorities. Perhaps a comparison between China and California doesnt paint the correct picture. Assemblyman Jim Frazier, D-Oakley, said the state of Florida is spending upwards of $58 million to fight the hyacinth and California is spending less than $10 million now. We dont have limitless resources, Mr. Conlin noted. No one wants us to go in heavy handed and kill all the critical species. The Delta is a unique environment. Also, he said, his departments budget has to deal with all of California, not just the Delta. Mr. Conlin said they would be using 2,4-D herbicide as one of their heavy tools on the hyacinth  but are limited to using it during about two months in the summer. This prompted Barbara Daly, a Clarksburg resident and member of North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability (also known as North Delta CARES), to ask if that chemical doesnt contain some of the ingredients of Agent Orange that has a long, lingering shadow of suspected cancer deaths and birth defects. Mr. Conlin and Edward Hard, program manager for the Aquatic Evasive Species in California, denied this claim. That might surprise organizations such as the American Cancer Society. It says that the controversial Agent Orange, sprayed over portions of the South Vietnamese countryside during the Vietnam War, used different mixes of herbicides, but most were mixtures of 2 chemicals that were phenoxy herbicides: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) [and] 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). Mr. Conlin responds, via email: "I am not a chemist, but my understanding is that 2, 4-D does not 'contain some of the ingredients of Agent Orange.' It is true that 2, 4-D was one of the herbicides used in the chemical cocktail that composed Agent Orange. However, 2, 4-D was not found to be the reactive component that caused exposure issues." Mrs. Daly told the audience and commission her concerns are about the Delta water quality since it supplies so much drinking water for Californians. On March 20, one day after the Delta Protection Commission meeting, the group Beyond Pesticides, which describes itself as a nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., which works with allies in protecting public health and the environment to lead the transition to a world free of toxic pesticides, asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop the use of the countrys most popular herbicide, glyphosate, in the wake of a finding that it causes cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity based on laboratory studies. Glyphosate is included in the herbicide brand Roundup. If this is banned, Mr. Conlin and his staff may have an even bigger headache and challenge using such chemicals to fight the war on hyacinth in the Delta. Mr. Conlin said AB 763, a law passed in 2013 dealing with control and eradication of invasive water weeds like the hyacinth, gives him and his staff the ability to better coordinate everything with federal and state partners. He said there was a history of problems in the past in trying to get the permit early enough to spray the Delta or get a green light on spraying more than just hyacinth. Because of AB 763, weve been able to get in short order two additional plants treated this year and we are trying to get funding for additional plants, he said. Other troublesome plants include egeria densa, sponge plant, and curly leaf pondweed. Youre never going to wind up with a clean Delta, said Mr. Conlin. All these species thrive in this area, particularly now in this drought. These species came from Amazon type environments and thrive in it. He added that the lack of more freezing temperatures this year also is a big change because that tended to kill a lot of the floating hyacinth and sunk it to the bottom until hot days in summer when it would again bloom. Why so much more treatment of egeria densa than hyacinth? Its pure physics, Mr. Conlin explained. When you treat the water hyacinth, you can treat only whats floating on the water. You have to be very careful about not spraying things like the elderberry bushes on shore. On the other hand, when you look at egeria densa, you are treating the water  not the plant. Youre putting the chemical into the water. Concentration will start to kill off the egeria densa. Whats different this year is we are doing a truly integrated strategy. Instead of doing a senior attack mode with herbicide, we have partnered with our federal, state and local agencies to hit this from several directions. Theres an area wide study that brings together the USDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and Fish and Wildlife to work on a long-range plan instead of a one-year hit list, he said. That opened up a whole bunch of different venues like chemical treatment. Until someone can figure out a better way, this is the best control method. By chemically treating these weeds, you stop or control their growth and from them increasing. Mechanical harvesting Last year we did our first mechanical harvesting, Mr. Conlin said. Were still working out the rough edges on it but it is going. Were also doing some removal of the hyacinth. He explained the difference with mechanical harvesting is that boats go out and cut the hyacinth and suck it into the vessels until it can be discarded elsewhere. The removal is when its put it into dump trucks. One can move around in the Delta where the other is more static unless the weeds come to it and then it lifts the invasive weed out of the water. What about bug that would eat hyacinth? This year the United States Department of Agriculture will do about 25 tests with some biologicals to see if they work, said Mr. Conlin. They tried this years ago but it was not during a drought period. The problem was when the freeze came it killed all the bugs. They think now we might have a better effect. NASA is into it, too NASA is using some high tech imaging tools to get a better read of where the plants are and what effect were having on them, said Mr. Conlin. Delta Protection Commission member Don Nottoli asked if the bugs migrate elsewhere and Mr. Conlin replied, They are plant specific. These are the insects that feast on water hyacinth in its native Amazon. They only eat the hyacinth. But the reason were starting with just 25 sites is to make absolutely sure there are no other effects, said Mr. Conlin. Any introduction of any biological can never be taken lightly. Delta farmers speak out Ten years ago we didnt have the hyacinth problem, said Mike Scriven, a member of the DPC and owner of a large farm in the Delta. Somebody was asleep at the switch. Now the boaters, marinas and farmers are all behind the eight ball. Mr. Conlin disagreed and told Mr. Scriven to look at the NASA images that tell a different story. I witnessed it, said Mr. Scriven. You can show all the pictures you want, then talk to some of the marina operators and boaters. I have a couple thousand acres on Highway 12. I cant get water out of the pipe for the first time in 40 years. We know the problem and this is the worst drought in the recorded history of California, said Mr. Conlin. We had a drought in the 1970s, too, said Mr. Scriven. Mr. Hard assisted Mr. Conlin by showing on his PowerPoint screen the status of hyacinth in 1989, 1996, 2005, 2010, and 2013, saying that proved that the current drought has had the biggest impact. Mr. Conlin said an example of a huge step forward through the cooperative efforts between various governmental agencies is that Whiskey Slough Marina has been able to install a boom at the head of the slough. It reportedly does not interfere with navigation and has been approved by law enforcement agencies that patrol the Delta. State Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, D-Stockton, has been helping to increase financial resources for the weed war. There are new funds for an additional $4 million in the Governors budget that will give Mr. Conlins department the ability to add four more boat crews and three scientists to analyze everything and develop better ways to fight the problem on a long-term basis, he said. Helping in the trenches Mr. Conlin said there are things people can do like towing the weeds out themselves. Many people thought they couldnt touch the plants, but thats not the case, he said. Pulling them out helps us in the long term. However, he said they cant get in around peoples piers and spray. There are liability issues, he said. I dont think anyone wants us around their boats and valuables if we end up damaging something. Were the heavy tool in the kit. He commended the Port of Stockton that has hired their own harvesters and said Discovery Bay created little community compacts to take care of their evasive weeds. What people cannot do, he stressed, is chemically treat this on their own. We do water sampling. If we reach higher than what we are allowed, it shuts us down. Mr. Conlin said the state is only allowed to treat 5,000 acres of egeria densa and other subsurface plants, plus 3,500 acres of water hyacinth under current regulations. Because of the way hyacinth moves, its really hard to calculate how much is getting hit by us. Were not as concerned about the upper limit yet. However, that is the reason for the scientific study. Wed like to open up some of those limitations for review. Skip Thompson, chairman of the Delta Protection Commission and a Solano County supervisor, said that all new ideas to get rid of hyacinth are welcome. Saving the Delta should be a priority. I dont want to discourage anyone from coming up with any good idea.

This is a good article. It tells the story, while also representing the viewpoints of those who are engaged in the eradication project, those who are concerned about the herbicides being used, and those who are inconvenienced by the hyacinth.

To those who are concerned about the herbicides being used, you should be. Although 2,4-D is not Agent Orange, they are both organochlorines. That means they accumulate in the fatty tissues of those who ingest it, in this case probably fish and then the animals and humans who eat those fish. This process of accumulating toxic chemicals is called bioaccumulation.

Organochlorines are also very persistent. DDT is an organochlorine. It was banned in the US in 1973, but it is still found in lake and stream sediments and in blood and other tissues of animals, including humans. Although the toxicity of the thousands of organochlorines varies, 2,4-D is classified as a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization, United Nations.

The story implies, but is not explicit about the cause of this invasion. The fact is this plant is spreading rapidly because of climate change. Both the water and the climate are warmer and are therefore promoting the growth of vegetation that is adapted to a warmer climate. Theres little point in repeatedly poisoning it unless the underlying causes of climate change are addressed. All the money wasted on these futile eradication efforts would be better spent addressing the causes of climate change. We are damaging the environment further by poisoning it (and ourselves).
