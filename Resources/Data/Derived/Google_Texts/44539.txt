Final thoughts on the Pirates one-game postseason:

Barry Bonds is reviled in Pittsburgh for many reasons and one of them is his failure to deliver in the postseasons of 1990-92 when the Pirates lost three times in the League Division Series. Bonds played in 20 postseason games with the Pirates -- six against Cincinnati and 14 against Atlanta -- and batted .191. His on-base percentage was .329 and his slugging percentage .264 (two doubles and a homer).

The three Pirates who have started in all three wildcard games the past three years have not fared much better.

PG Round Table: The post-mortem Pirates The post-mortem Pirates, who once again were blanked in the wild-card game.

Andrew McCutchen (9-for-28) has this batting line: .321/.441/.357 with no homers and no RBIs.

Neil Walker (2-for-31): .065/.121/.097 with no homers and one RBI.

Starling Marte (4 for 32): .125/.176/.250 with one homer and one RBI.

The three Pirates are a combined 14-for-87 (.161) with one home run and two RBIs.

Bonds is 13-for-68 (.191) with one home and three RBIs.

In fewer at bats, Bonds has a higher batting average, more RBIs and as many home runs.

In 20 playoff games, the 1990-92 Pirates averaged 3.2 runs. In eight playoff games, the 2013-15 Pirates averaged 2.6 runs.

The disappointment of Gerrit Cole’s performance in the 4-0 loss to Chicago Wednesday was increased by the way John Lackey, not considered on Cole’s level, handled the Cubs last night. In 7⅓ innings, Lackey held the Cubs to no runs, two hits and one walk while striking out five.

If you can find it on The Fan’s website, check out the interview with John Wehner yesterday on the Cook and Poni Show. At the end of the interview, Wehner had surprisingly strong negative words about the Pirates, unusual for a team employee. He cited a lack of urgency early in the season, both in fundamentals and running out batted balls and blamed that for the team’s poor start. He also said the lack or urgency carried out through much of the season.
