We need to be the thermostats and set the temperature,\u201d said Rob McCoy, pastor of Calvary Chapel, a few minutes\u2019 drive from the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif.\n\nFor Republicans like Mr. McCoy, who is running for a state Assembly seat, the national party has racked up decades of compromises that have led to relentless government expansion, ever-increasing spending growth, continually mounting national debt and growing intrusiveness into the private lives of Americans.\n\nFrom her George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center office in Arlington, Va., economist Veronique de Rugy looks at the objective evidence of the Republican Party\u2019s effect on limiting government.\n\n\u201cEvery president has spent more total real dollars in his last budget than in his first,\u201d she said, noting that Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson increased spending by 38 percent, but George W. Bush, twice elected on a conservative Republican platform, increased spending by 53 percent during his presidency.\n\n\u201cEven Reagan increased total spending by 22 percent\u201d over President Carter, she says on her website.\n\nSimilar disappointments are nagging at other conservatives as an expected 10,000 of them \u2014 nearly half college age \u2014 prepare to descend on Washington for the 41st annual Conservative Political Action Conference this week at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.\n\nAs always, the big question at CPAC will be over the best tactics to advance conservative ideas \u2014 specifically how often, if ever, to engage in principled but lost causes such as the filibusters that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and fellow conservatives have launched, against the wishes of the GOP\u2019s more center-right leadership in and out of Congress.\n\nLimited-government warriors such as Helen Van Etten, chief audiologist for the Topeka, Kan., school district, strongly backs Mr. Cruz and his allies. She said these conservatives are willing to risk losing legislative battles \u2014 and even their own re-election races \u2014 to mount high-profile challenges to what they see as big-government advocacy from the national news and entertainment media.\n\nMrs. Van Etten, an elected Republican National Committee member, rejects the idea that the temperature setters are interested only in blocking action in Washington.\n\nThe problem, she said from her Topeka office, is not one of action versus inaction, but that \u201cRepublicans [are] being asked to compromise. That implies that we\u2019re meeting the Democrats in the middle. What Republicans are being asked to do is capitulate completely and just give the Democrats everything they want.\u201d\n\nThe temperature setters refuse to grant the temperature takers an exclusive franchise on the pragmatic electoral concerns. Oklahoma veterinarian and RNC member Carolyn McLarty contended that the hard-liners\u2019 tactics \u201chave strengthened the base by offering a glimmer of hope that some in Congress have the guts and grit to make a difference.\u201d\n\nStanding fast on principle to block bad legislation no matter the outcome doesn\u2019t automatically conflict with pragmatic goals, said Iowa Republican Party Chairman A.J. Spiker. He insists the Ted Cruz-style filibusters and filibuster threats were not lost causes but rather \u201cmuch-needed wind in the sails of conservatives.\u201d\n\nFar from voter backlash that the thermometer faction so fears, Missouri Republican Party Chairman Ed Martin said, \u201cOur voters are glad someone is standing up to fight. It is better to fight even when you know you\u2019ll probably lose, because that way our elected Republicans show they take their limited-government promises to voters seriously and are at least taking risks to achieve change.\u201d\n\nConservative ratings\n\nIt\u2019s not that Republicans whom conservatives deride as \u201cRepublicans in name only\u201d don\u2019t talk and vote conservatively. Many of the House Republican leaders whom conservatives consider to be too moderate have strong conservative voting records.\n\nFew debates are surer to grow into heated arguments than betting that House Speaker John A. Boehner, who last year narrowly won a second term as speaker, has a liberal record. In fact, the Ohio Republican had a 90 percent American Conservative Union lifetime voting rating before he became speaker. The ACU gives a 96 rating to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and a 94 rating to Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican facing a fierce tea party challenge in his primary race this year, has a 90 percent ACU lifetime rating. The Senate\u2019s second-ranking Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, can boast of a 93 ACU voting score.\n\nTheir critics, however, say it\u2019s on unrated procedural votes and inside maneuvering that the McConnells and Cornyns differ from Mr. Cruz and allies such as Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican. Those differences lead to compromises that, to Republicans like Mrs. Van Etten, give everything to Democrats.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are taking a big risk doing that because it can turn off their base and cause [voters] to stay home this fall,\u201d she said.\n\nNot everyone agrees with the hard line against compromise.\n\nLynn A. Stout, a distinguished law and business professor at Cornell University, argues that Republicans take even bigger risks by not compromising at tactically important times, even if many in the party base perceive capitulation.\n\nFrom her Ithaca, N.Y., office, Ms. Stout said \u201csome compromise is necessary to prevent Republicans from losing influence, especially with young voters.\u201d She said polls generally show that using lost-cause filibusters such as Mr. Cruz\u2019s attempt to defund Obamacare last fall is \u201ca damaging strategy to Republicans.\u201d\n\nSen. John McCain of Arizona, the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, has accused Mr. Cruz of instigating last year\u2019s partial government shutdown and called the Texan \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nThermostat Republicans note that Mr. McCain and other critics of the Cruz filibuster failed to put any of the blame for the shutdown on Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats by rejecting bill after bill to carry on government operations during the standoff.\n\nMitt Romney, the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2012, pointedly left Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul off the list in November when he was asked to list the best available Republicans to head the ticket in 2016.\n\nOf two minds\n\nFormer Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III, who served as RNC chairman and now heads the Free Congress Foundation, said his own career shows the conflicting impulses of thermostat versus thermometer politics.\n\nMr. Gilmore has played the Republican thermostat in his political career by standing up to President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, for example, on foreign interventionism and government surveillance programs.\n\nBut Mr. Gilmore is of two minds on mounting hopeless fights in Congress over a principle. He faults Mr. Cruz, Mr. Paul and their allies for their tactics last fall.\n\n\u201cThe American people rejected the government shutdown as irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Gilmore said. \u201cThe need to climb back out of the hole Cruz and Paul put us in is the direct reason the GOP leadership postponed the substantive debate over the future of the nation.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Gilmore also said the less-confrontational approach of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill \u201chas pushed off the debate over the nation\u2019s future until after the 2014 elections.\u201d\n\nHe cited in particular the compromise spending plan fashioned by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, that conservatives have roundly criticized.\n\nBut to former Iowa Republican Party Chairman Kayne Robinson, Mr. Gilmore\u2019s claim that the government shutdown bloodied Republican noses misses the point.\n\n\u201cWhen a few Republicans like Cruz and Paul try to stop the march to socialized medicine, whether likely to succeed or not, at least they are lighting up the enemy and rallying the troops,\u201d said Mr. Robinson. \u201cThe result is a few leaders and ex-presidential candidates, apparently sore because they are off the air, attack those who are at least trying. The national media, of course, put ex-leaders back on the air.\u201d\n\nAt what is expected to be a raucous CPAC, the thermometer-thermostat tensions are likely to be on full display for the national media.\n\nDespite the spotlight, Republicans like Iowa\u2019s Mr. Robinson insist that compromise on principles is a misguided strategy and that those who stand up for the party\u2019s values are unfairly maligned.\n\nOrdinary Republicans \u201cwatch with a disbelief that turns to disdain as establishment Republicans try to personally destroy conservatives like Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, Steve King and Rand Paul for criticizing that same establishment,\u201d he said.\n\nNorquist shifts\n\nMaking the CPAC gathering even more intriguing is that Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, normally a thermostat Republican and feared enforcer of the party\u2019s no-tax pledge has come down strongly with the Senate GOP leadership in the shutdown debate.\n\nMr. Cruz \u201csaid he would deliver Democratic votes and he didn\u2019t. He pushed House Republicans into traffic and wandered off,\u201d Mr. Norquist said.\n\nMore recently, Mr. McConnell\u2019s allies hammered Mr. Cruz for seeking a filibuster on a \u201cclean\u201d bill to raise the federal debt ceiling, without extracting a single spending cut from Mr. Obama. The parliamentary move forced Mr. McConnell, Mr. Cornyn and a handful of other Republican senators to cast politically damaging votes to shut off debate, even though all 45 Republican senators voted against the measure to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nAn unrepentant Mr. Cruz said he had made his point that compromising with Democrats by giving everything they want is not what people sent Republicans to Washington to do.\n\n\u201cJust about every American understands that we can\u2019t keep going the way we\u2019re going. We\u2019re bankrupting the country. It\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cToday was a classic victory for Washington establishment interests, and the people who lost today are the American people.\u201d\n\nWhat most bugs thermostat Republicans is that their party seems to have a fatally steep learning curve.\n\nFrom violating no-tax pledges to failing to curb the growth of government, \u201ccompromising on principle keeps on costing Republicans,\u201d said Pastors and Pews founder David Lane, a Los Angeles-based conservative evangelical organizer. \u201cCompromise cost them the White House in 1992. Reagan won re-election in 1984 with 49 states; [George W. Bush] needed the U.S. Supreme Court in 2000 and Ohio in 2004.\u201d\n\nWhat most bugs Mr. McCoy, he said, is that \u201c19 people in a Wisconsin church started the Republican party to end slavery, their president got a bullet in the back of his head and 650,000 people died in the war that ended slavery. For the next 70 years, Republicans dominated the political landscape as the party of character because they lead the people.\u201d\n\nWhether Mr. McCoy is right and the GOP has become a party led by followers \u2014 temperature takers \u2014 is the question CPAC was created to address.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prominent Republicans see no evidence that their party's electoral successes have advanced the cause of limited government and moral governance.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Prominent Republicans see no evidence that their party\u2019s electoral successes have advanced the cause of limited government and moral governance.", "title": "CPAC conservatives frustrated by GOP\u2019s compromises, lack of leadership", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/2/cpac-conservatives-frustrated-by-gops-compromises-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/27/tea_20140227_016.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/27/tea_20140227_016.jpg", "description": "Prominent Republicans see no evidence that their party's electoral successes have advanced the cause of limited government and moral governance.", "card": "summary", "title": "CPAC conservatives frustrated by GOP\u2019s compromises, lack of lead"}, "Author": "Ralph Z.
