President Obama, who was inaugurated in January for his second term, finally implemented his signature health care legislation. Later in the year, the federal government shut down due to a funding war largely over that same reform. But it\u2019s also been a huge year for politicians doing and saying some truly embarrassing things. Even without the constant media attention from a presidential campaign like last year's, politicians still managed to embarass themselves in some ridiculous ways.\n\nHere are the 10 biggest political gaffes of 2013.\n\nMarco Rubio Gets Thirsty\n\n[[nid:1081124]]\n\nIn one of the most infamous moments of the year, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was asked to deliver a response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech. Rubio recorded a Spanish version of his speech first before stepping in front of the cameras to record a live English-language response. He apparently became very thirsty under the bright lights, because he suddenly lunged left and took a sip of water in the middle of his speech, resulting in one extremely awkward silence.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nGive Fetuses Guns\n\nRep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) has named himself Texas\u2019 most conservative congressman, and he wants you to know it. In April, the virulently pro-gun and pro-life Stockman combined his two favorite pet causes into one insane bumper sticker, reading \u201cIf babies had guns, they wouldn\u2019t be aborted.\u201d This one may have been less of a gaffe and more of an intentional act of provocation, however. Stockman is well known for hanging out with conservative provocateur Ted Nugent, so perhaps the two are having a bit of a laugh over all the uproar.\n\nOur campaign bumper sticker: If babies had guns, they wouldn't be aborted. http://t.co/dr3Nt9Can7 #gosnell #tcot pic.twitter.com/CVaYrQAeK9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Rep. Steve Stockman (@StockmanSenate) April 12, 2013\n\nRacism Is Over!\n\nRacism is over in America, at least according to the Republican National Convention. On Rosa Parks Day in December, the Republican National Convention implied that there are no more racists left in America, tweeting \u201cToday we remember Rosa Parks\u2019 bold stand and her role in ending racism.\u201d Understandably, the tweet caused an uproar online, leading the GOP to issue a correction claiming the tweet should have read \"Today we remember Rosa Parks' bold stand and her role in fighting to end racism.\"\n\nToday we remember Rosa Parks\u2019 bold stand and her role in ending racism. pic.twitter.com/uxIj1QmtkU \u00e2\u20ac\u201d RNC (@GOP) December 1, 2013\n\nDuck Dynasty and Rosa Parks Have a Lot in Common\n\nSpeaking of Rosa Parks, some Republicans just can\u2019t seem to stop making ridiculous comparisons to the civil rights icon. After \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Phil Robertson was suspended from the reality show for making offensive statements on homosexuality, Illinois congressional hopeful Ian Bayne compared the bearded Louisiana duck-call patriarch to Rosa Parks. In an email to supporters, Bayne wrote, \"In December 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand against an unjust societal persecution of black people, and in December 2013, Robertson took a stand against persecution of Christians.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that in the notorious GQ interview that got him fired last week, Robertson implied that African-Americans were happier in the Jim Crow era, something Rosa Parks would probably disagree with.\n\nJeb Bush Falls For Hoax\n\nWhen the Obama administration announced that it would move the United States embassy to the Vatican to a different facility, some right-wingers used the move to claim that Obama was \u201cclosing\u201d the Vatican embassy and cutting off all diplomatic ties with the Roman Catholic Church. Jeb Bush, touted as the smart one in the family, fell for the exaggerated lie and tweeted out, \u201cWhy would our President close our Embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare.\u201d In reality, the U.S. is just moving the Vatican embassy to the same building that houses the embassy to Italy, in a move expected to save more than $1 million per year.\n\nWhy would our President close our Embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 27, 2013\n\nAlaska Senator Drops Slur in Interview\n\nRep. Don Young (R-Alaska) made headlines in March when he referred to migrant Hispanic workers using the racial slur \u201cwetbacks.\u201d In an interview with Ketchikan Public Radio, Young told an anecdote about growing up on a California farm: \"My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,\" Young said. \"It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine.\u201d The 79-year-old Young never released a full apology for using the slur, though he later claimed in a statement that the term \u201cwas commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California,\" and that he \u201cmeant no disrespect.\"\n\nBiden Calls the Wrong Man Twice\n\nVice President Joe Biden is no stranger to gaffes, so this may be less of a \u201cbig f*cking deal\u201d than other moments, but it\u2019s embarrassing all the same. When Biden saw that Democratic candidate Marty Walsh had been elected mayor of Boston in November, the vice president excitedly called him up. \u201cYou son of a gun, Marty!\u201d Biden reportedly said. \u201cYou did it!\u201d Except he was talking to the wrong Marty Walsh. As it turns out, Biden called up another Marty Walsh who formerly worked for Ted Kennedy and now heads a government relations firm. After receiving the right number from the wrong Marty, Biden reportedly misdialed his phone and left a congratulatory voicemail to a woman named Toni.\n\nBest-Looking Attorney General\n\nPresident Obama drew the ire of some feminist groups after publicly commenting on the appearance of California Attorney General Kamala Harris. At a fundraiser in Silicon Valley, Obama praised Harris, stating that \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant and she\u2019s dedicated, she\u2019s tough,\u201d before adding, \u201cShe also happens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general.\u201d Obama was criticized for reducing Harris to her appearance, which he later apologized for.\n\nNevada Senator Would Vote for Slavery\n\nNevada Assemblyman Jim Wheeler (R-Gardnerville) has some interesting ideas about how a republic works. Speaking to a group of fellow Republicans, Wheeler explained that his job was to vote for whatever his constituents wanted, even if they demanded he reinstate slavery. \u201cIt that\u2019s what they wanted, I\u2019d have to hold my nose, I\u2019d have to bite my tongue and they\u2019d probably have to hold a gun to my head, but yeah... if that\u2019s what the constituency wants that elected me, that\u2019s what they elected me for,\u201d Wheeler said. Later, Wheeler apologized to the Las Vegas Sun, claiming that his words weren\u2019t meant literally.\n\nEverything Rob Ford Did in 2013\n\nPolitical gaffes in North America weren't limited to the U.S. Case in point: Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto, Canada. Rob Ford smoked crack. Rob Ford lied about smoking crack. Rob Ford admitted to smoking crack. Rob Ford called a journalist a pedophile. Rob Ford knocked over a council member at a meeting. Rob Ford got drunk and threatened to kill a man. Rob Ford said he had \u201cmore than enough to eat at home\u201d while denying that he offered a female staffer oral sex. And yes, after all that, Rob Ford is still mayor of Toronto.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "politician gaffes, political gaffes, gaffes 2013, marco rubio water, president obama gaffes, joe biden gaffes, rob ford gaffes", "og": {"url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/10-biggest-political-gaffes-2013-1518458", "site_name": "International Business Times", "type": "article", "description": "Sometimes, politicians can't help embarrassing themselves.
