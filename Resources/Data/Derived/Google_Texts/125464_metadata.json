Will the site work this time?\n\nThe second year of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment begins Saturday, and unresolved problems from the first season are complicating the already daunting task of enrolling millions of uninsured and re-enrolling millions more.\n\nThe lingering challenges involve both flawed technology and public perception of the Affordable Care Act as the Supreme Court prepares to review yet another key provision. The first season actually beat enrollment expectations, despite its disastrous start. More than 7 million people have exchange plans, and about 8.7 million were added to Medicaid. Premium increases for 2015 have generally been modest, though not all states have announced them yet. But the distrust and opposition, as the midterm elections vividly illustrated, still runs deep.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile consumers who click onto HealthCare.gov will see a cleaner, simpler application page, insurers still have headaches. They interact with the website\u2019s so-called back end, which is supposed to tell carriers who signed up and to pay out Obamacare\u2019s subsidies.\n\n( From POLITICO Pro: Full health care coverage)\n\nThat part still doesn\u2019t work as it should. Insurance industry sources say the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had sorted through about 80 percent to 85 percent of existing accounts to make sure its records match those of insurers. The agency is not likely to be done by Saturday; the latest best-case scenario is for the job to be finished by Dec. 15.\n\nThe date is key because anyone currently covered who doesn\u2019t either re-enroll or pro-actively opt out will automatically be re-enrolled in the same plan or the closest match for 2015. But with all the gaps in the system, consumers could find themselves in the wrong plan \u2014 or even enrolled in more than one plan. Nor will the health plans always know promptly if a customer dropped one plan and chose another (even though the \u201c834s\u201d \u2014 those initial enrollment files that nobody had ever heard of until they gummed things up last year \u2014 are pretty reliable now).\n\nCMS has been using cumbersome workarounds to clear up the records and calculate subsidy payments. But it\u2019s been messy, even without a wave of potentially millions of new enrollees added to the mix. The solution \u2014 a computer-facilitated automatic monthly reconciliation and payment process \u2014 fell by the wayside with last year\u2019s rollout disaster. Insurers don\u2019t expect it to come online until sometime next year.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama: 'The buck stops right here')\n\nThe administration, for its part, is much better prepared this fall to handle glitches. The tech SWAT team that made the frantic push to salvage the sign-up site last year is in the wings. Some are back at their regular Silicon Valley jobs, ready to swoop back in if they get the call from Washington. Others now work for the government, either toiling away at the new and improved HealthCare.gov or as part of a new White House-based cavalry of coders and software engineers ready to ride to a tech rescue anywhere the government needs them.\n\nThe website that serves as the primary enrollment portal for the Affordable Care Act was repaired last year, and by the end of the debut sign-up season it was working fairly well for consumers, although the pieces on which the insurance industry relies were incomplete.\n\nHealth officials working on the site on Sunday previewed for reporters a new \u201cwindow shopping\u201d feature that people should be able to use this week, to start checking out health plan options before enrollment opens. Officials said they\u2019ve met their deadlines for testing, and should be ready to go next weekend.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Texas is officially clear of Ebola)\n\nAnother total meltdown is unlikely. But even less serious problems will catapult into the headlines given the first year\u2019s calamity, when a faulty website nearly derailed President Barack Obama\u2019s top domestic achievement. Any missteps this season will be magnified by the GOP. Having a slew of problems from last year only makes the job of the Obama administration, new Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and supporters in the states more difficult.\n\nHHS officials aren\u2019t predicting perfection this year. But they and the many coders who helped in last year\u2019s rescue do say they\u2019ve done more testing this time around, and expect the site to work well. And if trouble comes, they\u2019re better prepared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the site, but I definitely will be watching the news just like everybody else,\u201d said Jason Huggins, a former Google employee who helped improve HealthCare.gov\u2019s automated testing last fall. He\u2019s been helping implement the retooled site, too \u2014 and he says he\u2019d return to the trenches if summoned.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Can D.C. get something done? Fat chance)\n\n\u201cFor a lot of us, when you hear the president needs your help, how do you say no?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you have a skill set and the country needs you, how do you say no? I expect a lot of people that I worked with would say yes again.\u201d\n\nOthers who came to join the tech surge \u2014 an exhausting, intensive six-week 24/7 operation that went right through Thanksgiving \u2014 never left. They\u2019ve moved from the rescue-squad headquarters at the DoubleTree hotel in suburban Columbia, Md., and are installed in downtown Washington offices.\n\nAndy Slavitt, who at Optum led the contractors helping to fix the ailing website, is now a top-tier CMS official. A new \u201cCEO\u201d for HealthCare.gov has been brought on, an expert who helped get both Massachusetts and Connecticut\u2019s exchanges up and running.\n\nRyan Panchadsaram, a Presidential Innovation Fellow called in last year, now works in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy as a deputy CTO.
