State health officials would need to apply to federal health officials, who may or may not grant the waiver. Before the state can even apply for it, the California Legislature must clear the way. A bill that would authorize it passed the Senate last year 28-9, but has been pending in the Assembly since last June.\n\nThere's likely to be opposition to the idea of including those immigrants living in the country without authority under a government program, even with the insurance premiums borne by those who would be insured.\n\nOpponents of SB 10, the bill that would authorize the state to seek a waiver, have questioned the legality of extending coverage to immigrants not here legally, and asked what administrative costs could be incurred in implementing the idea.\n\nCovered California spokesman James Scullary said there's no cost estimate yet for administration, but one could be developed if the legislation moves forward. It's also unclear what financial impact there would be on California participants if the insured pool increases; this would depend on the health of those newly insured, he said.\n\nImmigrants who would be most affected are adults with no option for coverage through the state exchange. Starting in mid-May, a new California law will allow youths under 19 to obtain full state-subsidized medical coverage under Medi-Cal, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nAccording to the exchange analysis, Section 1332 waivers can take effect as early as Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "State health officials could apply for a waiver to the federal Affordable Health Act to allow coverage for those in the country illegally.
