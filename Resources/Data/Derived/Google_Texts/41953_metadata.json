This January, TSA bragged about stopping an average of six firearms a day last year but now Americans aren\u2019t sure if that\u2019s a measure of success or a colossal failure,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican and member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nMr. Sasse applauded the inspector general for spotting the problems, but said the TSA will have to explain the problems in light of its previous success claims.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a full explanation for how TSA could miss weapons and explosives 95 percent of the time,\u201d he said.\n\nPHOTOS: The amazing firepower of the newest generation of guns\n\nABC News reported Monday that investigators from the Homeland Security inspector general\u2019s office had managed to sneak contraband material by TSA screeners in 67 of 70 tests they ran.\n\nThe investigators are professionals, and likely knew the best ways to exploit weaknesses, so it\u2019s not what their 95 percent failure rate translates into for actual weapons that got through.\n\n\u201cI am really surprised it took them, what, 14 years to find out their system doesn\u2019t work. I was on record from Day One that their system doesn\u2019t work and can\u2019t work,\u201d said airline security expert Rafi Sela, president of AR Challenges, who said the TSA does a poor job of trying to weed out would-be problem travelers and doesn\u2019t train and test its screeners.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it is dependent on a pair of eyes of a human being looking at a screen \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest flaw of all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think that the screener can spot anything then you are mistaken, and it\u2019s been proved. They can\u2019t spot anything. I have told this to the TSA several times over the years and they don\u2019t want to listen.\u201d\n\nMr. Sela said the 95 percent failure rate isn\u2019t new.\n\n\u201cFrom Day One the system never got below 95 percent failure. But nobody acknowledged it and nobody published it,\u201d he said.\n\nSecurity experts say the TSA doesn\u2019t have to be perfect in spotting guns or other weapons, just good enough to be a deterrent to a terrorist. But Bruce Schneier, a technology and security expert who\u2019s been a frequent critic of the TSA, wrote on his blog that the new reported failure rate is worrisome.\n\n\u201cA 95% failure rate is bad, because you can build a plot around sneaking something past the TSA,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe TSA referred questions about the failure rate to the main Homeland Security Department, which oversees the agency. A spokesman there declined to comment for the record, pointing to Secretary Jeh Johnson\u2019s extensive statement released late Monday in which he said he\u2019d \u201creassigned\u201d the TSA\u2019s acting chief and announced a series of immediate steps to retrain screening officers and retest equipment.\n\nHe also again touted the high seizure rates of weapons as evidence of success.\n\n\u201cI continue to have confidence in the TSA workforce,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cLast fiscal year TSA screened a record number of passengers at airports in the United States, and, at the same time, seized a record number of prohibited items.\u201d\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest tried to blame Senate Republicans for stalling on the nomination of Coast Guard Admiral Peter Neffenger, who was tapped by Mr. Obama in late April to lead the TSA.\n\n\u201cHe is somebody who is eminently qualified for this position,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cAnd in the several weeks since he has been nominated, he\u2019s been given one congressional hearing. We would like to see Congress act more quickly to confirm him and allow him to get on the job.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter pointed out that it took the White House more than six months to choose Adm. Neffenger to fill the job opening, Mr. Earnest replied, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve found that right person, we would ask the Senate to move quickly to get it done.\u201d\n\nThe Senate held a confirmation hearing for Adm. Neffenger two weeks ago. Senators are now awaiting his written responses to questions, and will move on his nomination at that time, a GOP aide said.\n\n\u2981 Dave Boyer contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week's report that the Transportation Security Agency failed to spot 95 percent of contraband weapons snuck through in tests of airport screeners comes just a few months after the agency bragged about the good job it was doing in sniffing out guns and other weapons.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "This week\u2019s report that the Transportation Security Agency failed to spot 95 percent of contraband weapons snuck through in tests of airport screeners comes just a few months after the agency bragged about the good job it was doing in sniffing out guns and other weapons.", "title": "TSA bragged about gun seizure success rate ahead of new failure report", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/2/tsa-bragged-gun-seizure-rate-ahead-failure-report/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/14/4a904594c0fdac10730f6a706700140f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/14/4a904594c0fdac10730f6a706700140f.jpg", "description": "This week's report that the Transportation Security Agency failed to spot 95 percent of contraband weapons snuck through in tests of airport screeners comes just a few months after the agency bragged", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "TSA bragged about gun seizure success rate ahead of new failure report"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Transportation Security Administration, Rafi Sela, Ben Sasse"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc967\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA 95% failure rate is bad, because you can build a plot around sneaking something past the TSA,\u201d he wrote.\nThe TSA referred questions about the failure rate to the main Homeland Security Department, which oversees the agency.\nI have told this to the TSA several times over the years and they don\u2019t want to listen.\u201dMr. Sela said the 95 percent failure rate isn\u2019t new.\nBut Bruce Schneier, a technology and security expert who\u2019s been a frequent critic of the TSA, wrote on his blog that the new reported failure rate is worrisome.\nThe investigators are professionals, and likely knew the best ways to exploit weaknesses, so it\u2019s not what their 95 percent failure rate translates into for actual weapons that got through."}
