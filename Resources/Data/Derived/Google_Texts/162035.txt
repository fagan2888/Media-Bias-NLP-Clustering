Stop attacking Trump, letting Clinton off hook

On May 15, The News printed three anti-Donald Trump letters with no countering views. Columnists blast Trump with their unanswered opinions.

Trump speaks ill of women? How about a woman enabler to a president who introduced the nation to oral sex in the Oval Office and then termed all her husband’s women “bimbos”?

Trump’s honesty is an issue? How about all the lies used by Hillary Clinton and President Obama regarding emails, Benghazi, the Iran deal, Obamacare, etc.?

Reporters are tearing into Trump’s life going back 40 years. Where was the same vigor when Obama was relevant, or Clinton now?
