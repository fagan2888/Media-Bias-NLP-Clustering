Liraglutide most recently obtained FDA approval for the treatment of obesity in December 2014 (under the brand name Saxenda) and was already approved as a medication for Type 2 diabetes in 2010 (as Victoza).\n\nThe study subjects were divided into three groups: 423 who received a daily 3.0-milligram dose of liraglutide; 211 given a 1.8-milligram dose; and 212 given a placebo. All were given their treatment subcutaneously, or under the skin \u2014 similar to how an insulin shot is often delivered.\n\nThe participants weighed on average around 230 pounds, entered the study with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27 or over, and throughout the course of the study were all placed on a diet that lowered their daily caloric intake by 500 calories and an exercise regimen that involved more than 150 minutes of physical activity a week.\n\nBy the end of the study \u2014 which included a 12 week-long observational period afterwards \u2014 the 3.0-mg group lost, on average, 6 percent of their original weight (14.1 pounds), the 1.8 group lost 4.7 percent (11 pounds), and the control group lost 2 percent (4.8 pounds). In addition, 54.3 percent of the 3.0-mg group lost at least 5 percent body weight, compared to 21.4 percent of the control group, and 10 percent weight loss occurred in 25.2 percent of the 3.0-mg group, compared to 6.7 percent of the latter.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first study specifically designed to investigate the efficacy of liraglutide for weight management in patients with type 2 diabetes and also the first study to investigate liraglutide at the higher 3.0-mg dose in a population with type 2 diabetes,\u201d the authors concluded. \u201cIn the present trial, liraglutide (3.0 mg), as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, was effective and generally well tolerated and was significantly better than placebo on all 3 co-primary weight-related end points.\u201d\n\nThough Saxenda (the highest dose being 3.0-mg) is meant to be used for obesity treatment, it currently isn\u2019t advised for those with diabetes. And while this current study didn\u2019t find any lasting side effects, several previous studies of animals who were given high doses of Saxenda found an increased risk of developing thyroid tumors, some of which became cancerous. It\u2019s enough of a concern that Saxenda\u2019s warning label recommends that those with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer not take the drug.\n\nStill, the researchers are encouraged, if cautious, about their results. \u201cFurther studies are needed to evaluate longer-term efficacy and safety,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSource: Davies M, Bergenstai R, Bode B, et al.
