A Planned Parenthood official says Kansas hasn't cut off Medicaid reimbursements even though Republican Gov. Sam Brownback declared two months ago that he'd quickly end the funding.

Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri President Laura McQuade told The Associated Press on Wednesday that her organization is still providing services to Medicaid participants — and getting state reimbursements — at five clinics in Kansas and the Kansas City, Missouri, area.

The vocal anti-abortion governor declared in January during his annual State of the State speech that Kansas would deny the funding to Planned Parenthood. In a letter, he directed state health officials to "take all necessary steps" to end the funding.

Brownback's spokeswoman said she was looking into the situation Wednesday. Other states have faced court fights over the issue.
