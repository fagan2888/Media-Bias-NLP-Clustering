SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (AP) - State officials have set a tentative date for a quarantine to be lifted at Sunland Park Racetrack, which has been caught in an outbreak of an equine herpes virus.

The racetrack announced that the New Mexico Livestock Board says the quarantine will end Wednesday and horses will be allowed on and off the property.

The news comes after a horse tested positive for the virus last week.

The infected horse was not entered to race but others in neighboring stables were. Those horses have been quarantined as a precaution.

The outbreak at the track along the Texas-New Mexico border began in January. More than 70 horses in New Mexico have been infected and two cases have been documented in El Paso County, Texas.

The virus poses no threat to humans.
