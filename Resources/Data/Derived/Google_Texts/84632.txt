One of the goals Montreal electro-funk duo Chromeo had for its fourth album, “White Women,” was to reconnect with fans who enjoyed the group’s earlier work.

“We wanted to reconnect with fans that discovered us in ’06-’07 when our record ‘Fancy Footwork’ connected with a bigger audience,” Chromeo singer/guitarist David Macklovitch, also known as Dave 1, tells Billboard at the 2014 Bonnaroo. “We didn’t lose a lot of them, but people have such sort attention spans that we felt like if we did a big South by Southwest grind it would be a show of good faith for us — and it really worked.”



Macklovitch describes “White Women” as the duo “opening the Chromeo matrix.”



“[Synth player Patrick "P-Thugg" Gemayel] and I always operated in a bubble for three albums and once we established that whole language, we felt like showing people it wasn’t an inside joke between the both of us, but it was really kind of a style of music we could export to other voices,” he says. “My voice sits in a certain register and you’ve got somebody like [Toro Y Moi] who sits in a whole other register. He’s cool, indie and funky, but people for some reason never pictured the fact that we could gel on a track the way we did.”



Chromeo also collaborated with A$AP Ferg on the video for "Jealous (I Ain't With It).” Macklovitch explained how the group got the rapper to appear in the clip.



“My brother A-Trak (Alain Macklovitch) runs Fool’s Gold and Fool’s Gold is actually the first to ever put on an A$AP Ferg show,” he explains. “The minute his ‘Kissin’ Pink’ verse came out on the first Rocky mixtape, my brother zeroed in on him and was like, ‘We’re going to book you at our first Christmas party.’ Ferg has been a fan ever since. We like the idea that we’re probably the only band right now that can get Soko and Ferg in the same video.”
