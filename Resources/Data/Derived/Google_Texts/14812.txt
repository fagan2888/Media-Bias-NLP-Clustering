“This is what you would look like if you were standing behind Jay Leno as he was doing his monologue,” Christie joked to Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” on Friday night.

ADVERTISEMENT “If you’re used to talking, it’s awkward not to talk, so if you’re standing there, I’m listening. What are you supposed to look like?”

“I would move to the right maybe four feet and get out of the way and let Jay Leno talk,” Fallon replied.

Fallon pulled out a cardboard cutout of Christie and set it behind the New Jersey governor for emphasis.

“You don’t find that distracting?” Fallon asked.

“He looks serious. He’s listening,” Christie said.

Christie made headlines and shocked pundits when he endorsed Trump in February, after heavily criticizing him in the past.

The New Jersey governor since appeared on the campaign trail with Trump.

“I thought really hard” about the endorsement, Christie said. “It wasn’t like I drew it out of a hat or something, Jimmy. It was my judgement that I thought he was better than the other two.”

Fallon asked Christie about rumors he may be Trump’s pick for vice president.

“I have a hard time believing anybody would be asking me to be vice president because of that,” he said, pointing to the cardboard cutout behind him.

“When you’re vice president, that’s basically what you do. I’ve got to get better at it then that, obviously.”
