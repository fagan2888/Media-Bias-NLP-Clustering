Available jobs are increasingly going to equally qualified applicants, the types that were once just a thing of Hollywood movies-- robots.\n\nConsider the irony: Millennials are coming of age in a world where the one thing they understand better than any other generation\u2014technology\u2014may well be the thing that hurts them most of all.\n\nRelated: Good Jobs Report Leaves Many Millennials Out\n\nIt\u2019s all part of what leading tech gurus say is an urgent need for society to transform the way it views jobs.\n\nGoogle cofounder Larry Page, for example, says one antidote for high unemployment is to view employment differently; if people prefer not to work 24/7, \u201cjust reduce work time,\u201d but don\u2019t consider part time a negative.\n\nThe Google CEO\u2019s work-less, do-better mentality was laid out in a Thursday interview with fellow Google pioneer Sergey Brin conducted by billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla.\n\nHis take may seem counterintuitive, especially at a time when young people are still struggling to find work in the wake of the recession.\n\nRelated: The Rise of Robots and the Decline of Jobs is Here\n\nThe June jobs report, boasting an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, shows positive signs of economic growth. But the snapshot is not as sunny for young adults. Those between the ages of 18 to 34 have an unemployment rate of 9 percent (higher if you count those who have given up looking) \u2014which leaves many sitting around twiddling their thumbs.\n\nPage acknowledges that people aren\u2019t happy if they have too much idle time, saying that that most want to \u201cfeel like they are needed\u201d and \u201chave something productive to do.\u201d\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t believe the answer to that need is necessarily a job. At least, not a full time one. Recalling a recent discussion with Richard Branson, Page discussed the English business magnate\u2019s solution to companies\u2019 unwillingness to bring on new employees: hire two part-time workers instead of one full-time worker. Recognizing it would come at slightly higher costs to employers, Page argued that it would be beneficial for younger people just starting their careers. \u201cAt least the young people can have a half-time job rather than no job,\u201d said Page.\n\nAs he sees it, it\u2019s what people want\u2014a healthy work-life balance. \u201cMost people like working,\u201d said Page, \u201cbut they would also like to have more time with their family or [time to pursue] their own interests.\u201d\n\nNo surprise: Most people would like an extra week of vacation. \u201c100 percent of people,\u201d said Page. He challenges the idea that people need to work as much as they do, calling it a \u201csocietal problem,\u201d and one that many don\u2019t recognize as a problem.\n\nRelated: The New Playbook That Taps a $200 Billion Millennial Market\n\nIf you think making such a strong argument that part time work could be the equal to full time is out of the box thinking, well think again. Or think about the coming robot revolution.\n\n\u201cEventually no human will have to work at all,\u201d said Marshall Brain, founder of How Stuff Works and author of Robotic Nation. \u201cTherefore, we should redesign our society so that everyone is on perpetual vacation.\u201d\n\nFrom parking lot attendees, to toll booth collectors, to drugstore cashiers, robotic automated machines are already freeing up more of people\u2019s time.\n\nThey get the job done, and usually\u2014they don\u2019t talk back.\n\nThe question many fear, particularly millennials, is whether these robots will make the already challenging job search even more of a challenge. Brain says yes\u2014absolutely, yes.\n\nRelated: We\u2019re One Step Closer to Robots on the Battlefield\n\n\u201cEventually, robots will equal and then surpass human capabilities,\u201d said Brain in an interview, \u201cand they will take a lot of jobs much sooner than we might expect.\u201d\n\nBrain, who admits he\u2019s on the extreme side of the spectrum, makes a controversial and bold prediction: \u201cWithin a couple of decades, there won\u2019t be a single job that robots can\u2019t do better than humans.\u201d\n\nRobots haven\u2019t just moved in on low-wage and entry-level jobs, but all the way up the chain to the likes of law clerks and doctors.\n\nRobots are already helping the best and brightest do what they do even better. A surgical technology called Firefly elevates doctors\u2019 ability to remove kidney tumors more safely and more efficiently at Georgetown University Hospital. An unmanned ground vehicle called MAARS (Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System) has been used to drag injured soldiers out of combat zones and monitor security in remote areas. A humanoid robot called Robonaut 2 aboard the International Space Station can perform simple tasks such as flipping switches and grabbing objects, relieving some of the challenging spacewalks required of astronauts.\n\nRelated: Robots Take Caregiving to a Whole New Level\n\nBut the breakthroughs haven\u2019t come without the roadblocks. \u201cRight now,\u201d said Page, \u201cwe feel like computers are still pretty bad.\u201d\n\nAdmitting that not all of Google\u2019s attempts at technological advancement have been successful, Page pointed to Google\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m Felling Lucky\u2019 feature, which was intended to allow users to skip the search results and go straight to the answer. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t want to ask questions, maybe you just want to have it answered before you ask it,\u201d said Page. \u201cThat would be better.\u201d\n\nBrain predicts that the first true circuit breaker will be when robots can see, rather than think, like humans. \u201cComputer science hasn\u2019t figured out a solution to the general vision problem yet, but as soon as that gets figured out, it opens up this huge range of jobs for replacement that have been immune to replacement for a long time,\u201d said Brain.\n\nOn that list: most remaining factory jobs, along with the fast food, retail and construction industries. \u201cIf we just take those sectors,\u201d said Brain, \u201cthat\u2019s tens of millions of jobs.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Robot Reality\u2014Service Jobs Are Next to Go\n\nTake leading retailer Walmart, which currently employs over 2 million people. Many of those jobs entail helping customers check out, stocking the shelves, mopping the floors, and picking up carts from the parking lot. \u201cWe are close to being able to automate these things now,\u201d says Brain. \u201cBut with a good vision system, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nAccording Brin, who leads the hush-hush R&D division known as Google X, cutting-edge machine learning is already capable of taking inputs such as vision\u2014which is currently being used for Google\u2019s self-driving cars.\n\nGoogle recently acquired DeepMind Technologies, a London-based startup focusing on artificial intelligence research that seeks to achieve tasks such as recognizing words in human speech or faces in video. \u201cIn theory,\u201d said Brin, \u201cwe hope it will one day be fully reasoning [artificial intelligence].\u201d\n\nKey word: hope.\n\nMany dispute Brain\u2019s claim that Robots can ever truly, well, have brains.\n\nRelated: The Robot Revolution Rips Up Our Social Contract\n\n\u201cComputer scientists have been promising that for decades and not at all delivered,\u201d said Brin during Thursday\u2019s discussion. \u201cSo I think it would be foolish for us to make prognoses about that.\u201d\n\nAlthough machine learning has never reached its speculated potential, Brin predicts it very well could down the road. \u201cYou should presume that some day we will be able to make machines that can reason and think and do things better than we can,\u201d said Brin.\n\nSo, for now, millennials need not worry too much about a robot having a better resume, or seeing the problem more clearly. For now.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin recently sat down with billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla for an interview.", "title": "Millennials vs. Robots\u2014Who Will Win the Jobs?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/08/Millennials-vs-Robots-Who-Will-Win-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062011_McD_Robot_2_cropped_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/08/Millennials-vs-Robots-Who-Will-Win-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062011_McD_Robot_2_cropped_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin recently sat down with billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla for an interview.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Good Jobs Report Leaves Many Millennials OutIt\u2019s all part of what leading tech gurus say is an urgent need for society to transform the way it views jobs.\nRelated: The Rise of Robots and the Decline of Jobs is HereThe June jobs report, boasting an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, shows positive signs of economic growth.\nJoining the workforce in the age of pizza-delivering drones and self-driving cars is easier said than done, especially for millennials.\nAvailable jobs are increasingly going to equally qualified applicants, the types that were once just a thing of Hollywood movies-- robots.\nSo, for now, millennials need not worry too much about a robot having a better resume, or seeing the problem more clearly."}
