Working from his State of the Union speech \u2013 which outlined what his budget specified Monday \u2013 TPC found that poor households would bring in about 1.2 percent more income each year and get a tax cut of nearly $600, while taxes for the rich would increase but stay about the same for middle incomes. But the TPC also found that the middle class is rapidly vanishing: their share of the nation\u2019s wealth has plunged over the last 20 years even though the number of those households barely budged, while the number of very rich and very poor households both increased.\n\nSeven Things: Obama\u2019s 2016 federal budget is a bound volume about the size of a phone book (remember them?) packed with charts, statistics and explainers only an accountant could love. So U.S. News\u2019 Andrew Soergel broke it down into the seven things you most need to know out of the $3.9 trillion budget. The takeaway: the president wants the revenue collected from a one-time 14 percent overseas earnings tax to rebuild infrastructure, specifically a six-year, $478 billion program that would upgrade a surface transportation system badly in need of repair and significant investment.\n\nBudget 101: It\u2019s a confusing process, this budget stuff: who gets to spend what, and how it all happens, can seem as puzzling as Pete Carroll\u2019s Super Bowl call to throw instead of run for the winning touchdown on 2nd and one. Fortunately, your guide to the federal budget process this year comes courtesy of the Mormon Democrats blog, which \u2013 despite its ideological handle \u2013 does a good job simplifying the process, \u201cto help dispel partisan rhetoric and break down unfounded talking points.\u201d\n\nMansplaining 202: Invited on CNBC to discuss his position on vaccinations and how he approached family members to a medical board on which he served as chairman, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and 2016 presidential contender, scolded anchor Kelly Evans for a \u201cslanted\u201d interview when things didn\u2019t go to his liking: \u201cYou have taken an interview and you\u2019ve made an interview into something where we got no useful information because you were argumentative and you started out with so many [presuppositions] that were incorrect.\u201d Paul then went on to declare the interview was no fair, and the anchor was mean to him so he\u2019d think long and hard before he\u2019d ever do another one with her. But not before, during the interview, he told Evans to \u201ccalm down\u201d and made a gesture that launched a thousand feminist tweets:\n\n\"Edith, stifle yourself.\u201d \u2014 Rand Paul pic.twitter.com/7cqIthd3dn \u2014 Mike Nellis (@MikeNellis) February 2, 2015\n\nTweet of the Day, Measles Edition:\n\nThe Daily Cartoon by @EmilyFlake: http://t.co/soo6dEhpDI pic.twitter.com/tWDGExx1wf \u2014 The New Yorker (@NewYorker) February 2, 2015\n\nDrawn Conclusion:\n\nDana Summers/Tribune Content Agency", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Honey, Who Shrunk The Middle Class?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Obama\u2019s Robin Hood budget helps the poor and Rand defends his stand, but gets caught mansplaining in the process.", "title": "Last Call: Honey, Who Shrunk The Middle Class?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/02/02/last-call-honey-who-shrunk-the-middle-class", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d3/05/274e1c274d8488697d1705889bed/150202-obama-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama\u2019s Robin Hood budget helps the poor and Rand defends his stand, but gets caught mansplaining in the process.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Last Call: Honey, Who Shrunk The Middle Class?"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Feb. 2, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
