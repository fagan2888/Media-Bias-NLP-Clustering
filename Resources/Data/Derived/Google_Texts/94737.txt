Following Recent Fund Close, Swander Pace Buys Soft Gelcap Maker Captek from Prairie and Skyline

Since 2014, the PE firm has bought Recochem and sold Gilchrest & Soames

Middle-market private equity firm Swander Pace Capital has completed the purchase of Captek Softgel International from Prairie Capital and Skyline Global Partners.

Captek, located in Cerritos, California, makes soft capsules that are used mostly in vitamin and mineral products. The target works with more than 200 brands. Prairie and Skyline acquired Captek in 2011.

“Softgels are growing even faster due to their multiple end-use applications, high potency and ease of swallowing,” says Swander Pace managing director Mark Poff. Kirkland & Ellis LLP represented Swander Pace. For on M&A in the vitamins sector, see Supplement Deals Flourish, Even After Investigations.

Swander Pace closed a $350 million fund in 2014. Some of the firm’s notable deals since include the investment in chemical products company Recochem Inc. and the sale of hotel bath products distributor Gilchrist & Soames to Sysco Corp. (NYSE: SYY).
