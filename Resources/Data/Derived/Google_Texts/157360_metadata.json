They also cherish tight-knit communities: neighborhoods, voluntary organizations, and religious congregations.\n\nTo some critics this looks like conservative incoherence. Aren\u2019t tight-knit communities the antithesis of rugged individuals? To others\u2014better versed in the basics of character formation in a free society and in what Tocqueville called \u201cthe art of association\u201d\u2014the conservative celebration of the individual and community appears quite sensible: it takes strong individuals to build flourishing communities and flourishing communities to nourish strong individuals.\n\nThis leads to a more fundamental difficulty. How do conservatives, whose very designation proclaims their inclination to preserve that which is time-honored, embrace free societies? After all, freedom encourages individuals to depart from established beliefs and practices and authorizes them to make their own way in the world. Isn\u2019t tradition one thing and liberty quite another?\n\nIn most times and places, liberty and tradition have been at loggerheads. But America\u2019s great experiment in constitutional self-government forged an alliance between them. The American founders were Englishman and Puritans, or Deist descendants of Puritans. Both their political and religious heritage taught them the sanctity of the individual and the imperative of limited government.\n\nLimiting government to protect individual freedom is the precious inheritance of the American constitutional tradition. Conserving that legacy is American conservatism\u2019s unifying task.\n\nIt is an appreciation of this task that lies at the core of Charles Cooke\u2019s first-rate contribution, \u201cThe Conservatarian Manifesto,\u201d to the robust debate within conservative circles about the future of conservatism. A writer at National Review and a proud immigrant to the United States from his native Britain, Cooke sets forth with vigor and subtlety a summons to conservatives to unite around the \u201ctimeless principles\u201d that inform the American founding. In applying those principles to a host of prominent issues of public policy, he demonstrates refreshing common sense, a confident command of empirical realities, and savvy political judgment.\n\nWhat, specifically, does Cooke advise conservatives in America to conserve? His answer embraces the fundamentals of freedom: \u201cproperty rights; separation of powers; hard limits on the power of the state; staunch protections of the rights of conscience, assembly, speech, privacy, and self-protection; a preference for local governance over central planning; a free and dynamic market economy that permits rapid change and remarkable innovation; and, above all, a distrust of any government that would step in to answer questions that can be better resolved by civil society.\u201d\n\nCooke\u2019s is an optimistic vision, and he has written an optimistic book about a conservative movement that in his judgment has in important respects lost its way. President Obama\u2019s job approval rating has been below 50 percent for more than a year and half; his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, is even more unpopular than he; and four months ago in the November elections the president\u2019s party suffered substantial setbacks in the House, the Senate, state legislative chambers, and gubernatorial offices. Yet Republicans are not particularly popular, either.\n\nPart of the problem is confusion within conservative ranks. What Cooke calls the conservative branch of the conservative movement, but is better referred to as traditionalist, has not always upheld fiscal restraint. Moreover, on some issues close to their heart\u2014abortion, same-sex marriage, drugs\u2014the traditionalists have turned to government to legislate their moral positions. Meanwhile, the libertarian branch often ignores the moral prerequisites of freedom, and too frequently proposes policy as if it were legislating for a country where expectations have not been molded by more than three-quarters of a century of an ever-expanding welfare state.\n\nWhat is needed\u2014in the spirit of National Review eminence Frank Meyer\u2019s influential 1962 book, \u201cIn Defense of Freedom\u201d\u2014is a fusion of the best of the social conservative and libertarian elements that overcomes the typical errors of each.\n\nCooke the fusionist, or \u201cconservatarian,\u201d embraces the formula of Ronald Reagan, who \u201creduced taxes, cut regulations, and relentlessly attacked the popular conceit that the answer to the nation\u2019s problems was invariably more government intervention,\u201d while recognizing that new times require new applications of that formula. For Cooke, as for Reagan, the essence of conservatism is limited government.\n\nBut that does not, Cooke emphasizes, imply indifference to the moral questions. To the contrary, proponents of limited government, he argues, regard the virtues and moral beliefs as of the first importance, and therefore reserve the people\u2019s responsibility for them and seek to assign legislation that touches them most directly to the level of government nearest to the people.\n\nWhereas progressivism, according to Cooke, \u201cis built on the core belief that an educated and well-staffed central authority can determine how citizens should live their lives,\u201d Cooke\u2019s conservatarian is a federalist who wishes, in conformity with the Constitution\u2019s design, to decentralize power. Federalism promotes genuine diversity by offering Americans in different regions with varying sensibilities the opportunity to \u201cthrive on their own terms.\u201d\n\nThe conservative defense of federalism is not, as progressive critics and some misguided conservatives contend, anti-government. Rather, it strives to keep federal and local government focused on their proper tasks. Accordingly, the principled federalist whole-heartedly affirms the federal government\u2019s constitutionally mandated responsibility to protect constitutionally proclaimed rights and uphold federal law everywhere in the United States.\n\nCrucial to Cooke\u2019s agenda for reform is a renewal of appreciation of the Constitution\u2019s structure and purpose, starting with its separation of powers, which by design seeks to slow down decision-making, promote deliberation, and raise the likelihood that major legislation enjoys broad, deep and enduring popular support.\n\nCooke is well aware that the American cultural elite\u2014academia, journalism, Hollywood\u2014is dominated by left-liberalism. He urges the right to build alternative institutions. Or rather\u2014since conservatives dominate talk radio, Fox leads in cable news, and the Internet and social media have shattered the left\u2019s role as the gatekeeper of all the news that\u2019s fit to report\u2014Cooke calls on conservatives to continue the work already under way.\n\nThe field of education presents particularly daunting challenges. Cooke counsels conservatives to be aggressive in making the case for a classical liberal education built around study of the great books. They should also, in his view: support alternative paths outside the university to career success, such as vocational training; champion school choice; and seek to reduce the centralization and monotony of public education while orienting it more toward teaching students the basics\u2014reading, writing, arithmetic, as well as the principles of political freedom.\n\nCooke vigorously defends the right of citizens to own and carry guns, and not only because the right to bear arms is enshrined in the Constitution. Since the late 1980s, he notes, support for this right has increased significantly. And even as gun controls have been loosened, gun-related crime has fallen significantly.\n\nCooke expresses doubts that the federal government has any legitimate authority to regulate recreational drugs. His preferred approach affirms that the use of such drugs is a matter of individual choice\u2014a choice he deplores\u2014while assigning their regulation to the states.\n\nHe rejects the widespread opinion that social issues are lost causes for conservatives. True, the data indicate that sooner rather than later, same-sex marriage, now legal in 37 states, will be legal throughout the country\u2014an outcome of which Cooke approves. Moreover, though a clear majority of the country favors preserving a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy during the first trimester, support for the pro-life view is slowly on the rise. One reason, Cooke observes trenchantly, is that the pro-life stance has no essential link to religious views or even social conservatism. It is grounded in opposition to murder and the belief, bolstered by the increasingly common use of sonograms since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, that the unborn child is a human being.\n\nOn immigration, Cooke faces a tough divide between traditionalists who want the country to control its borders and to calibrate immigration to the nation\u2019s social and economic needs, and libertarians who favor open borders and the free flow of people. Cooke would refocus the debate around the policies that serve the interests of ordered liberty in America. This involves shifting decisions about immigration away from questions of family and instead placing the emphasis on \u201cprofessional skills\u201d and \u201cpersonal virtues.\u201d It also requires reshaping policy so that it encourages assimilation rather than social balkanization. Cooke denies that Republicans can only avoid electoral disaster by adopting the Democrats\u2019 vision for comprehensive immigration reform. Hispanic voters, he points out, are diverse and their views are various.\n\nIn foreign policy, Cooke advocates a prudent internationalism. He criticizes President Obama\u2019s exploitation of the exhaustion Americans felt after Iraq to foster the view that America should mind its own business internationally. But Cooke does not wish to revive the Bush administration\u2019s aggressive promotion of freedom and democracy.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the American constitutional tradition has always embodied a powerful \u201cnoninterventionist instinct,\u201d he argues that after World War II, nonintervention became \u201ca luxury that the United States,\u201d having achieved superpower status, \u201ccould no longer afford.\u201d In agreement with Bret Stephens\u2019 recent book, \u201cAmerica in Retreat,\u201d Cooke maintains that America\u2019s proper international role is one of global policeman. If not the United States, who would maintain the international order, keep the sea lanes open and skies safe, and resist the spread of totalitarianism?\n\nCooke\u2019s conservatarian manifesto reflects the spirit of James Madison, Edmund Burke, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Friedrich Hayek. One could worry that his conservative defense of freedom overlooks the extent to which conservative hopes today depend not only on conserving and improving but also on restoring, and that it understates the paradoxes involved in reconciling liberty and tradition. Such worries, however, should be used to refine and fortify Cooke\u2019s judicious ideas for keeping the country hospitable to both cowboys and community.\n\nPeter Berkowitz is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
