He finished the regular season with six picks. Credit: Getty Images\n\nBy of the\n\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n\nGive the game ball to Joe Rudolph, UW's offensive coordinator/offensive line coach.\n\nWith starting right guard Walker Williams out with an unspecified injury suffered against Northwestern, the staff decided to shift right tackle Beau Benzschawel to right guard and give Jacob Maxwell his second start at right tackle.\n\nIt must be noted that Minnesota was without its top three defensive tackles because of injuries, but nevertheless UW's line, tight ends and fullbacks dominated the line of scrimmage.\n\nThe Badgers, who entered the day 10th in the Big Ten in rushing at 138.2 yards per game, rushed 35 times for 199 yards and four touchdowns \u2014 in the first half.\n\nMinnesota's linebackers came downhill against the run more in the second half and UW coach Paul Chryst acknowledged afterward he got a bit too conservative calling plays.\n\nAs a result, UW rushed 27 times for just 58 yards after halftime to finish with 257 yards on 62 carries.\n\nThe damage was done in the first half and that allowed UW to prevail against the Gophers for the 12th consecutive time.\n\nOFFENSIVE\n\nPLAY OF THE GAME\n\nTailback Dare Ogunbowale entered the regular-season finale with a college-high rushing total of 117 yards on 18 carries in UW's victory over Nebraska.\n\nOgunbowale surpassed that in the first half Saturday when he rushed 19 times for 131 yards.\n\nThe former walk-on ran hard, made defenders miss and got just about every yard he could.\n\nHis cleanest run came late in the first half to help UW take a 28-14 lead.\n\nUW ran the ball on five consecutive plays after a Minnesota turnover and faced second and 6 at the Gophers' 18. Ogunbowale, who had carries of 15, 4 and 4 yards on the drive, took a handoff from Joel Stave and bounced to the outside of left tackle Tyler Marz.\n\nHe picked up a key kick-out block from tight end Troy Fumagalli and outran the defense to the end zone.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAY OF THE GAME\n\nUW linebacker Joe Schobert entered the day with four forced fumbles in 11 games.\n\nHis fifth of the season helped turn the momentum, and the game, in UW's favor in the second quarter.\n\nWith the score tied, Minnesota took over at its 16 after a UW punt. Quarterback Mitch Leidner ran the ball on the third play of the possession and Schobert came in from the side and ripped the ball loose just before Leidner's knee hit the ground.\n\nThe ball popped into the arms of cornerback Darius Hillary at the Minnesota 34 with 6:32 left in the first half.\n\nThe call was upheld by a booth review and Taiwan Deal scored on a 13-yard run four plays later to break the 14-14 tie.\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS\n\nPLAY OF THE GAME\n\nMinnesota's last real hope to rally for a victory ended with a botched onside kick.\n\nThe Gophers had just driven for a 72 yards on five plays for a touchdown to pull within 31-21 with 5 minutes 33 seconds left in the game. Kicker Andrew Harte lined up on the left side of the Minnesota formation and hit a hopper toward the right sideline.\n\nThe ball bounced over the heads of several UW players and a Minnesota player hoping to recover the kick, failed to go the required 10 yards and went out of bounds.\n\nUW took over at the Minnesota 37, and although the Badgers didn't score the Gophers failed to score on their final two possessions, the second of which ended with an interception.\n\nINSIDE THE HUDDLE\n\nIn case you missed it, defensive end Chikwe Obasih dropped tailback Shannon Brooks after a 1-yard gain on the Gophers' first offensive play and then appeared to imitate swinging an ax after the play.\n\n\"I was swinging an ax,\" Obasih said with a devilish grin.\n\nObasih was imitating teammate Dare Ogunbowale, who made a similar move after making a tackle on special teams in UW's 34-24 victory over the Gophers last season.\n\nThe referee made sure Obasih didn't try the move again.\n\n\"I thought I'd do it all game long,\" Obasih said, \"but the ref said don't do any more of that or else I'm going to flag you.\"\n\nQUOTE\n\n\"Every win is fun. Every win is special. But this one...I know I wanted it more than I probably ever wanted to win a game before.\"\n\nJoel Stave, UW quarterback\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n5 Turnovers forced by UW, one third of its season total\n\n6 Interceptions this season by Tanner McEvoy\n\n7 Starting combinations UW used on the offensive line in 12 games\n\n12 Consecutive victories by UW in the series\n\n53 Rushing yards for Minnesota, below the team's average of 151.1 per game\n\n155 Rushing yards for UW's Dare Ogunbowale, a college high\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWisconsin (9-3, 6-2 Big Ten) must wait to learn its bowl destination, but the likely landing spot appears to be the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 30 in San Diego. UW would be paired against a team from the Pacific 12.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Badgers Report: UW vs. Minnesota", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/badgers/badgers-report-uw-vs-minnesota-b99623546z1-357463161.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99623546z.1_20151128213608_000_gm6dho02.1-1.jpg", "height": 750}, "type": "article", "description": "Give the game ball to Joe Rudolph, UW\u2019s offensive coordinator/offensive line coach.", "title": "Badgers Report: UW vs. Minnesota"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99623546z.1_20151128213608_000_gm6dho02.1-1.jpg", "description": "Give the game ball to Joe Rudolph, UW\u2019s offensive coordinator/offensive line coach.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Badgers Report: UW vs. Minnesota"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2373\"", "article_summary": "UW ran the ball on five consecutive plays after a Minnesota turnover and faced second and 6 at the Gophers' 18.\nUW safety Tanner McEvoy comes down with one of his two interceptions against Minnesota on Saturday.\nWith the score tied, Minnesota took over at its 16 after a UW punt.\nCredit: Getty ImagesBy of thePLAYER OF THE GAMEGive the game ball to Joe Rudolph, UW's offensive coordinator/offensive line coach.\nAs a result, UW rushed 27 times for just 58 yards after halftime to finish with 257 yards on 62 carries."}
