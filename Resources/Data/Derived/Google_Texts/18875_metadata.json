Real polls, fake polls, internet polls, telephone poles, barge poles \u2013 anything, as long as he is number one.\n\n\n\nSo, we might be expected to hear Trump talk tonight in the fifth GOP debate about the latest national poll of Republican primary voters. The survey from WaPo/ABC News has Trump in the lead by a tremendous 23 points. He is statistically tied with his next three closet competitors combined.\n\n\n\nIn the recent slew of polls released before the CNN debate tonight there seem to be two models nationally. One, which includes surveys from CNN and others, has Trump around 40 points rather than his usual mid-20s. The other, from WSJ/NBC News and others, has Trump in his normal range. Which model is correct? We\u2019ll probably never know since polls are snapshots in time.\n\n\n\nWhat the polls do agree on though is the shape of the race and the current trend: Trump remains way ahead, but that Ted Cruz is closing in fast and Marco Rubio is improved and showing some sturdiness in his support.\n\n\n\nThe new WaPo/CBS News poll will no doubt be especially attractive for Trump to tout given the newspaper\u2019s owner\u2019s taunting of the Republican frontrunner. Even Jeff Bezos\u2019 poll says Trump is trumping.\n\n\n\nTrump ought to be careful, however, when extolling this survey, because it also explains why he remains unlikely to be the Republican nominee.\n\n\n\nIn September, the WaPo/ABC News poll found Trump a scant 3 points behind Hillary Clinton. Now, it\u2019s doubled to 6 points. Much of her gains come from the Obama coalition that Clinton is struggling to reconstitute. Clinton leads by 45 points by voters under the age of 30, 52 points among non-white voters, and 22 points among voters who say the economy is the number one issue.\n\n\n\nIf Election Day looked anything like this \u2013 a scenario that would involve Trump doing worse among white voters than Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2013 the electoral catastrophe would be enormous for Trump\u2019s adopted party.\n\n\n\nTrump must take seriously the threat Cruz poses and will predictably find ways to scare conservative voters away from Cruz. One would assume that will include shifting his attacks on his rival from being \u201ca maniac\u201d who refuses to compromise in the Senate to highlighting Cruz\u2019s policy contradictions. Most of all, one assumes Trump will stoke the fires surrounding his proposed religious test for entry to the United States.\n\n\n\nThe things Trump is doing to solidify his stranglehold on the Republican lead is terrifying voters at large.\n\n\n\nTrump has adopted many of the views and folkways of the conservative voters he seeks to woo. But his supporters assure skeptical Republicans that Trump will be able to reset the race and start appealing to moderates and non-white voters in a general election. But it is hard to imagine how that could succeed given what this and other polls say about the broader electorate\u2019s view of Trump.\n\n\n\nParties have chosen unelectable nominees in the past, but never have done so knowingly.\n\n\n\nRush, Levin warn Trump on Cruz attacks - WashEx: \u201cOn Monday [Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin went] to Cruz\u2019s aid, bashing Trump for tearing into a fellow anti-establishment candidate to their combined audiences of millions. Limbaugh fired first on his midday show, saying Trump has \u2018decided to go after Cruz in the way the establishment Republican go after Cruz, in the way the media goes after Cruz, in the way Democrats go after Cruz \u2026 A genuine conservative, even in the Republican field, would not go after Cruz this way. So that just raised a red flag to me.\u2019 Levin laid out three reasons Trump \u2018really screwed up this weekend, big time, trifecta. He said Trump\u2019s assertion that Cruz has been bought out by oil companies just because he opposes ethanol and is from the Lone Star State are \u2018stupid.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nOHIO, TEXAS CLOSE DOOR ON TRUMP INDY RUN\n\nCleveland Plain Dealer: \u201cDonald Trump filed Friday to run as a Republican presidential candidate in Ohio, meaning that he now cannot run as an independent in the state next year, according to Secretary of State Jon Husted\u2019s office. However, an elections law expert questioned that assertion, pointing to a U.S. Supreme Court case upholding the right of an independent presidential candidate to appear on the Ohio ballot. Trump has repeatedly said he might run as an independent or third-party candidate if he's not treated \u2018fairly\u2019 by the Republican establishment. But under the Ohio Revised Code and case law, any independent presidential candidate running in the state must first disaffiliate with any political party \u2018in good faith.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTexas Tribune: \u201c[Monday was] the deadline for candidates to file for the 2016 elections [in Texas] \u2014 as Democrats, Republicans or independents. Trump already filed as a Republican, barring him from running a Texas race as an independent\u2026.And candidates who run in the party primaries are barred from becoming official write-in candidates (or at least the registered write-in candidates whose votes the state will count). It\u2019s a win-or-go-home state, politically. Trump and all the others will have to get by with just one bite at this apple.\u201d\n\n\n\nWHO CAN PASS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TEST?\n\nDavid Drucker is in Vegas, baby, and he has a fine guide for what to watch tonight (before you flip back to the Fox News Channel for the best analysis in the business, of course.) WashEx: \u201cSince the Republicans last met on the debate stage in Milwaukee to discuss pocketbook issues, jihadist radicals either directed or inspired by the Islamic State struck Paris, leaving 140 dead, and San Bernardino, Calif., leaving 14 dead and 21 wounded. The latter attack was the worst terrorist strike on the homeland since Sept.11, 2001, and new public opinion polls show that voters are now more concerned about national security than the economy, which is a marked shift.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz gave their preview of tonight\u2019s debate to Megyn Kelly on Monday\u2019s \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.]\n\n\n\nPro-Cruz PACs ready to spend - WSJ: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz\u2019s allies for months have questioned why his friendly super PACs appeared to be stockpiling their cash, running few television ads while his presidential rivals dominated the airwaves\u2026Together, the four primary super PACs backing the senator have spent some $2.2 million, or less than 6% of the $38 million they raised in the first half of the year, according to Federal Election Commission records confirmed by a person familiar with the groups\u2019 finances. That leaves them with more than $30 million to spend as the first nominating contest approaches Feb. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nPro-Rubio PAC new ad on national security - Fox News: \u201cThe super PAC supporting Republican presidential contender Marco Rubio is out with a new TV ad in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, FoxNews.com has learned. The commercial, issued by Conservative Solutions PAC, focuses on national security\u2026Conservative Solutions PAC spokesman Jeff Sadosky did not reveal specifics of the major ad campaign, but said it is part of a major ad buy that started in December, and will run throughout the early state process.\u201d\n\n\n\nSOUND OFF: READER\u2019S REACT TO 2016 POWER INDEX\n\n\u201cI\u2019m betting you won\u2019t publish this. Your \u2018Power Index\u2019 is less than accurate based on the polls and that determines what the people, actual voters, think. It is not just the Republican Party that is trying to sidetrack Trump. Fox News is guiltier of trying to derail him than the party at this point.\u201d \u2013 Tom Cain\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are conservatives rejecting Fiorina? To me, she is the bright spot in the whole bunch, certainly more intelligent than most of them.\u201d \u2013 Mary Hill\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nWe all love the Christmas carol \u201cGod Rest ye Merry Gentlemen.\u201d Not even the hardest heart can resist the versions by The Barenaked Ladies and, most beautifully, Allison Krauss. But the song and its history come with something not much allowed in the modern understanding of Christmas: the presence of evil. The Atlantic: \u201c\u2018God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\u2019 doesn\u2019t need to be performed on the lute to feel authentic; as Annie Lennox showed, it can come packaged in a super-weird, partly animated music video and still feel cool. But nodding to the history helps. It\u2019s a musical reminder of a time when Satan may have seemed closer by, when the threat of evil may have felt more imminent. It can be hard to sing about these things today, particularly in mainstream music. So when these old songs find their way into the right contemporary musicians\u2019 hands, the moment feels rare, and precious: a portal into an old world, a reminder of a Christmas that\u2019s not all sweet.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

But while the administration tosses the carrot in favor of the stick to prod sign-ups, the biggest threat to the president\u2019s health law is bailout-less insurers bolting from ObamaCare exchanges. Carriers, most losing money under ObamaCare, were expecting the so-called risk corridor payouts but have been denied under a provision of last year\u2019s budget bill that caps the amount of taxpayer dollars the government can shell out. With the threat of insurers fleeing the exchanges, the White House administration is fighting tooth and nail to keep the provision from being renewed in the current omnibus spending measure and allow the corporate welfare to flow.\n\n\n\n[Price spike - Vox details how ObamaCare premiums will rise significantly next year.]\n\n\n\nSpending deal is close - ABC News: \u201cWhite House and congressional negotiators moved toward wrapping up a tax and spending compromise Tuesday that would cap Congress\u2019 year, a package expected to lift the ban on U.S. oil exports and provide legislative goodies for home-state interests. House Speaker Paul Ryan told GOP lawmakers he expected compromise legislation to be publicly released Tuesday \u2014 a measure that would deliver victories for to both sides. But the Wisconsin Republican provided few details.\u201d\n\n\n\nHILLARY TRIES GOLDILOCKS PLAY ON ISIS\n\nNYT: \u201cIn a speech at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Mrs. Clinton is expected to propose a multifaceted plan that would address the Islamic State\u2019s recruiting methods and to call for better monitoring and vetting of people in the United States who could become radicalized. The topic is filled with pitfalls. She must appear tougher on the Islamic State than President Obama, who has faced criticism for his response to the attacks in Paris and California, but she must also avoid turning off Democratic primary voters who view her as overly hawkish on foreign policy, or who have concerns about the government\u2019s infringing on civil liberties in order to monitor would-be terrorism suspects.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Pro-GOP group America Rising Squared released a memo this morning highlighting what they call Clinton\u2019s \u201cfailed leadership\u201d on national security, including her initiative to combat terror online which experts reportedly called \u201cembarrassing.\u201d]\n\n\n\nHillary advocates lowering fees for citizenship - Daily Caller: \u201cDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton said Monday that she supports lower fees for people seeking U.S. citizenship. Speaking in Brooklyn at the National Immigrant Integration Conference, Clinton railed against immigration policies that \u2018can tear families apart\u2019 and against Republican rivals\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ll work to ensure that every single refugee who seeks asylum in the United States has a fair chance to tell his or her story. This is the least we can offer people fleeing persecution and devastation,\u2019 Clinton said.\u201d\n\n\n\nJarrett heads up Muslim outreach effort - WashEx: \u201cThe White House on Monday began \u2018staff-level\u2019 meetings and calls with religious leaders to discuss how they could help combat growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States. Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Obama, and Melissa Rogers, who leads the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, held a conference call with leaders of all religions from across the country. \u2018Spoke with 890+ religious leaders to thank them for speaking up for every American\u2019s right to be free from religious discrimination,\u2019 Jarrett tweeted on Monday.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE BRO-IFICIATION OF EVERYTHING\n\nAdWeek: \u201cSince the first department store mogul who dressed up like Santa Claus in 1890, retail Santas have been a trusty way to bring in the shoppers (even Walmart is trying to get in on the hustle), but they\u2019re usually focused on the family crowd. Not so with Fashion Santa, aka Paul Mason, a chiseled male model who enjoys a following of giddy ladies ... many of whom are probably happy to say they\u2019ve been naughty this year. Thankfully, his sex appeal is paired with a good cause: For every Fashion Santa selfie shared via the hashtag #YorkdaleFashionSanta, the Yorkdale Shopping Center [in Toronto] will donate $1 to the Sick Kids Foundation, up to a maximum of $10,000. We get the feeling they\u2019ll hit that number. After a Fashion Santa photo shoot, it won't just be tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, finding it hard to sleep tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201c[President Obama announcing statistics of death tolls] is reminiscent of the strategy in the Vietnam war, where we would announce the body counts, the ratio of the dead Viet Cong to Americans. And it was always lopsided, and we lost the damn war, because that\u2019s not how you gage who\u2019s winning and losing in such a war.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
