While Democrats and their allies in the DC Media will attempt to portray those opposed as racist, the truth is that most people are uneasy with the federal government\u2019s competence when it comes to vetting refugees.\n\nThe federal government could not vet an American company competent enough to build the ObamaCare website.\n\nThe federal government could not vet American executives capable of handling the Veterans Administration.\n\nThe federal government could not vet ethical employees to man the IRS.\n\nAnd finally, the same Tsarnaev brothers who set off multiple bombs at the Boston Marathon in 2013 were both refugees.\n\nISIS has sworn to use the Syrian migrant crisis to flood the West with trained terrorists.\n\nWe would be fools not to take them at their word.\n\nNo one opposes using tax dollars and our expertise to build and protect refugees camps in the Middle East. But Obama and the DC Media would prefer to keep us divided instead of united under a common cause that would protect as many refugees as needed and keep them close to home once the region settles to some sort of normalcy.\n\nHow exactly is it good for America and Americans \u2014 and therefore Constitutional \u2014 to spend billions of dollars to bring people here?\n\nNo one can answer that. They just scream, \u201cShut up racist.\u201d\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poll: 52% Believe Accepting Refugees Makes America Less Safe", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Poll: 52% Believe Accepting Refugees Makes America Less Safe", "title": "Poll: 52% Believe Accepting Refugees Makes America Less Safe - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-488181258.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/11/16/poll-52-believe-accepting-refugees-makes-america-less-safe/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Poll: 52% Believe Accepting Refugees Makes America Less Safe", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-488181258.jpg", "title": "Poll: 52% Believe Accepting Refugees Makes America Less Safe - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-11-16T13:06:52-07:00", "categories": "National Security,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "No one opposes using tax dollars and our expertise to build and protect refugees camps in the Middle East.\nObama has already promised to flood our country with tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.\nAnd finally, the same Tsarnaev brothers who set off multiple bombs at the Boston Marathon in 2013 were both refugees.\nHow exactly is it good for America and Americans \u2014 and therefore Constitutional \u2014 to spend billions of dollars to bring people here?\nThe federal government could not vet an American company competent enough to build the ObamaCare website."}
