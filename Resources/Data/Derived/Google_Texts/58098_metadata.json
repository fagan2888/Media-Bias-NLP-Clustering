Fortunately, there are a number of angles with which we can attack high health care costs. It all starts with this basic premise: One major reason that medicine costs so much is that insurers, pharmacies, doctors and hospitals know a lot more than you do. To lower your bills, you'll have to address this information gap.\n\nUnderstand your insurance\n\nBefore you dive into the murky waters of medical billing, you need to familiarize yourself with your insurance plan (if you have one). For a basic rundown of health care terms, check out our glossary below. You should be able to answer the following questions:\n\nDo you have a PPO, HMO, HDHP or POS plan?\n\nWhat is your deductible?\n\nPast your deductible, how much will you have to pay for health care?\n\nAre there any limits on services like mental health or physical therapy?\n\nDo you need any services that are not covered by insurance?\n\nDo you need a referral from your primary care doctor before seeing a specialist?\n\nWhat will you pay for out-of-network care?\n\nWhat is your insurance plan's emergency care policy?\n\nThis will form the framework for understanding what you need to pay for and what will be covered.\n\nTypical health care costs\n\nThere's a two-pronged approach to keeping your general health care costs low: Get seen when you need to, and don't get seen when you don't. Avoiding a doctor's visit might lead to higher health care costs later on, if you develop a serious condition or need to go to the ER. Remember to weigh long-term costs and risks alongside short-term ones.\n\nHowever, another major component is not running up a high number of visits unless you have to. Here are a few ways to sidestep unnecessary visits:\n\nFind a doctor who corresponds by email . Both he and you would rather not have a visit if you don't need it; you can shoot a quick email describing your symptoms and he can tell you if additional follow-up is needed.\n\n. Both he and you would rather not have a visit if you don't need it; you can shoot a quick email describing your symptoms and he can tell you if additional follow-up is needed. Use your insurance company's nurse hotline. Many insurance companies, like Aetna and Blue Cross, have 24/7 nurse hotlines where you can speak with a registered nurse. They can give you advice on whether you need to go to an emergency room or urgent care, or whether you'll be all right until your next appointment.\n\nMany insurance companies, like Aetna and Blue Cross, have 24/7 nurse hotlines where you can speak with a registered nurse.

This applies to a variety of cases, including but not limited to: Jackass-style stunts Not taking your medications or complying with physician recommendations Anything described in this handy public service announcement put out by Australian Metro Trains Not taking proper care of yourself after illnesses\n\n. This applies to a variety of cases, including but not limited to: Use outpatient facilities for lab work and tests. As a general rule, free-standing facilities charge less for lab tests, imaging and the like than hospitals do.\n\nPrescription drugs and medication\n\nWhenever possible, buy generic drugs. These can be an order of magnitude cheaper than name-brand drugs. GoodRx is a great resource for comparing name-brand and generic drug prices, as well as finding coupons for your prescriptions.\n\nHeads up! In some cases, your insurer might not cover name-brand drugs, so be sure to double-check how much you'll have to pay.\n\nEmergency and urgent care\n\nThe most obvious way to save money on emergency care is to visit an urgent care center instead of an ER if possible. Same-day urgent care treatment can help with non-life-threatening conditions and provide quality treatment. Going to an emergency room costs $800 on average, compared to $10-$80 for urgent care or a regular doctor's visit.\n\nPro tip: If you need hospitalization, don't put it off until the end of the week. Patients admitted on Fridays often have to wait until the next week to see a specialist or surgeon because of reduced staffing.\n\nThere are other benefits to urgent care as well. The average wait time in urgent care is less than half an hour, compared to over four hours for emergency care. Moreover, over 80% of visits last less than 60 minutes.\n\nFinally, you should be aware that urgent care centers have a list of conditions that they triage before scheduling a same-day appointment for you. They'll let you know if your symptoms warrant immediate care.\n\nFrom the National Institutes of Health, here's a guide to when to call an ambulance, go to the ER or go to urgent care for adults:\n\nCall 911 Go to the ER or call 911 Go to urgent care Choking\n\nStopped breathing\n\nHead injury with passing out, fainting, or confusion\n\nInjury to neck or spine, especially if there is loss of feeling or inability to move\n\nElectric shock or lightning strike\n\nSevere burns\n\nSeizure lasting 3 \u2013 5 minutes Trouble breathing\n\nPassing out, fainting\n\nSevere chest pain or pressure\n\nPain in the arm or jaw\n\nUnusual or bad headache, especially if it started suddenly\n\nSuddenly not able to speak, see, walk, or move\n\nSuddenly weak or drooping on one side of the body\n\nDizziness or weakness that does not go away\n\nInhaled smoke or poisonous fumes\n\nSudden confusion\n\nHeavy bleeding\n\nPossible broken bone, loss of movement, especially if the bone is pushing through the skin\n\nDeep wound\n\nSerious burn\n\nCoughing or throwing up blood\n\nSevere pain anywhere on the body\n\nSevere allergic reaction with trouble breathing, swelling, hives\n\nHigh fever with headache and stiff neck\n\nHigh fever that doesn't get better with medicine\n\nThrowing up or loose stools that don't stop\n\nPoisoning or overdose of drug or alcohol\n\nSuicidal thoughts\n\nSeizures Common illnesses, such as colds, the flu, earaches, sore throats, migraines, low-grade fevers and limited rashes\n\nNon-urgent injuries, such as sprains or back pain\n\nMinor cuts and burns, broken bones or eye injuries\n\nOnce you've gotten your bills\n\nAll these steps are preventative; now we're getting to the fun part. This is where the information gap between insurers, doctors and hospitals on one hand, and patients on the other, comes into play. You can lower your medical bills, but you have to arm yourself with information first.\n\nHow much did your services really cost?\n\nHealth prices aren't designed to be transparent. As you've probably heard, the price of a procedure can double from one county to the next, and each hospital has the leeway to determine the rate for a service given the patient's condition.\n\nThe cost to you (and the insurer) depends on how much bargaining power the hospital has. For example, Medicare insures millions of people and has enormous leverage. On average, it pays about 27% of the billed amount. But you're unlikely to see these lower rates as an individual, unless you speak up.\n\nHow to bargain down your hospital bill\n\nStep one: Believe\n\nThis sounds obvious, but it's important: You need to sit down at the negotiating table knowing that you are overpaying for your services. Like we said, Medicare knocks off 73% of the bill on average, so you're paying a very inflated rate. Armed with confidence and information, you can't go wrong.\n\nStep two: Research\n\nYou must now figure out how much insurers or Medicare and Medicaid pay for similar services. The NerdWallet hospital comparison tool shows you how much hospitals bill, and how much Medicare pays, for a given procedure in your area. Use this information as negotiating leverage to show that you're paying too much. Another service, Healthcare Blue Book, can help you find what insurers pay for a given procedure.\n\nStep three: Bargain\n\nTalk to the hospital about your bill. Use the data you found in your research to say what you think a fair price is. Write down all the reasons they give for why your bill is higher. It's important to let the hospital know immediately if you think you'll have trouble paying the bill. They don't want to send your debt to a collection agency any more than you want it sent, because then they're settling for pennies on the dollar. Talk with a financial counselor \u2013 some hospitals have them on-staff \u2013 and try to negotiate a zero-interest repayment plan.\n\nBe careful about medical credit cards, because if you don't pay off the bill in the allotted time, you may owe retroactive interest.\n\nPatient advocacy services like CoPatient can also give you expert advice and suggest further resources.\n\nStep four: Deduct\n\nFinally, come April, you might be able to deduct some of your health care expenses. If you itemize deductions, you can deduct expenses over 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. This means that if your AGI is $100,000 and you spent $9,000 in medical expenses last year, you can deduct $1,500. The term \"medical expense\" is fairly broad, and covers:\n\nCo-pays for doctor's visits and medication\n\nPhysician-recommended activities and home improvements such as retrofitting a home for wheelchair access or horseback riding therapy for a bad back\n\nTravel expenses to and from treatment\n\nInsurance payments\n\nThe cost of a medically necessary gluten-free diet, above the cost of an equivalent gluten-carrying item\n\nGoing to medical conferences to learn more about how to treat you or a dependent's illness\n\nYou can also contribute to health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts pre-tax. If you have a high-deductible health plan, you can put money into a health savings account (HSA) tax-free and use it for medical expenses. If you don't use all of your funds in one year, you can roll them over to the next year.\n\nFlexible spending accounts (FSA's), on the other hand, are offered through employers and are available regardless of your deductible. Unlike HSA's, your extra FSA money doesn't roll over at year's end, so you lose all unspent funds.\n\nTake control of your health care costs. Arm yourself with knowledge and know the time and place for spending, and in the words of Douglas Adams, don't panic.\n\nGlossary\n\nFeatures of health care plans\n\nPremium: The amount that you pay for your health insurance.

Coinsurance: Like a co-pay in that you're footing some of the bill of your health services, but it's expressed as a percentage of the total rather than a fixed amount. For example, you might pay all costs up to $1,000, and after you've hit the $1k mark, 15% of all costs beyond that. Your insurance will cover the rest.\n\nTypes of health care plans", "article_metadata": {"description": "To lower your bills, you\u2019ll have to address this information gap between you and health care pros. - Anisha Sekar, NerdWallet - Health Care", "author": "Anisha Sekar, NerdWallet", "promo": "To lower your bills, you\u2019ll have to address this information gap between you and health care pros.", "title": "Paying Too Much for Health Care?
