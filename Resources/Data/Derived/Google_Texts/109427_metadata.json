Darrell Issa, R-Calif., former chairman of the House oversight committee, cited the provision in announcing his endorsement of Rubio on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe saved us money on ObamaCare where others have simply wanted to repeal it,\u201d Issa told Fox News. \u201cHe has already saved $2.5 billion by eliminating an unreasonable backstop by the taxpayers for a failed program.\u201d\n\nThe program Rubio targeted is known as \u201crisk corridors\u201d \u2013 pricy provisions that allow the government to use taxpayer dollars to compensate insurance companies for losses suffered during the first few years of ObamaCare.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nIn 2013, the senator pushed legislation to repeal the risk corridor provision. Though the standalone bill failed, he had a hand in getting a rider into the \u201cmust-pass\u201d omnibus federal spending bill last year that prevents the government from making up shortfalls in the program by tapping other funds.\n\nLast year, insurers asked for nearly $2.87 billion in government payments from the program; though the Department of Health and Human Services had only $362 million available. Issa and others say the rider, then, helped save $2.5 billion.\n\nConcern about a backstop for losses has been renewed amid continuing financial uncertainty in the market -- which has led to more than a dozen folded co-ops and prompted UnitedHealth, the country\u2019s largest insurer, to threaten to pull out of the exchanges next year.\n\nRubio's campaign is claiming some credit for the turmoil, sending out a recent tweet that said: \u201cQ: Did Marco Kill Obamacare? A: You bet he did.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s CEO announced $425 million in losses and warned it may walk away from the health care exchanges altogether. It\u2019s a threat Rubio believes will resonate with other insurers who he thinks may follow suit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only going to accelerate now, because once these companies can\u2019t get bailed out, many of them are deciding they no longer want to participate in the ObamaCare exchange,\u201d he said in an interview with Breibart News.\n\nRubio wants to keep his restrictions in place going forward, as they are set to expire if not renewed.\n\nIn a Nov. 24 letter to Republican leadership, he argued that ObamaCare might not be worth saving if such deep safety nets are needed to keep private insurers interested.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is our responsibility to completely shield the U.S. taxpayer from a deal in the omnibus that might reimburse health insurers retroactively for these losses or any other future losses.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans President and CEO Marilyn Tavenner, who played a key role in launching the health care overhaul in the Obama administration, recently defended the risk corridors.\n\n\u201cStable, affordable coverage for consumers depends on adequate funding of the risk corridor program,\u201d she said in an October statement. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that Congress and CMS act to ensure the program works as designed and consumers are protected.\u201d\n\nDan Holler, vice president of communications at Heritage Action for America, disagrees.\n\nHoller told FoxNews.com his organization strongly supports eliminating bailouts for insurance companies and believes a similarly worded measure by Rubio will easily pass this year.\n\nWhile Rubio\u2019s social media team is claiming credit for delivering a death blow to ObamaCare, others argue it only did surface-level damage to the program.\n\nStill, most agree Rubio\u2019s efforts have had some impact on ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cIt did draw some blood,\u201d Tim Jost, a health law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, told Bloomberg News. \u201cThe restriction on funding is probably the most effective thing Republicans have done so far to limit the Affordable Care Act, other than the Supreme Court decision and subsequent decisions by Republican states not to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nFoxNews.com's Barnini Chakraborty contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "state-local", "classification": "/FOX
