Turkeys are being pardoned, Americans are furiously trying to make their way across the country into the loving embrace of family and friends and everyone is dutifully ignoring the cognitive dissonance inherent in the fact our national holiday of thankfulness and reflection is built upon genocide. That\u2019s right, Thanksgiving is upon us. And despite whatever trepidation one may have about the historical underpinnings of the holiday, it is undeniable that taking a day (or a part of a day if you\u2019re unlucky enough to work in retail) to contemplate those things that we have, rather than what we don\u2019t is healthy. In that spirit I have created my own, personal list of things that I as a contract attorney am thankful for.\n\nSure, contract attorneys are generally considered the very bottom of the legal industry barrel \u2014 and that generally creates plenty of fodder for complaints. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m completely unable to find silver linings, or at least some low quality silver-plated linings.\n\n1 \u2014 Having A Job\n\nOkay, lets start this out nice and slow. I currently have a job, or at least a project I am working on and that is great. Sure, there is no job stability, no OT and the conditions are poor, but we\u2019re starting small here. Being a contract attorney was never my life\u2019s ambition, but now that I am in the industry, I can appreciate it for what it is\u2026 okay, that is mostly just a paycheck, but there can be moments of zen. The truth is, I\u2019ve spent time as an unemployed lawyer and that\u2019s definitely worse. With this job I don\u2019t have to fill out student loan deferment paperwork, deal with the particular strictures of unemployment checks or worry about eviction.\n\n2 \u2014 Copy From Previous\n\nThe project I\u2019m working on is using the review platform, Relativity (like the vast majority of projects out there). The powers that be (read: case managers) have decided to turn on the copy from previous function. For those who haven\u2019t used that before, it is\u2026 pretty much exactly what it sounds like. But it enables reviewers to copy the coding (of whatever fields are enabled) from one document to another. With all the clicks for responsiveness, issue tags, privilege, confidentiality \u2014 and all of the related subtags \u2014 this saves me between 3-6 clicks per document. I\u2019m pretty sure this has delayed the onset of my carpal tunnel syndrome by at least a year or two.\n\n3 \u2014 Co-Workers That Don\u2019t Suck\n\nWe all know that those of us in the document review business can be\u2026 a bit of a mixed bag. While there are absolutely some reviewers that are relegated to contract work due to poor timing and bad market conditions, there are others who, well, let\u2019s just say not everyone would flourish in a law firm environment. So actually winding up working with someone you don\u2019t hate and can exchange the normal daily pleasantries with can make all the difference.\n\n4 \u2014 My Health\n\nCliched? Definitely. But still true. I spent the majority of my contract attorney career without heath insurance. At the time, the projects I was able to get weren\u2019t regular enough that I could justify the enormous expense. Workplace insurance was difficult to secure, and the one time I signed up for a project with a staffing agency that offered coverage the plan was so bad it wasn\u2019t worth it. So for years, I dealt with any heath issue with a prayer and whatever I could get OTC. Obamacare forced me to get actual insurance, and now I can fully appreciate knowing for sure that I am in good health.\n\n5 \u2014 Having A Forum To Complain\n\nI do a lot of venting in this column. Whenever something strikes me as unjust, silly, annoyingor just plain wrong for the last year I\u2019ve had a forum to let the world know about it. I have to say, it\u2019s done wonders for my blood pressure (see: gratitude point 4). But more than that, I hope I\u2019ve shed light on what it\u2019s like to be the bottom cog in a massive industry. And now it\u2019s time to spread the wealth.
