The Congressional Budget Office estimates the savings at $9.3 billion over ten years.\n\n\u201cThis untested idea may endanger patient access to care, especially among patients who are sicker, the poor, minorities and seniors who often receive care in hospital outpatient departments,\u201d said Thomas Nickels, AHA\u2019s executive vice president.\n\nHe called for the provision to be taken out of the deal, adding \u201cCongress and the Administration should not balance the budget on the backs of patients.\u201d\n\nAHA also objects that the budget deal cuts payments to healthcare providers by extending the 2 percent sequester cuts to Medicare by one year, to 2025. But other than those cuts, many other healthcare industry groups were spared and have not voiced opposition.\n\nEven another hospital group, the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents specifically for-profit hospitals, offered measured support for the bill.\n\nChip Kahn, FAH\u2019s president and CEO, said in an interview that with so many budget deadlines looming, they knew congressional leaders would need to look for offsets somewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are always opposed to arbitrary payment reductions,\u201d Kahn said. \u201cOn the other hand the reality is the reality and we sort of understood something was going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe said congressional leaders \u201cdealt with it the best way they could.\u201d\n\nThere is also hope for hospitals that the change will stave off more sweeping reforms in the realm of what are known as \u201csite neutral\u201d payments. Those further reforms, proposed by President Obama in his budget, would more drastically lower payments to hospital outpatient centers to bring them in line with doctors\u2019 office payments.\n\nKahn said the new provision means that with luck lawmakers \u201cwill not spend any more time\u201d on the issue.\n\nSeparately, the budget deal widens the requirement that drug companies pay a rebate to Medicaid when their prices rise faster than inflation. That requirement did only apply to brand-name drugs, but it is now being extended to cheaper generic drugs, for a savings of $1 billion over ten years.\n\nChip Davis, president and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said in a statement that the deal seeks to \u201cbalance the budget on the backs of America\u2019s vulnerable Medicaid population.\u201d He said the proposal could limit access to cheaper generic drugs.\n\nLiberals like Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders: Networks calling about Trump debate Why superdelegates shouldn't support Sanders Young Turks host offers M for Trump, Sanders debate MORE (I-Vt.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), however, have championed the change as offering relief from rising generic drug prices.\n\nOn the beneficiary side, AARP is praising the deal for averting 52 percent premium increases for some Medicare enrollees. This change is paid for over time through adding a $3 monthly charge to premiums.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A leading coalition says the deal balances the budget \"on the backs of patients.\"", "description": "A leading coalition says the deal balances the budget \"on the backs of patients.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A leading coalition says the deal balances the budget \"on the backs of patients.\"", "title": "Hospital group slams budget deal over cuts", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/258275-hospital-group-slams-budget-deal-over-cuts", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/texashospital_100414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/258275-hospital-group-slams-budget-deal-over-cuts", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-27T16:52-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bernie Sanders,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-27T16:52:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/258275-hospital-group-slams-budget-deal-over-cuts", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A leading coalition says the deal balances the budget \"on the backs of patients.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Hospital group slams budget deal over cuts"}, "dcterms.title": "Hospital group slams budget deal over cuts"}, "article_summary": "Separately, the budget deal widens the requirement that drug companies pay a rebate to Medicaid when their prices rise faster than inflation.\nHe called for the provision to be taken out of the deal, adding \u201cCongress and the Administration should not balance the budget on the backs of patients.\u201dAHA also objects that the budget deal cuts payments to healthcare providers by extending the 2 percent sequester cuts to Medicare by one year, to 2025.\nEven another hospital group, the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents specifically for-profit hospitals, offered measured support for the bill.\nA leading U.S. hospital coalition is opposing the two-year budget deal working its way through Congress because of its cuts, which the group says balance the budget \u201con the backs of patients.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe American Hospital Association said in a statement Tuesday that it is opposing the bipartisan deal because of a section cutting certain future payments to hospitals.\nThose further reforms, proposed by President Obama in his budget, would more drastically lower payments to hospital outpatient centers to bring them in line with doctors\u2019 office payments."}
