Here\u2019s what players and coaches said after the game.\n\n\u201cToday was a better day. Last week, it was great to get over the hump. Plus we played well, so it was very exciting. We have to keep our focus. We\u2019ll be one of two teams left. At the end, hopefully we\u2019ll be the only one left. It\u2019s so much fun to be able to do it here, in front of these great fans.\u201d\n\n\u2013Broncos VP John Elway\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without these fans. And I am so proud of this team, we have been through a lot.\n\n\u2014Peyton Manning, Broncos QB\n\n\u201cI went to the Super Bowl in \u201907. I thought I\u2019d be back the next season and every season. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a tough league. You have to take advantage of it when you can.\u201d\n\n\u2013Broncos WR Wes Welker\n\n\u201cEverybody made big plays. That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving on. It\u2019s a great moment for the Denver Broncos.\u201d\n\n\u2013Broncos defensive lineman Robert Ayers\n\n\u201cLosing is not easy.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tom Brady\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough loss. But we\u2019ll re-group and get back at it next year.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Patriots QB Tom Brady\n\n\u201cTo keep Tom Brady on the sideline is a good thing. That\u2019s something you try to do when you are playing the Patriots. Our field position was never very good and overcome a couple holding penalties was a good thing. It would have been nice to score some touchdowns instead of field goals. But certainly was enough points.\u201d\n\n\u2014Peyton Manning\n\n\u201cMy advice yesterday to Peyton was, \u2018Have fun.\u2019 And it looked to me like he was having fun today.\u201d\n\n\u2014Cooper Manning (Peyton\u2019s older brother)\n\n\u201cI gotta give Denver a lot of credit today\u2026 They did a better job than we did. I thought we were ready to go. But not we didn\u2019t do it well enough. Congratualtions to them. I\u2019m proud of our team this year.\u201d\n\n\u2013Patriots coach Bill Belichick\n\n\u201cYeah, we brought it today. We went out with that attack mentality. \u2026All week we heard about how they were going to run the ball, and how Brady was better than Manning. We went out there today to show what this team is about.\u201d\n\n\u2013Broncos DT Terrance Knighton on Denver\u2019s defensive intensity\n\n\u201cThis is second to none. This is the greatest feeling I\u2019ve had in my life. As a rookie going to the Super Bowl, I\u2019m spoiled.\u201d\n\n\u2013Broncos RB Montee Ball\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rather do this with any other group of guys\u2026 It\u2019s all or nothing. We worked so hard. I can\u2019t really explain how I feel right now. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Robert Ayers\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great team, a great organization. I\u2019ve got nothing but love for those guys over there.\u201d\n\n\u2014Wes Welker\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it takes. It\u2019s not an easy game. The NFL is tough. Our guys stepped up.\u201d\n\n\u2014Wes Welker\n\n\u201cAny time you play them, it\u2019s gonna be a knock-down, drag-out fight. This time was no different.\u201d\n\n\u2014Wes Welker\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless. We\u2019re going to the Super Bowl. It\u2019s just a great feeling.\u201d\n\n\u2014Demaryius Thomas\n\n\u201cI tell you what, it has been a terrific group. They have worked their tail off this whole year and I\u2019m excited for them.\u201d\n\n\u2014John Elway\n\n\u201cI think this team was very resilient. We just got beat today by a team that played really well. We just didn\u2019t play good enough. Our guys fought hard, we just didn\u2019t make enough plays.\n\n\u2014Tom Brady\n\n\u201cCertainly one of the greatest to ever play. Their defense played well and he had a great day.\u201d\n\n\u2013Tom Brady, on Peyton Manning\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an AFC guy. I\u2019m biased toward this conference. It\u2019s a hard conference to win. Whoever we are playing is going to be a terrific opponent. It\u2019s still one more game to play. You definitely want to savor the moment. I know how hard it is to get there. You do need to take a moment to enjoy it. Starting tomorrow, we\u2019ll start to look at who we\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\n\u2014Peyton Manning\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s surreal. It\u2019s a rewarding moment. We felt like we worked hard for this.\u201d\n\n\u2014Duke Ihenacho, Broncos defensive back\n\n\u201cCertainly we were looking to score touchdowns and we were very disappointed in the first half when we had to settle for field goals.\u201d\n\n\u2014Peyton Manning\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you it\u2019s hard to get there. I\u2019m happy for Champ (Bailey). He played well today. He\u2019s battled through some injuries. I\u2019m certainly happy for him.\u201d\n\n\u2014Peyton Manning\n\n\u201cGood team victory. To beat a team like the Patriots that have been here so many times is significant. I thought the crowd was great. Our team thrives on the energy they created.\u201d\n\n\u2014Peyton Manning\n\n\u201cEvery guy is dialed in. It\u2019s really a brotherhood over here.\u201d\n\n\u2014Chris Clark, Broncos lineman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What they said: John Elway, Peyton Manning on Broncos to the Super Bowl", "title": "What they said: John Elway, Peyton Manning on Broncos to the Super Bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/19/what-they-said-john-elway-peyton-manning-on-broncos-to-the-super-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__broncos-wesley-woodyard-fans-011914p1.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__broncos-wesley-woodyard-fans-011914p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T17:11:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:43:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a great moment for the Denver Broncos.\u201d\u2013Broncos defensive lineman Robert Ayers\u201cLosing is not easy.\u201d\u2014Tom Brady\u201cIt\u2019s a tough loss.\nIt\u2019s great.\u201d\u2014 Robert Ayers\u201cThey\u2019re a great team, a great organization.\n\u2014Peyton Manning, Broncos QB\u201cI went to the Super Bowl in \u201907.\nThe Broncos are Super Bowl-bound after topping Tom Brady and the Patriots in the AFC championship game Sunday.\nAs a rookie going to the Super Bowl, I\u2019m spoiled.\u201d\u2013Broncos RB Montee Ball\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rather do this with any other group of guys\u2026 It\u2019s all or nothing."}
