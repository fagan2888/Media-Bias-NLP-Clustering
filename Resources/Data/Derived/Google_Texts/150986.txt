The Sedgwick County Zoo was alongside many other organizations that were holding events to educate people on animal extinction.

The zoo has many animals on display that are considered endangered.

"A great way for people to experience an endangered species, [is to] learn about them, learn to love them and learn how to help them," said Melissa Graham of the Sedgwick County Zoo.

The zoo had information for people at the exhibits where endangered species were on display.

The World Wlidlife Organization lists on its' website 50 species that are critically endangered or endangered.
