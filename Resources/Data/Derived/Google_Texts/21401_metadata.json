Over the same period, the number of students applying for admission has climbed from 440 in 2009 to 750 this year.\n\nThe explosion of interest in a nursing education is not limited to students who want to enroll at TCNJ.\n\nIt is far reaching and has come amid a recession, when the nursing profession was seen as one of the few growth fields, and with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which through its broader health coverage of Americans is expected to bring a huge demand for more doctors and nurses.\n\nWhile TCNJ hasn\u2019t ramped up its nursing enrollment to accommodate the surge in interest, other schools are jumping into the breach.\n\nRecently Jersey College School of Nursing, headquartered in Teterboro, expanded its operations in Ewing, where it maintains a school for an undisclosed number of students.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have basically quadrupled in size at this campus in the past year,\u201d said Thomas Matese, campus director for the Ewing site. Recent construction has enlarged the campus on Spruce Street to 30,000 square feet.\n\nThe Ewing site was founded in 2003, the same year the school itself was established, and is among four other Jersey College campuses that are part of the same school and which include three Florida sites in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and Jacksonville. Altogether the school enrolls about 1,500, according to The Bergen Record.\n\nJersey College is joined in its response to nursing demand by Thomas Edison State College, which is currently building a $16.9 million, 27,000-square-foot nursing building on the grounds of the former Glen Cairn Arms apartment complex, across from the Calhoun Street Bridge.\n\nThree years ago, Mercer County Community College jumped into the online market for nursing school courses, expanding its reach to more students. At the time the school had just 275 spots for students in its nursing program and a backlog of 1,500 students on the waiting list.\n\nWith five hospitals in the immediate Trenton area, there will be openings for many of the students lucky enough to graduate from one of these programs.\n\nBut demand for nursing graduates will likely go further north from here.\n\nNew recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, an influential nonprofit group that advises the government and industry on health issues, suggest that 80 percent of all nurses should attain bachelor\u2019s degrees by 2020 in an effort to improve patient care.\n\nThis is sending nurses back to school in droves as hospitals try to comply with the recommendations.\n\nMany nurses are registered nurses or RNs, and have two-year degrees, though studies have shown the quality of nursing improves if nurses have more education.\n\nIn addition, Americans who are about to gain insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act will need skilled workers to deliver on the other half of that promise, further stoking demand for nurses.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act will provide them with health-care insurance, right, but will it provide them with health care, with a shortage of nurses and doctors?\u201d asked Marcia Blicharz, interim dean of nursing, health and exercise science at TCNJ.\n\nThe Bureau Of Labor Statistics anticipates a shortfall of 1.2 million nurses by 2020, and an increase of about 30 million insured Americans under the new law, Blicharz said.\n\nWhile TCNJ has not increased the number of nursing student spots in its program over the past four years, it has maintained an emphasis on quality that will stand its graduates in good stead as they look to advance in the medical profession, Blicharz said.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m prejudiced, but I think we have a really high quality program. I think we prepare students for what\u2019s going on in health care today, and speak to all the new trends in health care and teach them to think critically,\u201d Blicharz said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more well-rounded.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the lack of growth recently, the program has tripled in size since 1996, she said.\n\nBlicharz noted that a national shortage of nursing faculty remains one of the largest challenges with expanding, she said.\n\nBecause of the growing nursing and nurse faculty shortage, in 2009 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce launched a five-year, $22 million \u201cNew Jersey Nursing Initiative\u201d to help train nurses to become nurse faculty members, increasing what was seen then as a critically low number of nursing professors and educators.\n\nWhile there hasn\u2019t been enrollment growth at TCNJ lately, the school recently purchased two simulators, mannequins that can have heartbeats and can cough, give birth and die. A grant to purchase three more of the simulators \u2014 which cost from $65,000 to $75,000 a piece \u2014 was just secured, Blicharz said.\n\n\u201cWe do simulation scenarios, which are a good way to learn clinical decision-making without hurting anybody,\u201d Blicharz said.\n\nAt Jersey College, students can work in a two-room geriatric care suite, geared toward exposing them to working with older patients.\n\n\u201cThey get the lab component here, and then actually go out and do that in actual patients,\u201d Matese said of the care techniques and procedures they learn in the classroom and lab environments at Jersey College. \u201cThey do get such a wide range of experiences and exposures.\u201d\n\nBecause TCNJ is a four-year institution, students earn a four-year nursing degree and then take the test to become a registered nurse. With the RN, students can go on to complete a master\u2019s or a doctorate in nursing, Blicharz said.\n\nSome nursing programs offer degrees other than the RN. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) program is a one-year degree and the associate\u2019s degree in nursing (ASN) is a two-year program.\n\n\u201cIt depends on where you go around the country, but some places won\u2019t hire LPNs at all,\u201d Blicharz said. \u201cThe more nurses you have in a hospital with a bachelor\u2019s and higher, the lower the morbidity and mortality rate.\u201d\n\nJersey College focuses on LPN and RN students, Matese said.\n\n\u201cJersey College\u2019s nursing programs combine clinical learning with traditional classroom academics to help students acquire the necessary competencies to succeed as professionals in the health care industry,\u201d said Elizabeth Villanueva, dean of nursing at the Ewing campus.\n\nNurses holding either a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s make up about 50 percent of all nurses.\n\nThose with an associate\u2019s or LPN make up 49 percent of the work force and nurses with a doctorate make up less than 1 percent, Blicharz said.\n\nWith the increasing demand for spots in TCNJ\u2019s nursing program, Blicharz said the school is considering an expansion.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at least considering it, again. It\u2019s in terms of space and faculty, and we certainly have enough applicants to do that,\u201d Blicharz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge nursing faculty shortage and nursing shortage.\u201d\n\nContact Alyssa Mease at amease@njtimes.com or (609) 989-5673.\n\nOn mobile or desktop:\n\n\u2022 Like Times of Trenton on Facebook\n\n\u2022 Follow @TimesofTrenton on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','@times','college-of-new-jersey','ewing'", "title": "Mercer County nursing programs in high demand as profession gains popularity amidst recession", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mercer County nursing programs in high demand as profession gains popularity amidst recession\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/12/mercer_county_nursing_programs_in_high_demand_as_profession_gains_popularity_amidst_recession.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/the-times/photo/2013/10/13665167-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11746760\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-01T12:33:16Z\", \"author\": \"Times of Trenton Staff Writers\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"@times\",\"college-of-new-jersey\",\"ewing\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2013/10/13665167-small.jpg", "description": "An explosion of interest in a nursing education has reached Mercer County, with local programs reporting increased admissions applications.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, December 01, 2013,  7:33 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/the-times/photo/2013/10/13665167-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njotimesstaff\", \"author_nickname\": \"Times of Trenton Staff Writers\", \"author_id\": \"9432956\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Mercer County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "An explosion of interest in a nursing education has reached Mercer County, with local programs reporting increased admissions applications.", "title": "Mercer County nursing programs in high demand as profession gains popularity amidst recession", "url": "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/12/mercer_county_nursing_programs_in_high_demand_as_profession_gains_popularity_amidst_recession.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, December 01, 2013,  7:30 AM", "article_author": "Times of Trenton Staff Writers", "Description": "An explosion of interest in a nursing education has reached Mercer County, with local programs reporting increased admissions applications."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaac7\"", "article_summary": "With the increasing demand for spots in TCNJ\u2019s nursing program, Blicharz said the school is considering an expansion.\nThree years ago, Mercer County Community College jumped into the online market for nursing school courses, expanding its reach to more students.\nRecently Jersey College School of Nursing, headquartered in Teterboro, expanded its operations in Ewing, where it maintains a school for an undisclosed number of students.\nAt Jersey College, students can work in a two-room geriatric care suite, geared toward exposing them to working with older patients.\nWith the RN, students can go on to complete a master\u2019s or a doctorate in nursing, Blicharz said."}
