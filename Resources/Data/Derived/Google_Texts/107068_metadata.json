Lynch had been rumored to be under consideration.\n\nThe process of filling the spot that was held by Scalia, one of the court's most conservative justices, has ignited a partisan battle in Washington.\n\nRepublicans who control the U.S. Senate do not want to see the court shift ideologically to the left and have said they will not hold a vote on Obama's nominee. All appointees by the president to the Supreme Court are subject to approval by the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Walsh and Julia Edwards; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.
