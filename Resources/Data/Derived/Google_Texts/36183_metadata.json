Pat McCrory told reporters that if local school districts do not hire people to fill vacant teacher assistant positions, then that action can\u2019t be characterized as a result of a budget cut to TAs handed down by state lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIf at the end of this legislative session, if they [LEAs] had teacher assistants in place\u2014in positions\u2014they should all be rehired, based upon the budget,\u201d said McCrory. \u201cIf they were vacant or they were using that money for other reasons, you cannot then call that a cut, because they weren\u2019t using the money for teacher assistants.\u201d\n\nPrior to signing the appropriations bill last week, Gov. Pat McCrory said that the fact that this budget preserves all teacher assistants jobs contributed to his decision to sign off on it.\n\nBut according to the CFO of the N.C. Department of Public Instruction, Philip Price, the 2014 budget that the Governor signed actually spends $105 million less on TAs than what was planned for the upcoming year, which means local school districts will take a 22 percent hit to their teacher assistants \u2013 on top of huge cuts to TAs over the past several years.\n\nLawmakers have said that this budget simply a reshuffles money that school districts were already spending on other things, like teachers, and that districts could choose to shuffle the money back to TAs if they want.\n\nBut years of under funding teacher assistants and public education as a whole has left school districts with little choice but to slash TA positions or leave them unfilled. Some districts have been forced to make the difficult decision of using teacher assistant money for badly needed teacher positions, thanks to state disinvestment.\n\nMcCrory said folks should take a closer look at the language in the budget, which he says should allow local school districts to preserve teacher assistant jobs.\n\n\u201cIf you were a teacher assistant last year, you should be rehired this year,\u201d said McCrory.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3dac\"", "article_summary": "Some districts have been forced to make the difficult decision of using teacher assistant money for badly needed teacher positions, thanks to state disinvestment.\n\u201cIf you were a teacher assistant last year, you should be rehired this year,\u201d said McCrory.\nMcCrory said folks should take a closer look at the language in the budget, which he says should allow local school districts to preserve teacher assistant jobs.\nPat McCrory said that the fact that this budget preserves all teacher assistants jobs contributed to his decision to sign off on it.\nPat McCrory told reporters that if local school districts do not hire people to fill vacant teacher assistant positions, then that action can\u2019t be characterized as a result of a budget cut to TAs handed down by state lawmakers."}
