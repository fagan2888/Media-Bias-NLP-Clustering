The church is continually asking for contributions to other charities and causes, and we don\u2019t have the money to give to them all while we\u2019re sticking to our budget and getting out of debt. The worst part is that we get pretty aggressive pushback when we say no. What can we do?\n\nI don\u2019t react well to that kind of pushback. I would probably be nice a couple of times, but after that my response might sound something like, \u201cMind your own business.\u201d\n\nSeriously, I\u2019d probably be a little gentler than that. But basically when it reaches that point, they\u2019re saying, \u201cI want your money.\u201d And that\u2019s really over the top. If it goes even further, and it becomes a question of you \u201cdigging deep\u201d or not having enough faith, I might get ungentle in a hurry.\n\nYour first job is to provide for your family and take care of those kinds of responsibilities. Once you\u2019ve done that, then you\u2019ll hopefully have the financial ability to move beyond tithes and into offerings, which are completely different concepts. Tithes are first fruits off the top, while offerings are from surplus \u2014 meaning that you and your family are doing well financially.\n\nAnother thing to consider is this: Does this church turn every impulse they have into pressure to donate or buy something because they didn\u2019t plan for this kind of stuff in the church budget? I\u2019d start having a problem with the leadership if this turned out to be the case because it\u2019s a sign they\u2019re not planning and leading well.\n\nHopefully, you can explain to these folks the reason why you can\u2019t contribute to additional things at the moment and they\u2019ll understand. If not, and it were me in your shoes, I think I\u2019d have to find another church.\n\nI\u2019ve been following your plan, and I have my emergency fund in place and am investing in mutual funds. Recently, a financial planner recommended bonds to me. What is your opinion on this?\n\nI don\u2019t recommend bonds at all right now. I\u2019m not a fan of them, and I don\u2019t own any. The bond market is almost as volatile as the stock market, and it doesn\u2019t pay nearly as much on average.\n\nOn top of all that, bond prices work at an inverse of interest rates. In other words, as interest rates rise, bond prices go down. Long-term interest rates are still really low. If you were to buy a bunch of bonds right now, and interest rates went up even 1 percent, you could lose a lot.\n\nI recommend mutual funds and good growth stock mutual funds. There are always some bonds mixed in with a growth and income fund, and I\u2019m not opposed to that to some degree, but it\u2019s not my favorite. So, if I were ever going to buy bonds \u2014 and I\u2019m not going to \u2014 it definitely wouldn\u2019t be right now. It doesn\u2019t take much of a move in interest rates for bond prices to go down dramatically.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
