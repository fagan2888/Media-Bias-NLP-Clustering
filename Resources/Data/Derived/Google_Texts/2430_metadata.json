Those services include family skills training, counseling and goods and services to stabilize a family crisis.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which voiced its support for the legislation early Wednesday, said the bill makes critical improvements to the current system.\n\n\u201cThe bill provides for new investments and acknowledges the important role of prevention including parenting skills training and mental health services,\u201d AAP President Sandra Hassink said in a statement. \u201cThese and other services offered to children and their caregivers enable children to stay with their families.
