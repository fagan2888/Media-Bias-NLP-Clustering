Residents can apply for coverage on the State exchange online at sonoma-county.org/healthcarereform and mybenefitscalwin.org, or in-person through at the County Human Services Dept. Economic Assistance offices and various locations throughout the County, including the Redwood Community Health Clinics. See the online listing of enrollment locations, or call Economic Assistance at (877) 699-6868. For Covered California coverage that takes effect January 1, the purchase deadline is December 15, 2015.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to worry about losing their health insurance when they change jobs or launch a business. No one should have to worry about losing their home because of an unexpected medical emergency. The Affordable Care Act and Covered California have gone a long way toward making these fears a thing of the past \u2013 we are urging the public to sign up for coverage during the open enrollment period,\u201d said Sonoma County Supervisor Efren Carrillo. Supervisor Carrillo serves as liaison to both the Department of Health Services and Human Services Department.\n\n\u201cMany low-income clients apply for Covered California subsidized insurance and are happily surprised to find they are eligible for free or low-cost coverage through Medi-Cal,\u201d says Human Services Department Economic Assistance Director Kim Seamans. \u201cResidents covered by either program have access to the same services, so their needs can be met either way.\u201d Medi-Cal enrollment, unlike Covered California, is open year-round online and through the Economic Assistance offices.\n\nAs a result of the federal Affordable Care Act, most Americans are required to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. In 2016, the penalty will be $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of yearly household income, whichever is higher.\n\nTo avoid any penalties, Sonoma County residents are encouraged to sign up for the State program, Covered California, by December 15, 2015 in order to have required coverage as of January 1, 2016. Says Seamans, \u201cFor lower-income residents, it\u2019s not a question of whether they are eligible, it\u2019s a matter of finding out what they are eligible for. Economic Assistance expects to take in a large number of applications in the next few months, so we ask people to be patient with the process.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health Services Director Dr. Stephan Betz stated, \u201cWe are striving to be the healthiest county in California, and an important part of that effort is making sure our residents have access to medical care regardless of income. Enrolling residents in health coverage through Covered California or Medi-Cal is one way individuals and their families can remain healthy and covered.\u201d\n\nCurrently, more than 100,000 people in Sonoma County are on Medi-Cal. In 2014-2015, Human Services Department Economic Assistance Division enrolled more than 12,700 people in Covered California plans. Based on household income, an individual or family may qualify for a tax credit to help pay for health care coverage through Covered California, or for a low- or no-cost plan through Medi-Cal.\n\nSonoma County Enrollment Locations\n\nEsta p\u00e1gina en espa\u00f1ol\n\nIn-person enrollment assistance is available at clinics and other locations in Sonoma County to help individuals and families enroll in health insurance.\n\nPlease call for an appointment\n\nCloverdale\n\nAlexander Valley Healthcare\n\n(serving patients only)\n\n6 Tarman Dr., Cloverdale\n\n(707) 894-4229\n\nForestville\n\nForestville Forestville Wellness Center\n\n6550 Front St., Forestville\n\n(707) 887-0290\n\nGuerneville\n\nRussian River Health Center\n\n16319 3rd St., Guerneville\n\n(707) 869-2849\n\nHealdsburg\n\nAlliance Medical Center\n\n1381 University Ave., Healdsburg\n\n(707) 433-5494 ext. 412\n\nOccidental\n\nOccidental Area Health Center\n\n3802 Main St., Occidental\n\n(707) 874-2444\n\nPetaluma\n\nPetaluma Health Center\n\n1179 North McDowell Blvd., Petaluma\n\n(707) 559-7500\n\nSanta Rosa\n\nBrookwood Health Center\n\n983 Sonoma Ave, Santa Rosa\n\n(707) 583-3030\n\nCommunity Action Partnership\n\n1300 North Dutton Ave., Santa Rosa\n\n(707) 544-6911\n\nHealthy Kids at the Santa Rosa WIC Office\n\n1450 Guerneville Rd., Santa Rosa\n\n(707) 565-6583\n\n(707) 565-6586\n\n(707) 565-4516\n\n(707) 565-4476\n\n(707) 565-4471\n\nRoseland Pediatrics\n\n711 Stony Point Rd., Ste. 17, Santa Rosa\n\n(707) 547-3030\n\nSonoma County Human Services\n\n2550 Paulin Dr., Santa Rosa, or 520 Mendocino Ave., Santa Rosa\n\n(877) 699-6868\n\nSonoma County Indian Health Project\n\n(serving patients only)\n\n144 Stony Point Rd., Santa Rosa\n\n(707) 521-4542\n\nSouthwest Community Health Center\n\n751 Lombardi Ct., Ste.
