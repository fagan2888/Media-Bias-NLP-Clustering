The hard part is treating it, some experts say, and paying for that treatment.\n\n\u201cI hope this recommendation will galvanize a larger conversation around the issue,\u201d said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, the director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cBut we need to look at the big picture\u2014If every place is going to screen, they\u2019re going to have to offer good services too.\u201d\n\nAt the University of North Carolina, mental health providers are embedded in the psychiatry and pediatric wing\u2014and they take Medicaid. According to Meltzer-Brody this should be the model everywhere: psychiatrics working with the pediatricians and ob-gyns. \u201cYou also need to have an adequate number of psychiatrists who take a wide range of insurance, like Medicaid,\u201d she said. However, as she pointed out, New York, despite having so many psychiatrists, has a shortage of those who take insurance. \u201cThere are many mental health providers in New York, but most are privatized,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich means you can get care, but it\u2019s very expensive.\u201d\n\nOlivia Bergeron, based in both Manhattan and Park Slope, is a social worker who has experience in working with mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression and mood disorders. \u201cThe screening costs are minimal and covered by insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the problem is about the treatment\u2014how can women afford the services they need after diagnosis?\u201d\n\nBergeron does not take insurance. \u201cMany therapists and social workers don\u2019t. It\u2019s extremely time consuming and I don\u2019t have a billing person,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d rather spend that time on a client.\u201d She operates on a sliding fee scale depending on patients\u2019 incomes, where one hour of therapy can range from $30 to $400.\n\nStudies suggest that during or after pregnancy, at least one in eight women\u2014and as many as one in five\u2014develop symptoms of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or a combination.\n\nNew York City has been ahead of the wave on screening. In November last year, First Lady Chirlane McCray announced that New York would screen every pregnant woman and new mother for maternal depression. Mayor de Blasio said that screening for maternal depression \u201cshould be a part of routine care.\u201d\n\nIn New York and everywhere, the new recommended screening can be done by any trained health provider, including obstetricians and pediatricians\u2014the doctors who tend to see women most often during and after pregnancy. The most prevalent screening method is the 10-question Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, which is covered by the Affordable Care Act, but the new recommendation makes coverage even clearer. The recommendations make coverage of screenings possible but are less clear about the services accessible after- in terms of both mental health providers and insurance.\n\nBeth Halpern is a psychologist based in Brooklyn Heights who counsels mothers struggling with perinatal mood disorders, encompassing depression and anxiety-related issues. While she sees a pro-bono client every week and tries to accommodate more clients along a sliding-fee scale payment model, she agrees that it\u2019s hard to get coverage for private therapy. \u201cI don\u2019t take insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very arduous\u2014all the paperwork and caps on hours that dictate when and how often you can see your patient.\u201d She isn\u2019t a provider for any of the New York based health insurance plans as \u201cit\u2019s difficult for a solo practitioner\u2014there\u2019s no administrator or staff to go through all the insurance paperwork.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that a mother who qualifies for Medicaid can go to a clinic and see a good provider, but from her experience, \u201cIt\u2019s not always ideal for the mother\u2014it\u2019s hard to mobilize and the waiting lists can be endless so the process of getting help can be time consuming in itself.\u201d The amount and kind of mental health services a person can access is largely dependent on their insurance plan and, as Halpern pointed out, \u201cusually there is a cap on your health insurance plan, which varies greatly and affects the time you can spend with a patient.\u201d\n\nBack in April of last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a proposal to combine mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits for low-income individuals, by collaborating with private health insurance plans. The proposal draws on specific provisions of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance (CHIP). In June 2015, the Behavioral Health Parity in conjunction with Medicaid required all Medicaid managed care organizations to provide mental health services in parity with medical/surgical benefits.\n\nBut as Halpern and Bergeron point out, compensation for mental health therapists has dwindled to the point where few will take insurance, many preferring out-of-pocket coverage.\n\nMolly Peryer struggled with postpartum depression and anxiety during her last month of pregnancy when she was carrying her first child. \u201cWhat is worse in our culture than the idea of a bad mom?\u201d Peryer asked. \u201cWe\u2019re terrified of being given that label.\u201d Five months after the birth, she decided to get help. Now she and her partner, Chris Lindsay-Abaire, run Brooklyn PPD Support. In 2006, the two moms\u2014who both struggled with postpartum depression\u2014established a peer support group in Brooklyn as a place where pregnant and postpartum women can get help. \u201cI started the group because I wanted to go to something like this and there wasn\u2019t one,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her monthly group meetings in Brooklyn, Peryer would find that many mothers would find the discussions extremely helpful. \u201cThese women need to be able to talk in a stigma-free environment. Often, I\u2019ve seen mothers voice their feelings for the first time in the group. Many repress their thoughts in fear that talking about it would mean their child might get taken away,\u201d she said. Halpern, too, believes that support groups like Brooklyn PPD Support are an integral part of the treatment process\u2014\u201cI wish there were more support groups in Brooklyn.\u201d But while the group is a helpful support unit, it doesn\u2019t meet all the treatment requirements.\n\nPeryer has a list of local mental health practitioners that she refers her clients to. But, money is an added source of anxiety for many of these mothers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than having a woman come to the group and me tell her all the things she needs to do to get better, only to have them look at me and say, \u2018I can\u2019t afford any of that\u2019,\u201d Peryer said. Peryer herself paid out of pocket for her treatment and it was an added cost. \u201cMany women take time off from their jobs when they have a baby or they become stay at home moms,\u201d she said, \u201cSo the additional expense of treatment often prevents them from seeking out help.\u201d\n\nThe new recommendation is certainly forcing the issue of screenings, but a larger problem remains\u2014the huge gap in the range of services afforded by the wealthy people and the lack of options for the less well off. As Meltzer-Brody pointed out, unless these screenings also push for more coherent and comprehensive insured mental health services within hospitals, the well-intentioned thought behind it may never be fully realized. \u201cThat\u2019s still something we need to work on,\u201d she said, \u201cdeveloping services that are affordable.\u201d\n\nFurther, Bergeron hopes that this recommendation will be \u201ccritical in getting the word out to pediatricians and obstetricians to do more screenings.\u201d Jada Shapiro, founder of Birth Day Presence in Brooklyn and an experienced doula, agrees. \u201cThe big issue is not just regular screenings, rather it\u2019s the disconnect between the care providers. We need more pediatricians in the area to administer screenings for mothers.\u201d While the pediatrician\u2019s realm of expertise is the child, they are the ones who see the mother the most after pregnancy. \u201cThe mother and the baby are a unit, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Premier Pediatrics, a program about to launch in May, \u201cThe First Month,\u201d is hoping to bridge this gap. Jon Sarnoff, a pediatrician who works in Manhattan and Brooklyn, hopes the program will engage the pediatric community to regulate depression screenings for mothers. According to Sarnoff, the program will have three major components\u2014provision of lactation rooms and pumps (there\u2019s been a link between nursing and feelings of empowerment), educational resources made available to both mothers and fathers, and carrying out screenings. \u201cWe will also work with a network of ob-gyns so that the mothers are in more regular contact with them after the screenings,\u201d he said, \u201cfor example, have the ob-gyn call and check in, in case the mother doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut once again, it all comes down to money. Sarnoff said that the biggest challenge his group is facing is working around the cost structure\u2014\u201cHow do we help out the mom who really needs therapy but doesn\u2019t have the insurance coverage? That still remains unresolved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NY City Lens", "description": "Healthcare experts see a gap between diagnosis and treatment", "title": "Postpartum Depression: More Screening Is Good, But Then What? - NY City Lens", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://nycitylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AP090506047647.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-07T22:00:24+00:00", "url": "http://nycitylens.com/2016/02/14323/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nycitylens/", "section": "Brooklyn", "tag": "Unites States Preventive Services Task Force", "published_time": "2016-02-07T12:04:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T22:00:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=0.9, minimum-scale=0.9", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "Jon Sarnoff, a pediatrician who works in Manhattan and Brooklyn, hopes the program will engage the pediatric community to regulate depression screenings for mothers.\nThe proposal draws on specific provisions of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance (CHIP).\nMolly Peryer struggled with postpartum depression and anxiety during her last month of pregnancy when she was carrying her first child.\nPeryer has a list of local mental health practitioners that she refers her clients to.\nIn June 2015, the Behavioral Health Parity in conjunction with Medicaid required all Medicaid managed care organizations to provide mental health services in parity with medical/surgical benefits."}
