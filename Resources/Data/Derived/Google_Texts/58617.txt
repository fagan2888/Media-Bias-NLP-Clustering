PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Health Minister Florence Duperval Guillaume was named as Haiti’s interim prime minister on Sunday following the resignation of her predecessor a week ago amid a stalemate over delayed legislative elections.

Duperval Guillaume will hold the post for a maximum of 30 days, as established by the constitution, before a permanent choice is presented to parliament by President Michel Martelly, according to Enex Jean Charles, secretary general of Haiti’s council of ministers.

The former prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, resigned a week ago amid the bitter political standoff over legislative elections.

Martelly was supposed to call elections in 2011 for a majority of Senate seats, the entire Chamber of Deputies and local offices. But several opposition senators have used parliamentary procedure to prevent a vote authorizing the election while orchestrating a series of large protests in the capital to call for the president to resign.
