A federal judge in New York may force the government to release a trove of images taken at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2004.

Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled that the Defense Department has not provided sufficient evidence that disclosing the images would put U.S. citizens and military personnel overseas in danger, The Hill reported.

“Given the passage of time, I have no basis for concluding either that the disclosure of photographs depicting the abuse or mistreatment of prisoners would affect United States military operations at this time, or that it would not,” Judge Hellerstein wrote Wednesday, The Hill reported.

In 2009 the Defense Department was allowed by the judge not to disclose roughly 2,000 photos. His decision to revisit the case will force the Defense Department to analyze each individual photo and prove its incendiary nature.

“I have reviewed some of these photographs and I know that many of these photographs are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,” the judge continued, The Hill reported.

The Defense Department has until Sept. 8 to respond to Judge Hellerstein’s ruling.

Army Pfc. Lynndie England was found guilty in 2005 of one count of conspiracy, one count of committing an indecent act and four counts of maltreating detainees for her role in the scandal. Of the nine Army reservists linked to the abuse, six took plea deals.
