Both teams score perfect in season's first big test

More bodies may have clogged up the course at Buffalo Ranch on Saturday morning for the 30th annual Rocky Mountain Shootout, but for the men's and women's cross country teams at Colorado, the competition seemed to come entirely within themselves.

The only difference was going from a training mentality to a winning mentality, and that transition was flawless as both the men and women recorded perfect scores in crisp conditions against several local Division I and Division II teams.

"This race is the first chance for us to really compete with each other, out there as a team but at the same time trying to beat each other," said senior Pierce Murphy, who won the men's race with a time of 24 minutes, 26 seconds — one second off his time of a year ago. "Of course, we're training hard but we're not really competing during training. We all know each other races, and how we train, so there's nothing really competitive up to now."

The first meet in which the Buffs competed with most of their elite runners, CU held the top seven spots on the men's side and five of the top six on the women's side. Following Murphy directly was Morgan Pearson, Connor Winter and Zach Perrin — all within 27 seconds.

Junior Erin Clark beat her time of last year, finishing first in 20:13, and the Buffaloes tried to push their pack time in an attempt to get the racing juices flowing.

No one wearing colors other than gold could keep up.

"Definitely excited. It's been awhile since the end of track season, and a long time since cross country so it was fun to test out all the training we've been doing and see where everyone's fitness is," said Clark, who led the entire way. "I think it went well. I watched everyone come in and was excited to see Maddie (Alm) and Dani (Jones) just behind me."

Certainly, there is growing interest in how well the women's team is shaping up. They came into Saturday's race second in both the regional and national polls behind New Mexico, and by cooking the home course they definitely appear ready to take that next step. Alm finished in 20:54, Jones in 21:16.

"Those are big shoes to fill being ranked No. 2, but I think it's exciting that people are seeing that we have a strong team here," Clark said. "We're just going to keep training as we are, doing the right things and hopefully the results will come."

The Buffaloes might catch a better glimpse of where they are at in two weeks, when they travel to Louisville for the NCAA Pre-Nationals. So far, however, there has been nothing but encouraging signs for head coach Mark Wetmore.

"I saw two good teams, two teams that may be a little better than I expected," Wetmore said, adding times were surprisingly comparable to last year despite different racing conditions. "The women ran a little better (than last year).

"There's a little more talent (on the women's side), another year of experience and a good, solid summer and some synergy. They're all making each other better, so you put all those things together and it makes a big step forward."

Wetmore said Ryan Forsyth's seventh place finish impressed him, as did the unattached runs of true freshmen John Dressel and Joe Klecker — enough to question the benefits of redshirting them.

The men won the race for the 25th straight time, while the women logged their 17th straight Shootout victory.
