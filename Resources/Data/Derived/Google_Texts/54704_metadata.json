He and his wife, Lynne, have retired to a farm in Northeast Mississippi.\n\nIn a Ways and Means Committee hearing last week Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, showed up to announce that 4.2 million Americans had enrolled in Obamacare.\n\nKevin Brady (R-TX) asked her if she was going to delay the individual mandate further. \u201cNo sir,\u201d she responded.\n\nThe secretary seemed to be unaware that her department had done just that more than a week before. The suspension of the mandate was buried in an unrelated rule. It casually mentions that a rule in a separate December 2013 bulletin would be extended.\n\nThroughout the catastrophic rollout of Obamacare it has been clear that Mrs. Sebelius was either \u201cout of the loop\u201d in the department of which she was the top executive, or she is just a blatant liar. I, frankly, am unsure which is worse.\n\nThe law became effective on October 1. On October 2 it was clear that the program was not ready for prime time. The Republicans in the House passed several bills to repeal it and then to just postpone the effective date. The White House lectured that this was a law passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the president. It was even ratified by the Supreme Court. It is settled law and cannot be changed.\n\nWhen the stories of cancelled plans rolled out it became clear that this was causing more political pain than could be managed in an election year and the administration decided to change that \u201csettled law\u201d and delay its effective date.\n\nWhat the president castigated the Republicans for trying to do legally, he did without any legal authority. Last week he extended that deadline again which would get the Democrats, conveniently, beyond another election.\n\nIn early February, the president extended the effective date for small businesses for a year. That too has just been extended for two years.\n\nThe most recent delay, which the President so ardently opposed when it was offered as a legitimate legislative proposal, applies, according to Speaker John Boehner, \u201cto virtually anyone for any reason.\u201d\n\nFor all practical purposes Obamacare is no longer.\n\nSecretary Sebelius was also asked in that hearing how many of the 4.2 million \u201cenrollees\u201d she was touting had paid the premium and were thus actually insured.\n\nShe had no idea. She explained that the purchasers pay the insurance company direct to the insurance company and there was no way for the government to know who paid and who didn\u2019t. That simply has to be another lie.\n\nThe entire purpose of this enterprise was to find a way to insure those who were uninsured. There are many pieces to this puzzle. One of the most important pieces is information. I promise you that if 95 percent had paid for their policy she would have happily told the committee\n\nObamacare was undertaken ostensibly because about 45 million Americans did not own health insurance. There were many reasons for that. We were told that up to half of our entire population could have trouble buying insurance because of pre-existing conditions. The Census Bureau puts that number at about 1.5 million. It was known at the time of the debate that a significant number of the uninsured had plenty of money. They just chose not to buy insurance.\n\nSome had jobs that provided coverage and they opted out. I visited a plant in Athens, Ga. and asked the plant manager if they provided insurance coverage. She said that they did, but only about 42 percent of the employees availed themselves of it. They didn\u2019t want to pay their share of the premium and knew that they could go to the emergency room at any time.\n\nTwo of her employees, who were insured, delivered babies in the last year. When they went to the hospital they told the person at the receiving desk that they were uninsured. They didn\u2019t want to pay the co-pay.\n\nToday we are 90 percent of the way through the open enrollment period for Obamacare. A McKinsey study through February concludes that of those signed up about 27 percent were previously uninsured and 13 percent of those had paid the premium. So, 143,000 of the 45 million previously without insurance are now covered.\n\nThank you Mr. Obama!\n\nOf those who were previously insured, but lost their insurance and went through the hassle of getting new insurance, 86 percent paid their premiums.\n\nWe now have 2.4 million newly insured under Obamacare while 4.7 million lost their policies because of the new mandates. That is not success.\n\nSo where does that leave us? We have spent billions of dollars to put one-sixth of our economy under the heavy boot of government. Bureaucrats have reordered what was widely seen as the world\u2019s best health care system, thousands of doctors are leaving their practice and we have 2.3 million fewer people insured than were insured six months ago.\n\nHow\u2019s this working out for you so far?\n\nJohn Linder served in Congress for 18 years from Georgia.
