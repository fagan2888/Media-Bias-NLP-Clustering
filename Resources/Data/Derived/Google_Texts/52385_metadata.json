CEO Mario Schlosser has found the strategy he says will build his startup into a million-customer player in the health insurance industry: use tight, exclusive networks with hospitals to sell competitively priced insurance in perhaps 30 U.S. markets.\n\nThe tactic, a shift from Oscar\u2019s beginnings in New York, has helped it grow to about 43,000 members in Dallas and San Antonio during its first year in the Texas market, according to preliminary figures provided by the company. Nationwide, Oscar boosted enrollment to 145,000 customers in 2016, up from about 40,000 last year. The company\u2019s chief executive officer has said he wants to hit the million mark within five years.\n\n\u201cThe bet we made in going deep with a couple of health systems, I love what we\u2019re doing there,\u201d Schlosser said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very good blueprint now to go into new markets.\u201d Since its founding in 2012, Oscar has raised money from private investors and has a $1.75 billion valuation.\n\nThe strategy taps into two key features of the markets created by President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act: Consumers tend to go with cheaper plans, and each customer can shop for his or her own policy. Using a narrow set of doctors and hospitals to build an insurance plan can help Oscar keep premiums low.\n\n\u2018Price-Competitive\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s different from the market for insurance provided through employers, where most working-age people get their coverage. Companies typically choose broader networks, with multiple hospitals and physician groups, to satisfy employees who may have different needs or live in different parts of a region. That wider selection is typically more expensive.\n\n\u201cThe good news for a startup is this is a very price- competitive market,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation health policy organization. \u201cPeople flock to low-cost plans, and are willing to switch from one year to the next if they can get a better deal.\u201d\n\nWhen it started in New York, Oscar had a different strategy, using a broad network like a traditional insurer. In early 2014, Schlosser told an interviewer that he\u2019d send a cancer patient to Manhattan\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, \u201cbecause it may be more expensive in the short run, but she\u2019ll get better care, which will be better for her and probably for us in the long run.\u201d\n\nBig Player?\n\nSince then, Oscar has been cutting its hospital list, and Memorial Sloan Kettering isn\u2019t on it. This year, Oscar patients in the New York region will no longer be able to go to New York- Presbyterian-affiliated hospitals, such as Weill Cornell Medical Center. New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn is also out. Instead, Oscar covers what it says are 40,000 health providers and more than 70 hospitals, including ones tied to New York University and Mount Sinai Health System. It\u2019s allowed existing members to stick with their current health providers to avoid disruptions in care, according to a company spokeswoman.\n\nWith a million customers, Oscar wouldn\u2019t rival the biggest health insurers in the U.S., but it would make the firm a big player in the individual market. UnitedHealth Group Inc. has about 42.3 million customers nationwide, while Anthem has 38.6 million, including about 1.7 million in the individual market.\n\nOscar\u2019s new strategy hasn\u2019t worked everywhere: A limited network wasn\u2019t enough to keep pricing competitive in California this year. Oscar enrolled just 5,000 people in Los Angeles and the Orange County area. In Los Angeles, for example, a mid-level Oscar plan costs $338 a month. That\u2019s $23 more than an Anthem Inc. offering, while the cheapest coverage costs $267 a month.\n\nIn all, about 1.6 million people bought plans for 2016 on California\u2019s ACA exchange, as of Feb. 7, according to the state. Oscar\u2019s figures include consumers who bought through California\u2019s marketplace, as well as directly from the company.\n\n\u2018Nobody Knows\u2019\n\nIn San Antonio, by comparison, Oscar offers the least expensive mid-level plan on the Obamacare market. It\u2019s using Tenet Healthcare Corp. and Baylor Scott & White Health in Dallas, and Tenet\u2019s Baptist Health System in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, Oscar is very competitive,\u201d said Dylan Roby, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. In California, \u201cYou have to pay extra to get this plan that nobody knows about.\u201d\n\nSchlosser said he\u2019s confident Oscar will grow in California. He pointed out that enrollment in New Jersey jumped from a few thousand last year to about 28,000 for 2016. The company has about 69,000 members in New York.\n\n\u201cWhen we go into a market like California, we don\u2019t underprice,\u201d Schlosser said. \u201cWe price for a good margin, what we think covers medical risk in a good way.\u201d\n\nIn California, Oscar partnered with Providence Health to build a network that includes University of California, Los Angeles hospitals. The plan covers about 16 hospitals in the area.\n\nOscar and Providence also agreed to share the cost and profit of caring for patients, rather than Oscar paying Providence a fee each time a customer sees a physician or gets an x-ray. It\u2019s an arrangement other insurers have used to cut down on unnecessary procedures, with the goal of maintaining a patient\u2019s overall health.\n\n\u201cWe want some skin in the game for both parties to deliver on performance,\u201d said P.K. Khurana, chief strategic services officer at Providence Health. \u201cWe have a shared goal of really trying to transform the patient experience.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Oscar Health Insurance Corp.
