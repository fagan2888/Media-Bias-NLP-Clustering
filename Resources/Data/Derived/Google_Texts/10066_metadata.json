However, this is the first time in recorded history that not only were human teeth found in the tumor, but also that the teeth were fully grown adult teeth.\n\nTeeth have been found in tumors before, but never in this type of tumor. The tumors that have contained teeth are called teratomas.\n\nTeratomas are unique in that they contain the three types of tissue found in human embryos. In contrast, a craniopharyngioma only has one type of tissue, making this infant a medical rarity.\n\nCraniopharyngioma\u2019s are generally found in children ages 5-14 so the four-month old infant\u2019s tumor suggests the tumor developed form cells that make teeth.\n\nThe infant is recovering well but this type of tumor is of the pituitary gland and may cause abnormal hormonal growth and related problems. Additionally, the tumor destroyed the normal connections disallowing the brain to release certain hormones and hormone treatments will be mandatory for life.\n\nBeaty told the New England Journal that only a few years ago, the infant would not have survived.\n\nPaul Mountjoy is a Virginia based psychotherapist", "article_metadata": {"description": "A rare tumor, first in history", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Paul Mountjoy", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "A rare tumor, first in history", "title": "Adult teeth found in infant\u2019s brain", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/health-science/health/adult-teeth-found-in-infants-brain-11082/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/brain_tumor.jpg", "height": 692}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A rare tumor, first in history", "title": "Adult teeth found in infant's brain", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/brain_tumor-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@paulmountjoy", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "tumor,teeth,brain,infant", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-01T15:43:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-01T15:43:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "brain, infant, teeth, tumor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c07\"", "article_summary": "However, this is the first time in recorded history that not only were human teeth found in the tumor, but also that the teeth were fully grown adult teeth.\nCraniopharyngioma\u2019s are generally found in children ages 5-14 so the four-month old infant\u2019s tumor suggests the tumor developed form cells that make teeth.\nTeeth have been found in tumors before, but never in this type of tumor.\nThis type of tumor is benign but can grow to the size of a golf ball and contain calcium deposits.\nAdditionally, the tumor destroyed the normal connections disallowing the brain to release certain hormones and hormone treatments will be mandatory for life."}
