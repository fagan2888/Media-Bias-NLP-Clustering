In video obtained by Media Matters -- published here for the first time -- close Trump ally Roger Stone says Trump himself gave money to Willey so she would be able to attack the Clintons during Hillary Clinton\u2019s current presidential run. The Office of the Independent Counsel reviewed Willey\u2019s allegations but declined to press charges after determining that Willey repeatedly shifted her story, lied to the FBI, and urged a friend to falsely support her story. She subsequently suggested that the Clintons had murdered her husband in the same way they supposedly murdered former White House aide Vince Foster.\n\nResearch", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "From the January 22 edition of CNN's Crossfire:", "title": "On CNN, NARAL's Ilyse Hogue Calls Out Lila Rose For Hypocrisy On Preventing Unwanted Pregnancies", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/01/22/on-cnn-narals-ilyse-hogue-calls-out-lila-rose-f/197701", "updated_time": "2014-01-22T20:24:45-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/01/22/on-cnn-narals-ilyse-hogue-calls-out-lila-rose-f/197701", "title": "On CNN, NARAL's Ilyse Hogue Calls Out Lila Rose For Hypocrisy On Preventing Unwanted Pregnancies", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Video", "tag": "CNN", "published_time": "2014-01-22T20:24:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-22T19:51:49-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/media-matters-staff/70"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc509\"", "article_summary": "She subsequently suggested that the Clintons had murdered her husband in the same way they supposedly murdered former White House aide Vince Foster.\nThe media is highlighting a new web video from Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign that features former White House aide Kathleen Willey accusing Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s.\nIn video obtained by Media Matters -- published here for the first time -- close Trump ally Roger Stone says Trump himself gave money to Willey so she would be able to attack the Clintons during Hillary Clinton\u2019s current presidential run.\nThe Office of the Independent Counsel reviewed Willey\u2019s allegations but declined to press charges after determining that Willey repeatedly shifted her story, lied to the FBI, and urged a friend to falsely support her story."}
