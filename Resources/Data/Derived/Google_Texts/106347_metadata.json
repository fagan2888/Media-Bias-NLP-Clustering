That's insane.\"\n\nKerik, who had been nominated by former President George W. Bush to lead the Department of Homeland Security, spent time in prison on eight felony counts, including tax fraud and lying to the White House.\n\n\"If the American people and members of Congress saw what I saw, there would be anger, there would be outrage, and there would be change, because nobody would stand for it,\" Kerik said of his time behind bars.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said on \"Meet the Press\" that there was a \"growing consensus\" on the issue of prison reform, citing comments from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Attorney General Eric Holder has instituted several reforms as part of a \"Smart on Crime\" initiative, including a policy that allows some low-level drug defendants to avoid mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 27 Reasons Why U.S. Shouldn't Lead War On Drugs 27 Reasons Why U.S. Shouldn't Lead War On Drugs\n\n1 of 27 Because Most Americans Are Unenthusiastic About It Only 7 percent of Americans think the United States is winning the war on drugs , and few Americans are interested in throwing down more money to try to win, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll released in 2012.
