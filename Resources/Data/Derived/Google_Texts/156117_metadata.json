Frontrunner Donald Trump was the guest of honor. But hosts Eric Bolling and Kimberly Guilfoyle were so busy slobbering over Trump that they missed the countdown that Trump was supposed to do and they ended up doing it late, after January 1, 2016 had already begun and the Times Square ball had already dropped.\n\nOther candidates, including Democrat Martin O\u2019Malley, appeared in video messages that were generally upbeat. But Cruz, in a voice filled with hammy hope and optimism, talked only of all the things he looks forward to obliterating:\n\nCRUZ: Happy New Year. 2016 is going to be an incredible year. 2016 is going to be the last year of the Obama presidency. 2016 is going to be the last year before Hillary retires permanently to Chappaqua. 2016 is going to be the last year that we have ObamaCare.\n\nCruz apparently thought the idea of 17 million people losing their health insurance was such happy news, he didn\u2019t feel the need to tell anyone what will replace it.\n\nCRUZ: 2016 is going to be the last year until we abolish the IRS. And 2016 is going to be the last year until we utterly destroy ISIS and defeat radical Islamic terrorism. Like 1980, 2016 is going to be a very, very good year.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say a single thing about what he\u2019d create or how he'd fund such things as the military that's going to \"utterly destroy\" ISIS without an IRS. Not to mention roads, bridges, airport security and Social Security. I would not be surprised if Cruz intended to privatize all of them.\n\nThen came the acrimonious joke which, Cruz said in a folksy voice, was \u201cjust a simple story, a story that I\u2019ve heard on the trail.\u201d\n\nThe gist of the \u201csimple story\u201d that went on for more than a full minute is that in January, 2017 \u201ca little old man\u201d goes to the White House day after day asking for Barack Obama and is repeatedly told Obama is no longer president. The predictable punch line was, \u201cThe little old man smiles and with a twinkle in his eye, says, \u2018I know that. I just love hearing you say it!\u2019 And the Marine promptly salutes (as did Cruz, melodramatically) and says, \u2018See you tomorrow, Sir!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c2016 is going to be a very, very good year,\u201d Cruz concluded.\n\nNot surprisingly, hosts Eric Bolling and Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 the ones who later missed the countdown to midnight \u2013 gushed over Cruz\u2019 maliciousness.\n\nBolling is impressed. \u201cGotta love the story. That guy can tell a story.\u201d Guilfoyle agrees. \u201cThat was very special and creative.\u201d\n\nWatch it below, from Fox\u2019s December 31 New Year\u2019s Eve special.\n\n(H/T NewsHound Richard)", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "7e7lmUJGrAtH3zNyjzg27n/RidI6tLYNL1GPpIiijBA=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/ted_cruz_creepy_mean_spirited_new_year_s_message_for_fox_viewers_010116", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019 Creepy, Mean-Spirited New Year\u2019s Message For Fox Viewers"}, "Title": "Ted Cruz\u2019 Creepy, Mean-Spirited New Year\u2019s Message For Fox Viewers"}, "article_summary": "CRUZ: 2016 is going to be the last year until we abolish the IRS.\nNot surprisingly, hosts Eric Bolling and Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 the ones who later missed the countdown to midnight \u2013 gushed over Cruz\u2019 maliciousness.\nAnd 2016 is going to be the last year until we utterly destroy ISIS and defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\nAs I previously noted, Republican candidates Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina got brief live stints on Fox\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve special.\n2016 is going to be the last year before Hillary retires permanently to Chappaqua."}
