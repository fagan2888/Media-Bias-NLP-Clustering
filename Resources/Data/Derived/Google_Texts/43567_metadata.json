Having won three of the four contests so far, he\u2019s heading into Super Tuesday six days from now in a position to widen his lead beyond the point where his opponents could catch him.\n\nWhich raises an inevitable question: Is he really as terrible a general election candidate as so many people have assumed?\n\nThe most rational answer is that we have no idea. If Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio were the nominee, the general election would likely be fairly predictable, in that the debate would revolve around traditional partisan divisions on issues, and we know which states would be competitive and which wouldn\u2019t. But just as Trump\u2019s unique candidacy has defied all that we thought we knew about what matters in primary campaigns \u2014 the damage done by outrageous statements, the importance of ideological consistency, the key role played by party elites \u2014 so too could a Trump nomination produce an utterly unpredictable general election.\n\nDonald Trump cruised to victory in Nevada, building a broad coalition that left his two rivals trailing far behind heading into Super Tuesday. The Washington Post's David Weigel talks about what this means for Trump 's chances of securing the GOP nomination. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\nThere are still good reasons to think that Trump would be be obliterated by the Democratic nominee. But there\u2019s also a case to be made that Trump would so scramble the election calculus that he could win. Indeed, you might even argue that he has a better shot than a more traditional candidate. Let\u2019s examine each way of looking at the general election.\n\nThe case against Trump\u2019s chances begins with the fact that he\u2019s tremendously unpopular. As much as he has thrilled a certain segment of the Republican electorate, everything he has done and said in the primary campaign \u2014 the xenophobia, the bigotry, the bombast \u2014 has served to alienate him from voters he would need to win the general election. Polls of all Americans, as opposed to just Republicans, show that around 30-35 percent of the public have a favorable impression of Trump, while around 55-60 percent have an unfavorable impression of him.\n\nFurthermore, talking about building a wall with Mexico and rounding up 11 million undocumented immigrants might make the audiences at his rallies cheer, but it won\u2019t play so well with the broader electorate. Everyone understands that the GOP must improve its showing among Latino voters, one of the fastest-growing parts of the electorate, if it\u2019s ever to win back the White House. Trump wouldn\u2019t just fail to improve those numbers, he\u2019d make the bottom fall out: polls have shown (see here or here or here) that Trump is spectacularly unpopular with Latinos, just as you might expect, with approval ratings as low as 11 percent. Furthermore, his nomination would be a terrific mobilization tool to get Latino voters to the polls.\n\nThat\u2019s true of other voting groups as well. If you\u2019re not a white guy and Trump hasn\u2019t insulted you yet, he probably will by the end of the primaries. Imagine that the Democratic nominee were Hillary Clinton. How wide will the gender gap be when the potential first woman president is running against a guy who shows such contempt for women and discards each of his wives as soon as she hits her 40s? (Note to Melania: the clock is ticking, so you might want to prepare yourself.)\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Trump has tapped into something important within the Republican electorate, but that\u2019s where it resides: that combination of anger at their party\u2019s leaders and fear of a changing world sowed the seeds for Trump\u2019s rise. But the general electorate is very different from the Republican electorate: among other things, it\u2019s less white, less Christian, and younger. The positions Trump has taken as he\u2019s appealed to Republicans \u2014 overturn Roe v. Wade, loosen gun laws, cut taxes for the wealthy, repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are all unpopular with the public at large.\n\nSo that\u2019s the case for a Trump defeat in the fall: he\u2019s got the wrong positions on issues, he\u2019s ticked off a lot of voters he\u2019ll need, and he\u2019s generally considered to be an obnoxious jerk.\n\nThe argument in favor of a Trump victory has two pieces to it, one about demographics and one about the kind of candidate he\u2019d actually be in a general election. The demographic argument says that Trump has an appeal that other Republicans don\u2019t have. We\u2019ve seen again and again how party leaders (and his opponents) have attacked him for liberal positions he\u2019s held in the past (like being pro-choice and saying nice things about single-payer health care), and even some heresies he\u2019s offered in the present (like his bizarre assertion that George W. Bush was president on September 11, 2001 or his criticism of the Iraq War). Trump\u2019s voters, it turned out, didn\u2019t care. Ideological consistency isn\u2019t important to them, because their affection for Trump is based on other things, like their contempt for Washington and the belief that he\u2019s a \u201cwinner,\u201d and if he were president he\u2019d spread his winningness over the whole country, through some process that need not be explained.\n\nSince these beliefs aren\u2019t tied to conservative ideology, they could have appeal beyond Republicans. And even if Trump alienates women, his displays of chest-thumping dominance could appeal to lots and lots of white men, particularly those who are lower on the income and education scales (as Trump said after his Nevada win yesterday, \u201cI love the poorly educated\u201d). That could make Trump competitive in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan that have been in the Democratic column in the last two elections. Unlike other Republicans who have to work to convince voters that they aren\u2019t just on the side of the rich, Trump, an actual rich person, has an economic appeal that has nothing to do with facts but is more about feeling. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders may be leading Trump in general election trial heats, but not by much \u2014 just a few points.\n\nIt\u2019s the second piece of the puzzle that may be less appreciated at this point. To put it simply, Donald Trump would be a completely different candidate in a general election than the one we see now. Conservatives are justified in being terrified by Trump\u2019s ideological malleability. They look at him and see someone with no true beliefs and no commitments, who will quickly change positions if it suits him. He\u2019s only presenting himself as a conservative Republican now \u2014 to the degree that he\u2019s even doing that \u2014 because he\u2019s running in a Republican primary.\n\nWhen conservatives think that, they\u2019re absolutely right. He will indeed transform himself once he has a different audience. We don\u2019t have to wonder about that, because he has said so on more than one occasion. \u201cOnce you get to a certain level, it changes,\u201d he told Greta Van Susteren a few weeks ago. \u201cI will be changing very rapidly. I\u2019m very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, he told voters in Iowa, \u201cWhen I\u2019m president, I\u2019m a different person. I can do anything. I can be the most politically correct person that you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d While ordinary politicians try to convince you of their consistency, Trump proudly says that he\u2019ll turn himself into whatever the situation demands. And if it demands someone who has moderate positions, that\u2019s what he\u2019ll be.\n\nWill the voters buy it? We have no way of knowing, because we haven\u2019t seen that version of Trump yet. But we shouldn\u2019t assume that the fact that most of them dislike the current version means they won\u2019t like the next one.\n\nAt the moment, I haven\u2019t decided which of these scenarios I think is more likely, Trump getting blown out and taking the Republican Party with him, or Trump forging a heretofore unseen coalition that carries him to the White House. I lean toward the first, but I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s because the idea of this despicable buffoon being the most powerful human being on earth is so ghastly, and my judgment derives more from hope than anything else. The truth is that with Trump in a general election, we\u2019d be in uncharted territory.
