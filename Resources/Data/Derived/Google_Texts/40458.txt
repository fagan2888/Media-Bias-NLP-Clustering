DECATUR, Ala. (WHNT) - The CEO of Decatur Morgan Hospital says the U.S. appears headed toward a single payer health care system, or Medicare for all. Nat Richardson made the remarks during a Morgan County Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting Thursday. He says health care providers need to sit down and prepare.

"The government will pay us one payment and or commercial insurance payers will pay us one payment. The hospitals would then be responsible for making sure all of the providers thats attached with that episode of care are paid," Richardson told WHNT News 19.

There is a big difference in a so-called single payer system and the Affordable Care Act. Richardson says in the next decade millions of Americans will remain uninsured under the Affordable Care Act, and millions more will be under-insured. That means the delivery of health care services would still conditioned by a patient's ability to pay. However, under a single payer system, everyone's covered. Period.

"It is a very challenging system for a single payer system because you've got to determine the value of each of the care providers, the specialists, the surgeons, what do you pay the nursing care units, what does the hospital get paid for it's services. And I think what that does is require us all to come to the table and discuss how we deliver care in a single payer system and it's just going to require all of us at the table together."

The evolution of health care in America, and the debate is really just getting started. Richardson also discussed Medicare, Medicaid and Blue Cross/Blue Shield reimbursements the hospital receives. He says currently they are the lowest in the state.
