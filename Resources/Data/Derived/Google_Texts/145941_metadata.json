Until.\n\n\u201cI got into my practice and realized there were a whole lot of folks in Atlanta and Washington who had never taken care of a patient that wanted to tell me how to practice,\u201d he said.\n\nPrice met with the Rome News-Tribune editorial staff Monday in advance of a speech on healthcare economics and policy issues to Berry College students.\n\nOne of the highest-ranking physicians in Washington, Price has long been an opponent of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\nIn May of 2015, Price introduced a revised version of his Empowering Patients First Act.\n\nIt would repeal the ACA and replace its subsidies and mandated purchase of insurance policies with a plan that focuses on regulatory reform and tax credits to make coverage affordable.\n\nUnlike the income-based Obamacare subsidies, Price\u2019s plan would provide tax credits based on age. The higher the age, and likely dependency on the health care system, the higher the tax credit.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t tell anybody what to buy; we simply make it so that\u2019s financially feasible for everybody to get coverage,\u201d Price said. \u201cThe way that we do that is to provide tax credits to folks regardless of their income status.\u201d\n\nPrice said that under Obamacare many Americans may have medical coverage but they\u2019re not getting actual care.\n\n\u201cYou get somebody early in the year who hasn\u2019t met their deductible and you tell them they need a procedure that\u2019s going to cost $6,000, they\u2019re going to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Price said. \u201cThat\u2019s just wrong. Real people are getting hurt right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to trust people and you\u2019ve got to trust markets to believe that my plan works,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know what doesn\u2019t work and it\u2019s government-run healthcare.\u201d\n\nPrice does not face opposition in the GOP primary next month but will face off with Democrat Rodney Stooksbury in the Nov. 8 general election.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Six-term Georgia Congressman Tom Price, R-Roswell, is an orthopedic surgeon who never dreamed of entering into politics.
