Drug companies see a lot of risk in providing a drug in the approval pipeline to a patient already in advanced stages of a disease.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried about getting sideways with the FDA,\u201d said Kurt Altman of the Phoenix-based institute, which began promoting the bill 18 months ago.\n\nFlorida was the 21st state to enact it with Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s signature last month; two more states lack only their governors\u2019 signature. The measure is pending in at least a dozen more.\n\nBut not a single patient has received access to an investigational drug through a state Right to Try law. Altman predicts a breakthrough by the end of the summer.\n\nTo ratchet up public pressure on the companies and the FDA to cooperate, the Goldwater Institute launched a website and a petition drive. It features personal stories of terminally-ill children and their parents pleading for one last try.\n\nThe FDA denies it is blocking access to the drugs and has taken no position on Right to Try.\n\n\u201cIt is critical for the public to understand that FDA is not a barrier to accessing investigational drugs or medical devices,\u201d press officer Sandy Walsh said in an email. The FDA \u201chelps to ensure patients are adequately protected from receiving a potentially harmful or ineffective treatment.\u201d\n\nWalsh said keeping the FDA involved in the process also ensures the collection of data to guide FDA decisions. \u201cThe drug approval process represents the best way to assure development of and access to safe and effective new medicines for all patients,\u201d Walsh wrote.\n\nFDA has its own compassionate-use process, created in 2009. But the agency's own officials concede Expanded Access is so cumbersome to use that relatively few who could benefit apply. Right to Try advocates say bypassing the FDA program could save weeks or months, precious time for patients and their families.\n\nWhen Right to Try came to the Florida House floor in April, several members spoke of the personal impact of the bill.\n\nDebbie Mayfield, R-Vero Beach, said her husband Stan responded to treatment with a cancer drug when he was enrolled in a Phase 1 clinical trial at M.D. Anderson in Houston. But he could no longer get the drug after that trial ended. He died in 2007, three months shy of their oldest son\u2019s graduation..\n\n\u201cTime is so important to cancer patients,\u201d she said.\n\nThe House bill sponsor, Rep. Ray Pilon, said his 36-year-old son has colorectal cancer. While he\u2019s doing well in treatment now, that could change. \u201cSo, this is personal to me,\u201d said Pilon, R-Sarasota.\n\nThe act passed the House unanimously and got overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate.\n\nThese moves by Florida and other states will force the FDA to make compassionate use easier and faster, Pilon said. \u201cThe passage of this bill\u2026will finally make the federal government wake up and say, \u2018There\u2019s a better way to do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the the FDA estimates its \u201cExpanded Access\u201d program application may take up to 100 hours to complete, Associate Commissioner Peter Lurie said the agency was proposing a shorter, simpler form expected to take just 45 minutes. The FDA also has streamlined its website, he said.\n\nThe new law does not require drug companies to make medications available. It just shields the company, as well as doctors and health facilities, from liability if it does. It also doesn\u2019t require insurers to cover the treatment, meaning companies either have to give the drug for free or try to get money from a dying patient.\n\nWalsh, from the FDA, said it is not unusual for the company to refuse, she said.\n\n\u201cBefore a request for access to an investigational drug can be considered, a drug company must be willing to provide the drug,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FDA cannot legally require a drug company to make a drug product available.\u201d\n\nThe industry\u2019s lobbying arm, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), has taken no position on the state bills. State laws are well intentioned, but do little to improve the FDA\u2019s process, said Sasha Haverfield, PhRMA vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs.\n\n\"We have serious concerns with any approach to make investigational medicines available that seeks to bypass the oversight of FDA and clinical trial process,\u201d she said in an email. That \u201cis not in the best interest of patients and public health.\u201d\n\nIn December, PhRMA\u2019s board adopted new principles on the safe and ethical conduct of clinical trials. Member companies said while the best route for access to investigational drugs is through clinical trials, they are committed to expanding access to the drugs for patients who don\u2019t qualify for the trials or can\u2019t participate.\n\nThere were several caveats: There is enough evidence to indicate the drug won\u2019t do harm, even if it doesn\u2019t do any good. There is enough of the drug left over after supplying patients in clinical trials.\n\nAnd, the group said, access to the drug \u201cshould not delay, interfere or compromise the completion of clinical trials that are intended to support approval by national regulatory authorities.\u201d\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent for WUSF in Tampa.
