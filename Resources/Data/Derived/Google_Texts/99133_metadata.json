Ultimately, that last-ditch effort was a total failure. Republicans didn\u2019t achieve any major changes to Obamacare in the compromise to re-open the government.\n\nNonetheless, right-wing Republicans are doubling down on their failed strategy. Rather than conceding that they\u2019re out of chances to get rid of Obamacare, conservatives are simply changing their tune. Now, GOPers say they won\u2019t give up the fight:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX): The Tea Party lawmaker was the primary architect of the GOP\u2019s shutdown strategy. But now that it\u2019s failed, Cruz won\u2019t admit defeat. \u201cI would do anything, and I will continue to do anything, to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,\u201d he said on Thursday. He has also hinted that he hasn\u2019t ruled out pushing for another government shutdown over Obamacare. Sen. David Vitter (R-LA): Vitter tried to use the funding negotiations to push through an Obamacare-related amendment that would ultimately force Congress members and their staff to pay more for their health plans under the law. He was unsuccessful, and the final agreement didn\u2019t include his amendment. But Vitter isn\u2019t fazed and promises to keep pushing to amend the law anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not going away, and this issue is certainly not going away,\u201d Vitter said on Fox News this week. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL): Speaking on the Senate floor over the summer, Rubio told his colleagues that shutting down the government represented \u201cour last chance and our last best chance\u201d to undermine Obamacare. Now, the senator is saying that Republicans will keep fighting anyway. This week, he told Fox News that there is going to an \u201call-out revolt\u201d next year, once the rest of Obamacare\u2019s major provisions take root. \u201cAnd that is, I think, the moment to absolutely act and say we are going to get rid of this law and then look for opportunities in the future to replace it,\u201d Rubio said. The Heritage Foundation: During the shutdown battle, Heritage\u2019s political arm told its supporters that it needed their support because \u201cwe only have one more chance to repeal Obamacare.\u201d The group didn\u2019t deliver. Now, Heritage is simply assuring its supporters that it won\u2019t stop fighting the law. The group\u2019s president, Jim DeMint, published an op-ed this week claiming that most Americans\u2019 lives \u201care not dominated by the electoral cycle,\u201d so those people \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to wait three more years for Congress to give them relief from this law.\u201d FreedomWorks: The right-wing group recently claimed that shutting down the government \u201cmay be the last best chance to defund Obamacare before it goes into effect.\u201d Rather than adjusting their strategy, the group is now planning rallies to discourage young Americans from signing up for health coverage. The group says that Obamacare will still be a losing issue for Democrats up for re-election in red states \u2014 although outside polling has shown that the shutdown fiasco has made more than a dozen House seats more winnable for Democrats.\n\nMainstream Republican leaders, on the other hand, have admitted recently that the ongoing crusade against Obamacare is hurting their party as a whole. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told the Hill that he won\u2019t allow another government shutdown in another futile attempt to stop health reform, particularly after the hit to Republicans\u2019 approval ratings. \u201cI think we have fully now acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is,\u201d he noted.\n\nAs the shutdown demonstrated, however, it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter what the GOP leadership thinks. Last month, as the deadline to pass a continuing resolution drew near, mainstream members of the GOP indicated that they didn\u2019t support shutting down the government over Obamacare. At least 49 Republicans publicly came out against the strategy. Nonetheless, Republicans ended up falling in line behind Ted Cruz anyway.\n\nIt may be an uphill battle for far-right Republicans. Obamacare has actually gotten more popular over the past month, and polling has consistently shown that voters oppose efforts to undermine health reform. In a moment of clarity earlier this week, even the Heritage Foundation acknowledged that \u201ceverybody understands\u201d it\u2019s politically impossible to repeal Obamacare right now.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Shutting down the government didn't get rid of Obamacare, and ultimately ended up tanking the GOP's approval ratings.
