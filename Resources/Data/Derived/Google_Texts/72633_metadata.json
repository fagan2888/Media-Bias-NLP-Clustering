Only the propellant has been changed, according to Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote a commentary accompanying the new study.\n\nThe inhaler switch \u201chad minimal or no environmental benefits, but great benefits to pharmaceutical companies,\u201d Redberg told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nSince the HFA inhalers are newer and still under patent, these branded inhalers are more expensive than the CFC generics had been.\n\nThe researchers studied private insurance claims data for albuterol inhalers among more than 100,000 adults and 37,000 children with asthma from 2004 to 2010 and asthma-related hospitalization records.\n\nAverage out-of-pocket cost rose from $13.60 per inhaler prescription in 2004 to $25 in 2008, which declined to $21 by 2010. The number of patients using their inhalers declined \u201cmodestly,\u201d said lead author Dr. Anupam B. Jena of Harvard Medical School in Boston, and asthma-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits did not change over time.\n\n\u201cThe uninsured population, who were not in this study, would face the full increase,\u201d Jena said in a phone interview with Reuters Health. \u201cEven a $10 dollar increase, about a doubling, is quite large in terms of copayment increases.\u201d\n\nCosts went up but use only declined modestly, which may be because these inhalers are really important medications, so when prices go up people are reluctant to reduce their use, Jena said.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an example of a really well intended public policy geared toward improving the environment, but the question is in this particular case whether or not the reduction in use of these propellants was worth it,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 20 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and their use of these inhalers probably does not have a significant effect on the ozone layer, he said.\n\nPrice regulation or public subsidies could have limited cost increases, he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded insurance coverage, so would have softened the economic impact of the ban somewhat, but otherwise does not address high costs of branded medications, he said.\n\n\u201cHFA inhalers should be going off patent soon, in five years there may be generic HFA inhalers on the market,\u201d and costs will decrease again, Jena said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1K1UgOP JAMA Internal Medicine, online May 11, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKBN0NW1OV20150511", "sailthru.author": "Kathryn Doyle", "Author": "Kathryn Doyle", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters Health) -
