While it\u2019s no surprise that these Republicans are feeding off each other in a feedback loop of one-upmanship, this latest round of boasting is not occurring in a vacuum. The U.S., as the world\u2019s largest military force, faces many major challenges in the coming years \u2014not just ISIS in the Middle East, but also China enlarging its maritime borders.\n\nWhat follows are profiles of five candidates who are chicken hawks. None have served in the military but they all \u2013 unlike Obama \u2013 are willing to deploy ground troops overseas to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Other Republicans running similarly have puffed out their warmongering chests, such as Scott Walker saying that he would take on ISIS like he bullied Wisconsin\u2019s public employee unions and Jeb Bush endorsing W\u2019s invasion of Iraq. Lindsey Graham also is calling for 10,000 ground troops, but he served in the military. These five haven\u2019t:\n\n1. Marco Rubio\n\nOn CNN\u2019s The Lead last September, Rubio made it clear ground troops would \u201clikely be needed\u201d to \u201cfinish the job\u201d on ISIS. He said, \u201cThe chances of local forces alone being able to defeat ISIL, or any group for that matter on the ground is dubious at best\u2026 It\u2019s important for the President to be honest with the American people that at some point in the future, this might require some element of U.S. ground power in order to finish the job.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Senator quickly earned the respect of the hawkish wing of the foreign policy establishment, especially the neocons that got us into Iraq for spouting the right bellicose talking points. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t seem to know that Iran \u2013 despite being a favorite punching bag of this same neocon set \u2013 is a mortal enemy of ISIS, not in alliance with it. As Think Progress noted:\n\nSpeaking before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, Rubio told radio and TV host Sean Hannity that \u201cif we wanted to defeat [ISIS] militarily,we could do it. [Obama] doesn\u2019t want to upset Iran\u2026\u201d There\u2019s just one problem: Iran has been fighting ISIS just like the United States and has publicly urged America to take a larger role in the operation. Obama has even sent a letter to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggesting anti-ISIS cooperation.\n\nWhat\u2019s scary is that for many foreign policy experts, he\u2019s considered the intelligent one in Republican circles. Meanwhile, what he did during his Military age years (18-35)? Like the others on this list, Rubio spent his military-age years, well, running for President. He attended law school, interned for Florida U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, worked on the Dole-Kemp campaign and eventually got elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, and rose to become Speaker of the Florida House.\n\nThe wars Rubio decided not to fight in include: Gulf War, Bosnian War, Kosovo War, War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. The American troops killed in those conflicts totaled 7,041.\n\n2. Rick Santorum\n\nThe former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator, Christian evangelical, and winner of the 2012 Iowa Caucuses wants to send the troops back to Iraq: Santorum is straddling the fence between the GOP\u2019s \u201csmall government\u201d Tea Party and the \u201cMuslims are coming for us all\u201d tension at the heart of the current GOP foreign policy orthodoxy. He\u2019s called for Obama to \u201cdouble\u201d the amount of \u201cadvisers\u201d to Iraq to look tough without offending libertarians who are weary of war. According to Bloomberg News:\n\nSantorum, speaking on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d show, said he\u2019s \u201cnot talking about a massive invasion force\u201d just about doubling the 3,000 now on the ground in Iraq. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about front line troops here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start winning the war against ISIS my fear is we are going to see casualties here in the United States.\u201d\n\nSo 3,000 more \u201cadvisors\u201d, to Santorum, is the existential difference between attacks on the homeland and containing the enemy overseas. Santorum also believes that the U.S. should use more military muscle in the Ukraine to push back Russia.\n\nDuring his military-service age years, he also focused on building a career as a lawyer and politician, skipping the Gulf War.\n\n3. Ted Cruz\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz is trying to thread the same needle as Santorum. He\u2019s a Tea Party favorite, where 86% think ISIS can launch a \u201cmajor attack\u201d on U.S. soil. His solution: set the table for ground troops in Iraq and Syria \u201cif need be\u201d to \u201caccomplish the mission.\u201d He told ABC News:\n\n\u201cThe mission should be defeating ISIS before they succeed in carrying out more horrific acts of terror, before they succeed in murdering Americans. If need be, we should go that step,\u201d Cruz told \u201cThis Week\u201d anchor George Stephanopoulos when asked whether U.S. troops on the ground should be considered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio.
