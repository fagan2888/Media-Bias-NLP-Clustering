Whatever your opinion, plastic surgeons believe they\u2019ve found a way to define the \u201cperfect\u201d belly button.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Aesthetic Surgery Journal, surgeons at the University of Singapore\u2019s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine have claimed that the ideal navel is oval-shaped, vertical, and has a ratio of 46:54. They came to this conclusion using the \u201cAesthetic Analyzer,\u201d a computerized tool that researchers have used previously to examine what makes noses, breasts, and the belly button (also known as the umbilicus) aesthetically-pleasing.\n\nIn the study, the researchers analyzed various belly buttons and compared them to Playboy models as sources of ideal \u201cbeauty,\u201d which perhaps deems the study flawed from the start: \u201cUsing Playboy playmates is kind of an arbitrary sample,\u201d Dr. Adam Rubinstein, a Miami plastic surgeon, told Today.com. \u201cJust because these women are considered beautiful doesn\u2019t mean they have beautiful belly buttons.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeautiful\u201d belly buttons, the authors found, were likely to be small, vertically-oriented, and had a small flap or \u201chood.\u201d Of course, beauty is subjective and lies in the eye of the beholder. But people undergo plastic surgery in order to make their belly buttons look more like Playboy navels.\n\nKnown as an umbilicoplasty, these plastic surgery operations are common after a tummy tuck, dramatic weight loss, or weight gain \u2014 making people become dissatisfied with the appearance of their navel. \u201cAdults can lose their belly buttons after a tummy tuck, for example, if the surgeon doesn\u2019t create one, and sometimes they lose it just through another type of stomach surgery,\u201d Rubinstein told Today.com. \u201cSometimes the belly buttons that are created are just really bad looking.\u201d\n\nBelly buttons are scars left over from where the umbilical cord was attached to the abdominal area; they are present in all mammals. Ninety percent of humans have \u201cinnies,\u201d which involves a small depression in the skin; the rest have \u201couties.\u201d\n\nMost people who want new belly buttons ask for a small \u201cdime slot\u201d that's vertical. \u201cThere are a number of people who have pierced belly buttons and now they have piercing regret, and scarring, and women who have had several children and now their belly buttons are misshapen, and then there are people with tattoos who say get rid of the tattoo and give me a new belly button,\u201d Dr. Brent Moelleken, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, told Today.com. \u201cCreating a belly button is a work of art. No one really needs to walk around with a belly button that looks like a coin slot or a bullet hole.\u201d On the other hand, perhaps it's unnecessary to get an umbilicoplasty unless there's been serious damage to the navel; a trend of belly button makeovers could be as bad as thigh gaps.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "navels, belly buttons, umbilicoplasty, plastic surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists in Singapore wanted to see what made navels \"beautiful\" or ideal, and they found that most people preferred smaller, vertical belly buttons.", "title": "Doctors Can Give You The Belly Button You've Always Dreamed Of", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/belly-button-makeovers-offer-perfect-navel-oval-shaped-belly-buttons-are-prettiest-299888", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/navel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists in Singapore wanted to see what made navels \"beautiful\" or ideal, and they found that most people preferred smaller, vertical belly buttons.", "title": "Doctors Can Give You The Belly Button You've Always Dreamed Of", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/belly-button-makeovers-offer-perfect-navel-oval-shaped-belly-buttons-are-prettiest-299888", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/navel.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/navel.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-26T16:20:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-26T16:20:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists in Singapore wanted to see what made navels \"beautiful\" or ideal, and they found that most people preferred smaller, vertical belly buttons."}, "article_summary": "Researchers believe that the most beautiful belly buttons are small, vertical, and have a small \"flap\" or hood over them.\nDo you find belly buttons beautiful or appalling?\nNo one really needs to walk around with a belly button that looks like a coin slot or a bullet hole.\u201d On the other hand, perhaps it's unnecessary to get an umbilicoplasty unless there's been serious damage to the navel; a trend of belly button makeovers could be as bad as thigh gaps.\nWhatever your opinion, plastic surgeons believe they\u2019ve found a way to define the \u201cperfect\u201d belly button.\nBut people undergo plastic surgery in order to make their belly buttons look more like Playboy navels."}
