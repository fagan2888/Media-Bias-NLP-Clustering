But the professional touches, from water bottles to the posed photo with everyone shouting \u201cAFP!\u201d on the count of three all pointed to rally organizer Americans for Prosperity. Nationally, the group is known as a key cog in the political operation for Charles and David Koch, two business billionaire brothers known for opposing government regulation and supporting free markets. But the organization isn\u2019t just a purveyor of negative advertising bashing \u201cObamacare\u201d while subtly panning Democrats and praising Republicans. AFP has chapters in 33 states, including Colorado, that influence politics from the school board to the statehouse. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on any political candidate or any political party,\u201d said Dustin Zvonek, Colorado\u2019s AFP director. \u201cWe try to mobilize the grass roots to promote or to defend economic freedom.\u201d But Luis Toro, director of Colorado Ethics Watch, views AFP\u2019s Colorado operations in a more skeptical light. \u201cBasically, they\u2019re well lawyered up, and if they jump through certain hoops, they can avoid the disclosure laws that apply to everybody else that spends money on elections,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Koch connection\n\nThe late July rally was timed to coincide with Environmental Protection Agency hearings in Denver and other cities on the Obama administration\u2019s plan to reduce carbon pollution. Energy issues are at the forefront for AFP and for the Koch brothers, the group\u2019s founders. The two built on their father\u2019s oil and gas fortune, expanding what is now Koch Industries into an international and privately held behemoth that still focuses on oil and gas but also deals in chemicals, forest products, minerals and more. AFP \u2014 and the Kochs \u2014 are strong supporters of oil and gas development and strong opponents of regulation, especially environmental restrictions. Jeff Crank, a former congressional staffer and candidate, took over the Colorado chapter in 2009. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much infrastructure when I started,\u201d he said. But soon the group was holding rallies across the state to oppose the Affordable Health Care Act, or \u201cObamacare.\u201d Rallies on the issues continue, as does field work coordinated by paid staff. \u201cIt\u2019s been a growing presence that\u2019s been consistent, particularly in Colorado,\u201d said Crank, who went on to lead AFP nationally for a time and now runs a private political consulting firm, Aegis Strategic, which is linked to the Kochs. The ground game for the Colorado chapter includes a National Day of Action on the first Saturday of each month, soliciting volunteers to make calls or knock on doors. Zvonek said the group has 25 to 30 paid employees to help organize volunteers for such efforts.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have much infrastructure when I started. It\u2019s been a growing presence that\u2019s been consistent, particularly in Colorado. Jeff Crank former director, Colorado AFP chapter\n\nKyle Saunders, a political scientist at Colorado State University, said AFP takes aim at unaffiliated voters, a growing demographic in Colorado. \u201cGroups like AFP have more reason to focus their resources here than in other unbalanced states because here they can make an impact,\u201d he said. But Saunders said it\u2019s early to reach out to such voters, when campaigns typically focus on September and October. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time if they\u2019re already trying persuade the middle, \u201cSaunders said. \u201cUsually that happens late in the game.\u201d Other groups were listed as sponsors of the anti-EPA rally, including the Colorado Mining Association. The lengthy parade of speakers included union representatives from the United Mine Workers of America, a bit of an irony, considering AFP\u2019s opposition to organized labor. Before the speakers took the stage, attendees were encouraged to shout \u201cAmericans for Prosperity\u201d across from the state Capitol. \u201cHow about Americans for coal?\u201d shouted Dianna Orf, a lobbyist for the Colorado Mining Association who helped organize the event. But her suggestion was scarcely heard.\n\n\u2018Kochtopus\u2019 in Colorado\n\nAmericans for Prosperity may be the Kochs\u2019 ground connection in Colorado, but there\u2019s plenty of other activity by the so-called Kochtopus network of nonprofits funded by the two men and their wealthy colleagues. In 2012, AFP spent more than $537,000 on ads in the state opposing President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, according to the Federal Election Commission. This year so far, the group has spent at least $311,000 on Colorado ads attacking \u201cObamacare\u201d and mentioning Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who faces a tough re-election bid against Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. In fact, Gardner was one of several Senate candidates invited to Charles and David Koch\u2019s summer meeting. There Crank interviewed Gardner and another candidate during one session, according to The Nation. Freedom Partners, a related nonprofit supported by the Kochs, has almost $1.2 million in ads scheduled this year, also attacking Udall on \u201cObamacare.\u201d The American Energy Alliance spent almost $157,000 on ads criticizing Udall on the Keystone Pipeline, which is intended to carry oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. And Generation Opportunity spent nearly $1 million for TV and online ads earlier this summer attacking Udall for federal spending, unemployment and the Affordable Care Act. GenOpp is a Koch-related nonprofit group aimed at millennials, best known for its \u201cCreepy Uncle Sam\u201d ads discouraging enrollment in \u201cObamacare.\u201d GenOpp, which Zvonek called a partner organization, recently started a ground operation in Colorado. Toro said the groups\u2019 nonprofit status makes it difficult to assess their activities. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say, because we don\u2019t know how much money they\u2019re spending,\u201d he said. \u201cBut their voice is everywhere. They\u2019ve really made what they want to talk about an issue.\u201d\n\nOnly certain issues fit\n\nThere are certain things, however, that AFP doesn\u2019t talk about. For instance, some participants at the anti-EPA rally wore \u201cCoal, guns, freedom\u201d stickers. But when AFP got involved in the recall elections of two Democratic state senators last fall, gun rights weren\u2019t mentioned, even though that was the reason other groups successfully pressed for the recalls. The AFP door hanger during the Colorado Springs recall instead mentioned state Senate President John Morse\u2019s votes for a health care exchange, Medicaid expansion and increased fees. \u201cThe Second Amendment is an issue we don\u2019t talk about,\u201d Zvonek said. Crank said such issues don\u2019t fit in with the economic freedom mantra of AFP and the Koch brothers. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen AFP talk about guns or any of the social issues or immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ve been a lot of attempts to get them involved in other things, and they\u2019ve always resisted it.\u201d But AFP does get involved in issues beyond energy. Zvonek lobbied the state legislature unsuccessfully earlier this year for a bill to halt implementation of the Common Core standards in Colorado schools. And AFP\u2019s activity provides an antidote to ProgressNow Colorado, a nonprofit formed in 2003 to promote progressive ideas. But Americans for Prosperity operates as a single, national entity based in Virginia that oversees the state chapters. Michael Huttner, the founder of ProgressNow, who has helped expand the group to 23 states, noted that each ProgressNow state chapter is individually organized, and selects its own key issues. \u201cI think the Koch brothers, who have got a lot of money to throw at this \u2014 they\u2019re throwing the money at the targeted states,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fine line of politics", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Kochtopus\u2019 aims to influence political climate on economic and educational issues in run-up to November midterms", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/12/colorado-kochtopusamericansprosperity.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/8/12/colorado-kochtopusamericansprosperity/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.colorado2.1407864848352.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "\u2018Kochtopus\u2019 aims to influence political climate on economic and educational issues in run-up to November midterms", "title": "Americans for Prosperity: Koch brothers\u2019 advocacy gets local in Colorado"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/8/12/colorado-kochtopusamericansprosperity/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.colorado2.1407864848352.jpg", "title": "Americans for Prosperity: Koch brothers\u2019 advocacy gets local in Colorado", "description": "\u2018Kochtopus\u2019 aims to influence political climate on economic and educational issues in run-up to November midterms", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "Republican Party, Politics, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2535\"", "article_summary": "Jeff Crank former director, Colorado AFP chapterKyle Saunders, a political scientist at Colorado State University, said AFP takes aim at unaffiliated voters, a growing demographic in Colorado.\nEnergy issues are at the forefront for AFP and for the Koch brothers, the group\u2019s founders.\nCrank said such issues don\u2019t fit in with the economic freedom mantra of AFP and the Koch brothers.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t focus on any political candidate or any political party,\u201d said Dustin Zvonek, Colorado\u2019s AFP director.\nBut Americans for Prosperity operates as a single, national entity based in Virginia that oversees the state chapters."}
