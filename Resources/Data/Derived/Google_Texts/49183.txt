Big changes are in store later this month at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after Administrator Marilyn Tavenner officially steps down.

Andy Slavitt, CMS' principal deputy administrator and a top spokesman for the dramatically improved Affordable Care Act rollout this year, takes over for Tavenner, the agency said last month. On Monday the agency announced Slavitt will be replaced in an acting capacity by Patrick Conway, a doctor who is chief medical officer at CMS.

Conway, who is also currently CMS' deputy administrator for innovation, will continue to lead the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation.

"Patrick's work to build successful innovation models and quality programs for transforming health care will serve as an important foundation for his work as Acting Principal Deputy," Slavitt said in a note sent to staff that was released by CMS.

Tavenner, who faced many testy congressional committee hearings during her five-year tenure at CMS, is the former Virginia secretary of health. Before government service, she was a longtime hospital company executive and a nurse.
