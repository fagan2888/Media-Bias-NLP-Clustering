And as a county commissioner, it is my responsibility to preserve that value wherever I can.\n\nA shadow is being cast over that independence by a piece of the Affordable Care Act called the Health Insurance Tax, or HIT. It is a hidden federal sales tax on health insurance plans purchased in the open marketplace by families and small businesses.\n\nWe depend on hard-working and enterprising individuals and families to keep Mesa County moving.\n\nThe HIT would unfairly tax all of these people for buying their health insurance in the marketplace while giving a free pass to much larger operations that can afford to self-insure.\n\nCongress has already reached bipartisan agreement to suspend the tax, but that agreement runs out next year.\n\nWe need more confidence in the future than a temporary suspension. Our elected officials in Washington should step up and permanently repeal the HIT as a way to show meaningful support for our independent farmers and ranchers, small business owners and self-employed entrepreneurs.\n\nWe do not want special treatment. We just want a square deal. A permanent repeal is the only acceptable answer.\n\nRose Pugliese\n\nMesa County commissioner", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0.11"}, "article_summary": "Permanently repeal Health Insurance TaxTo the editor:Independence is an important value cherished by the people of Mesa County.\nA shadow is being cast over that independence by a piece of the Affordable Care Act called the Health Insurance Tax, or HIT.\nIt is a hidden federal sales tax on health insurance plans purchased in the open marketplace by families and small businesses.\nThe HIT would unfairly tax all of these people for buying their health insurance in the marketplace while giving a free pass to much larger operations that can afford to self-insure.\nWe depend on hard-working and enterprising individuals and families to keep Mesa County moving."}
