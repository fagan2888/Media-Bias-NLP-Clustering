Storm troopers, presidential displays of athleticism and that looming bunny -- just another Easter Egg Roll on the White House South Lawn.

President Barack Obama and wife Michelle marked their final Egg Roll on Monday, kissing their way through the sea of babies (and their parents) who convene annually for the event. It was the 138th time that youngsters gathered on the President's backyard to roll eggs along the grass.

"Today is a little bit bittersweet for us because this is the Obama administration's last Easter Egg Roll," the first lady said during remarks kicking off the festivities. "If we think about what we've accomplished over these past seven years, it's pretty incredible."

During her remarks, Michelle Obama even offered a preview of one of the day's entertainers: "Whip/Nae Nae" singer Silento.

Obama said she was proud of her attempts to open up the event and imbue it with more opportunities for aerobic exercise.

That included a go on the White House basketball court, where the President failed to sink the single three-point shot he attempted (he avoided another embarrassing 2-for-22 round, as he did in 2013).

And he made some solid forehands on a makeshift tennis court, though a whiffed backhand he blamed on his gear.

"This looks like a little bit of a flawed racquet here," Obama said. "It must be the equipment."

Many celebrities also were on hand for the big event, including Jay Z, Beyonce and their daughter, Blue Ivy.
