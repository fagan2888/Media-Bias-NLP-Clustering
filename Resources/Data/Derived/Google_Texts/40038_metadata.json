At the same time, the plan would provide all residents with Medicare-style health care coverage and allow the state to dump Obamacare.\n\nWhether Colorado voters would agree to take on that kind of tax hike is another question \u2014 two years ago, they rejected a comparatively paltry $1 billion tax increase for education \u2014 but there is no doubt that the \u201cno-more-Obamacare\u201d argument resonates with certain segments of the population.\n\n\u201cFor some people, I say, \u2018It gets us out of Obamacare,\u2019 and some people cheer,\u201d T.R. Reid, a spokesman for ColoradoCareYES, said during the signature-gathering campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s a purple state, and we have this purple plan that can appeal to both sides.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Famous faces of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit edition\n\nUnder the proposal, known as Initiative 20, employers would be on the hook for the lion\u2019s share, 6.67 percent, and employees would be responsible for 3.33 percent of the 10 percent. The program would be administered by a nonprofit cooperative, not a state agency, run by a 21-member board.\n\nMuch as Colorado conservatives may dislike Obamacare, they were quick Friday to denounce the single-payer proposal.\n\n\u201c\u2018Affordable\u2019 care just got more expensive in Colorado,\u201d Colorado Senate Republicans said on Twitter.\n\nJonathan Lockwood, executive director of the free-market Advancing Colorado, warned that ColoradoCare \u201cwill triple Coloradans\u2019 taxes to rake in a state budget-sized $25 billion a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cColoradoCare is a charade, and their campaign has been deceptive on every level, preying on millennials and the underserved communities, promising them relief that will deliver pain,\u201d Mr. Lockwood said.\n\nSupporters argue that the state\u2019s $25 billion estimate is too high and insist that the plan would actually save people the money they would normally spend on health insurance. In addition, the program would allow Colorado to opt out of the Affordable Care Act, which would free up federal dollars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a rich, compassionate country. We should provide health care for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Reid, a former Washington Post reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get there at the federal level. The federal government can\u2019t do much. They\u2019re gridlocked. So the way we\u2019re going to get there is state by state.\u201d\n\nThe plan also allows Colorado to avoid joining the federal Obamacare exchange if the state exchange crumbles. The struggling Connect for Health Colorado took another hit Oct. 16 when state insurance cooperative Colorado HealthOp was dropped from the annual Nov. 1 rollout over a lack of financial stability.\n\n\u201cEarlier this month, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS), announced it would only reimburse the nation\u2019s health insurers 12.6% of what they were entitled under the program \u2014 only $362 million out of $2.9 billion promised,\u201d the state Division of Insurance said in a statement.\n\n\u201cColorado HealthOP was expecting around $16.2 million this year from the risk corridor payments, but instead will only receive about $2 million,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe move left 82,000 policyholders without insurance and further contributed to the sense that Connect for Health Colorado may be unable to remain solvent without significant federal support.\n\nThe signatures were submitted \u2014 some of them wheeled in on a hospital gurney \u2014 to the secretary of state\u2019s office on the same day that the insurance division announced that health insurance premiums would rise in Colorado by an average of 7 percent for next year.\n\nLeading the ColoradoCareYES campaign is Democratic state Sen. Sally Aguilar, a doctor who previously proposed legislation to enact a single-payer system.\n\nAfter the bill was defeated two years ago, she said, she began working to bring the idea before the voters.\n\n\u201cWe tried to pass it in the legislature. But with the money in politics these days, there\u2019s no chance,\u201d Ms. Aguilar told the Denver Business Journal. \u201cFortunately, in Colorado, if the legislature refuses to do what\u2019s needed, the people can vote it into law through a ballot initiative.\u201d\n\nThe proposal has already drawn national attention as a model for other states interested in going beyond Obamacare to offer universal health care.\n\n\u201cIt is a monumental proposal that could change the face of our nation,\u201d Occupy Democrats said in a statement. \u201cIt sets a precedent of recognizing that access to quality health care is a right, not a privilege to be awarded to those who can afford it.\u201d\n\nIf the Colorado measure does qualify for the ballot, Mr. Reid said, other states, starting with Oregon and Washington, would follow with single-payer plans of their own.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say to them: \u2018We beat you to [recreational] marijuana, and we\u2019ll beat you to universal coverage,\u2019\u201d Mr. Reid said with a laugh.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Colorado's shaky Obamacare exchange in peril, some health care advocates are calling for voters to scrap it and replace it with something far more ambitious.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With Colorado\u2019s shaky Obamacare exchange in peril, some health care advocates are calling for voters to scrap it and replace it with something far more ambitious.", "title": "ColoradoCare would replace Obamacare with statewide single-payer plan \u2014 at $25 billion cost", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/25/coloradocare-would-replace-obamacare-with-statewid/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/10252015_universal-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/10252015_universal-28201.jpg", "description": "With Colorado's shaky Obamacare exchange in peril, some health care advocates are calling for voters to scrap it and replace it with something far more ambitious.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "ColoradoCare would replace Obamacare with statewide single-payer plan"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Politics, TR Reid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafb8\"", "article_summary": "At the same time, the plan would provide all residents with Medicare-style health care coverage and allow the state to dump Obamacare.\n\u201c\u2018Affordable\u2019 care just got more expensive in Colorado,\u201d Colorado Senate Republicans said on Twitter.\nDENVER \u2014 With Colorado\u2019s shaky Obamacare exchange in peril, some health care advocates are calling for voters to scrap it and replace it with something far more ambitious.\nWe should provide health care for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Reid, a former Washington Post reporter.\nSupporters argue that the state\u2019s $25 billion estimate is too high and insist that the plan would actually save people the money they would normally spend on health insurance."}
