On June 23, the World Health Organization reported 635 Ebola cases, including 399 deaths. By July 12, the figures were up to 964 cases, including 603 deaths. Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization are providing substantial medical personnel and resources on the ground in order to help contain the outbreak.\n\nThe United States, according to the CDC, has sent a seven-person team to help in Guinea, and provided protective clothing and equipment for healthcare workers in all three countries. In the grand scheme of things, that is a minimal amount of aid \u2014 echoed by the minimal coverage the outbreak has garnered in U.S. media. (Far more attention was afforded GOP Congressman Phil Gingrey\u2019s outlandish and factually implausible comments about refugee children crossing the border bringing Ebola into the United States from Central America.)\n\nThere is more than one way to interpret America\u2019s disinterest. One is racism \u2014 the sense that the people dying of Ebola are so different from \u201cus\u201d that we really can\u2019t identify with them. Another is compassion fatigue. Isn\u2019t there always some horrible disease afflicting Africa and Africans?\n\nIndeed, many of the English\u2013language articles that have been written about the Ebola outbreak focus on \u201cignorant\u201d and \u201csuperstitious\u201d Africans who give more credence to witchcraft than to modern medicine.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe key to halting Ebola is isolating the sick, but fear and panic have sent some patients into hiding, complicating efforts to stop its spread. \u2026 Preachers are calling for divine intervention, and panicked residents in remote areas have on multiple occasions attacked the very health workers sent to help them. In one town in Sierra Leone, residents partially burned down a treatment centre over fears that the drugs given to victims were actually causing the disease.\n\nThis analysis, picked up by several news outlets, simultaneously reveals the kind of xenophobic Western mindset that victims of the Ebola outbreak distrust, and hints at why Western readers do not seem all that interested in learning about or from the outbreak.\n\nThe suspicions with which many people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leona regard Western interventions make sense. Healthcare workers are particularly hard-hit by Ebola, and workers and other patients who hadn\u2019t been infected can return home not knowing they now carry the disease, transmitting the virus to their families and communities. International relief organizations in these countries set up emergency treatment that will be taken down when the immediate threat is over. But family sticks around forever. Refraining from leaving sick relatives in hospitals (that typically utilize isolation as the sole means of containing the Ebola virus) can be a pragmatic and sensible choice to rely on the kinship and community networks that have kept people alive in the past.\n\nFrom my perch as a medical sociologist, the claim that mobs attacking treatment centers are panicking reveals \u201ctroubling truths\u201d regarding the Western track record of medical experiments and geopolitical ambitions in Africa. Distrust of Western medicine may have less to do with superstition than with history: forced sterilizations in Peru; the intentional infection of Guatemalans with gonorrhea and syphilis; marketing campaigns urging mothers in countries lacking safe water supplies to replace breastfeeding with infant formula so that women could work in western-owned factories; the sale in Africa of pharmaceuticals that passed their expiration date for sale in the West; the harvesting of organs in India for transplants to wealthy foreigners.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, outbreaks of new diseases such as Ebola (first identified in 1976) echo the spread of industrialization, urbanization, unprecedented militarization (funded by western countries), deforestation and the destruction of eco-systems that have forced communities to expand their search for food into territories that traditionally were not used for that purpose. In reports in the English-language press, however, there is little consideration of the political and economic structural forces that gave rise to the emergence and spread of Ebola. Rather, as Jared Jones writes, \u201cAfrican \u2018Otherness\u2019 overpowers the possibility of a non-cultural causality in the dominant discourse, and other factors are left unexamined as potentially causal or exacerbating.\u201d Attention to sorcery rather than the inequalities of globalization obscures the fact that the biggest leaps in life expectancy in the U.S. and Europe came about because of massive government-funded public health measures \u2014 sewage systems and clean water supplies \u2013 not because we gave up our religious beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has western Africa in its grips \u2014 but Americans are looking the other way", "author": "Susan Sered", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has western Africa in its grips \u2014 but Americans are looking the other way", "title": "America\u2019s shameful ebola ignorance: The troubling truth about our attitude toward the virus", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/americas_shameful_ebola_ignorance_the_troubling_truth_about_our_attitude_toward_the_virus/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/ebola_virus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has western Africa in its grips \u2014 but Americans are looking the other way", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/ebola_virus.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s shameful ebola ignorance: The troubling truth about our attitude toward the virus", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "America\u2019s shameful ebola ignorance: The troubling truth about our attitude toward the virus", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Africa, Disease, ebola, Ebola outbreak, Editor's Picks, healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd939f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Africa, Disease, ebola, Ebola outbreak, Editor's Picks, healthcare, NewsThe present Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is the deadliest on record.\n\u2026 Preachers are calling for divine intervention, and panicked residents in remote areas have on multiple occasions attacked the very health workers sent to help them.\nIndeed, many of the English\u2013language articles that have been written about the Ebola outbreak focus on \u201cignorant\u201d and \u201csuperstitious\u201d Africans who give more credence to witchcraft than to modern medicine.\nOn June 23, the World Health Organization reported 635 Ebola cases, including 399 deaths.\nIn reports in the English-language press, however, there is little consideration of the political and economic structural forces that gave rise to the emergence and spread of Ebola."}
