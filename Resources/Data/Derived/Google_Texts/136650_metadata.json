Michele Walton said she hopes it will be a gathering place in the Brook Oaks neighborhood, where restaurants and retail are scarce.\n\n\u201cA lot of people here don\u2019t have vehicles, and they need a place to eat,\u201d Walton said. \u201cWe want to be a family store for the community and a restaurant for those who don\u2019t have cars. It\u2019s a community center.\u201d\n\nHarlem Walton, the pitmaster, smokes brisket, chicken and ribs in the style his grandfather taught him decades ago, with sweet barbecue sauce slathered on thick.\n\nHis barbecue stand at the corner of Ninth and Waco Drive next to his Old School Detail Shop won a following during the last decade.\n\nBut the family\u2019s sudden move into the restaurant business this past summer ended in a dispute that left a bitter taste for both parties involved.\n\nThe Waltons and their former business partner, Amir Zakirali, are still pointing fingers at each other, with each side claiming to be swindled.\n\nThe Waltons say Zakirali lured them into doing business at the former Al Miraj restaurant space he was leasing but used the arrangement to try to steal their money.\n\nPolice have charged Zakirali with forgery, accusing him of using a fake document to route money from the barbecue business to his personal bank account, a charge Zakirali denies.\n\nZakirali says it\u2019s the Waltons who took advantage of him, taking jointly owned restaurant supplies and furnishings with them when they relocated in November.\n\n\u201cThey got me pretty good,\u201d he said, adding that he plans to sue the Waltons to recover the property. The Waltons deny that they took anything improperly.\n\nBy all accounts, it was Zakirali who approached Harlem Walton in July to run a barbecue restaurant.\n\nZakirali had closed Al Miraj, his Mediterranean-Pakistani restaurant on Franklin Avenue, and he was looking for a way to continue to pay the lease.\n\n\u201cFriends said barbecue would be good for downtown, and I had heard about this barbecue place,\u201d Zakirali said. \u201cI bought a lunch there and it tasted pretty good.\u201d\n\nZakirali offered to take Harlem Walton to see a place where he could open a restaurant.\n\n\u201cI thought he was kidding,\u201d Walton said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Come take a ride in my car and I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWalton said he felt \u201cleery\u201d of the offer, but the restaurant looked like a good opportunity.\n\nHe had his wife, who worked in a financial job, draw up a partnership agreement and found family to lend him money, including the $5,000 Zakirali sought as an upfront payment.\n\nThe July 10 agreement, which was never officially recorded, stated that the parties would share net profits and losses from the partnership and that Michele Walton would be a managing partner.\n\nThe Waltons brought a smoking pit to the restaurant and both sides brought furnishings.\n\nEviction notice\n\nThe day after the business opened July 31, landlord Tom Chase served an eviction notice to Zakirali, initially claiming that he had sublet the building without permission.\n\nEventually, he ended up evicting Zakirali effective Oct. 31 for failing to maintain liability insurance, Chase said.\n\nOn Sept. 10, the Waltons noticed that their deposits were not showing up, and they discovered that the local credit card company at Zakirali\u2019s request had caused the deposits to be routed to Zakirali\u2019s own bank account, according to a police affidavit.\n\nThe switch was based on a letter that appeared to be from Educators Credit Union, where Zakirali banked, but police say the letter was clearly a fake. They charged Zakirali with forgery, a state jail felony, but no indictment has yet been made.\n\nZakirali said he doesn\u2019t know who forged the document, but he had no reason to do it. He said he had payments routed to his bank account legitimately in accordance with the partnership agreement to pay bills that the Waltons weren\u2019t paying.\n\nBy that time, Zakirali was in financial straits, with the state comptroller moving to freeze the assets of his Al Miraj LLC for back taxes.\n\nZakirali also lost his home in a foreclosure sale in August, and he is facing legal action from local governments for unpaid property tax.\n\nZakirali, who formerly owned several other businesses in Greater Waco, said the Al Miraj restaurant drained him financially.\n\nHe had a 10-year lease on the building, starting in 2012, until Chase brought it to an end Oct. 31.\n\nZakirali claims that the Waltons took about $12,000 of equipment and tore up the place when they left.\n\nMichele Walton said that equipment was theirs all along, and she claims Zakirali owes her $5,000 back.\n\nZakirali said he would be willing to sit down with mediators and negotiate with Walton about who owes what to whom \u201cand see who comes out ahead.\u201d\n\nChase is now leasing the building to Marcia Neal, who plans to open a restaurant there in February called Sacsee\u2019s Southern-Style Eatery.\n\nNeal, who has run a catering business, plans to offer a buffet with homecooked meats and vegetables. She plans to be open Wednesdays through Sundays, offering live jazz on weekends.\n\nMeanwhile at Old Fashion BBQ, Michele Walton said she is committed to working at the restaurant full time to make it a success and brought in her sister to help.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to work, we have to put our all into it,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "WacoTrib.com", "description": "Harlem and Michele Walton never intended to turn their roadside barbecue stand into a downtown restaurant until the opportunity suddenly came open this summer.", "title": "Barbecue business tries fresh start after downtown deal flames out", "url": "http://www.wacotrib.com/news/business/barbecue-business-tries-fresh-start-after-downtown-deal-flames-out/article_06aae9b2-13cf-51ce-b16f-060bf40dbbe9.html", "image": {"width": 840, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/99/b994ff8c-1bf1-5465-82ef-491109cac23d/54b1b610cd8eb.image.jpg?resize=840%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wacotrib", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Harlem and Michele Walton never intended to turn their roadside barbecue stand into a downtown restaurant until the opportunity suddenly came open this summer.", "fb": {"admins": 100003972382224, "app_id": 109882439169884}, "google-site-verification": "50pYtHR6CCFTzZ71kPh9VblWnhVFzTMInJ8Z9e0QKbw", "keywords": "business,restaurants", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wacotrib"}, "news_keywords": "business,restaurants"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFriends said barbecue would be good for downtown, and I had heard about this barbecue place,\u201d Zakirali said.\nNeal, who has run a catering business, plans to offer a buffet with homecooked meats and vegetables.\nNow they\u2019re starting over, determined to make a barbecue restaurant and store succeed in an underserved North Waco neighborhood.\nBut the family\u2019s sudden move into the restaurant business this past summer ended in a dispute that left a bitter taste for both parties involved.\nBy all accounts, it was Zakirali who approached Harlem Walton in July to run a barbecue restaurant."}
