Jerry Brown and state legislative leaders announced a five-year expansion to the state\u2019s film and television tax credit program.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the governor approved a bipartisan plan to raise the annual allocated tax credits to $330 million, over three times the current allocation.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2012, the California entertainment industry lost 16,137 film production jobs. During that same period the state of New York increased its entertainment employment by 25 percent. The Milken Institute attributes this shift in employment to the billions of dollars in robust incentives from competitive states like New York, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.\n\nAs film and television productions move to other states, California state leaders have been under pressure by industry unions to keep jobs within the state.\n\nThomas Davis, a business representative for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees argued that additional tax credits are essential to California\u2019s entertainment identity.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow California to become another Michigan where we let our signature industry leave,\u201d said Davis. \u201cThis is an opportunity to reinforce how important this industry is to the state.\u201d\n\nCurtis Dubay, a tax policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, explained that California\u2019s attempt to lure businesses through incentives does not provide a long-term solution to the state\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise California has to bribe its headline industry to stay in the state. Its taxes make it uncompetitive for any industry to operate in the state without such sweeteners. But targeted tax credits are bad tax policy,\u201d said Dubay. \u201cIt would be better if California lowered taxes for everyone, rather than bestow indulgences on the politically connected.\u201d\n\nThe proposed law would also remove a disputed lottery system, previously used as a means of distributing funds to approved applicants. Instead this law would allocate tax credits based on the economic impact and potential employment for each project.\n\n\u201cThis law will make key improvements in our film and television tax credit program and put thousands of Californians to work,\u201d said Brown.\n\nThe law is expected to pass the state senate later this week. In total, California will allocate $1.65 billion for film and television tax credits between 2015-2020.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The California governor approved a bipartisan plan to triple the tax credits for the film and television industry.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The California governor approved a bipartisan plan to triple the tax credits for the film and television industry.", "title": "California to Triple Tax Credits to Hollywood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140827_Hollywood_Anderson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tP1E5I"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The California governor approved a bipartisan plan to triple the tax credits for the film and television industry.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140827_Hollywood_Anderson.jpg"}, "title": "California to Triple Tax Credits to Hollywood", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2014-08-28T14:46:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc6c\"", "article_summary": "But targeted tax credits are bad tax policy,\u201d said Dubay.\nIn total, California will allocate $1.65 billion for film and television tax credits between 2015-2020.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the governor approved a bipartisan plan to raise the annual allocated tax credits to $330 million, over three times the current allocation.\nIn an effort to revive a struggling entertainment industry, California Gov.\nJerry Brown and state legislative leaders announced a five-year expansion to the state\u2019s film and television tax credit program."}
