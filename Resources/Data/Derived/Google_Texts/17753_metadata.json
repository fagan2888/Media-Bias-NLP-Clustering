Plaintiffs cannot plead or prove otherwise nor would they want to.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by plaintiffs Daniel Blumenthal and Michael Hartzmark, who live in Chicago\u2019s Hyde Park neighborhood, alleged Land of Lincoln had fraudulently led them to believe health care services they received through University of Chicago Medicine, for either themselves or their spouses, would be covered through Land of Lincoln policies in 2016. However, in early 2016, the men said they received notice Land of Lincoln would be dropping coverage for University of Chicago Medicine, effective March 1, indicating Land of Lincoln and University of Chicago had failed to reach agreement on reimbursement rates. The men said they then purchased additional coverage at a much higher cost to make sure they could continue to receive coverage for health care at University of Chicago, and filed suit, accusing Land of Lincoln of a \u201cbait and switch.\u201d\n\nHowever, Land of Lincoln recently announced it had reached an agreement with University of Chicago Medicine, and had again added the university medical system to its roster of covered providers. The health insurer then moved to dismiss the legal action against it over the now-resolved dispute.\n\nIn its motion, Land of Lincoln said the court should dismiss the action because the renewal of University of Chicago and the insurer\u2019s sustained efforts to negotiate the reimbursement agreement, belie the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions the insurer intended to deceive or defraud its insured.\n\n\u201cLincoln could not have engaged in consumer fraud or deceptive business practices as to any representation that the University of Chicago would be in network for 2016,\u201d Land of Lincoln said in its motion. \u201cAny such representations have turned out not to be true.\u201d\n\nLand of Lincoln conceded it \u201cdid erroneously notify some insureds who had claim histories using the University of Chicago\u2019s services that they would no longer be in-network as of March 1,\u201d explaining the \u201cstatements were erroneously made without any understanding of the University of Chicago provider contract termination provisions.\u201d\n\nBut Land of Lincoln said the plaintiffs chose independent of Land of Lincoln\u2019s actions to \u201cleave the plan\u201d and buy other, more expensive health insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cAny damages they purportedly incurred were based on their own choice, not any fraud by Lincoln,\u201d the motions said. \u201cFurther, Lincoln could not be unjustly enriched as to these two named plaintiffs as they got what they bargained for \u2013 for the two months they were in the plan they received in-network care by the University of Chicago.\u201d\n\nLand of Lincoln is represented in the action by attorneys with the firm of Barnes & Thornburg, of Chicago.\n\nAttorneys with the firm of Krislov & Associates, of Chicago, did not reply to requests for comment on Land of Lincoln\u2019s recent actions and on plaintiffs\u2019 intentions concerning their lawsuit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the heels of announcing it had resumed covering patients seeking health care through University of Chicago Medicine, Land of Lincoln Health has asked a Cook County judge to dismiss a class action lawsuit brought by two of its former customers who alleged the provider of Obamacare health insurance policies had misled people into buying policies under false premises.", "author": "Jonathan Bilyk", "og": {"url": "http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510712148-land-of-lincoln-health-re-ups-with-university-of-chicago-asks-court-to-dismiss-class-action-alleging-it-misled-customers", "image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/96/c9/137880/large_Land_of_Lincoln_Health.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On the heels of announcing it had resumed covering patients seeking health care through University of Chicago Medicine, Land of Lincoln Health has asked a Cook County judge to dismiss a class action lawsuit brought by two of its former customers who alleged the provider of Obamacare health insurance policies had misled people into buying policies under false premises.", "title": "Land of Lincoln Health re-ups with University of Chicago, asks court to dismiss class action alleging it misled customers"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/96/c9/137880/large_Land_of_Lincoln_Health.jpg", "title": "Land of Lincoln Health re-ups with University of Chicago, asks court to dismiss class action alleging it misled customers", "description": "On the heels of announcing it had resumed covering patients seeking health care through University of Chicago Medicine, Land of Lincoln Health has asked a Cook County judge to dismiss a class action lawsuit brought by two of its former customers who alleged the provider of Obamacare health insurance policies had misled people into buying policies under false premises.", "card": "summary", "site": "@CookRecord"}, "articleid": 510712148, "article": {"published": "2016-04-08", "modified": "2016-04-08", "author": "http://cookcountyrecord.com/author/jonathan-bilyk"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere is no question of fact to resolve here,\u201d Land of Lincoln Health wrote in its April 1 motion to dismiss.\nHowever, in early 2016, the men said they received notice Land of Lincoln would be dropping coverage for University of Chicago Medicine, effective March 1, indicating Land of Lincoln and University of Chicago had failed to reach agreement on reimbursement rates.\nThe health insurer then moved to dismiss the legal action against it over the now-resolved dispute.\n\u201cThe University of Chicago contracts are renewed for 2016.\n\u201cLincoln could not have engaged in consumer fraud or deceptive business practices as to any representation that the University of Chicago would be in network for 2016,\u201d Land of Lincoln said in its motion."}
