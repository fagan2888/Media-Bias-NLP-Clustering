Welborn Barton Griffith of Texas, logistics and liaison officer in the XX Corps, learned of orders for U.S. artillery to shell Chartres Cathedral, one of the most important monuments of medieval civilization, in order to eliminate suspected German snipers and observers in the tower.\n\n\n\nCol.

They were able to evade the Germans, who still occupied the city, and entered the cathedral. Griffith searched the cathedral and climbed the bell tower. He found no Germans, and was able to rescind the order to shell the monument. Thanks to Griffith\u2019s courage, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Chartres was saved from war damage, thereby preserving it for future generations.\n\nGriffith then headed to L\u00e8ves, a small town just north of Chartres. He spotted a German machine gun nest, headed back to the American lines, climbed onto the turret of an American tank, and ordered the tank crew to head for the machine gun nest.\n\nGriffith did not get into the tank because \u201che was a very large man and couldn\u2019t get through the hatch,\" said Schulz. Although the tank destroyed the machine gun nest, Griffith was killed in the fight. He was posthumously decorated with the Silver Star, Distinguished Service Cross, and the French Croix de Guerre. He is buried at the St. James World War II Memorial Cemetery in Brittany.\n\nGriffith was born in Quanah, Texas. According to his daughter, Mrs. Alice Griffith Irving of Jacksonville, Fla., Griffith was a loving father who visited her whenever he was on leave from the military. In a recent conversation, Mrs. Irving also mentioned Schulz\u2019s admiration for her father, as a man of great commitment, dedication, and integration \u2014 his mentor in the armed forces.\n\n\n\nGriffith's grave in Brittany, France (Photo: Brittany American Cemetery Facebook page) Griffith's grave in Brittany, France (Photo: Brittany American Cemetery Facebook page)\n\nThe people of L\u00e8ves setup a plaque on a building next to the spot where Griffith was killed. Initially, it was dedicated to Col. Griffith Welborn, as the French people did not know how to read American dog tags. In 1999, thanks to the efforts of local historian Bertrand Papillon, who was a teenager in 1944, a new plaque was erected in the presence of Col. Griffith\u2019s daughter and her family.\n\nIn 2009, Alice Griffith Irving and her family attended Memorial Day at the St. James cemetery, where her father is buried along with 4,413 other American servicemen. In her words, in the AWON issue of September 2009: \u201cMore than a thousand local people attended. It was rewarding to know that the sacrifices these graves represent have not been forgotten. It was an unforgettable experience for our family.\"\n\nTo honor the 70th anniversary of Col. Griffith\u2019s death, Dominique Lallement, president of American Friends of Chartres, will lay a wreath at the Houston National Cemetery in Houston, Texas, on Aug. 16, thus uniting as an expression of gratitude and friendship in the ceremony that the people of L\u00e8ves conduct annually in front of the plaque dedicated to his memory.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I don\u2019t know how I got on the email list of the American Friends of Chartres, but I\u2019m glad I did, for it made me aware of this inspiring story, of how an American military officer saved Chartres Cathedral from shelling in World War II, a story which I thought was worth sharing:\n\nAmerican Friends of Chartres Honors the Memory of Col.
