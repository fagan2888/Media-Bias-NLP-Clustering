It also would be 4-of-4 for Chris Harris, Von Miller, Orlando Franklin, Rahim Moore, Julius Thomas, Nate Irving, Quinton Carter, Virgil Green, Tony Carter and Manny Ramirez.\n\nAll were picked up by the Broncos in 2011. Beat San Diego and the class of 2011 \u2014 headed by Elway the general manager and Fox the head coach \u2014 will have known nothing short of a division title.\n\n\u201cIt would be a great accomplishment,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get ready for San Diego. The Chargers almost won the division from us last year. If you\u2019re not ready, the Chargers can embarrass you.\u201d\n\nBeat San Diego and the Broncos would be 11-3 with two games to go. San Diego would be 8-6. Kansas City will be either 8-6 or 7-7.\n\n\u201cAny time you get an accomplishment,\u201d Moore said, \u201cthe first thing you want to do is accomplish more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos aiming for \u201c4-of-4\u201d in AFC West Division titles", "title": "Broncos aiming for \u201c4-of-4\u201d in AFC West Division titles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/08/broncos-aiming-for-4-of-4-in-afc-west-division-titles/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141208__SP12FBNBRONX_AO27186xp1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141208__SP12FBNBRONX_AO27186xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-08T17:14:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:47:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb33\"", "article_summary": "Never mind four division titles during the four-year reign of John Elway and John Fox.\nBeat the Chargers in San Diego and the Broncos win their fourth AFC West Division title in four years.\nIf you\u2019re not ready, the Chargers can embarrass you.\u201dBeat San Diego and the Broncos would be 11-3 with two games to go.\nSan Diego would be 8-6.\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get ready for San Diego."}
