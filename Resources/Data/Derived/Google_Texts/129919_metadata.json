A hearing has been set for June 6.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is about religious freedom and the conscience rights of individuals to operate their enterprises free from government coercion, reprisal, or punishment,\u201d MRC Founder and President Brent Bozell said. \u201cThe Obamacare mandate destroys the ability of free people to practice their faith in their everyday lives and forces them to either reject their faith or face crippling government imposed fines and punishment; in our case over $4.5 million dollars per year. We do not stop being religious, moral people the moment we walk out of our houses of worship.\u201d\n\nThe MRC contends that under ACA rules it has self-certified as a religious organization and is therefore exempt from the mandate. The MRC is the first organization that has asked the court to affirm its \"self-certification.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor nearly three decades, the MRC has been the nation\u2019s premier defender of pro-life views and Judeo-Christian values from attacks by the liberal media. Bozell and other employees of the MRC practice and live by Judeo-Christian values, and believe abortion, whether through the actions of an abortionist or a drug, is the taking of innocent human life. Under the First Amendment, the MRC and its employees have the right to practice and abide by their faith in their everyday lives including in the operations of their mission-oriented non-profit organization.\n\n\n\nThe ACA explicitly allows exemptions for non-profits that self-certify that they \u201chold themselves out as religious organizations.\u201d The law, however, is vague, so the MRC is asking the court declare that the MRC qualifies.\n\n\n\nShould the court disagree and hold that the MRC is not an \u201celigible organization,\u201d then MRC believes that the ACA violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution as the \u201celigible organization\u201d determination would require the government to determine who is \u201creligious enough\u201d to qualify for an exemption. Determining who is \u201creligious enough\u201d is an unconstitutional entanglement in questions of religious doctrine and organization.\n\n\n\nThe case, Media Research Center v.
