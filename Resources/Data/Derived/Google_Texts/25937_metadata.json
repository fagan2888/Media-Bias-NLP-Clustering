More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Furthermore, some of these non-citizens voted. Our best guess, based upon extrapolations from the portion of the sample with a verified vote, is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010.\n\nBecause non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 CCES sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections.\n\nNon-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) won election in 2008 with a victory margin of 312 votes.\n\nVotes cast by just 0.65 percent of Minnesota non-citizens could account for this margin. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama\u2019s 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina\u2019s adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Non-citizen votes gave us both Al Franken and ObamaCare.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Non-citizen votes gave us both Al Franken and ObamaCare.", "title": "Washington Post: Obama Won 80% of Non-Citizen Votes in 2008", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/243770/washington-post-obama-won-80-non-citizen-votes-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:23-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/243770/washington-post-obama-won-80-non-citizen-votes-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Non-citizen votes gave us both Al Franken and ObamaCare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Washington Post: Obama Won 80% of Non-Citizen Votes in 2008"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-25T17:27:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd50\"", "article_summary": "It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama\u2019s 2008 victory in North Carolina.\nObama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina\u2019s adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.\nSen.
