This is a controversial project. Remember how the Republicans and Sen. Dan Sullivan blistered Sen. Mark Begich for not opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in exchange for his vote for Obamacare? Well, why, as the chair of the committee that passed this, didn't Sen. Murkowski make up for the massive losses Alaska will face from the creation of this pipeline? She could have put in a provision to open ANWR for oil drilling, or rallied to get revenue sharing for Outer Continental Shelf drilling -- just like they have in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Revenue sharing alone would have netted Alaska about $1 billion in lease revenue alone just a few years ago. I'm thinking now would be a good time for a coach's challenge.
