“Good evening everybody,” Obama began his remarks. “Tonight we celebrate the artists and music and messages that shape our culture, and together, we can change our culture for the better by ending violence against women and girls.”

“Right now, nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape, and more than one in four women has experienced some form of domestic violence,” the president continued. “It’s not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Artists have a unique power to change minds and attitudes and get us thinking and talking about what matters. And all of us, in our own lives, have the power to set an example. Join our campaign to stop this violence. Go to itsonus.org and take the pledge. And to the artists at the Grammys tonight, I ask you to ask your fans to do it too.”

“It’s on us, all of us, to create a culture where violence isn’t tolerated, where survivors are supported, and where all our young people, men and women, can go as far as their talents and their dreams will take them,” Obama concluded. “Thanks.”
