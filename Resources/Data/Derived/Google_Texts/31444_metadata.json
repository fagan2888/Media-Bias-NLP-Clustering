He has been involved in two auto accidents, which meant he was unable to work. ( Alan Toth/KQED )\n\nFor six months, Eliza Kinrose worked about ten hours a week delivering anything from cupcakes to art supplies to strangers\u2019 homes.\n\nShortly after quitting her steady job as a recruiter, Kinrose, 29, signed up to work for a new San Francisco-based mobile delivery service called Postmates. She made about $15 an hour for six months, which was just enough to scrape by until she launched a yoga business.\n\nPostmates is just one of an explosion of \u201cgig economy\u201d or \u201con-demand economy\u201d companies that connect people seeking services with sellers of those services in a few minutes\u2019 time. Those who work for the gig economy do not receive health insurance, or any of the other social protections extended to employees. Unless they are employed elsewhere, they need to find and pay for these protections on their own.\n\nBut one evening, Kinrose received an email from Postmates about an intriguing free \u201cperk\u201d to help her find health insurance called Stride Health.\n\nStride Health is a startup health insurance broker service, which makes recommendations about health plans that are tailored to people\u2019s needs. The company offers web and mobile services to assist customers once they\u2019ve purchased a health plan, including premium payment reminders and guidance on whether they qualify for subsidies. Stride Health also shows customers how much scenarios, like asthma or heart disease, would affect their out of pocket costs.\n\nSan Francisco-based Stride Health is one of many startups taking advantage of new opportunities created by the Affordable Care Act and the perceived failings of the federal and state marketplaces for individuals to buy health insurance. It is unique, however, in targeting gig economy workers like Kinrose. Uber, Postmates and Taskrabbit, three of the largest gig economy companies, market Stride Health\u2019s service to their workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nStride Health\u2019s involvement with the gig economy may signal a shift in attitudes and priorities. According to Stride Health CEO Noah Lang, Uber and the rest are starting to care about the needs of their workers. \u201cThey want to make sure people don\u2019t end up in a tough spot by forgoing coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nBut critics of the gig economy say Stride Health is a bandaid solution, as workers are still on the hook to pay for their own health insurance.\n\n\u201cWhen we have a jobs-based social welfare system, some people get a combination of health care, disability and more,\u201d said Ken Jacobs, chair of the Labor Center at UC Berkeley, who specializes in health care coverage and public policy. \u201cIn a world where people are operating separately from that, the safety net goes away.\u201d\n\nHow Big Is the Gig Economy, Really?\n\nIn cities across the United States, anyone with a smartphone can order a meal from Postmates, a ride to work via Lyft or Uber, groceries on Instacart or a home cleaning on Handy. These services are so pervasive, with billions in total sales as a group that it\u2019s hard to believe they only sprung up in the past five years.\n\n\u201cThese marketplaces care about growing and maintaining their labor pool. But at the same time, they have to minimize their risks by not stepping over any of the lines.\u201d\n\nNoah Lang, Stride Health cofounder and CEO\n\nThe on-demand economy has been hailed as the next big thing, but labor economists say it still hasn\u2019t made much of a dent in the overall U.S. economy. The idea may be disruptive to the status quo, but the most recent data suggests that Americans are no less likely to be self-employed than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe gig economy currently is not really even big enough to show up in the [national economic] data,\u201d said Jacobs. \u201cAnd unfortunately, we don\u2019t yet have a good sense of how big it will be.\u201d\n\nOne promising trend, according to Jacobs, is that the companies are starting to release more data on their workers. In 2014, Uber collaborated with Princeton University economist Alan Kreuger on a report that determined the company had 160,000 \u201cdriver partners\u201d in the United States. By contrast, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that there were some 230,000 taxi-drivers in the U.S. in 2012.\n\nUber may not show up in national data just yet, but it is having an outsized impact in politics and popular culture. Even the presidential candidates are taking a side: While Hilary Clinton says she wants to \u201ccrack down\u201d on sharing economy abuses of workers, Jeb Bush was recently spotted hailing an Uber ride in San Francisco.\n\nIndependent Contractors or Employees?\n\nBy targeting the gig economy, Stride Health has taken a central role in an ongoing debate between policymakers, investors, and litigators, about whether on-demand companies should be treating their workers as employees and paying their expenses, as well as providing health insurance and other benefits.\n\nUber, a San Francisco-based company that uses a smartphone app to link people needing car rides with drivers for hire who use their own vehicles, is currently facing a looming class action lawsuit. In the suit, three Uber drivers are collectively challenging the company on whether they should be considered employees under the law \u2013 and not independent contractors, as the company now classifies them.\n\nAnd in June, the California Labor Commission ruled against Uber in determining that an ex-driver was entitled to reimbursement for business expenses.\n\n\u201cMany drivers have included on their list of issues that they are on their own for health insurance,\u201d said Shannon Liss-Riordan, of Boston, Mass. the lead plaintiff attorney in the class action lawsuit against Uber. Liss-Riordan is also taking aim against Uber\u2019s main rival, Lyft, and has spoken to hundreds of people who drive for these companies. \u201cThese drivers are left in the cold,\u201d she said.\n\nHow the Uber case ends up could have national implications. If the company loses its class-action lawsuit and has to reclassify its drivers from independent contractors to employees, that would force the company to pay for things like expenses, and provide benefits to full-time drivers. One recent estimate is that Uber would need to pay $209 million a year to reclassify its drivers to employees \u2013 and that\u2019s just in California.\n\nNot everyone believes that Uber and the rest have left anyone out in the cold.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one thing, the Affordable Care Act has relieved the burden for many drivers, as it provides subsidies for low-income people to buy health insurance independently. Uber\u2019s CEO Travis Kalanick reportedly referred to the ACA as \u201chuge\u201d for the gig economy.\n\nSome policymakers envision a middle ground, where workers have some added protections but are not full employees. One idea is a new worker category called a \u201cdependent contractor,\u201d which is legal in Germany, Canada and other countries, but not in the United States.\n\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner, D-Virginia, has spent more than a year researching the on-demand economy. He has proposed numerous paths forward to broker a peace in the legal wars, including the dependent contractor model. He has also proposed similar marketplaces to the Affordable Care Act for other key benefits, including workers\u2019 compensation.\n\nBut Warner doesn\u2019t agree that the ACA is a silver bullet for the gig economy, as these companies do not pay into it. Uber avoids providing health insurance to drivers, which it considers contractors, as the ACA mandates that only employers extend coverage to full-time employees. That\u2019s a loophole that saves gig economy companies a lot of money.\n\nWalking the Tightrope\n\nSome critics of Uber have painted the company\u2019s top executives as indifferent to the plight of workers. But by providing services to workers, these companies risk adding fuel to the legal argument that they should be employees and not independent contractors.\n\nThe I.R.S. has about twenty factors that it takes into account when determining a worker classification. One important distinction is how much \u201ccontrol\u201d an employer has over the work that\u2019s being done, but it\u2019s not always clear what control means.\n\n\u201cEssentially, this [partnership with Stride Health] is about how these workers can get health care without exposing Uber and the rest to liability or responsibility,\u201d said UC Berkeley\u2019s Jacobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLang doesn\u2019t totally disagree, but paints the partnership in a more positive light: \u201cThese marketplaces care about growing and maintaining their labor pool,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they have to minimize their risks by not stepping over any of the lines.\u201d\n\nIf these companies do nothing, their practices may draw fire from policymakers. An uninsured and at-risk population is likely to incur major health costs in the long-term, costs that could eventually be borne by taxpayers. According to Lang, about 40 percent of gig economy workers surveyed by Stride Health said they would \u201cnot have gotten coverage otherwise.\u201d\n\nStride Health seems to be a safe solution for the gig economy companies. It is unclear how many workers are using the tool, but Uber said it is helping those who are uninsured drivers find an affordable health plan. And drivers seem to like it.\n\n\u201cFinding affordable, effective health insurance is top of mind for many drivers,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said in a press release. A spokesperson for Taskrabbit said the company \u201cvetted other options\u201d but ultimately opted to partner with Stride due to the \u201cthoughtful approach for independent contractors.\u201d\n\nPostmates declined to comment on its reasons for partnering with Stride. Uber and Taskrabbit emailed statements that could not be attributed to any company official.\n\nWill On-Demand Companies Ever Provide Health Insurance to Workers?\n\nCritics of the on-demand economy say that Uber and the rest are the latest in a long line of companies that use fancy wordplay and questionable tactics to avoid protecting workers. These legal battles go back decades, with FedEx most recently settling a lawsuit with drivers who claimed they had been misclassified.\n\n\u201cUber tries to argue that it\u2019s not in the car service industry; it\u2019s a technology platform,\u201d said Liss-Riordan in an interview. \u201cThe court rejected that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome folks are working part-time for other jobs. Others have not had health insurance in a long time and need extra help navigating their options.\u201d\n\nAn Uber spokesperson\n\nSome on-demand economy companies are now taking steps to reclassify their workers as employees, including Doctor on Demand, a company that connects people with doctors online in a matter of minutes, as well as mobile delivery services Instacart and Shyp.\n\nBut Lang is doubtful that this will trigger a shift for the on-demand economy at large. As Lang points out, Uber\u2019s labor pool is much larger than an Instarcart or Shyp and its workers are not specialized like Doctor on Demand\u2019s physicians \u2013 all they need is a drivers\u2019 license. \u201cI give Shyp and Instacart kudos, of course,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also opportunistic for them.\u201d\n\nA change in federal law or a landmark Supreme Court ruling might force Uber, Lyft and others to treat their workers as employees. This wouldn\u2019t mean that every driver would receive employee-sponsored health insurance overnight.\n\nDan Diamond, executive editor for the research and consulting firm The Advisory Board, has written about how Uber would handle the health care problem if its drivers were considered employees. Diamond does not believe that workers would immediately benefit from a reclassification.\n\nUber might opt to avoid providing health insurance by paying a fee under the Affordable Care Act (a requirement if businesses do not provide health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours per week). It might also cap workers\u2019 at 29 hours per week to keep them part-time employees.\n\nDiamond expects that Uber will use every weapon in its arsenal to avoid such an outcome. \u201cFor Uber, none of these options are ideal.\u201d\n\nDeco Carter, a Bay Area-based Lyft driver, said he \u201cknew the risks\u201d when he joined the growing ranks of gig economy workers. He has been involved in two auto accidents, and lacked income for several weeks until he got his car fixed.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t have anything to fall back on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my fianc\u00e9, I don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d\n\nIn the years ahead, he hopes that Lyft would consider extending benefits to drivers, particularly to those who work full-time hours. Lyft is not currently working with Stride Health, but it drivers have access to an alternative service called the eHealth marketplace. A spokesperson denied requests from KQED for an interview.\n\nBut while executives at these companies may want to do more to protect workers, they are also under pressure to protect their bottom line. It would be highly expensive for them to reclassify workers.\n\nMost experts are watching the presidential race as an indicator of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that we\u2019ll either re-classify everyone as an employee or trust the unfettered hand of capitalism,\u201d said Warner. \u201cBefore that happens, I\u2019m hoping those of us who are thinking about this in a bipartisan fashion can come up with some policy ideas that might be embraced by both sides.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A startup called Stride Health is working with Uber, Taskrabbit and Postmates to help their workers find affordable health insurance.
