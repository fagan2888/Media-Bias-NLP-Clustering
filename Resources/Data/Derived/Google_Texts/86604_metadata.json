In the report, professional autonomy is defined as the \u201cright and privilege granted by a governmental authority to a class of professionals, and to each licensed individual within that profession, to exercise independent, expert judgment within a legally defined scope of practice, (and) to provide services in the best interests of the client.\u201d\n\n\n\nI made a number of observations while reading the report, but I want to share just 2 of them with you. Although it may not be much consolation when an individual feels challenged to compromise his or her professional values, recognizing that pharmacy doesn\u2019t face the issue of professional autonomy alone but, instead, shares it with all other health care professionals can provide some level of encouragement. Another perspective is that no matter the type of health care system involved\u2014entrepreneurial or socialized\u2014we are all facing economic pressures that can challenge professional autonomy. Pharmacy will have to face many obstacles ahead, with or without Obamacare.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Pharmacy Times", "type": "Article", "description": "Professional autonomy is necessary to allow pharmacists to fulfill their mission.", "title": "Threats to Professional Autonomy in Pharmacy"}, "description": "Professional autonomy is necessary to allow pharmacists to fulfill their mission."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03f7\"", "article_summary": "Blogs : The Reinvented PharmacistThreats to Professional Autonomy in PharmacyRecently, the International Pharmacy Federation (FIP) released an interesting report entitled \u201cPharmacist Ethics and Professional Autonomy: Imperatives for Keeping Pharmacy Aligned with the Public Interest.\u201d One aspect of the report that got my attention is the observation that, \u201cBecause of international trends in health care delivery and financing, practitioners in most (perhaps all) health professions are experiencing threats to professional autonomy.\u201dThe FIP report does an excellent job in documenting why professional autonomy is necessary to allow pharmacists to fulfill their mission.\nAnother perspective is that no matter the type of health care system involved\u2014entrepreneurial or socialized\u2014we are all facing economic pressures that can challenge professional autonomy.\nAlthough it may not be much consolation when an individual feels challenged to compromise his or her professional values, recognizing that pharmacy doesn\u2019t face the issue of professional autonomy alone but, instead, shares it with all other health care professionals can provide some level of encouragement.\nPharmacy will have to face many obstacles ahead, with or without Obamacare.\nIn the report, professional autonomy is defined as the \u201cright and privilege granted by a governmental authority to a class of professionals, and to each licensed individual within that profession, to exercise independent, expert judgment within a legally defined scope of practice, (and) to provide services in the best interests of the client.\u201dI made a number of observations while reading the report, but I want to share just 2 of them with you."}
