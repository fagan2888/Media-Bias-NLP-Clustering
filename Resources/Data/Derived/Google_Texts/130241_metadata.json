Income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes \u2014 it seems like the list is endless. But there\u2019s one tax I\u2019ve been paying for most of my life that you might not know about. If you\u2019re a woman, chances are you\u2019re paying it too.\n\nIt\u2019s called the pink tax.\n\nWhat is it? It\u2019s the premium you pay for goods and services that are marketed to women, even when they\u2019re identical to those sold as \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d products at a cheaper price. One study calculated this \u201ctax\u201d at an extra $1,400 a year.\n\nYou\u2019ll find a lot of these items in drugstores \u2014 stuff like razors, deodorants, wrinkle creams, shaving creams, even pain killers. The pink tax also creeps in at dry cleaners, where a plain women\u2019s white shirt often costs more than a man\u2019s shirt, which is usually bigger and made from longer-lasting fabric.\n\nHigh-end products are no exception. Manufacturers of scents charge less for men\u2019s cologne than they do for ladies\u2019 perfume \u2014 even though the ingredients are the same. Women\u2019s plus-sized clothing costs more than the regular sizes. If you think it\u2019s because more fabric is used, think again: Men\u2019s plus sizes cost about the same as the smaller sizes.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see for yourself.\n\nResearchers for Mic.com sampled a handful of common drugstore products. They found pink razors for $12.49, while blue razors from the same brand ran just $10.99. Women\u2019s deodorant was $4.99. Men\u2019s, only $3.29. And even though Excedrin Complete Menstrual contains the same ingredients as Excedrin Extra Strength, that \u201cM\u201d word costs half a buck extra for the same size bottle.\n\nTwenty years ago, California did a study that uncovered lots of this gendered pricing, leading to a statute that outlawed the practice. But no other states followed suit, so women in the other 49 could be stuck paying more.\n\nThere\u2019s one bit of good news. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies could and did charge women more for the exact same coverage men got. And not because of maternity coverage \u2014 that often wasn\u2019t included in the policies at all. When Obamacare passed, sex discrimination in health insurance pricing became illegal.\n\nBut the pink tax is still very much alive. A nickel here and 50 cents there adds up to over a thousand bucks a year for the typical female shopper. And that\u2019s real money.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Women are slammed with $1,400 a year in retail markups thanks to gendered marketing.", "author": "Martha Burk", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "Women are slammed with $1,400 a year in retail markups thanks to gendered marketing.", "title": "Paying the Pink Tax", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/31448-paying-the-pink-tax", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/tologo.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "title": "Paying the Pink Tax", "twitter": {"description": "Women are slammed with $1,400 a year in retail markups thanks to gendered marketing.", "title": "Paying the Pink Tax", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@truthout"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "keywords": "economy and labor, gender, women, media and culture, opinion, Economy and Labor, gender, Media and Culture, Opinion, women", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s called the pink tax.\nBut the pink tax is still very much alive.\nThey found pink razors for $12.49, while blue razors from the same brand ran just $10.99.\nBut there\u2019s one tax I\u2019ve been paying for most of my life that you might not know about.\nThe pink tax also creeps in at dry cleaners, where a plain women\u2019s white shirt often costs more than a man\u2019s shirt, which is usually bigger and made from longer-lasting fabric."}
