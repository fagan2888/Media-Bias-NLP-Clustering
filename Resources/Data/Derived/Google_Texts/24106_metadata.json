Math anxiety.\n\nMeans of transmission? Homework help.\n\nChildren of highly math-anxious parents learned less math and were more likely to develop math anxiety themselves, but only when their parents provided frequent help on homework, according to a study of first- and second-graders in Psychological Science.\n\nResearchers tested 438 children from 29 public and private schools, at the beginning and end of the school year.The more the math-anxious parents tried to work with their children, the worse their children did in math, slipping more than a third of a grade level.\n\n\u201cThe parents are not out to sabotage their kids,\u201d said Sian L. Beilock, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Chicago and the author of \u201cChoke,\u201d about anxiety and performance. \u201cBut we have to ensure their input is productive. They need to have an awareness of their own math anxiety, and that what you say is important.\u201d\n\nFor example, she said, comforting a child, by saying, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not a math person either, and that\u2019s OK,\u2019 is not a good message to convey.\u201d\n\nFor decades, researchers have looked at high math anxiety, which, some studies show, can afflict 10 percent to 20 percent of adults. It affects not only grades but also self-esteem and everyday skills. (How many gallons of paint for two coats of your living room? Can you convert a double-layer cake recipe into a triple-layer?) Mark H. Ashcraft, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, explains that the condition can feed upon itself.\n\n\u201cOn challenging math problems that require a lot of working memory, math-anxious people fall apart,\u201d he said. Their working memory is consumed by worry, \u201cand they don\u2019t have enough left over to do the math.\u201d\n\nMany adults identify middle-school algebra as the onset of math anxiety. Research has shown it can begin earlier. In a 2010 study, Beilock\u2019s team found one significant factor, particularly for young girls: math-anxious elementary teachers, almost 90 percent of whom are female.\n\nBut the effect of math-anxious, homework-helping parents is a newly discovered factor. This is exacerbated when schools introduce new methods of learning, said Harris Cooper, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University.\n\n\u201cEducators can\u2019t take math, turn it into Greek, and say, \u2018Mom, Dad, will you help your kid with this,\u2019 and not expect to get a \u2018wha?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nCooper suggests that parents of young children create a math-positive environment by modeling \u201cmath behavior.\u201d Tell your child, \u201c\u2018You have your math homework, and I have mine,\u2019\u201d he said, and show them whenever you \u201ccount your change, calculate when dinner will be ready, look at prices in a grocery store.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/09/1003474180-FL_SAR_HFYOUTH22.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9822\"", "article_summary": "Math anxiety.\nChildren of highly math-anxious parents learned less math and were more likely to develop math anxiety themselves, but only when their parents provided frequent help on homework, according to a study of first- and second-graders in Psychological Science.\nTheir working memory is consumed by worry, \u201cand they don\u2019t have enough left over to do the math.\u201dMany adults identify middle-school algebra as the onset of math anxiety.\n\u201cOn challenging math problems that require a lot of working memory, math-anxious people fall apart,\u201d he said.\nBut the effect of math-anxious, homework-helping parents is a newly discovered factor."}
