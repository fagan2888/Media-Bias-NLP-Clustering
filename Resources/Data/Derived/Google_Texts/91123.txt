Ever seen the hit TV show Bring It? It's featured on LIfetime and shows teams from around the nation competing in a dance competition.

Several teams from around Mississippi gathered at the Frank Cochran Center this afternoon, to have their own stand battle. Teams from as far as Crystal Springs, Mississippi took to the floor and competed against many dance teams located here in the Queen City.

"If they continue to do this through school, you know they have to keep up their grades," Dancing Diva's Team Mom Wynake Wilson stated. "You can get a scholarship through the dance. We are trying to give them that positive attitude to keep it up and keep going with it through high school. You can get scholarships through that."

The winners of the Buck it Out stand battle were given trophies for their performance in different categories.
