(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nWe often think of government regulations as important and valuable, keeping us safe and protecting us from fraud. But did you know the cost of these regulations could be up to $15,000 per family?\n\nThat\u2019s one finding of a new report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). Authored by Wayne Crews, CEI\u2019s vice president for policy, \u201cTen Thousand Commandments\u201d highlights the recklessness with which the federal government has been implementing new rules, often with substantial costs and minor benefits.\n\nBecause federal agencies can issue regulations and the president can enact certain rules by executive order, the rules are seldom debated by the public or discussed by the media. One of the biggest problems with federal regulations is that most of them are never analyzed to determine whether they are worth the costs they impose. As a result, there is no real accountability, especially for old regulations that remain in the Federal Register year after year.\n\n\u201cAmong the problems with cost-benefit analysis is that it relies primarily on agency self-reporting,\u201d Crews writes. \u201cHaving agencies audit their own rules is like asking students to grade their own exams.\u201d\n\nRegulatory costs have skyrocketed, the report notes, leading to an annual federal regulation and intervention cost of almost $2 trillion. If U.S. regulations were a country, they\u2019d be the ninth-largest economy in the world, ahead of Russia.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, the cost of regulation and federal intervention comes out to $14,842 per household. Obviously, this amount is not actually paid by individual households, but it illuminates the significant drag on economic growth that regulations can have.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the cost that matters. The precedent set by an unaccountable set of federal agencies constantly issuing opaque rules without input from the public or Congress is dangerous. \u201cWe live in an era in which the government \u2014 without actually passing a law \u2014 increasingly dictates parameters of various economic sectors, including health care, retirement, education, energy production, finance, land and resource management, funding of science and research, and manufacturing,\u201d Crews writes.\n\nIn 2015, Congress enacted 114 laws, while federal agencies issued 3,410 new rules, according to the report. That\u2019s 30 rules for each new law.\n\nJust recently, House Republicans won a court case arguing that the Obama administration spent money to fund part of the Affordable Care Act without a congressional appropriation. The line between legislators and federal agency officials has become fuzzier by the year, and many agencies seem to follow the old saying, \u201cit\u2019s better to ask forgiveness than permission.\u201d\n\nThe CEI report also references a 2012 Washington Post article in which agency officials alleged the Obama administration had intentionally delayed issuing certain rules so to avert public controversy during an election year. This new style of rulemaking is bad for businesses and citizens, since they end up paying the costs of rules imposed on them by unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\u201cRegulations impact not just employment. We\u2019ve seen an inverse correlation between regulation and innovation as well,\u201d Crews told Opportunity Lives. \u201cThe only way to improve the future prospects for American businesses is to rein in federal regulations.\u201d\n\nDaniel Huizinga is a columnist for Opportunity Lives covering business and politics.
