Furniture Row Racing has picked up driver Martin Truex Jr.’s option for the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and will switch from Chevrolet to Toyota as its car manufacturer in 2016, the Denver-based team will announce Sunday morning. The No. 78 will be a Toyota Camry next season.

Since its 2005 big-league inception, Furniture Row Racing has been with Chevrolet, and recently aligned with North Carolina-based Richard Childress Racing. FRR will now have a technical alliance with Joe Gibbs Racing, which is currently partnered with Toyota.

Truex, who is in his second year with FRR, is among the 16 playoff drivers competing in the Chase for the Championship. The second of 10 Chase races is Sunday at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Truex is in 11th place after finishing 13th in the Chase opener last week at Chicago.

In the first 27 races this season, Truex has one victory, seven top-five finishes and 17 top-10 efforts.

Joe Gibbs Racing fields four Camrys — driven by Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards, Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth. All four are in the Chase and have combined to win 12 races this season. Hamlin won the Chase opener and JGR has been the dominant team in the series this year.
