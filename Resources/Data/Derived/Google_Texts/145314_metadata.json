This past week, Obama used 60 Minutes to attempt to shift blame for the failure to anticipate the rise of ISIS, endured a cover-up of White House security disasters by the Secret Service, and saw a government-agency report that he had skipped nearly 60 percent of his intelligence briefings.\n\nThe reaction from some longtime Obama defenders was swift and harsh. \u201cPresident Obama this week committed professional suicide,\u201d wrote former CNN host Piers Morgan, now an editor-at-large for Britain\u2019s Daily Mail.\n\nHe called Obama\u2019s throwing of the intelligence community under the bus a \u201cshameless, reprehensible display of buck-passing\u201d that will result in some analysts\u2019 exacting \u201ccold-blooded revenge on Obama by drip-feeding negative stories about him until he\u2019s gone.\u201d As for the Secret Service fiasco, Morgan said it was \u201cno wonder the Secret Service gets complacent when The Boss exudes complacency from every pore.\u201d\n\nChris Matthews of MSNBC, the former White House speechwriter who once rapturously recounted that he \u201cfelt this thrill going up my leg\u201d as Obama spoke, didn\u2019t hold back on Wednesday\u2019s Hardball. \u201cLet\u2019s get tough here,\u201d Matthews began, as he lambasted Obama for being \u201cintellectually lazy\u201d and \u201clistening to the same voices all the time.\u201d He even named names, saying that Obama had become \u201catrophied into that little world of people like Valerie Jarrett and Mrs. Obama.\u201d\n\nJonathan Alter, a columnist for Bloomberg News and the author of a sympathetic book on Obama\u2019s first term, reported that Jarrett is an unusual presence in the White House: \u201cStaffers feared her, but didn\u2019t like or trust her. At meetings she said little or nothing, instead lingering afterwards to express her views directly to the President, creating anxiety for her underlings and insulting them by saying, \u2018I don\u2019t talk just to hear myself talking.\u2019\u201d\n\nEveryone expects a presidential spouse to weigh in on issues, but the reference to Valerie Jarrett, the White House senior adviser who mentored both the president and the first lady at the start of their careers in Chicago, is telling. Her outsize role in many presidential decisions is known to insiders, but she remains resolutely behind the scenes. So when Jarrett does enter the news, it\u2019s significant, because it may provide a window into how the Obama White House really works.\n\nThis week, Greg Hinz of Crain\u2019s Chicago Business noted that President Obama was back visiting Chicago but \u201chaving to share headlines with Valerie Jarrett.\u201d She began the week with a cameo appearance on CBS\u2019s highly rated show The Good Wife. Then a column by Michael Sneed in the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Jarrett \u201cmay be the worst abuser\u201d of any executive-branch official with a Secret Service detail, using guards \u201cround the clock\u201d even while she was shopping, at the gym, or visiting friends in Chicago.\n\nAt a time when a government report shows the Secret Service is more than 550 agents below its optimal strength, Sneed bluntly asked, \u201cIs this expense justifiable or is it an abuse of power?\u201d Sneed quoted a source close to the White House: \u201cJarrett is treated as a member of the Obama family, but she\u2019s had no real death threats requiring the constant use of the Secret Service that I know of.\u201d\n\nWhen Mark Leibovich of the New York Times tried to trace how Jarrett obtained Secret Service protection, he was told by someone close to her that she found such questions \u201cridiculous and offensive.\u201d\n\nHinz of Chicago Business has covered Jarrett for years and has decided to offer her some quick advice: \u201cDo whatever it takes to get your name out of the papers. And just watch TV for a while. OK?\u201d He then joked that if Jarrett really wanted \u201cto have some fun, try to figure out who dropped the dime on you.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bet against Jarrett finding out. As I wrote last year, White House aides \u201cwent to extraordinary lengths to uncover the identity of a senior official who was using Twitter to make snarky comments about Jarrett and other White House staffers. . . . The official had gone so far as to tweet \u2018I\u2019m a fan of Obama, but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a vacuous cipher like Valerie Jarrett concerns me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen the bloodhounds uncovered Jofi Joseph, the point man on nuclear nonproliferation at the National Security Council, as the offending official, he was fired \u2014 not for revealing any secrets but for making disparaging comments about thin-skinned administration players such as Jarrett.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, members of both parties are more and more mystified at Obama\u2019s apparent disengagement from parts of his job. Months before he dropped the ball on ISIS, he failed to keep himself properly apprised of the problems with Obamacare\u2019s website. Jarrett appears to exercise such extraordinary influence that in some quarters on Capitol Hill she is known as \u201cRasputin,\u201d a reference to the mystical monk who held sway over Russia\u2019s Czar Nicholas as he increasingly lost touch with reality during World War I.\n\nNo one suggests that Jarrett is solely responsible for the administration\u2019s slow response to the crises, contradictory communication, and labored political calculation that have become its hallmarks. But many do think that she has failed to encourage the president to bring in new people with fresh ideas.\n\nSo how has she survived? Not only has she been close to the first couple for nearly a quarter-century, but she clearly makes the president feel even better about himself than he would anyway. Consider this quote from her interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick for his book The Bridge (2010):\n\nI think Barack knew that he had God-given talents that were extraordinary. He knows exactly how smart he is. . . . He knows how perceptive he is. He knows what a good reader of people he is. And he knows that he has the ability \u2014 the extraordinary, uncanny ability \u2014 to take a thousand different perspectives, digest them and make sense out of them, and I think that he has never really been challenged intellectually. . . . So what I sensed in him was not just a restless spirit but somebody with such extraordinary talents that had to be really taxed in order for him to be happy. . . . He\u2019s been bored to death his whole life. He\u2019s just too talented to do what ordinary people do.\n\nJournalists who contacted the White House this week and asked to speak with Jarrett didn\u2019t get very far. Maybe she\u2019s decided to follow the advice of Greg Hinz and lie low for a while. But if journalists really want a fuller explanation for how the Obama administration has reached its current low ebb, perhaps they should continue to follow the threads of the Jarrett string that were revealed this week and see where those lead.\n\n\u2014 John Fund is national-affairs correspondent for NRO.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Obama\u2019s \u00c9minence Grise", "sailthru.author": "John Fund", "description": "Are significant chunks of the mainstream media in despair over Barack Obama?
