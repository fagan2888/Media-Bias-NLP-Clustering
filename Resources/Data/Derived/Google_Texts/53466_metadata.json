Photo: JOHN TAGGART for The Wall Street Journal\n\nOn Thursday evening, Lincoln Center will hold an official ceremony to rename Avery Fisher Hall, home of the New York Philharmonic, David Geffen Hall. Mr. Geffen, the entertainment mogul, contributed $100 million toward the hall\u2019s coming renovation.\n\nOne of Lincoln Center\u2019s current employees who recalls Philharmonic Hall\u2019s previous renaming\u2014for Avery Fisher in 1973\u2014is Jack Kirkman, director of production.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Kirkman, 81 years old, remembers the neighborhood before there was a Lincoln Center. \u201cWhen they started building this complex I was working at Don Allen Chevrolet, making adjustments on carburetors,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was referring to a car dealership in the neighborhood that was going to be torn down to make way for the arts complex. \u201cI was so against building this place. I thought I\u2019d lose this job.\u201d\n\nSeeing little future in car repair, Mr. Kirkman managed in 1963 to land a job at Lincoln Center as an artist\u2019s assistant. In fact, the position was created for him.\n\n\u201cI absolutely loved that job,\u201d he recalled as he sat one afternoon last week in Avery Fisher Hall\u2019s Green Room, where conductors and soloists greet friends and fans after performances. \u201cI would meet the conductor when they arrived. I would collect their mail and any flowers and gifts.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Mr. Kirkman may have been a bit too conscientious. Such as the time he grilled the great classical pianist Arthur Rubinstein about the length of his performance. \u201cHe said, \u2018Listen, young man. I\u2019m playing a concert. I\u2019m not driving a train.\u2019 \u201d\n\nArtists have their idiosyncrasies. But Mr. Kirkman, who grew up in North Carolina, dreamed of being a dancer and studied acting with Lee Strasberg, was a sympathetic spirit.\n\nENLARGE A 1965 exterior view of Philharmonic Hall, as it was then known, at Lincoln Center.

At his first opportunity Mr. Kirkman handed them off to the Philharmonic\u2019s engineers, who sanded the bottoms.\n\n\u201cWe became quite good friends after that,\u201d Mr. Kirkman remembered. \u201cI\u2019d always come early and she would come early. I\u2019d give her tea and she\u2019d read the tea leaves.\u201d\n\nOne of his saddest memories is of Judy Garland during a 1968 tribute concert to Harold Arlen. The frail Ms. Garland had trouble remembering the lyrics to \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe audience got wind of what was going on and they came forward; some came on the stage just to be near her,\u201d Mr. Kirkman remembered. \u201cI went out there and took her off the stage.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he served as bartender to Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton during one evening\u2019s performance.\n\nThe box closest to and overlooking the stage used to be screened in, Mr. Kirkman explained, hiding celebrities so that they could enjoy the performance without their presence disrupting it.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I did was sit with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, pouring vodka\u201d as they polished off the better part of a bottle, he recalled.\n\nThe Burtons seemed as pleased by Mr. Kirkman\u2019s performance as by whatever was transpiring onstage. \u201cShe said as she was leaving, \u2018You pour a hell of a drink.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerhaps Mr. Kirkman\u2019s richest professional relationship was with conductor Leonard Bernstein, with whom he traveled during the Philharmonic\u2019s trips abroad.\n\nDuring a concert in Switzerland, Charlie Chaplin invited Bernstein to lunch. \u201cBernstein knew I was trying to be an actor and studying with Lee Strasberg,\u201d Mr. Kirkman said. \u201cHe asked me if I wanted to go. It was a delightful afternoon.\u201d\n\nENLARGE Ella Fitzgerald belts out a song at Avery Fisher Hall in 1987. She and Lincoln Center Director of Production Jack Kirkman became good friends.

He was being honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.\n\nMr. Kirkman was designated to protect Chaplin from the huge crowds that swarmed Lincoln Center. \u201cWhen it was over he got back in the elevator, hugged me, and said, \u2018I love you, America. It\u2019s good to be home.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Kirkman has been slowed by a stroke and uses a walker to get around the hall these days. But he wanted to take me backstage where, for many years, he has instructed the lighting engineers to \u201ctake the house down\u201d when the conductor or soloist gave him the signal that he or she was ready to go.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get a great feeling when you stand here,\u201d he said as he walked to center stage. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u2014ralph.gardner@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2015-09-22T19:22:00.000Z", "article.section": "US", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Lincoln Center is renaming Avery Fisher Hall, home of the New York Philharmonic, David Geffen Hall.
