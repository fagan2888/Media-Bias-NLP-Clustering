We know that poverty is \u201ctoxic\u201d to children: toxic to their health and nutrition; toxic to early brain and child development, and toxic to their chances for school achievement and productive adult lives.\n\nIn 2012, the Academic Pediatric Association, or A.P.A., formed a Task Force on Childhood Poverty, bringing together leading pediatricians from the United States and Canada to advocate for the needs of children and families living in poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics, or A.A.P., representing over 60,000 pediatricians, made \u201cpoverty and child health\u201d its strategic priority starting in 2013.\n\nWe speak with one voice when we stress the importance of implementing early childhood programs, such as home visiting programs to help and mentor families with infants and young children, high-quality universal preschool and child care, and Reach Out and Read, for all low-income children in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPediatricians do not view addressing childhood poverty as a partisan political issue. We expect Democrats and Republicans to share a desire to help children and safeguard our country\u2019s human capital and economic future.\n\nWe know what works. We know what to do. Let us join together to make this happen.\n\nBENARD P. DREYER\n\nNew York, Dec. 18, 2013\n\nThe writer, a professor of pediatrics at the New York University School of Medicine, is co-chairman of the A.P.A. Task Force on Childhood Poverty and co-chairman of the A.A.P. Public Policy and Advocacy Committee.\n\nMr. Shriver is right that we have chosen to invest in seniors rather than children. We\u2019ve also chosen to invest in bailing out banks, insurance companies and automobile manufacturers rather than investing in children. Arguably, all the bailouts were done for good reasons. But our kids are an even better reason \u2014 they just lack the political and financial power to command the attention of elected officials.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan vote for budget cuts that hurt children, the timidity of most Democrats when it comes to talking about poverty has made it easier for such votes to take place.\n\nThe gap between what we know about what children need, and what we do to ensure that they get it, has grown larger than ever.\n\nIf our actions mirrored our rhetoric, rather than mocked it, we\u2019d be reaping the long-term health, education and economic benefits of well-fed and well-educated American children.\n\nBILL SHORE\n\nChief Executive\n\nShare Our Strength\n\nWashington, Dec. 18, 2013\n\nMr. Shriver is right to highlight the scandal of worsening child poverty in the 50 years since Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s declaration of a War on Poverty. And he\u2019s also on target in comparing our relative success in reducing poverty among seniors with the inexcusable failure to tackle poverty among the young. But it\u2019s important to bear in mind that the roots of America\u2019s dismaying levels of child poverty lie primarily in our neglectful treatment of adults.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChildren are poor, after all, because their parents are poor. And their parents are poor because of some combination of lack of work, inadequate pay when they do work and minimal income support if they don\u2019t. We can\u2019t effectively address the poverty of children unless we tackle those structural deficits head-on.\n\nHead Start and other early childhood intervention programs are surely important, and as Mr. Shriver notes, sorely underfunded. But even more generous support for those programs won\u2019t roll back the continuing social disaster of endemic joblessness, declining pay for low-wage work and relentless attacks on benefits for low-income Americans.\n\nAs long as we tolerate those conditions, we will continue to suffer the worst child poverty rates in the advanced industrial world. We have the economic resources to do better. The question, as Mr. Shriver suggests, is whether we have the political will.\n\nELLIOTT CURRIE\n\nIrvine, Calif., Dec. 18, 2013\n\nThe writer is a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nI was in my 20s when Medicare was passed. I was in favor; I remember arguing with some friends who were opposed that we needed decent health care for older people. Now I am one.\n\nI pay for my Medicare, but I can and am willing to pay more. But children who are ill nourished and poorly educated break my heart, and I fear for our future.\n\nIf it takes Head Start from six months of age; if it takes Medicare for all; if it takes more food stamps, let\u2019s do it! Don\u2019t yak about how can we afford it. The question is: how can we afford not to?\n\nI don\u2019t want to see the United States roiled in mediocrity because its people are not educated properly and not in great health. Actually, I won\u2019t see it. I\u2019ll be dead, but how about the rest of you?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCAROL S. FRIEL\n\nCincinnati, Dec. 18, 2013\n\nMr. Shriver is saying the obvious, and it is sad that it has to be said. But it is all part of a bigger picture in which self-reliance and the frontier spirit of our country\u2019s history is taken to such an extreme that it drowns out the voices of community and compassion and the American tradition of helping one another.\n\nIt is a picture in which income extremes are at toxic levels so that a decent minimum wage cannot be passed and it is politically impossible to ask billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes, partly because politicians depend on their huge contributions to get elected. This is a time when government is considered the enemy rather than of the people, by the people, for the people. It is a time when taxes are no longer seen as the price of civilization, but an unfair imposition.\n\nChildren cannot pull themselves up by their bootstraps, especially when they do not even have shoes or a warm winter coat or a functioning family, when they don\u2019t come to school ready to learn because of a lack of preschool opportunities. We must repair our safety nets and make it possible for all children to reach their full potentials.\n\nIt is not either senior citizens or children, but both. It takes the whole village working together.\n\nINA ARONOW\n\nNew Rochelle, N.Y., Dec. 18, 2013\n\nMark Shriver should be assured that the work of his father, Sargent Shriver, lifted millions out of poverty and to a better life \u2014 in the \u201960s, yes, but also to this day. But I share his frustration. After 45 years of working on kids\u2019 issues, I\u2019ve not seen such political indifference, even hostility, to helping children.\n\nConservative belief that private-sector market forces, on their own, will spread our economy\u2019s benefits to all, poor children included, should have been shattered in the 2008 Wall Street debacle. No. Conservatives still want repeal of Obamacare, deep cuts in nutrition, no minimum-wage increases and shredding of a weakened social safety net \u2014 raising child poverty to levels unseen in rich democracies.\n\nPart of the answer to fighting child poverty is in your editorial \u201cWhy Other Countries Teach Better,\u201d printed on the same page as Mr. Shriver\u2019s letter. Listing reasons for Finland\u2019s success, you note that all schools are for wealthy and poor alike, and include hot meals, health services and family programs. Yes, Finns pay higher taxes, and investing in kids is redistributing income. They also have less crime, low teenage births, more success in school and less child poverty \u2014 true also in other rich democracies.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson and Sargent Shriver proved that we could lift children and families from poverty. Other presidents and Congresses, Democratic and Republican alike, have believed the same. Without today\u2019s conservative leaders rejoining the fight, millions of children face a grim future.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMICHAEL PETIT\n\nPresident\n\nEvery Child Matters\n\nWashington, Dec. 18, 2013\n\nThe Writer Responds\n\nI appreciate, though disagree with, Mr. Rogers\u2019s constructive criticism that my argument \u201cembraces the Republican either-or mentality between the elderly and those mired in poverty.\u201d\n\nI did not intend to make this simply an either-or argument between seniors and children. The same president that launched Head Start also started Medicare. I am not for children and therefore against seniors. I admire the progress that has been made for and by seniors \u2014 in fact, I am jealous!\n\nWhy is it, though, that we know what to do to address childhood poverty, as Professor Dreyer writes, just as we know what to do to address senior poverty, but we don\u2019t act on behalf of kids?\n\nI share Professor Dreyer\u2019s view that childhood poverty isn\u2019t a \u201cpartisan political issue\u201d and his expectation that Democrats and Republicans should share \u201ca desire to help children.\u201d But Bill Shore is correct that politicians in both parties have made kids less of a priority than seniors, banks, insurance companies and auto manufacturers, to name just a few.\n\nIt\u2019s imperative to heed the call from Proverbs 31: \u201cSpeak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.\u201d\n\nUntil kids and those who advocate on their behalf \u2014 including Bill Shore, Michael Petit, Samuel J. Meisels and me \u2014 get better politically organized and hold political leaders accountable at the ballot box, change is not going to happen.\n\nMARK K.
