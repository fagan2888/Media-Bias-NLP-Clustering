REUTERS/Jason Reed (UNITED STATES HEALTH POLITICS BUSINESS) - RTR265K1\n\n4004136\n\nThe retired persons advocacy group AARP partners with the organization that helped craft President Obama\u2019s \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d lie.\n\nAARP, founded in 1958, is generating criticism from many of its members for heavily promoting Obamacare, which helps AARP\u2019s bottom line to the tune of more than $1 billion. One legendary television personality told The Daily Caller that disgruntled members should leave the organization and join his rival group.\n\nAARP partners with a small, unknown group called the Herndon Alliance, which has been described as \u201cthe messaging arm of a vast center-left infrastructure pushing health care reform.\u201d AARP and Herndon\u2019s co-founders participated in weekly conference calls during the run-up to the passage of Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s talking point that Americans could keep their \u201cchoice\u201d of doctors and insurance plans was a Herndon strategy, developed by the end of Obama\u2019s first 100 days in office. Herndon was in contact with then-Senator Obama during the 2008 campaign, discussing strategies to sell health care reform to demographic groups including \u201cMarginalized Middle Agers\u201d and \u201cMobile Materialists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Herndon Alliance was one of many broad stakeholder groups and coalitions \u2013 most notably Divided We Fail, which we led with partners like the Business Roundtable and NFIB \u2013 we worked with during the health reform process. These stakeholder groups frequently include organizations representing hospitals, physicians, employers, workers, consumers and health advocates,\u201d AARP spokesperson Allyson Funk told TheDC.\n\nAARP\u2019s heavy promotion of Obamacare, including creating the informational website HealthLawAnswers.org and holding informational events and health fairs, has alienated many seniors who hold membership in the organization.\n\n\u201cLove it or hate it, we want to make sure that people have the information they need to make informed decisions,\u201d Nicole Duritz, AARP Vice President for Health Education and Outreach, told TheDC.\n\nAARP began partnering with the left-wing California Endowment, a foundation with close ties to the Obama White House and liberal billionaire George Soros and the Obama White House, in mid-October to \u201craise awareness about Obamacare\u201d and \u201cget Californians to enroll in health coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there are some people who in those calls\u2026the opinions go both ways. So we\u2019re definitely reaching both sides,\u201d said a spokesperson for AARP California, referring to telephone town halls the group has conducted with members on Obamacare. The spokesperson added that \u201cthe targeting we\u2019re doing here in California is for the Hispanic population because they comprise 60 percent of the uninsured.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "AARP is generating criticism from many of its members for heavily promoting Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The retired persons advocacy group AARP partners with the organization that helped craft President Obama's \"you can keep your plan\" lie.
