Draughn sat out Sunday\u2019s practice with a cast encasing his left thumb, which he injured during Friday\u2019s scrimmage in Columbus.\n\nFollowing the workout, Browns running back coach Wilbert Montgomery expressed disappointment that none of his team\u2019s young backs seem willing to step forward and become Cleveland\u2019s lead back.\n\n\u201cNobody wants the role,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\nSince training camp opened, the Browns have lost Terrance West, last year\u2019s leading rusher, with a calf injury; rookie Duke Johnson is out with a hamstring issue; Glenn Winston has undergone knee surgery; and fullbacks Malcolm Johnson (shoulder) and Luke Lundy (concussion) have missed practice time.\n\nMedical issues aside, Montgomery, an old-school coach who gained nearly 7,000 yards during nine seasons in the NFL, is bothered that his backs didn\u2019t come to camp physically prepared for the grind of multiple practices.\n\n\u201cThe disappointing thing was that all those guys approaching here and not being in tip-top shape,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI think that was a total setback, and now they are climbing back uphill and that\u2019s why they\u2019re taking a back seat right now.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a running back, your job is to get hit and your job is being able to bounce back from injuries really quickly because it\u2019s most like playing a game every week.\n\n\u201cEach day you\u2019ve got to be healthy and ready to go and you\u2019ve got to play injured, you\u2019ve got to play sore and you\u2019ve got to play banged up. And if you can\u2019t play with those things there, you really can\u2019t play.\u201d\n\nBrowns coach Mike Pettine ruled out Johnson, a third-round pick, for Thursday\u2019s exhibition opener against Washington. Johnson has been sidelined since Aug. 1 and there is still no timetable for his return.\n\nJohnson is expected to have a major role in Cleveland\u2019s offense, and Montgomery said the former Miami star\u2019s versatility separates him from the Browns\u2019 other backs. However, while he\u2019s hurt, Johnson doesn\u2019t have a chance to showcase his talents.\n\nMontgomery believes Johnson can stay in step with the offense because he played in a similar system with the Hurricanes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just missing reps,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sitting in meetings all the time, taking notes, doing what we ask him to do, but Duke showed so much in the OTAs and the minicamp, and before his injury, he showed us the things that we wanted to see, so as long as he stays focused and stays into it, I think he\u2019s going to be OK because he had done a lot of things already\n\n\u201cThe running part of it, he\u2019s a running back. Put him on his track and tell him his keys, and he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\nMontgomery knows what it takes to be great, and he\u2019d like to see one of Cleveland\u2019s backs strive for stardom. At this point, none of the youngsters appears to have the inner drive or motivation to be the unquestioned starter - never mind the Browns\u2019 next Jim Brown or Leroy Kelly.\n\n\u201cHow can you play and not want to be a starter?\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cIt just bothers me that guys don\u2019t want to be the lead bell-cow guy. This game gives you so much. I always talk to them about what this game gives you as a young person, but what it does for them in life and to their families, so if you want to be a backup then be a backup, but I mean you\u2019re gonna get replaced.\n\n\u201cAt some point you\u2019ve got to be a starter if you want to hang around.\u201d\n\nMontgomery is looking forward to his backs getting healthy enough to practice in pads. Only then will he be able to figure out what he\u2019s got.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time evaluating guys when they\u2019re in their underwear,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to see them with the pads, that\u2019s when I really want out here in the next few weeks is to see if somebody is willing to pick up the flag.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Pettine has not ruled out WR Terrelle Pryor for Thursday\u2019s preseason opener. Pryor has been sidelined with a strained hamstring and will need to practice by Tuesday in order to play. \u2026 Rookie OL Cam Erving took some snaps with Cleveland\u2019s starting offense at left guard over John Greco. \u2026 Sunday\u2019s practice was essentially a half-speed walk-through and fans seemed bored by the lack of action. \u2026 Pro Bowl CB Joe Haden was back on the field after being held out of the Columbus scrimmage with muscle tightness.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Browns are searching for a feature running back, the one they can feed the ball to down after down.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Browns are searching for a feature running back, the one they can feed the ball to down after down.", "title": "Browns running backs still slowed by slew of injuries", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/9/browns-running-backs-still-slowed-by-slew-of-injur/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/9945cac767c878237e0f6a7067002020.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/9945cac767c878237e0f6a7067002020.jpg", "description": "The Browns are searching for a feature running back, the one they can feed the ball to down after down.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Browns running backs still slowed by slew of injuries"}, "Author": "TOM WITHERS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1ce\"", "article_summary": "Following the workout, Browns running back coach Wilbert Montgomery expressed disappointment that none of his team\u2019s young backs seem willing to step forward and become Cleveland\u2019s lead back.\nInjuries have ravaged Cleveland\u2019s offensive backs with Shaun Draughn, who has been making a strong push for a roster spot, the latest to get hurt.\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) - The Browns are searching for a feature running back, the one they can feed the ball to down after down.\nJohnson is expected to have a major role in Cleveland\u2019s offense, and Montgomery said the former Miami star\u2019s versatility separates him from the Browns\u2019 other backs.\n\u201cEach day you\u2019ve got to be healthy and ready to go and you\u2019ve got to play injured, you\u2019ve got to play sore and you\u2019ve got to play banged up."}
