Cruz and others spoke about the upcoming winter Olympics in Sochi and Russia's human rights record. AFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n4316120\n\nFor 48 hours now, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has been celebrated as a gutsy hero for walking out of a Christian gathering after some attendees booed his pro-Israel remarks. His comment, \u201cIf you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you,\u201d drew widespread attention and admiration.\n\nBut the episode was more complex, and only underscores how Cruz\u2019s approach to key issues is cynically calculated \u2013 or, at best, tone-deaf. He represents an existential threat to the future of the Republican Party.\n\nMembers of the GOP who\u2019ve been celebrating his rise because he stands up for conservative principles (or, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, because he\u2019s Hispanic) need to be very careful what they wish for. Should Cruz be nominated for president in 2016, he could devastate the party brand for decades.\n\nThe event where Cruz received his jeers was a gathering of mostly Middle Eastern Christians trying to build unity on a crucial issue \u2013 the persecution and murder of their co-religionists in the Levant. But the Senator\u2019s remarks overwhelmingly focused on his devotion to the State of Israel. Extravagantly, he declared that ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas are all equivalent manifestations of the \u201ccancer\u201d of religious bigotry. \u201cMurder is murder,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rise and growth of ISIS is probably the greatest moral challenge of our generation, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere. Its mode of operation displays a barbarism and brutality rare in world history, even among rogue nations and peoples. If every group is a cancer, then no group is a cancer \u2013 and right now Western civilization cannot afford to take its eye off the ball of stopping the worst of the worst.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter to the junior Senator from Texas, who was trying to appeal well beyond his immediate audience to the millions of Christian and Jewish voters who, like I do, strongly support the Jewish State. Few actions could be more glorious for an ambitious politician than storming off a stage in mock disgust as he champions a position that\u2019s popular within his party.\n\nThe boos condemned the Senator hijacking the assembly\u2019s agenda by calling attention to a pet issue of his. Politicians simply don\u2019t harp on capital punishment at anti-Obamacare rallies. If I were there, I might have booed, too.\n\nThis is hardly the first example of Ted Cruz\u2019s demagoguery. His 21-hour filibuster and other attempts to block resolution of the government shutdown and debt ceiling fight last year may have gained him sympathy on the far right, but they made Republicans look petulant and intransigent.\n\nHe has said, \u201cI would do anything, and I will continue to do anything I can, to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.\u201d Sorry, but \u201cby any means necessary\u201d was popularized by radical leftist Malcolm X and, most recently, the affirmative action nuts (and government-labeled terrorists) of \u201cBAMN.\u201d Decode those initials yourself.\n\nConservatives, by contrast, are usually willing to work within the system. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re quick to compromise our principles or positions. But Barry Goldwater\u2019s comment that \u201cextremism in the defense of liberty is no vice\u201d was about ideas, not methods.\n\nCruz doesn\u2019t hesitate to call out fellow Republicans \u2013 even beloved ones \u2013 in pursuit of public attention. A GOP senator attacking Hillary Clinton? Dog-bites-man. But Cruz criticizing Bob Dole for not standing up for conservative principles? Now, that\u2019s man-bites-dog.\n\nThe Republican Party stands at an exciting crossroads. We\u2019re poised to gain several seats in the Senate just two months from now, and (unlike two years ago) we\u2019re blessed with at least a half-dozen excellent potential candidates for the next presidential election. The country is exhausted by eight years of an inept president who did not match the high expectations of our Democratic friends. He didn\u2019t even match our own low expectations.\n\nPlease, Senator Cruz. If you want, I can get a thousand Republicans to call you every morning to tell you how great you are. We can arrange for dozens of gatherings to boo you so you can storm off the stage. But don\u2019t spoil our party\u2019s promising moment in the sun.\n\nDavid Benkof is a freelance writer living in St. Louis, and a frequent contributor to both the Daily Caller and the Times of Israel.
