Sam Brownback announced he intends to terminate state Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nKansas will be joining seven other states that have taken action to prevent the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider from receiving taxpayer dollars.\n\n\u201cEnsuring the health and safety of Kansans means protecting all Kansans at every stage of life,\u201d Brownback, a Republican, said Tuesday during his State of the State address.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s trafficking of baby body parts is antithetical to our belief in human dignity,\u201d he added.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been subject to increased national attention after a series of videos released last summer by the Center for Medical Progress that raise questions about how the organization disposes of the tissue of aborted babies.\n\nThough the ensuing controversy inspired a number of state and federal congressional investigations, the abortion giant has dismissed the accusations as a \u201csmear campaign\u201d and has denied illegal activity.\n\nReminding viewers he signed legislation in 2011 that stopped \u201cmost taxpayer funding from going to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Brownback stated, \u201cThe time has come to finish the job.\u201d\n\nBrownback directed Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) Secretary Susan Mosier to prevent state funding of the abortion giant and said he would \u201cwelcome legislation that would enshrine this directive into state law.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released after the address, Mosier detailed the initial process the department is taking to end its relationship with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.\n\n\u201cKDHE will issue an intent to terminate letter. This letter will initiate the process to formally terminate Planned Parenthood as a KanCare provider,\u201d Mosier said in the statement.\n\nResponding to the governor\u2019s speech, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri released a statement saying the action limits health care options for low-income Kansans and will lead to a costly legal battle.\n\n\u201cKansans and their health care providers are not Mr. Brownback\u2019s punching bag and we will fight back,\u201d Laura McQuade, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThe medical needs of Kansas women will continue to be met by providers in the Medicaid and KanCare network,\u201d Kansas Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is attempting to mislead and frighten women into believing their health care services will suffer. This is not true.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s directive would free \u201cmoney for more widely available and more comprehensive low-cost health care options for women and families in Kansas,\u201d Casey Mattox, senior counsel at legal defense nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNot one more penny should go to Planned Parenthood, a scandal-plagued abortion business that does not provide comprehensive health care services for women,\u201d Mattox added.\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst in the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, argues that Congress should redirect federal funds away from Planned Parenthood and towards alternative health care options.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers should not be forced to fund the largest abortion provider in America, especially after videos suggesting it harvests and sells the body parts of children it aborts,\u201d Torre said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama vetoed legislation last week that would have defunded Planned Parenthood.\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not reply to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kansas will be joining seven other states that have taken action to prevent the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider from receiving taxpayer dollars.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Kansas will be joining seven other states that have taken action to prevent the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider from receiving taxpayer dollars.", "title": "Kansas Governor to End State Planned Parenthood Funding", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160114_KansasPP_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-15T15:55:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Pe2y3C"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Kansas will be joining seven other states that have taken action to prevent the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider from receiving taxpayer dollars.", "title": "Kansas Governor to End State Planned Parenthood Funding", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160114_KansasPP_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-01-15T11:47:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T15:55:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Kansas, pro-life, Sam Brownback, abortion, trafficking, governor, Medicaid, funding, defund"}, "article_summary": "Sam Brownback announced he intends to terminate state Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood.\nThis letter will initiate the process to formally terminate Planned Parenthood as a KanCare provider,\u201d Mosier said in the statement.\n\u201cThe medical needs of Kansas women will continue to be met by providers in the Medicaid and KanCare network,\u201d Kansas Lt.
