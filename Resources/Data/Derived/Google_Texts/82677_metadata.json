I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nUntil now, insurers were reluctant to sell coverage to prostitutes because their job puts them at increased risk for costly, incurable and even life-threatening STDs. Meanwhile, brothels are not required to provide insurance for them because prostitutes are considered independent contractors under Nevada law.\n\nBut now, insurance companies cannot say no \u2013 and as long as a prostitute makes less than four times the federal poverty limit, she will be eligible for taxpayer-funded subsidies to help cover the cost of her premiums, which are likely to be high given her dangerous work.\n\nProstitute \u201cCaressa Kisses\u201d said she feels unfairly judged by insurance companies. \u201cThey equate us to illegal working girls who have very high STD's and AIDS rates which we have none of the above. We're legal, licensed prostitutes,\u201d Kisses told KRNV-TV.\n\nAlthough condom use is mandated by state law during intercourse and oral sex acts with prostitutes, prostitutes in Nevada must still be tested weekly for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and monthly for HIV and syphilis.\n\nBut according to the Centers for Disease Control, rapid tests for HIV have a high false negative rate and should be repeated after three months to be considered reliable. During those three months, the CDC recommends abstinence or \u201cmutual monogamy\u201d with a trusted partner \u2013 difficult advice to follow when having sex with strangers is your job.\n\nUltimately, though, the required tests are designed to protect clients, not prostitutes, from infection. Clients are never tested at all, which means in between tests, the prostitutes are repeatedly exposing themselves to possible sources of infection. Additionally, the state does not require prostitutes to be tested for herpes or HPV, which can lead to several forms of cancer.\n\nLaurence Vance, a policy adviser at the free-market think tank Future of Freedom Foundation, told LifeSiteNews that he believes forcing insurers to offer coverage to people who gamble with their health for a living is wrong, and forcing taxpayers to foot the bill is even worse.\n\n\u201cNot only should insurance companies not be forced to enroll sex workers, they should not be forced to enroll anyone they don\u2019t want to enroll for any reason,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThe real problem with the various Obamacare mandates, regulations, and reforms has nothing to with medical care or health insurance. The problem is simply one of unauthorized, unlawful, unconstitutional intervention by the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal government has no authority whatsoever to tell insurance companies whom they must enroll or what their polices should be regarding pre-existing medical conditions, annual and lifetime caps on benefits, and co-payments and deductibles,\u201d Vance continued. \u201cLikewise, the federal government has no authority whatsoever to tell employers what benefits they must offer, what the benefits must include, the minimum requirements of the benefits, the maximum amount they can charge employees for a particular benefit, or what constitutes a full-time employee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs concerning individuals,\u201d Vance added, \u201cthe federal government not only has no authority whatsoever to require anyone to purchase a product or service; it has no authority to force some Americans to pay for the health insurance or medical care of other Americans. No American has a right to the resources of another American, no matter how low his income or his \u2018need\u2019 for medical services.\u201d\n\nThe dangerous risks of sex work, even with mandatory condom use and frequent routine testing, have made headlines recently in Los Angeles, where the adult film industry was temporarily shut down after an outbreak of HIV earlier this year and a syphilis outbreak in 2012.\n\nFormer porn actress Vanessa Belmond told a British documentary crew last month that all the testing just gives sex workers a false sense of safety.\n\n\u201cI had gonorrhea. I had bacterial infections a lot, and the testing, I thought, was keeping me safe, because they make it sound like everyone is tested,\u201d Belmont said. \u201cThe thing is, you only test once a month, and all through that month they still have a \u2018clean\u2019 test, but they might have gotten something in the meantime.\u201d\n\nMichelle Savoy, a former Bunny Ranch prostitute, spoke to journalist Crystelle Rife in 2011 about the risks of her profession and the false sense of security the rules provided her.\n\n\u201cI felt like I walked around with a false confidence that nothing would ever happen to me,\u201d said Savoy. \u201cThere were times when I could have caught something. They don\u2019t explain the rules of safe sex to you. You have to figure it out yourself. There is a Bunny Bible but it is not mandatory to read it. You will not get fired for not using a condom. Once the doors are closed who knows what girls are doing?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "The prostitutes at Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch brothel say Obamacare is", "title": "Nevada prostitutes praise Obamacare: law will force insurers to cover them regardless of risk", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/shutterstock/shutterstock_61902901.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/nevada-prostitutes-praise-obamacare-law-will-force-insurers-to-cover-them-r", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "The prostitutes at Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch brothel say Obamacare is"}, "description": "The prostitutes at Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch brothel say Obamacare is", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f50\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe real problem with the various Obamacare mandates, regulations, and reforms has nothing to with medical care or health insurance.\n\u201cHaving this profession, we aren\u2019t exactly offered group health insurance,\u201d prostitute Taylor Lee told KRNV-TV.\nMeanwhile, brothels are not required to provide insurance for them because prostitutes are considered independent contractors under Nevada law.\nAlthough condom use is mandated by state law during intercourse and oral sex acts with prostitutes, prostitutes in Nevada must still be tested weekly for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and monthly for HIV and syphilis.\nI\u2019m excited.\u201dUntil now, insurers were reluctant to sell coverage to prostitutes because their job puts them at increased risk for costly, incurable and even life-threatening STDs."}
