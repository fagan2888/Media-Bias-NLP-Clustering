Fallon\n\nPro Tip: If you are going to misrepresent a journalist\u2019s own reporting, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to do it on a webcast that she is moderating.\n\nThe conservative Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon is one of the architects of a lawsuit called King v. Burwell, which seeks to defund much of the Affordable Care Act by cutting off tax credits in many states that help people pay for their health insurance. On Thursday, Cannon participated in a web debate hosted by the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation, where he cited reporting by former NPR reporter Julie Rovner that, he claims, supports his understanding of the law.\n\nCannon\u2019s interpretation of Rovner\u2019s reporting, however, did not sit well with the moderator of the debate, former NPR reporter Julie Rovner. After Cannon attempted to use Rovner\u2019s reporting in support of his argument, Rovner, who now reports on health policy for Kaiser Health News, produced a copy of the article Cannon cited and read it aloud to him in order to prove that it does not actually support his claims.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gives states a choice to either set up health exchanges where their residents can buy subsidized health plans or allow the federal government to set up such an exchange for them. Cannon claims, however, that tax credits are only available in states that elected to set up their own exchange. Should a majority of the Supreme Court agree with him in King, 13 million or more people in states with federally-run exchanges could lose their health insurance.\n\nDuring the web debate, Cannon cited several pieces of evidence which, he claims, support his view that Congress intended to make tax credits unavailable in states with federally-run exchanges, including a letter signed by 11 Democratic members of Congress which raised some concerns about how the Affordable Care Act was designed. Cannon also cited a report Rovner filed in 2010 as alleged evidence that this letter supports his reading of the Affordable Care Act. According to Cannon, \u201cour own moderator Julie Rovner reported on those concerns, that House Democrats expressed with the [Affordable Care Act] that if the states didn\u2019t bother to create an exchange their residents would have no way to benefit from the new law.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the letter from the 11 Democrats (which can be read in its entirety here) is completely silent on the subject of whether tax credits are available in all 50 states under the bill that actually became law. Rather, it concerned an irrelevant dispute between the House and the Senate regarding whether the law would create one national exchange that covered people in every state, or 50 different state-based exchanges for 50 different states. The 11 Democrats preferred the former approach because they feared that the alternative \u201crelies on states with indifferent state leadership that are unwilling or unable to administer and properly regulate a health insurance marketplace.\u201d In essence, their concern was that the Senate bill potentially placed implementation of the Obamacare in the hands of state officials who did not support Obamacare, and that these state officials might operate exchanges in a way that thwarted the law\u2019s goal of providing health care to millions of Americans.\n\nRovner\u2019s report on this letter (which can be read in its entirety here) does include one line which, if read out of context, might support Cannon\u2019s interpretation of the law. Her report closes by stating that the 11 Democrats \u201cworry that because leaders in their state oppose the health bill, they won\u2019t bother to create an exchange, leaving uninsured state residents with no way to benefit from the new law.\u201d After Cannon finished his presentation, however, Rovner clarified what she did \u2014 and what she did not \u2014 report. \u201cWhile that Texas letter did express concern about people not getting any benefits, they weren\u2019t talking about subsidies,\u201d Rovner explained.\n\nContrary to Cannon\u2019s claim that the benefits of the Affordable Care Act hinge upon whether a state sets up its own exchange, Rovner noted that \u201cin fact, the paragraph immediately prior\u201d to the portion of her reporting that Cannon relies upon cuts against his argument. In that paragraph, Rovner quoted law professor and health policy expert Tim Jost saying that federally-run exchanges will provide a backstop against recalcitrant states \u2014 \u201cif the state fails to do it, then the federal government is supposed to step in.\u201d (The 11 Democrats agree with Jost\u2019s reading of the Senate bill in their letter, which states that \u201c[i]f the state does not set up the exchange, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to set up an exchange for the state.\u201d)\n\nNevertheless, Cannon continued to insist upon his own interpretation of Rovner\u2019s report even after Rovner herself accused him of mischaracterizing her reporting. According to Cannon there is \u201cno other plausible reading\u201d of Rovner\u2019s own reporting than the reading Cannon preferred.\n\n(It should be noted that, even if Cannon\u2019s reading of Rovner\u2019s reporting were accurate, that still does not prove that the letter itself actually says what Cannon says that it says. To the contrary, it would only prove that Rovner might have misread the letter. Once again, the full text of the letter is available at this link so that our readers can independently verify what it says.)\n\nTowards the end of the web debate, when Rovner and her co-panelists began to take questions from people who called into the webcast, a staffer from an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act brought the dispute between Rovner and Cannon up again. Noting that Cannon has, in the past, retracted some of his claims about the Affordable Care Act after they were proven untrue, the caller asked whether Cannon would also retract his claim about Rovner\u2019s reporting now that Rovner herself repudiated Cannon\u2019s interpretation. \u201cI know that, for some reason, you take your interpretation of her own work over hers,\u201d the caller asked, \u201cbut I wonder if, with some reflection, you\u2019ll decide that you should actually formally withdraw\u201d the claim that Rovner\u2019s reporting supports the plaintiffs\u2019 view in King.\n\nCannon, however, was still unmoved. \u201cIf you can convince me that Julie\u2019s interpretation of her own story is not contradicted by her own story, then I\u2019ll be happy to make the change that you suggest.\u201d Nevertheless, Cannon claimed, \u201cno one has been able to do that, not even Julie herself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Pro Tip: If you are going to misrepresent a journalist's own reporting, it's probably not a good idea to do it on a webcast that she is moderating.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Pro Tip: If you are going to misrepresent a journalist's own reporting, it's probably not a good idea to do it on a webcast that she is moderating.", "title": "Top Obamacare Opponent Mansplains Health Reform To Reporter, Gets His Butt Handed To Him", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/02/06/3620030/top-obamacare-opponent-mansplains-health-reform-reporter-gets-butt-handed/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tea-Party-Flag-e1417627990195.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pro Tip: If you are going to misrepresent a journalist's own reporting, it's probably not a good idea to do it on a webcast that she is moderating.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tea-Party-Flag-e1417627990195-320x213.jpg", "title": "Top Obamacare Opponent Mansplains Health Reform To Reporter, Gets His Butt Handed To Him", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tea-Party-Flag-e1417627990195.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tea-Party-Flag-e1417627990195.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-06T09:48:36+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8792\"", "article_summary": "Cannon\u2019s interpretation of Rovner\u2019s reporting, however, did not sit well with the moderator of the debate, former NPR reporter Julie Rovner.\nCannon also cited a report Rovner filed in 2010 as alleged evidence that this letter supports his reading of the Affordable Care Act.\nJustice Top Obamacare Opponent Mansplains Health Reform To Reporter, Gets His Butt Handed To Him CREDIT: AP Photo/Patrick T.
