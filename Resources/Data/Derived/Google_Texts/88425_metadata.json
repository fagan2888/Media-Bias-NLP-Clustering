( Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nThis is exactly why we all love sports.\n\nBecause every once in a while, a story unfolds that's too good to be true.\n\nAll season, the Loveland football team had a dream of making it to the state championship. But after a 2-4 start, that goal seemed a little too far-fetched.\n\nIt isn't now.\n\nThe dream became a reality Saturday when the 13th-seeded Indians put an end to top-seeded Pine Creek's 37-game win streak with a shocking 26-14 victory in the 4A state semifinals at a frozen Patterson Stadium.\n\nThe Indians (8-5) advance to face Longs Peak rival and third-seeded Windsor (12-1) next Saturday at Sports Authority Field at Mile High (11 a.m. Altitude2). It's Loveland's first state title game appearance since falling to Wheat Ridge in 2006.\n\nSaturday's stunning upset \u2014 the Indians' third straight win over a top-five team in the postseason \u2014 left many LHS players speechless, and it was enough to drive coach Wayne McGinn to tears.\n\n\"I'm just so happy I'm crying,\" said McGinn, who's in his third year as the LHS head coach after replacing the legendary John Poovey in 2013. \"I'm so happy for these kids. I had a good feeling this could happen today even though we were playing a great team. Number 37 was my number in college, so I knew that was a lucky number for me. They won 37 in a row, so I knew we had a good chance.\"\n\nAfter trailing 14-6 at halftime, LHS scored 20 unanswered points in the second half to end Pine Creek's bid for a third straight title. The Eagles' 37-game win streak now goes in the books tied with Palisade (1994-96) for the eighth-longest in state history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Indians scored all three of their second-half touchdowns from in close. First, it was Charles Dunkelman from 3 yards out, followed by an Ayden Eberhardt-to-Calvin Kelley 2-point conversion to tie it at 14 midway through the third quarter.\n\nThen Eberhardt sneaked it in twice in the fourth quarter, both times from the 1. The first came on the heels of a 25-yard run by Dunkelman, giving the Indians a 20-14 lead with 8:06 to play. The second was set up by another chunk play by a Dunkleman, this time a 26-yard catch and run, to make it 26-14 with 1:57 to go.\n\nA sack by Zach Swartwout on the first play of the ensuing PCHS series set the Eagles back before an interception by Kelley iced it in the closing moments.\n\nKelley's interception was the second pick by LHS following one late in the third by Kaden Morin, setting up what proved to be the go-ahead score.\n\nThe Indians were plus-three in the turnover battle thanks to recovering a pair of Pine Creek (12-1) botched snaps, including one on the Eagles' first series that was scooped up by Ryan Svendsen and returned 55 yards for a touchdown to give the hosts a quick 6-0 lead.\n\n\"They fumbled the snap, I got back in the backfield, got a hit by Dane (Abila) on that quarterback that got me a chance to get the ball, and I was just able to return it with some blockers,\" Svendsen said. \"That's big against a No. 1 team in the state like that. They're a great team.\n\nCalvin Kelley's pregame speech before Loveland's upset over Pine Creek #copreps pic.twitter.com/iqZNhfhSmd \u2014 Sean Star (@seanvstar) November 28, 2015\n\n\"This is amazing. I don't even know what to say. I'm still waiting for it to kick in.\"\n\nThe mostly snow-covered field made for some seriously sloppy conditions, providing a bit of an equalizer. And if that weren't enough to even things out, the two-time defending champs were dealt a huge blow when PCHS playmaker JoJo Domann suffered a shoulder injury on the fumble recovery by Svendsen.\n\nThe Nebraska-bound athlete did not return to the game. His brother, quarterback Brock Domann, helped guide the Eagles to a 14-6 lead, but the offense wasn't nearly as potent without one of its best players as PCHS was held to 14 points fewer than its previous season low and to just 169 yards of offense.\n\nThe LHS offense wasn't significantly better, totalling 185 yards. But the Indians were able to move the ball when it mattered most, putting together second-half scoring drives of eight, 11, and 10 plays on the backs of Eberhardt and Dunkelman, who had 80 total yards on 14 touches (11 carries and three catches).\n\n\"I'm just speechless,\" Dunkelman said. \"I don't know what to say. I'm just thankful for my team for how we performed on those fourth-quarter drives.\"\n\nEberhardt finished with just over 100 total yards, half of what he averages, as he was constantly pressured and was sacked eight times.\n\nMore importantly, he converted both times at the goal line when his number was called \u2014 not easy against a defense that came in allowing just more than a touchdown per game.\n\nNow, it's off to the championship game for LHS, an improbable destination for a once-struggling Indians team that credits its crosstown rival for the turnaround.\n\n\"You always have in the back of your mind, like, 'Hey, we're winning state. I know we are,'\" Eberhardt said. \"Being 2-4, that's when the confidence went down a little bit, but coming out and winning the Thompson Valley game by as many as we did really gave us confidence. I think that game gave us the confidence throughout the rest of the season.\"\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar\n\n4A State Semifinals\n\nIndians 26, Eagles 14\n\nAt Patterson Stadium\n\n7 7 0 0 \u2014 146 0 8 12 \u2014 26\n\nFirst quarter\n\nLHS \u2014 Ryan Svendsen 55 fumble return (kick failed), 8:52.
