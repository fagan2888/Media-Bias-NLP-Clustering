For the past 30 years, the Vietnam veteran has frequented McDonald\u2019s for his meals, but for not just any order. Only the infamous Big Mac satisfies Rosenlof\u2019s appetite.\n\n\"My first meal of the day is always at about 10:30, when they open up the Big Macs,\" Rosenlof explained to ABC News. \"I enjoy what I eat. It tastes good, so I order the same thing every day.\"\n\nThe electrical appliance salesman does make room on Sundays for his wife\u2019s cooking, but the rest of the week is \u201ctwo all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.\u201d According to the self-proclaimed Big Mac-aholic\u2019s estimates, Rosenlof has eaten over 12,000 Big Macs in his lifetime.\n\n\"Mondays I always eat a Big Mac, two on Tuesdays, one on Wednesdays, two on Thursdays, one or two on Fridays, and two every Saturday,\" Rosenlof told ABC News. \"It has all the major food groups in it. I'm not sure what's in the special sauce, but you put them all together and it makes a fantastic sandwich.\"\n\nAlthough Rosenlof claims that he is perfectly healthy, nutritionists and healthcare professionals don\u2019t recommend his specialized diet. \"What's missing from his diet it seems are vitamins, minerals, fiber,\" said Dave Zinczenko, ABC News nutrition and wellness editor. \"The good news is he's keeping his calories in check, 700 fewer calories than the average American man brings in.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dennis, rosenfol, big, mac, mcdonald's", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dennis Rosenlof enjoys a very specific diet that revolves solely around McDonald's Big Macs.", "title": "Man Eats Big Macs For Breakfast, Lunch, And Dinner", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dennis-rosenlof-eats-big-macs-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner-256739", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/mcdonalds-big-mac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dennis Rosenlof enjoys a very specific diet that revolves solely around McDonald's Big Macs.", "title": "Man Eats Big Macs For Breakfast, Lunch, And Dinner", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dennis-rosenlof-eats-big-macs-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner-256739", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/mcdonalds-big-mac.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/mcdonalds-big-mac.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-13T16:40:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T16:40:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dennis Rosenlof enjoys a very specific diet that revolves solely around McDonald's Big Macs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33ec\"", "article_summary": "\"My first meal of the day is always at about 10:30, when they open up the Big Macs,\" Rosenlof explained to ABC News.\nOnly the infamous Big Mac satisfies Rosenlof\u2019s appetite.\nI'm not sure what's in the special sauce, but you put them all together and it makes a fantastic sandwich.\"\n\"Mondays I always eat a Big Mac, two on Tuesdays, one on Wednesdays, two on Thursdays, one or two on Fridays, and two every Saturday,\" Rosenlof told ABC News.\nFor the past 30 years, the Vietnam veteran has frequented McDonald\u2019s for his meals, but for not just any order."}
