Hagan slams the Koch brothers\n\nVulnerable Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan shrugged off the massive amounts of money being spent in her race by a group backed by the Koch brothers, saying her state\u2019s residents will stop them from trying to \u201cbuy\u201d her seat in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe people in North Carolina are not going to let the billionaire Koch brothers buy this seat,\u201d Hagan said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d on Wednesday night.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPOLITICO reported Wednesday that the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity has already spend $8.2 million against Hagan\u2019s reelection in her state.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Koch brothers bombard vulnerable Senate Democrat Kay Hagan)\n\nBut Hagan said Wednesday that the priorities of the group are not aligned with the needs of her constituents and they won\u2019t be \u201cfooled.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy state, as you said, is being flooded with millions of dollars, funded by outside interest groups,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cThey\u2019ve opposed the bipartisan farm bill that is extremely important to the agricultural sector in my state. They opposed the bipartisan budget bill that turned off sequestration. At the same time, they\u2019ve gotten tax cuts for the wealthy and put that burden on 80 percent of the middle-class families, increasing their taxes. These are not policies that North Carolinians want, and they\u2019re not going to be fooled by this outside money.\u201d\n\nA key part of the barrage against Hagan and other Democratic senators that Republicans perceive as vulnerable in 2014 is tying them to Obamacare, something Hagan defended.\n\n\u201cThe people in North Carolina have the fifth-highest signup on the exchanges, after Florida, New York, California and Texas, it\u2019s North Carolina, so they\u2019re very interested in this,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cWe want to show that the Affordable Care Act is something whose time has come. It\u2019s going to really change how the cost of health care will not have these huge increases that we\u2019ve been seeing every year.\u201d\n\nHagan also referenced the \u201cwar on women\u201d theme pushed by Democrats.\n\n\u201cYou know what my opponents want to do? They want to personally get involved in the health care decisions, especially of women,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cEvery one of my opponents to date has said that the state has the authority to ban contraception. I can guarantee you, that\u2019s what women will not want to have to hear.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She says North Carolina residents will stop them from trying to \u201cbuy\u201d her seat in the Senate.", "title": "Hagan slams the Koch brothers", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/kay-hagan-koch-brothers-north-carolina-2014-103478.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/09/120906_hagan_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Kay Hagan,Koch Brothers", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She says North Carolina residents will stop them from trying to \u201cbuy\u201d her seat in the Senate.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7fb\"", "article_summary": "Hagan slams the Koch brothersVulnerable Democratic Sen.
