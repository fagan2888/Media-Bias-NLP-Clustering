Instead, they are required to consult with a health practitioner \u2013- doctor, naturopath or credentialed school nurse \u2013- before they\u2019re allowed to obtain what\u2019s known as a \u201cpersonal-belief exemption\u201d from their child\u2019s required immunizations.\n\nNowhere is the impact of the law more anticipated than in Nevada County, a former gold mining haven in the Sierra foothills, northeast of Sacramento. The county had the highest opt-out rate in the state for many years and is now a close second to sparsely populated Trinity County. Here, 20 percent of kindergartners have a personal belief exemption on file.\n\nPublic Charter Schools Have Highest Opt-Out Rates\n\nThat exemption rate is driven by huge percentages of vaccination opt-outs at public charter schools in the county, led by Yuba River Charter School in Nevada City. In the current school year, 81 percent of kindergarteners at the school received personal-belief exemptions.\n\nCaleb Buckley, director of the Yuba River Charter School, said many students\u2019 parents steer clear of Western medicine and, by association, its core tenet that immunizations save lives. \u201cI don\u2019t know too many that go to see the local pediatrician group, unless they really have to,\u201d Buckley said.\n\nAs Trevor Michael, president of the Nevada County Board of Education, explained, \u201cOur county is rural. People live alternative lifestyles and have alternative beliefs.\u201d\n\nAt Grass Valley Unified, Ettl hears parents state that it is better for a child\u2019s immune system to get the disease than the vaccination, and that polio is pass\u00e9. And even though a research paper alleging a link between vaccinations and autism was retracted, deemed a fraud by the British Medical Journal and its author stripped of his medical license, they say they\u2019re still not sure that a vaccination won\u2019t give their child autism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t argue with them,\u201d Ettl said. In the past, when she has refuted their claims, \u201cThey get mad and head right to Holly,\u201d she said, referring to Holly Hermansen, superintendent of the Nevada County Office of Education.\n\n[Related: More California Parents Opt-Out of Vaccines \u2014 Look Up Your School Online]\n\nAt some charter schools in the county, a philosophical opposition to vaccinations has become a defining feature of the culture, said Sharyn Turner, coordinator of school health services at the Nevada County Office of Education.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden it becomes socially unacceptable to be one of the few parents immunizing your child,\u201d Turner said.\n\nPublic charter schools lead the state in enrolling the highest percentage of kindergarteners with personal-belief exemptions \u2013 10.1 percent in 2013-14, according to new data from the California Department of Public Health. At private schools, 5.6 percent of kindergarteners received personal-belief exemptions, while 2.3 percent opted out at public schools.\n\nThose high rates are driving an overall increase in personal belief exemptions statewide. The percentage of exempted kindergarteners more than doubled, from 1.4 percent in 2007 to 3.1 percent in 2013-14, according to the state Department of Public Health.\n\nFading Awareness of Dire Infectious Diseases\n\nIf roughly 90 percent of a population is fully vaccinated, \u201cherd immunity\u201d helps keep at bay infectious diseases including measles, pertussis or rubella. But with longstanding herd immunity comes fading awareness of dire infectious diseases. \u201cThere\u2019s no fear,\u201d said Lindsay Dunckel, executive director of First 5 Nevada County, which funds community programs for babies and young children. \u201cThese diseases that were once so frightening have disappeared.\u201d\n\nNow some of them are coming back, and the role of unvaccinated people in spreading disease is under scrutiny. In 159 cases of measles across the country last year, 82 percent of those infected were unvaccinated and of those, 79 percent had philosophical objections to vaccinations, according to the CDC.\n\nSo far in 2014, the California Department of Public Health has received reports of 51 cases of measles in the state, the largest number since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. In the decade before the introduction of a measles vaccine in 1963, the disease killed about 450 people a year in the U.S., according to the CDC.\n\nAlso increasing in California is the number of cases of pertussis, better known as whooping cough. Reported cases in 2013 hit more than 2,300, including an infant who contracted the disease at 4 weeks old and died. During a 2010 California outbreak of pertussis, in which 10 infants died and more than 9,000 cases were reported, children with personal-belief exemptions played a role in transmitting the disease. Communities with high rates of personal-belief exemptions were 2.5 times more likely to also have pertussis clusters.\n\nCan the New Law Help Raise Vaccine Rates?\n\nAt Grass Valley Unified, Ettl met recently with a parent of an incoming kindergartener who was dead-set against immunizations. The meeting was perfunctory: The parent read the vaccination information sheet, and Ettl explained that an unvaccinated child may not attend school for 21 days if an outbreak of whooping cough or measles occurs. Then Ettl and the parent signed the new personal belief exemption form.\n\nEttl\u2019s hopes, and the hopes of public health officials, rest largely with parents whose opposition to vaccination is not entirely locked in. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll ask, \u2018Are you against every vaccine or some of them?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nOne mother of a kindergartener recently told Ettl that although her child had received one vaccination, she was now inclined to opt out of the rest. Ettl talked to her about the risk of tetanus, a bacterial infection that can be contracted through a wound or animal bite. \u201cWe live in a rural place and tetanus is a serious disease,\u201d Ettl recalled telling her. \u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you start with one?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe mother left without a personal belief exemption in hand, saying she would think about it.\n\nThat\u2019s just what the law is intended to do. The state of Washington passed a similar law in 2011 and its opt-out rate has dropped about 40 percent.\n\n\u201cSome parents are never going to change their mind,\u201d said Catherine Flores Martin, director of the California Immunization Coalition, \u201cbut there is a larger number that want to have their vaccine concerns acknowledged and answered.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parents must now meet with health provider before opting-out of vaccines, providing opening for education.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"School Nurses on Front Lines to Raise Vaccine Rates\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/04\\/07\\/under-new-law-california-school-nurses-on-front-lines-to-raise-vaccine-rates\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-07 12:05:17\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-04-08 14:27:35\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18562,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Science\",\"Vaccines\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/04\\/SchoolnurseGrassVallNo2March2014JA-e1396892054106.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Parents must now meet with health provider before opting-out of vaccines, providing opening for education.", "title": "School Nurses on Front Lines to Raise Vaccine Rates", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/04/07/under-new-law-california-school-nurses-on-front-lines-to-raise-vaccine-rates/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/04/SchoolnurseGrassVallNo2March2014JA-640x426.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science,vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As Trevor Michael, president of the Nevada County Board of Education, explained, \u201cOur county is rural.\nNowhere is the impact of the law more anticipated than in Nevada County, a former gold mining haven in the Sierra foothills, northeast of Sacramento.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fear,\u201d said Lindsay Dunckel, executive director of First 5 Nevada County, which funds community programs for babies and young children.\nIn the current school year, 81 percent of kindergarteners at the school received personal-belief exemptions.\nIn the past, when she has refuted their claims, \u201cThey get mad and head right to Holly,\u201d she said, referring to Holly Hermansen, superintendent of the Nevada County Office of Education."}
