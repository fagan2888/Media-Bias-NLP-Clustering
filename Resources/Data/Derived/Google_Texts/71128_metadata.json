A federal judge ruled this month that the administration overstepped its authority by making the payments without an appropriation from Congress, though the ruling will be appealed.\n\nAccording to Fisher, IRS officials questioned whether the healthcare reform law provided a \"permanent appropriation\" for the payments. The text of the law clearly provides one for ObamaCare\u2019s tax credits, which help people pay insurance premiums, but does not specifically provide one for the cost-sharing reduction payments, which help people afford their deductibles.\n\nThe administration went on to argue that the same authority that provides for the tax credits also covers the cost-sharing reductions because the structure of the law links the two \u201cinextricably.\u201d\n\nBut in early 2014, the IRS, which is responsible for distributing the payments, pointed out the lack of an explicit appropriation for the cost-sharing reduction.\n\n\u201cMy understanding, through the accounting folks, is that the IRS had raised some concerns and was looking for, whether it was a legal analysis or something more authoritative that would provide confidence that these payments were, in fact, authorized out of the permanent appropriation,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nFisher said the IRS requested a meeting with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to get its perspective on the legality of making the payments.\n\nThat meeting occurred on Jan. 13, 2014, at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across from the White House, Fisher said, with officials from the OMB and the IRS.\n\nThe IRS officials received a memo written by OMB attorney Sam Berger that laid out a legal justification for making the payments, Fisher said. He added that the IRS officials were told not to take notes and were not allowed to keep copies of the memo at the end of the meeting, an arrangement Fisher called \u201ca little unusual.\u201d\n\nFisher recalled the memo as \u201ca lengthy, sort of, list of small justifications of individual things trying to identify why the administration believed that it was Congress's intent to have the payments for both the [tax credits] and the cost-sharing reduction payment being made in the same manner.\u201d\n\nAfter that meeting, Fisher said, not many IRS officials were worried about the legality of the payments.\n\nBut Fisher said he still had concerns, as did Gregory Kane, the IRS deputy chief financial officer.\n\n\u201cMr. Kane, I think, had some reservations still, even after, you know, reading the memo and going to the meeting,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI don't believe there was as much concern with most of the other folks.\u201d\n\nAbout a week after the meeting with the OMB, Fisher said, IRS senior staffers met with Commissioner John Koskinen to get his take on the legality of the payments before they went forward.\n\nKoskinen mentioned a memo, approved by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew Jack LewIRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says Overnight Finance: GOP makes its case for impeaching IRS chief | Clinton hits Trump over housing crash remarks | Ryan's big Puerto Rico win The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE and the Justice Department, that deemed the payments appropriate, Fisher said.\n\n\u201cAnd so there was a very strong consensus of the people who had been in the loop on this at, you know, fairly senior positions in government that these payments were appropriate,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nFisher said he voiced his doubts to Koskinen about the legality of the payments. Koskinen listened and thanked Fisher for expressing his opinion, according to Fisher.\n\n\u201cGiven the strong consensus to support that perspective that was presented to the Commissioner, I was certainly not surprised that he supported that with this level of senior advice given to him as, you know, what should we go do,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cHe made the choice that I bet you 99 out of 100 people would have made. It's just one that I happen to disagree with, in terms of my understanding of both appropriation law and my reading of the statute.\u201d\n\nFisher pointed to the fact that ObamaCare lays out no permanent appropriation specifically for the cost-sharing reductions, despite arguments about the law's overall structure.\n\nThe cost-sharing reduction payments, estimated at $130 billion over the next 10 years, help low-income enrollees pay the deductibles in health insurance plans purchased through ObamaCare.\n\nDemocrats argue that Republicans\u2019 lawsuit over the payments and the investigation by the Ways and Means panel are just political attacks on the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMore than 20 million Americans have health coverage today that didn\u2019t previously thanks to the health reform law, yet the Republicans are doing everything in their power to take that away,\u201d Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said at a markup Tuesday during which the panel voted to release the transcript of Fisher\u2019s deposition.\n\nDemocrats on the committee released the full transcript of the deposition online after Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin BradyIRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says Report: Pacific trade pact would boost growth, jobs and incomes Puerto Rico debt becomes constitutional fight on the right MORE (R-Texas) said Tuesday that he did not plan to release it in electronic form.\n\nOver 10 current and former government officials have been voluntarily interviewed as part of the committee\u2019s investigation into the cost-sharing reductions since the beginning of the year, according to a committee Democratic aide. Fisher testified after the committee subpoenaed him.\n\nRepublicans on the panel are preparing a report about the payments. Brady said that the investigation has been met with \u201cunprecedented resistance\u201d from the administration.\n\nDemocrats counter that the investigation is unnecessary, given that the matter is already the subject of a lawsuit in which both sides have agreed that the facts are not in dispute.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "David Fisher said most IRS officials were reassured after a meeting at the White House.", "description": "David Fisher said most IRS officials were reassured after a meeting at the White House.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "David Fisher said most IRS officials were reassured after a meeting at the White House.", "title": "IRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/281195-irs-doubted-legality-of-obamacare-payments-former-official-says", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/irs_080515getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-25T14:56:10-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-25T14:56-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/281195-irs-doubted-legality-of-obamacare-payments-former-official-says", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-25T10:31-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Kevin Brady, Jack Lew,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-25T10:31:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T14:56:10-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/281195-irs-doubted-legality-of-obamacare-payments-former-official-says", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "David Fisher said most IRS officials were reassured after a meeting at the White House.", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says"}, "dcterms.title": "IRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda84\"", "article_summary": "According to Fisher, IRS officials questioned whether the healthcare reform law provided a \"permanent appropriation\" for the payments.\nThe IRS officials received a memo written by OMB attorney Sam Berger that laid out a legal justification for making the payments, Fisher said.\nThe IRS raised concerns in early 2014 about the legality of certain ObamaCare payments that Republicans are now challenging in a lawsuit, according to a deposition from a former agency official.\nFisher said the IRS requested a meeting with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to get its perspective on the legality of making the payments.\nKane, I think, had some reservations still, even after, you know, reading the memo and going to the meeting,\u201d Fisher said."}
