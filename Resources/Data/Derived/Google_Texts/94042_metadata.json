Reporters must put the uppity Dr. Carson, 64, in his place.\n\nTo the vast left-wing conspiracy, the good doc exhibits extreme chutzpah \u2014 simultaneously bearing black skin and being a conservative.\n\nHow dare an African-American, an educated, accomplished, evangelical Christian, think for himself?\n\nWell, he won\u2019t be taken down easily.\n\nExhibiting a fire that I haven\u2019t seen from him before, Dr. Carson Tuesday night blasted critics for spreading lies \u201cbeing put out there as truth.\u2019\u2019 At the televised Republican presidential candidates\u2019 debate, he took aim at the double standard protecting a serial fibber, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, 68.\n\nHe said this about Clinton\u2019s account of the deadly 2012 terrorist attacks on American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, Libya, which occurred on her watch as US secretary of state:\n\n\u201cWhen I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that \u2018No, this was a terrorist attack,\u2019 and then tells everybody else that it was [triggered by] a video, where I come from, they call that a lie.\u2019\u2019 Go Ben!\n\nDr. Carson has been ripped \u2014 unfairly \u2014 for his claim, made in his 1990 autobiography, \u201cGifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story,\u2019\u2019 that in 1969, Army bigwigs offered him a \u201cfull scholarship\u2019\u2019 to the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nThe account was \u201cfabricated,\u2019\u2019 Politico initially shrieked. Huh?\n\nDialing back the reckless report into oblivion, the website not only removed the \u201cfabricated\u2019\u2019 claim from its story, it acknowledged that scholarships are never awarded at West Point; there\u2019s just a requirement that grads perform military service. Dr. Carson has never said, written or emitted smoke signals asserting that he applied to West Point, as Politico suggested. At most, he mistook an offer for a free education as a \u201cfull scholarship,\u2019\u2019 but didn\u2019t pursue it.\n\nJust as pathetic is CNN\u2019s attempt to prove that Dr. Carson, who grew up poor in Detroit, pretended to be a badass teen. He\u2019s said and written that, as a 14-year-old ninth-grader, he tried to hit his mom over the head with a hammer in an argument over clothes, that he smashed classmates\u2019 faces with a rock and a lock, and that he once attempted to stab someone in a fight over which station they\u2019d listen to on the radio, but the knife hit the youth\u2019s belt buckle instead.\n\nAside from his apparently rotten aim, it boggles the mind that reporters from the TV news network interviewed nine people who may (or may not) have known Dr. Carson five decades ago. None could remember him being violent. Some scoop.\n\nDr. Carson is a threat because he leads Donald Trump in some polls of Republican voters. In one jarring survey, he leads Clinton among all voters in Michigan!\n\nIn recent days, I\u2019ve seen these stories regurgitated, like iffy pieces of fish:\n\nDr. Carson compared the US to Nazi Germany last year, because the government uses the IRS to intimidate people. More recently, he said Jews could have defeated the Nazis during the Holocaust if they\u2019d been armed. He also said two years ago that ObamaCare is the worst thing \u201csince slavery.\u201d I would say the doctor is guilty not of being offensive, but rhetorically lazy. Nazis and slavery were evil? Duh.\n\nHe floated the theory \u2014 17 years ago, and stood by it last week \u2014 that the Egyptian pyramids were not built as tombs for pharaohs, but were constructed by the biblical figure Joseph to store grain. How insulting. To ancient Egyptians.\n\nA painting seen in his Maryland house last year \u2014 first spotted by a magazine reporter who profiled him in 2009 \u2014 shows a depiction of Dr. Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, sitting next to the image of a smiling Jesus Christ. The creepy picture may not be this Jew\u2019s cup of java, but I can think of worse people Dr. Carson could pose alongside. (Lefty reporters?)\n\nDr. Ben Carson sprang into national popularity in September after he expressed a decidedly politically incorrect view. He said he did not think that a Muslim should be elected president. Since then, his poll numbers, and fundraising, have shot through the roof.\n\nNow he\u2019s the left\u2019s No. 1 bogeyman. He should be proud.\n\nNo pit-y for killer dogs\n\nThe New York City Council voted last year to ban the sale of rapidly multiplying, but harmless, pet bunnies. Nothing has been done to stop the ownership of pit bulls.\n\nOn Sunday, a vicious dog of that breed named Kane mauled to death a beautiful 9-year-old girl, Amiyah Dunston, on Long Island.\n\nPit bulls, sometimes bred to have freakishly strong and deadly jaws, have been outlawed in some municipalities, but the beasts are legally owned throughout New York state. Except in Larchmont, where, I\u2019ve read, owners must register them, carry liability insurance and keep the creatures away from people.\n\nIt\u2019s a start. Pit bulls should be banned everywhere.\n\nSingle-minded Vonn, for now\n\nWorld champion skier Lindsey Vonn says she\u2019s taking a break from men.\n\n\u201cI think this is just a good time for me to focus on myself,\u2019\u2019 the 31-year-old US Olympic hottie says in the December issue of Health magazine, a statement that translates roughly to, \u201cUp yours, Tiger Woods!\u2019\u2019\n\nVonn and the faded golfer, 39, announced their split in May after nearly three years of dating, as a Vonn pal said that Woods cheated on her. No surprise.\n\nYou won\u2019t be alone long, Linz.\n\nGive beggars what they really need\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said this week that the best way to get rid of the homeless is to stop giving the bums money.\n\nGenerous people obviously ignored this advice when it came to 43-year-old Will Andersen, who isn\u2019t even homeless. He boasted to The Post in a Page 1 story Wednesday that he rakes in up to $200 \u2014 an hour \u2014 from strangers outside Grand Central Terminal by putting out one hand and cradling his pet pooch, Rizzo, in the other. Disgusting.\n\nThe best way to rid the city\u2019s parks, subways and sidewalks of guys such as Andersen (who disappeared from his begging spot the day after the story broke), as well as genuine homeless folks, is to require them to move inside \u2014 to shelters or into their own apartments \u2014 or leave town. Only if authorities get tough will folks get help.\n\n\u2018Pop\u2019 up at Citi Field\n\nPepsiCo is ending its sponsorship of Citi Field, home of the New York Mets and its popular seating area, the Pepsi Porch. Coca-Cola is in negotiations to step in as the Mets\u2019 official soda.\n\nHooray!\n\nWill we soon be able to sip superior Coke products while watching ballgames from the sure-to-be-named Coke Couch?
