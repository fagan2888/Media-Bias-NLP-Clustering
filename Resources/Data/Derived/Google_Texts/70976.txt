Connecticut officials are celebrating congressional approval of a new national park in Hartford centering on the historic Colt firearms factory building with the blue, onion-shape dome.

The U.S. Senate on Friday approved plans for the Coltsville National Historical Park as part of a massive defense policy bill that was sent to President Barack Obama.

The effort to make Coltsville a part of the national park system has been ongoing for years. Huge win for Hartford and CT. — Chris Collibee (@ChrisCollibee) December 12, 2014

Congressman John Larson said the approval was the culmination of more than a decade of work to preserve the factory and surrounding area as well as make it a destination and history hub.

The Connecticut Democrat said the park designation will drive economic growth and help create jobs.

Plans call for a visitors' center at the former factory building built in 1855, a multimedia tour experience, and an observation area overlooking the park.
