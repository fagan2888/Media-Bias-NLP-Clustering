Oklahoma City Police said West stole a Pauls Valley General Hospital ambulance outside of St. Anthony Hospital in OKC just after 5 a.m.

“They got here and had to rush the patient inside so when they were inside the subject then went to the ambulance and drove off in it,” said Oklahoma City Police Lt. Valerie Littlejohn.

Two hours later, the stolen ambulance was seen on the John Kilpatrick Turnpike. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol chased West and arrested her near the Kilpatrick Turnpike and County Line Road.

News 9 has learned West was also arrested Wednesday, March 16, for attacking a paramedic.

According to the police report, she called EMSA for possible seizures and when paramedics put an IV in, she ripped the IV’s out of her arm and punched one of the paramedics in the face.

EMSA had to strap her down to the gurney to finish evaluating her.

The report stated West later said she was sorry for smoking those drugs and admitted to smoking PCP.

“Dasha West was placed under arrest for assault and battery on a medical personnel and a simple assault and battery charges, so she was just released from the Oklahoma County jail,” said OCPD Sgt. Ashley Peters.

West bonded out of jail on that charge around 1:10 a.m. Friday. Four hours later and eight blocks away from the jail, West allegedly stole the ambulance.
