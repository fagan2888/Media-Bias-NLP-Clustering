Do you get solicitations from AARP? They have been trying to sign me up for a decade now. Until recently I always tossed everything except the business reply envelope, which I would often drop in the mail empty because I have always disapproved of their philosophy of promoting subsidies and discounts based on status rather than need.

I've noticed that the last two solicitations I have gotten from them did not contain a business reply envelope. Anyone who wanted to sign up with AARP would have to use their own stamp. Since including a postage reply envelope has a significant effect upon response rates, they ar

e standard in most solicitations. In my experience only the most controversial organizations don't regularly use business reply envelopes in their mass solicitations for new members.
