He was completing his undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and had dreams of going to medical school.\n\nBut he had no idea if he\u2019d ever get there. Latthivongskorn is an undocumented immigrant.\n\nHis parents brought him to the U.S. from Thailand on a tourist visa when he was 9 years old, and the family never left.\n\nLatthivongskorn had good reason to be worried about going to medical school in the U.S. He had already had his admission to a research fellowship program at Weill Cornell Medical College rescinded \u2014 after the school learned of his immigration status.\n\nAlthough Cornell later readmitted him to the program, Latthivongskorn worried that medical schools would not want to admit a student who was living in the country illegally. He feared that schools might balk at a student who would have no guarantee of being able to practice medicine in the future.\n\nSpeed forward two years to last Friday. UCSF formally admitted its new medical school class, and one of the 149 students is Latthivongskorn. UCSF says he is its first undocumented immigrant student. Along with the other students, he was ceremoniously awarded a physician\u2019s white coat.\n\nThe ceremony marks the official start of a student\u2019s medical training. I talked to New about his achievement and the obstacles that lie ahead.\n\n(Below are excerpts from our conversation; questions and comments edited for clarity.)\n\nMina Kim: What does it mean to you to reach this milestone?\n\nNew Latthivongskorn: Definitely surreal, thinking about how much work it took to get here and how many people and family friends and community really supported me.\n\nMK: Are you guaranteed to do your residency, at which point you\u2019ll need to be employed by a hospital?\n\nNL: With Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, I have a work permit so I would be able to. However, there is always uncertainty with immigration and policy, and what would happen to [DACA] two years, five years down the road.\n\nMK: How are you financing medical school when you\u2019re not eligible for federal loans?\n\nNL: I am very fortunate that the university is able to provide some form of grant funding, private funding that the university has, donations from alumni or various funding sources that the university has. And that\u2019s only possible because of the California DREAM Act, which is a state law that provides for private funding to be accessible by a person like myself.\n\nThat helps with a chunk of my tuition. (But) housing and other fees, I essentially have to come up with on my own. I\u2019ve been looking into private loans. I am applying vigorously for private scholarships.\n\nMK: How do you respond to the issue of fairness? Is it fair to give a spot at a top medical school to an undocumented student, the child of a family that broke the law?\n\nNL: Now, DACA means students are able to get a work permit, they\u2019re able to get residency, they\u2019re able to get licensed, so what are the real practical concerns of admitting an undocumented immigrant. Financial aid is a big issue.\n\nThe real purpose is being able to train someone who will be able to effect change and improve health for the communities around us. Myself and other folks who are undocumented understand these communities. We have grown up here, we have experienced being at the edge of no access to health care. I think that we bring a really important perspective that can be seen as a positive and as an added perspective, instead of immigration status being seen as a minus.\n\nMK: Two years ago, after you were re-accepted as the first undocumented student to a Cornell internship, you told me:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about myself anymore; it\u2019s bigger than myself. If I go and I do well and they really see this is what is possible from an undocumented student, it could potentially open up a lot more doors for a lot of other students who right now are in the same boat as me.\u201d\n\nMK: Is that a pressure you continue to feel, and has it intensified by being the first undocumented medical student at UCSF?\n\nNL: It definitely is still very much present, and in many ways the stakes have gone up now that I am in medical school. I\u2019ll try to not only do well in school, but I\u2019m always conscious of how it will be for the next undocumented student coming through the door.\n\nJirayut Latthivongskorn helped create a website that\u2019s a resource for other undocumented immigrants who want to pursue health careers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jirayut Latthivongskorn's parents brought him to the U.S, from Thailand on a tourist visa when he was 9.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"UCSF's First Undocumented Medical Student Begins Training\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/09\\/08\\/ucsfs-first-undocumented-medical-student-begins-training\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-08 14:43:37\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-09 14:42:45\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21311,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Physician Workforce\",\"Science\",\"Undocumented Immigrants\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/09\\/Jirayut_New_Latthivongskorn--e1410207297503.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Jirayut Latthivongskorn's parents brought him to the U.S, from Thailand on a tourist visa when he was 9.", "title": "UCSF\u2019s First Undocumented Medical Student Begins Training", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/09/08/ucsfs-first-undocumented-medical-student-begins-training/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/09/Jirayut_New_Latthivongskorn--640x711.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "physician workforce,science,undocumented immigrants", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded1d\"", "article_summary": "Is it fair to give a spot at a top medical school to an undocumented student, the child of a family that broke the law?\nHe was completing his undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and had dreams of going to medical school.\nThe ceremony marks the official start of a student\u2019s medical training.\nNL: It definitely is still very much present, and in many ways the stakes have gone up now that I am in medical school.\nMK: Two years ago, after you were re-accepted as the first undocumented student to a Cornell internship, you told me:\u201cIt\u2019s not just about myself anymore; it\u2019s bigger than myself."}
