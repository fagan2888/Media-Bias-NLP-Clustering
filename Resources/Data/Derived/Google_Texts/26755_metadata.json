This strategy \u2014 as I found in a recent study \u2014 has substantially increased the proportion of such students entering the city\u2019s charter schools.\n\nHistorically, as in other cities, Denver\u2019s charter schools enrolled significantly smaller proportions of students with classifications that suggest they are particularly difficult to educate \u2014 those with disabilities, those learning English, and those eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch \u2014 than did surrounding schools. Critics of charters often alleged that such differences were due to their \u201cpushing out\u201d these types of students.\n\nHowever, an analysis of student enrollment data shows that low-performing students are just as likely to exit district schools as charters, and students with disabilities are substantially less likely to exit charters than district schools.\n\nThe data show that the reason urban charters have historically enrolled fewer seemingly disadvantaged students is that families are less likely to apply.\n\nPrior to SchoolChoice, families interested in DPS charter schools were expected to research and understand complicated application processes. Today, parents annually submit a single form on which they list preferred schooling placements from among both charter and district options. Surveys conducted by the Center for Reinventing Public Education found DPS parents feel the common enrollment system more accessible and less confusing than the old, lottery-based system.\n\nSo, have the adoption of SchoolChoice and the improved informational resources led to real increased access to charters for disadvantaged students?\n\nTo answer that question, I compared changes in enrollment for entering kindergartners in Denver\u2019s charter and district elementary schools before and after adoption of SchoolChoice.\n\nAfter the program began, there was a clear jump in the proportion of students entering charter schools who were eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch or who spoke English as a second language that did not appear within district schools. (Students with disabilities did not fully participate in the process during the years studied.) The effect was large enough to almost entirely eliminate the once-sizable enrollment gap between charter and district schools for English language learners, and it cut the gap of those eligible for free or reduced-price lunch by more than half.\n\nDenver\u2019s experience shows that moving to a common enrollment process has promise to address the consistent charter school enrollment gaps that consistently occur in urban districts. SchoolChoice\u2019s success should act as a model for districts looking to increase educational opportunity for students most in need.\n\nMarcus A.
