This week, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge to the Environmental Protection Agency's rules to clean up the Chesapeake Bay.

The Lawsuit was filed by the American Farm Bureau and was one of hundreds the high court declined to consider.

A federal appeals court last year ruled restrictions on fertilizer runoff, wastewater discharges and other bay pollutants are valid and that decision will stand.

The EPA in 2010 set up a "total maximum daily load" of nutrients and sediment permitted to wash into the Chesapeake Bay.

President of the American Farm Bureau Federation Zippy Duvall says they are disappointed in the Supreme Court not examining the Chesapeake Bay blueprint, "EPA has asserted the power to sit as a federal zoning board, dictating which land can be farmed and where homes, roads and schools can be built. We remain firm in opposing this unlawful expansion of EPAâ€™s power."

He adds the Farm Bureau will keep fighting the scope of the EPA's power.
