An online organization called foreskin-restoration.net said it had more than 5,000 members, some of whom \u201care so bothered by the imposed loss of their foreskin that they endure a tedious process of nonsurgical foreskin restoration to undo some of the sexual damage.\u201d\n\nOther critics noted that circumcision is unlikely to dent HIV transmission in the U.S. since most HIV cases are among men who have sex with men. The CDC proposal recognized this, saying that the studies showing circumcision as an effective HIV-prevention strategy only involved men who had sex with women.\n\nU.S. health care providers \u201cshould inform men who exclusively have sex with men that male circumcision has not been proven to reduce the risk of HIV or [sexually transmitted infections] during anal sex,\u201d the CDC said, adding that circumcision is still advised for bisexual men as well as men who have sex with HIV-infected women, commercial sex workers, injection-drug users and women who live in areas with a high HIV prevalence in the population.\n\nThe CDC proposal got a few supportive comments.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t listen to the hysterical nay-sayers. Look at the evidence,\u201d wrote one medical doctor, while a man writing as \u201cAnonymous\u201d said his bouts with balanitis, a swelling condition of the penis in uncircumcised men, \u201ccould have been prevented if I had been circumcised as an infant.\u201d\n\nAnother circumcision supporter, Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, urged the CDC to recommend that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force review the issue of newborn circumcision. If that task force would endorse newborn circumcision with \u201can A or B recommendation,\u201d he wrote, it would require Medicaid and Medicare to pay for the procedures as a preventive intervention.\n\nA peer review panel will also be assembled to examine the evidence for the proposal and offer expert opinion on whether the CDC recommendations are justified and appropriate for the intended audience. Final recommendations are likely to be published later this year in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekend Report, the CDC said.\n\nThe agency did not directly respond to a question about whether its expert-review panel would include anyone who is critical of circumcision. But it said its peer reviewers would be selected because of their expertise in such matters as urology, pediatrics, public health, infant circumcision and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\n\nAnti-circumcision advocates in Atlanta said on their Facebook page that they are planning a rally Jan. 22 outside the CDC offices to protest the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe all know that there are no benefits to the amputation of healthy body parts,\u201d said organizers, including members of Bloodstained Men & Their Friends, who protest while wearing white pants with bright red circles at the crotch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal proposal to encourage discussions about circumcision for baby boys and at-risk men of all ages has drawn nearly 2,000 mostly negative comments and a planned protest in front of a federal agency this month.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal proposal to encourage discussions about circumcision for baby boys and at-risk men of all ages has drawn nearly 2,000 mostly negative comments and a planned protest in front of a federal agency this month.", "title": "Circumcision proposal by CDC drawing detractors", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/15/circumcision-proposal-by-cdc-drawing-detractors/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/15/1975160_396674443823049_2330796355158608421_n.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/15/1975160_396674443823049_2330796355158608421_n.jpg", "description": "A federal proposal to encourage discussions about circumcision for baby boys and at-risk men of all ages has drawn nearly 2,000 mostly negative comments and a planned protest in front of a federal age", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Circumcision proposal by CDC drawing detractors"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, United States Centers For Disease Control And Prevention"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1567\"", "article_summary": "But the vast majority of the 1,978 public comments on the CDC proposal opposed it \u2014 often furiously.\nThe CDC proposal recognized this, saying that the studies showing circumcision as an effective HIV-prevention strategy only involved men who had sex with women.\nThe CDC proposal got a few supportive comments.\nAnti-circumcision advocates in Atlanta said on their Facebook page that they are planning a rally Jan. 22 outside the CDC offices to protest the proposal.\nFinal recommendations are likely to be published later this year in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekend Report, the CDC said."}
