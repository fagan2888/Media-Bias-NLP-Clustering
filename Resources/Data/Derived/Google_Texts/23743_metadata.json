Ted Cruz and his family enjoy reading \"Christmas classics\" in his campaign's latest TV ad, which aired during late-night television in Iowa over the weekend. ( Video Screenshot Image )\n\nSome presidential candidates attempt to \"reach out\" to non-traditional voters by appearing on late-night television. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is instead putting his own message out to those audiences without having to set foot on any entertainer's stage.\n\nSaturday, his presidential campaign team released an ad that spoofs Democrats, the Obama Administration, and other Beltway conservative whipping posts, like the IRS targeting scandal. Titled \"Cruz Christmas Classics,\" the 90-second spot aired during that evening's broadcast of Saturday Night Live on NBC affiliates in Iowa.\n\nThe ad shows Cruz sitting on a sofa, reading an assortment of fictional \"Christmas stories\" to his daughters. These \"Christmas Classics\" include:\n\n\u2022 A Wonderful Life: A Very Merry Economy\n\n\u2022 Rudolph the Underemployed Reindeer\u2014\"All of the other Reindeer couldn't afford to hire Rudolph.\"\n\n\u2022 How ObamaCare Stole Christmas\n\n\u2022 The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails\u2014a dig at Hillary Clinton: \"I know just what I'll do\", she said with a snicker. \"I'll use my own server, and no one will be the wiser!\"\n\n\u2022 Miracle on K Street\n\n\u2022 Frosty the Speaker of the House\u2014a dig at former Speaker of the House John Boehner that depicts a very tanned \"Frosty\" as a drinker and a smoker\u2014\"Look!
