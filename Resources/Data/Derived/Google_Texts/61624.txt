ANALYSIS/OPINION:

On June 17, 2014, The Washington Times published an article written by Daniel Pipes with the headline, “Turkey’s support for ISIS Islamist terrorists. Aiding jihadists could put Ankara at odds with Iran.” Saudi businessman Yassin Abdullah Kadi complained about this article, and Mr. Pipes has posted on his website www.danielpipes.org the apology below:

“In my article dated 18 June 2014 headed “Turkish Support for ISIS“, I alleged that Saudi businessman Yassin Abdullah Kadi has close ties to ISIS, the militant Sunni Islam group, and that Mr Kadi has funded ISIS. I also stated that Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had met three times with Mr Kadi, and I implied these meetings took place in order to further Ankara’s alleged support for the ISIS group.

“I have since been informed by Mr Kadi’s legal advisers that he has never supported ISIS financially (or otherwise) nor has he ever supported any other terrorist group or activity.

“I unreservedly retract these allegations of Mr Kadi which I accept are totally untrue. I sincerely apologize to Mr Kadi for having published them.”
