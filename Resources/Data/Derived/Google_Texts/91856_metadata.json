Now, some are pointing the blame of the murders at the Mexican drug cartel.\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t comment on other people\u2019s investigations, but they have had cartel problems out there in the past. It\u2019s very volatile. They knew what they were doing, they took care of business. It seemed like a professional hit to me,\u201d said Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer.\n\nPlummer says locally the cartels presence is menacing and the main source for Ohio\u2019s heroin problem.\n\n\u201cWe have three different cartels here that we know of for sure, all dealing with drug trafficking,\u201d said Plummer.\n\nSinaloa, Mexican cartel kingpin, El Chapo\u2019s group\n\nLos Zetas\n\nMexican mafia\n\n\u201cThe Mexican mafia is typically the strong arm. That\u2019s who protects the load, the dangerous ones who do the violence when it needs to be done. So, it\u2019s here,\u201d said Plummer.\n\nFor the sheriff\u2019s office, Miller Lane in Butler Township has been the biggest arresting point for cartel members.\n\n\u201cI wish I could release the number on how many we encountered. It\u2019s a lot. We pick a lot of them up at hotels, but now they are buying houses in our communities,\u201d explained Plummer.\n\nFor Plummer pushing to cartel out of the Miami Valley has become a personal mission.\n\n\u201cThey threaten my detectives, they know where their kids live. This is a whole new level that we\u2019re not used to dealing with,\u201d said Plummer.\n\nThe Rhoden murders aren\u2019t the first time the cartel has been mentioned in Pike County. In 2012, investigators found 1,200 marijuana plants and two campsites suspected to be owned by Mexican nationals.\n\nDeWine\u2019s office has not confirmed or denied whether the cartel is connected to the Rhoden killings.\n\nWhat others are clicking on:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says the cartels' presence is menacing and the main source for Ohio's heroin problem.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=380703612", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4i.com", "description": "Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says the cartels\u2019 presence is menacing and the main source for Ohio\u2019s heroin problem.", "title": "Mexican drug cartels impacting Ohio drug trade", "url": "http://nbc4i.com/2016/05/03/mexican-drug-cartels-impacting-ohio-drug-trade/", "image": {"width": 658, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/11-17-cartel-heroin-bust.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says the cartels\u2019 presence is menacing and the main source for Ohio\u2019s heroin problem.", "title": "Mexican drug cartels impacting Ohio drug trade", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/11-17-cartel-heroin-bust.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@nbc4i", "site": "nbc4i", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "drug cartel, drugs, el chapo, heroin, los zetas, marijuana, mexican drug cartel, mexican mafia, pike county, sinaloa Crime, Local, News, State", "msapplication-tooltip": "Columbus, Ohio News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_09ba3f0df1447f40e98674ba9d62c747", "fb": {"pages": 38342932750}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbc4i.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6f1d97944cdcea2214c0f42e5738057f?s=16", "application-name": "NBC4i.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBC4Columbus", "published_time": "2016-05-03T15:20:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T15:20:44+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "Y7Un57nax7y1Nq_Ap5-4MFnKkuvSsOsEzQ67vpVKTFQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Now, some are pointing the blame of the murders at the Mexican drug cartel.\nSinaloa, Mexican cartel kingpin, El Chapo\u2019s groupLos ZetasMexican mafia\u201cThe Mexican mafia is typically the strong arm.\nDAYTON, OH (WDTN) \u2013 The Pike County killings are shedding light on the region\u2019s drug trade.\nThe Rhoden murders aren\u2019t the first time the cartel has been mentioned in Pike County.\n\u201cWe have three different cartels here that we know of for sure, all dealing with drug trafficking,\u201d said Plummer."}
