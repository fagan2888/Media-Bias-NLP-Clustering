It\u2019s a portrait of a man\u2019s life that\u2019s as solid and real as his ironwork.\n\n\u201c I suddenly feel deeply humbled,\u201d one commenter on the website Reddit wrote after scrolling through the album. \u201cWe\u2019re all just humans, trying to live our lives to their fullest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting in the middle of a bar in Manhattan, crying like a baby,\u201d another wrote.\n\nThe response surprised Joshua Alsup, a 34-year-old bike messenger dispatcher who lives in Philadelphia. He decided to create the tribute after his family threw a memorial party for his dad in May. It was there he saw three chronologically organized photo albums put together by his mother, Bar Harbor weaver Judith Blank.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen a lot of those pictures,\u201d Joshua Alsup explained in a telephone interview. He figured his dad\u2019s life story might be interesting, primarily to young blacksmiths.\n\n\u201cI just thought it would be neat for somebody who was young to see what that was like, seeing how somebody lived their life as a blacksmith,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare.\u201d\n\nBut it turns out that his father\u2019s life resonates for many others, too. In a world where so much shared on the Internet is fleeting, the story of Maine blacksmith Steve Alsup has caused deeper reflection among those scrolling through his life on their handheld devices.\n\n\u201cWhat a lovely post,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cI have a 4-month-old daughter and couldn\u2019t help but think about how my current life wouldn\u2019t lead to anything as moving as this. I don\u2019t think pictures of me staring at my phone would be so interesting for her or others 40 years from now. [Joshua\u2019s] dad lived a good life of doing. I need to get off my damn phone and get out into the world.\u201d\n\nAlways a surprise\n\nSteve Alsup was born a world away from today\u2019s technological interconnectedness. He grew up roaming the woods and Ozark mountains of southern Missouri, just 20 miles from the Mississippi River.\n\nAfter high school, the wide-eyed teen joined the Air Force and was a radio operator in Turkey and Germany. He married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended and Steve Alsup wound up back in Missouri, going to college on the G.I. Bill. It was the beginning of the 1970s. The photos show how he started to let his hair grow and how his clothes became more fanciful. Then they show a beautiful woman with dark hair, who came onto the scene and stay there. That woman was Judith Blank, a young teaching assistant from Pittsburgh with a newly minted Ph.D. in anthropology.\n\n\u201cSteve was always a surprise,\u201d Judith Blank said this week. \u201cIt seemed like he was an original \u2014 an authentically honest person. He didn\u2019t bother about what other people thought about it.\u201d\n\nThe couple turned their gaze to the north, first moving to Massachusetts, where she taught at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester. He found work as a \u201ccolonial townsfolk\u201d in Old Sturbridge Village. It was at that New England living history museum where Steve quickly lost interest in farming, then discovered a love for blacksmithing. In 1977, the couple moved to Maine.\n\nWhen Joshua Alsup was born, his parents were working on their octagonal house. Capped with a cupola and built with lumber salvaged from the big hotels that had burned in the fire of \u201947, the house has \u201ca good feeling to it,\u201d Judith said. Steve started his blacksmith business, the Morning Glory Forge, and spent lots of time in his shop producing the fanciful yet sturdy metalwork he\u2019s known for.\n\nRailings, fireplace screens and andirons all over Mount Desert Island and beyond show his graceful designs of cattails, hummingbirds and Great Blue Herons worked into the metal.\n\n\u201cSteve saw himself as a tradesman,\u201d Judith Blank said, in the tradition of the self-employed skilled people who controlled their own work situation. \u201cThey deserve respect for their skills. There\u2019s a lot of pride in them. They can\u2019t be pushed around at all.\u201d\n\nIn some of those photos Steve Alsup is holding a cigarette or a can of beer, lifestyle habits Joshua did not gloss over in his blunt, unembellished prose.\n\n\u201cHere is my dad rolling a cigarette in the forests of La Verendrye Wildlife Refuge in Quebec,\u201d he wrote in a caption to a camping trip photo. \u201cI don\u2019t know when my father started smoking. From my earliest memory until the stroke that hit him two years before his death, he rolled unfiltered cigarettes as often as every 20 minutes. He favored Turkish tobacco blends. Lung cancer would eventually kill him.\u201d\n\nAfter a 2012 stroke left him partially paralyzed and ended his long blacksmithing career, Steve Alsup eventually learned to move around the Bar Harbor property with a cane or wheelchair, cook food and take care of the animals, Joshua Alsup wrote. Two years later he was diagnosed with lung cancer and given only a few months to live.\n\n\u201cHe elected to stay at home and not take chemotherapy treatments. One morning in early January of 2015 he was unable to rise from bed, and he died five minutes later,\u201d Joshua Alsup wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing that he never became bedridden. It would have really salted his nut to be dependent on my mom or a nurse. I like to think that at the moment of his dying he was satisfied that he avoided that.\u201d\n\nStanding in his spot\n\nSince his dad\u2019s death, in a time of big transitions, Joshua Alsup said he wants to come home to Maine, leaving the city behind. There\u2019s work to do on the octagonal house and the lure of living a car-free lifestyle on Mount Desert Island in the summertime.\n\nIf things align for him, he\u2019s interested in building something on the foundation where his dad\u2019s blacksmith shop had stood for decades until it was demolished this spring.\n\n\u201cEventually maybe I\u2019ll be working on my own projects, with my own tools, standing in the spot where he once did,\u201d Joshua wrote at the close of his photo essay.\n\nHis mother said she hopes it works out that way.\n\n\u201cSteve really wanted Josh to build a building, but thought he never would,\u201d Judith said. \u201cHe would really be pleased.\u201d\n\nWriting and sharing the story has helped him get perspective on Maine and on his father \u2014 a complicated, imperfect, loving and loved person.\n\n\u201cI feel like I understood my dad. I think that I enjoyed portraying him the way he is,\u201d Joshua Alsup said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the easiest person to talk to. He was an old-school male. He was a well-rounded, flawed but also cool and a very capable person, which is how I want to remember him. Making a photo album that way helped me shape my memory.\u201d\n\nFor his mom, the story Joshua told about his father feels true and fair and important.\n\n\u201cSteve, when I met him, secretly wanted to be a writer,\u201d Judith said. \u201cWhen Josh was born, I had the feeling that our story would continue \u2014 that somebody would tell our story. And here he\u2019s gone and done it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BAR HARBOR, Maine \u2014 A lot of the things popular on the Internet are like soap bubbles: shiny and insubstantial, disappearing as fast as they float past on your Facebook feed.
