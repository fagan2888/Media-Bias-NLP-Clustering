But those of us who care more about getting health insurance than the latest old videos of Jonathan Gruber talking about how the law was passed are the real lucky ones.\n\nFirst, the four Fox hosts tried to get Chong to knock the glitches in the HealthCare.gov rollout. He replied, \u201cMy thing about the whole ObamaCare is that it\u2019s better than Bush\u2019s ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nOne of the hosts asked, \u201cWhat was Bush\u2019s ObamaCare?\u201d\n\nChong said, \u201cHe never had one.\u201d\n\nThere was a nervous titter from one host and silence from the rest.\n\nTantaros brought up Gruber and his claim that \u201cstupid Americans\u201d were misled in order to pass the Affordable Care Act.\n\nChong\u2019s reply: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s just another attack on ObamaCare from another angle. Sounds like Benghazi all over again.\u201d\n\nLater, Tantaros tried to argue that Gruber\u2019s old comments represent \u201can attack on the American people for how quote stupid we are.\u201d\n\nChong said, \u201cYou have to define what stupidity means, you know. If you are opposing universal health care based on rumors of lies then that it is a stupid way to be.\u201d\n\nThat shut them up.\n\nWatch it below from today\u2019s Outnumbered.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "W4RFhb230UiLkz78R5ZKcL7j8egsDH6okeVAcQu3nj0=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/watch_tommy_chong_smack_down_fox_s_attacks_on_obamacare_sounds_like_benghazi_all_over_again_11192014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Tommy Chong Smack Down Fox\u2019s Attacks On ObamaCare: \u2018Sounds Like Benghazi All Over Again\u2019"}, "Title": "Watch Tommy Chong Smack Down Fox\u2019s Attacks On ObamaCare: \u2018Sounds Like Benghazi All Over Again\u2019"}, "article_summary": "First, the four Fox hosts tried to get Chong to knock the glitches in the HealthCare.gov rollout.\nWatch it below from today\u2019s Outnumbered.\nIf you are opposing universal health care based on rumors of lies then that it is a stupid way to be.\u201dThat shut them up.\nTommy Chong was today\u2019s #OneLuckyGuy on Fox\u2019s Outnumbered show.\nTantaros brought up Gruber and his claim that \u201cstupid Americans\u201d were misled in order to pass the Affordable Care Act."}
