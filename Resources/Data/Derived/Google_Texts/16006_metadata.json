( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nLOVELAND -- Poudre Pet and Feed Supply, which has been providing \"a feed for every need\" for decades in Fort Collins, has opened a Loveland location.\n\nThe store launched Monday at 2400 N. Lincoln Ave. in the former Mrs. GoodThrift building.\n\n\"We had some customers write us letters and other customers beg us to open in Loveland. We finally gave in,\" said Karen Horak, co-owner of Poudre Pet and Feed, which has four locations in Fort Collins.\n\nHorak said she and Karen Morris bought the company in 1988, when it had one location. The new Loveland store is the third they have added in the past three years.\n\nShe said they don't have plans to expand further right now but added, \"Since we've opened the Loveland store, people have been calling us from Windsor.\"\n\nAt 8,200 square feet, the Loveland store is the company's largest, she said.\n\n\"We have food for every animal you can think of,\" Horak said and then ran through a long list of creatures that included dogs, cats, wild birds, parrots, lizards, fish, guinea pigs, llamas, horses, chickens and cattle.\n\n\"As the demographics change in the city, the demographics change at the feed store,\" she said. \"We like to sell what people want and buy.\"\n\nThe store is open 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nFor more information, call 970-800-3967.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Craig Young at 970-635-3634 or cyoung@reporter-herald.com.
