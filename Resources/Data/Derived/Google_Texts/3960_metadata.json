It can snow in September.\u201d\n\nEarly freeze or no, Plotkin\u2019s 1-acre Golden Acre Farm could soon be able to extend its growing season year-round, thanks to the farm-to-table relationship Plotkin has cultivated with the executive chef at Regis University.\n\nBon Appetit Management Company, the food-service provider at Regis, is giving away $50,000 in grants to small farmers nationwide, and Golden Acre\u2019s request for a greenhouse is one of five finalists for two $5,000 grants in the Southwest region.\n\nThe grants are part of Bon Appetit\u2019s 15th anniversary celebration for its Farm-to-Fork program, which requires its kitchens to source at least 20 percent of ingredients from small, owner-operated farms within a 150-mile radius. Chefs and diners at Bon Appetit properties across the U.S. will vote to determine the winners Sept. 23.\n\n\u201cI would love to be able to extend my season and know I have a permanent structure to grow my starts,\u201d Plotkin said. \u201cNot only do I need a greenhouse so I can get my plants to market sooner, I want to be able to supply Regis and other restaurants with hardy winter crops.\u201d\n\nFor the past year, Plotkin has worked with Glenn Babcock, executive chef for Bon Appetit at Regis, to serve up Golden Acre produce in the university\u2019s cafes.\n\nEach week, after closing his stand at the Highland Farmers Market, Plotkin brings whatever didn\u2019t sell \u2014 heirloom tomatoes, swiss chard, watermelon, beets, turnips, cucumbers, kale galore \u2014 to Regis.\n\nBabcock then buys what he wants direct from Plotkin at a wholesale price. The produce\u2019s destination: the 1,800 meals served to Regis students every day.\n\n\u201cI clean him out every single week,\u201d Babcock said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a mutually beneficial relationship, Babcock said. He gets fresh, high-quality local produce \u201cat a fair price,\u201d and Plotkin knows that he won\u2019t go home with unsold produce.\n\n\u201cIt becomes my challenge to say, \u2018We have this great, wonderful product in-house \u2014 how do we use that? How do we save it?\u2019 \u201d Babcock said.\n\nMost produce ends up on the salad bar where it \u201creally shines,\u201d Babcock said. But the chef also gets creative, serving up watermelon agua fresca, oven-roasted turnips and \u201ckale 5,000 ways.\u201d He even started up a little pickling operation to handle an overabundance of cucumbers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic,\u201d Plotkin said. \u201cGlenn understands the need for community support for small farms.\u201d\n\nIf he wins the grant from Bon Appetit, Plotkin plans to build a passive solar greenhouse and aquaponics system, incorporating used and recycled materials as much as possible.\n\nThe goal, he said, is to transform the 3-year-old farm into a year-round operation, supplying organic produce and sustainably raised tilapia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been growing food since I was 12 years old,\u201d Plotkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s my trade. I love being outside. I have a passion for growing plants. You learn something new every season.\u201d\n\nBabcock is also looking forward to the possibility of more fresh, local produce, particularly in the months outside the traditional growing season when Regis serves most of its meals.\n\n\u201cTo have that expanded capacity, he has the opportunity to supply some hardy winter greens and hardy vegetables \u2014 cauliflower, broccoli, kale,\u201d Babcock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for us. It\u2019s a win for him.\u201d\n\nEmilie Rusch: 303-954-2457, erusch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/emilierusch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Golden farmer in the running for national grant, thanks to Regis chef", "title": "Golden farmer in the running for national grant, thanks to Regis chef", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/19/golden-farmer-in-the-running-for-national-grant-thanks-to-regis-chef/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__20140920_C3_FE20AHGOLDENFARMp2.jpg", "height": 421}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__20140920_C3_FE20AHGOLDENFARMp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-19T17:40:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:14:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chefs and diners at Bon Appetit properties across the U.S. will vote to determine the winners Sept. 23.\n\u201cI clean him out every single week,\u201d Babcock said.\n\u201cGlenn understands the need for community support for small farms.\u201dIf he wins the grant from Bon Appetit, Plotkin plans to build a passive solar greenhouse and aquaponics system, incorporating used and recycled materials as much as possible.\nGOLDEN \u2014 As he surveyed his farm, nestled in a backyard between North and South Table Mountain, Jason Plotkin had weather on his mind.\nHe gets fresh, high-quality local produce \u201cat a fair price,\u201d and Plotkin knows that he won\u2019t go home with unsold produce."}
