Nearly as convenient as stopping for gas, retail health clinics offer parents quick options for maintenance and repair, especially synergistic for those requiring prescription medicine along with a loaf of bread and gallon of milk. Although no U.S. corporation has yet to devise a health care drive-thru, some question whether Ronald McDonald represents the best business model for delivering good pediatric health care over time. Now, the nation\u2019s largest group of pediatricians says fast-food health care may be harming human health.\n\n\u201cThe AAP recognizes that convenience and access to care will continue to be important drivers of how health care is delivered,\u201d James Laughlin, lead author of the policy statement, said Monday. \u201cHowever, the expertise of the pediatrician and the medical [provider group] should continue to be recognized as the standard for care of children.\u201d\n\nThe group also encouraged its members to keep accessible office hours in convenient locations, to essentially offer convenience along with higher-quality longitudinal care realized through the concept of the \u201cmedical home,\u201d or patient\u2019s central provider. In other words, \u201cWho\u2019s your doctor?\u201d\n\nAlthough the group\u2019s position on retail-based health clinics has remained consistent over the years, \u201cthe number of clinics has grown and they are used much more,\u201d Laughlin said. \u201cIf these entities are going to take care of children, there should be certain standards adhered to in terms of communication back to the pediatrician or having some sort of relationship with a pediatrician locally so that a child can be referred back to their pediatrician for ongoing care.\u201d\n\nLaughlin, who serves as head of pediatrics at IU Health in Bloomington, Ind., says the use of retail health clinics disrupts a child\u2019s continuity of care. When parents order health care in discrete transactions \u2014 supersized or not \u2014 children lose over the longer term. Yet pediatricians are also to blame for the popularization of retail health care, given that few offer after-hours services convenient to working parents, Laughlin acknowledge. Such clinics often offer the best alternative to waiting for doctor\u2019s appointments or paying for a costly visit to the emergency room.\n\n\"I think there are instances where it is reasonable to use a retail-based clinic, such as if you're traveling or if you have a time crunch and you feel like that's where you need to go to get immediate care,\u201d Laughlin said. \u201cBut make sure that the information from that visit gets transmitted back to your pediatrician because the medical home is the optimal standard of care for pediatric patients.\u201d\n\nTo date, more than 20 million customers have been served. Corporate chains operate more than 1,600 retail clinics in 39 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Convenient Care Association, a trade group representing the growing industry. Though industry members say they support the continuity of care, they emphasize that most patients visit retail clinics for the convenient treatment of minor ailments, such as cold and flu.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "walgreens healthcare clinic, kroger's the little clinic, cvs minuteclinic, retail health clinics, retail health clinics and pediatrics", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics now says retail-based health care clinics, such as those operated by Walgreens and CVS, are inherently inadequate for longer-term medical care.", "title": "Retail Health Clinics Inadequate For Kids\u2019 Care: Has Capitalism Gone Too Far?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/retail-health-clinics-inadequate-kids-care-has-capitalism-gone-too-far-269974", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/24/are-retail-health-clinics-bad-kids.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics now says retail-based health care clinics, such as those operated by Walgreens and CVS, are inherently inadequate for longer-term medical care.", "title": "Retail Health Clinics Inadequate For Kids\u2019 Care: Has Capitalism Gone Too Far?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/retail-health-clinics-inadequate-kids-care-has-capitalism-gone-too-far-269974", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/24/are-retail-health-clinics-bad-kids.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/24/are-retail-health-clinics-bad-kids.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-02-24T11:04:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-24T12:32:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics now says retail-based health care clinics, such as those operated by Walgreens and CVS, are inherently inadequate for longer-term medical care."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb20f\"", "article_summary": "Although no U.S. corporation has yet to devise a health care drive-thru, some question whether Ronald McDonald represents the best business model for delivering good pediatric health care over time.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics now says retail-based health care clinics, such as those operated by Walgreens and CVS, are inherently inadequate for longer-term medical care.\nNow, the nation\u2019s largest group of pediatricians says fast-food health care may be harming human health.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on Monday criticized a growing reliance by American families on retail-based health care clinics found in pharmacy chains such as Walgreens, Kroger\u2019s, and CVS drug stores.\nWhen parents order health care in discrete transactions \u2014 supersized or not \u2014 children lose over the longer term."}
