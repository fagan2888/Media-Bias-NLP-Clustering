In 1980, Reagan won it by 66 percent. This heart of \u2018Reagan Democrat\u2019 country was closely split by Gore and Bush and Bush and Kerry\u2026 until Obama won it 53 to 45 in 2008 and by 51 to 47 in 2012.\n\nThe Republican Party doesn\u2019t need to worry about the Latino vote nearly as much as it should be worrying about its inability to connect with white working class Americans. The pro-amnesty GOP establishment\u2019s electoral vision of a party of corporations and minority voters already exists.\n\nIt\u2019s called the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s fate in 2016 will be decided in places like Macomb County. It will be decided by white men and women earning $20,000 to $50,000 a year. It will be decided by working families struggling to get by and searching for answers from a government that keeps betraying them.\n\nThat is the point that Senator Jeff Sessions, the Republican senator who has stood tallest against amnesty, makes in his National Review article \u201cBecoming the Party of Work.\u201d\n\nSessions argues that slowing down immigration in a time of tremendous economic turmoil would actually be the populist thing to do. Three to one of those earning under $30,000 want to see reductions in immigration. Instead the Republican Party is alienating them further by championing illegal aliens.\n\n\"To open the ears of disaffected voters, the GOP must break publicly from the elite immigration consensus of Wall Street and Davos,\" Sessions warns.\n\nToo many Senate Republicans act like members of a globalist party who legislate while detached from the concerns of ordinary working Americans. McCain, the GOP candidate in 2008, and the most aggressive GOP proponent for amnesty in the Senate, whose daughter has made a career of \u201coutreach\u201d to her own class of hip young wealthy people, represents the opposite of what the GOP should be doing.\n\nMcCain\u2019s infamous claim, \u201cThere are jobs Americans won\u2019t do\u201d was seen as embodying the detachment of the pro-amnesty elite from working Americans struggling to get by.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney,\u201d Sessions points out, \u201clost lower- and middle-income voters by an astonishing margin. Among voters earning $30,000 to $50,000, he trailed by 15 points, and among voters earning under $30,000 he trailed by 28 points.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, McCain won only 25 percent of voters whose incomes fell below $15,000, 37 percent of voters whose incomes were between $15,000 and $30,000 and 43 percent of voters in the $30,000 to $50,000 range. That is not what a party that aspires to represent the silent majority of Americans looks like.\n\nInflation has changed income and demographics have changed as well, but still the only income group that Reagan lost in 1984 were in the under $12,500 range and even then it was close. Even in 1980, Reagan did not lose any income group by more than 10 percent.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was able to win back some Reagan Democrats, but the party never again equaled Reagan\u2019s performance.\n\nSenator Sessions however has some proposals for changing that from merging 80 means-tested poverty-assistance and welfare programs into one to be administered by a welfare office that doubles as a job training program to cracking down on corporate outsourcing and repealing ObamaCare.\n\nThe Republican Party has been able to put forward a credible pro-business agenda, but it needs a credible pro-worker agenda without assuming that talking about Staples is the same thing as connecting with Staples employees. If it fails to do that, it will be hammered by minimum wage and overtime measures until its voting base is limited to a shrinking upper middle class.\n\n\u201cWherever the policies of the Left have been faithfully implemented, as in Detroit, human tragedy has followed. The future offered by the Left \u2014 a shrinking work force struggling to fund a growing welfare state \u2014 is not only unsustainable but uncompassionate. Compassion demands that we spare no effort in helping millions now jobless to realize the dream of financial independence. This is the urgent economic task of the 21st century,\u201d Sessions writes.\n\nThe Republican Party has to stop merely running against welfare and start running on opportunity. The left\u2019s response to the GOP\u2019s anti-welfare rhetoric has been to swell the welfare rolls making more and more Americans complicit in the welfare state.\n\nInstead of turning to 47% rhetoric, the critique of a political movement that has given up, it has to reclaim welfare voters and transform them into working voters.\n\nSession\u2019s agenda challenges the GOP to stop trying to plug a work culture hole with immigrants. Instead he urges the Republican Party to \u201chelp the millions struggling here today \u2014 immigrant and native-born alike \u2014 transition from dependency to self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nReagan understood that welfare was morally crippling. In his 1985 State of the Union address, he said, \u201cLet us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom.\u201d\n\nIn a ringing critique of the welfare state, he stated that, \u201cPolicies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroy self-respect are not progressive; they\u2019re reactionary. Despite our strides in civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power.\u201d\n\nThis is the critique that Sessions and David Horowitz return to.\n\nLast year, David Horowitz said that the \u201chistoric assault on Detroit\u2019s African American population was absent from all the speeches and all the political ads of all the actors supporting free market solutions in the 2012 elections. The word 'Detroit' wasn\u2019t mentioned.\u201d\n\nAmnesty for illegal aliens may be an even bigger assault on both lower income whites and blacks than anything before. Instead of countering it, too many Republicans are providing cover for it. Instead of offering American solutions to American problems, they take refuge in abstract free market ideology.\n\nSessions confronts the intersection between immigration and unemployment, between the welfare state and the open border and urges the Republican Party to stand up for American workers.\n\nAmnesty is an assault on the economic freedom and opportunity of the voters that the Republican Party needs to win in 2016. The Republican Party has critiqued the Democratic Party\u2019s debt slavery, borrowing trillions to be repaid in the future, but with amnesty the GOP is selling off its base of today in the hopes of buying a new demographic of voters from a new nation.\n\nThe United States cannot survive as a welfare nation, but the Republican Party cannot win it back until it relearns how to speak to the national interest instead of the global interest, to the American worker and the American businessman.\n\n*\n\nDon't miss Daniel Greenfield on The Glazov Gang.
