Phyllis Kahn (D) wants college students to drink in bars, not in their dorms. She says the Supreme Court\u2019s Obamacare decision in 2012 will help her case.\n\n(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nState Rep. Phyllis Kahn (D) is a Minnesota institution. The 21-term lawmaker has a PhD in biophysics from Yale as well as an MPA from the Kennedy School at Harvard. In the 1970s, she reformed the state\u2019s laws to demand gender equity in sports programs from college all the way down to primary school.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s known as the mother of Title IX here in Minnesota,\u201d said state Rep. Joe Atkins (D), admiringly. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my favorite legislators. But she also drives me crazy sometimes. She likes to push the envelope with certain ideas.\u201d\n\nIdeas like this one: For over a decade, Kahn has been trying to reform the state\u2019s laws on underage drinking. She believes that people 18 and over should be served at bars. It\u2019s safer and would provide an alternative to the unsupervised \u2014 often dangerous \u2014 drinking that goes on at college campuses.\n\nThe policy has gained fans among many university presidents. But the bill has been a tough sell in Minnesota. For years, Kahn has had trouble getting her idea heard before a committee.\n\nNow, she has a new argument up her sleeve that involves Obamacare, the Supreme Court and constitutional law.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a moment. President Ronald Reagan is the reason why the drinking age is 21 everywhere these days. In the 1980s, nearly half of states still allowed residents to buy alcohol at age 18. In 1984, Reagan signed a bill demanding that all states raise their drinking age to 21. There was a threat: If states didn\u2019t comply by 1987, they would lose 10 percent of their federal highway construction dollars.\n\nSome states didn\u2019t like being pushed around like that. The legal fracas that ensued left us with a landmark Supreme Court decision. The federal government is allowed to attach conditions on the money that it gives states, the court ruled, but there are limits. The feds, for instance, can\u2019t be too coercive. The court said that Reagan was in the clear, though, since federal highway dollars are only a tiny percentage of state budgets.\n\nThis decision, South Dakota v. Dole, came to prominence again during the Obamacare lawsuit that came before the Supreme Court in 2012. The court upheld most of the Affordable Care Act, but it struck down one of the law\u2019s threats. As it was written, the ACA would have taken away federal Medicaid funding entirely from any states that didn\u2019t play along with expanding Medicaid.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts argued that to bargain with existing Medicaid dollars crossed a line drawn by South Dakota v. Dole. Unlike federal highway funds, Medicaid is a huge chunk of state budgets, about one-fifth of expenditures. More than half of that money comes from the federal government. For the feds to use Medicaid funding as a bargaining chip represented too much of a threat, according to Roberts. Famously, Roberts called this part of the ACA \u201ca gun to the head\u201d for states.\n\nEver since South Dakota v. Dole, states have been reluctant to lower the drinking age because they would lose 10 percent of federal highway dollars. That threat has always stood in the way of Kahn\u2019s efforts in Minnesota. But she argues that the Obamacare decision, NFIB v. Sibelius, changed the game. She says there\u2019s a chance that Minnesota \u2014 and all states \u2014 would get to keep their highway money even if they lowered the drinking age.\n\nReally, though?\n\nKahn said she hadn\u2019t consulted any legal experts yet, but some of her colleagues also seemed to think that this argument could have merit. The Minnesota House commerce chairman, Joe Hoppe (R), told the Pioneer Press Thursday that he\u2019d put it on the committee calendar.\n\nHere come the rain clouds for that parade. Several law professors said that Kahn\u2019s interpretation of the law probably won\u2019t hold up in court.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have much of a case at all,\u201d said Sam Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan. The Obamacare decision, he explains, hinged on how important Medicaid funding was to states. \u201cIt was explicitly based on the unprecedentedly large size of the threat,\u201d he said.\n\nWhereas federal Medicaid spending makes up over 10 percent of state budgets, the highway money is a pittance, less than one percent. To take away 10 percent of that is a smaller sum still. It\u2019s exactly because that is such a small amount that Reagan\u2019s drinking age bill was allowed to stand some 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cThere was not a hint in the opinions in NFIB that would question the holding in Dole,\u201d said Mitchell Berman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI still think the small amount of funding at stake negates a coercion argument,\u201d Nicole Huberfeld, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nDavid Orentlicher, a professor of law at Indiana University, pointed out that a challenge to South Dakota v. Dole would result in dramatic upheaval. The federal government attaches conditions to all kinds of funding, from health care to education to transportation.\n\nNo Child Left Behind is an important example. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal filed a lawsuit last year against the federal government asking to strike down the law. One of his arguments is that NCLB makes states jump through too many hoops to get federal education money. (Georgetown law professor Eloise Pasachoff has argued that the federal education laws are probably safe from these kinds of lawsuits.)\n\nOrentlicher predicts that the Supreme Court would be reluctant to take away this important tool for making policy at a national level. \u201cThat would be a huge limitation on federal powers,\u201d he said.\n\nOh, well \u2014 it was an interesting idea, at least. Atkins, the Minnesota representative, said that the bill was doomed anyway because constituents just don\u2019t want to lower the drinking age. \u201cI don\u2019t think this stands a snowball\u2019s chance in \u2014 well, let\u2019s say Florida,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This Minnesota lawmaker says the Obamacare decision in 2012 may have opened the door to a lot more.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeff.y.guo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "This Minnesota lawmaker says the Obamacare decision in 2012 may have opened the door to a lot more.", "title": "Did the Supreme Court accidentally allow states to lower the drinking age with impunity?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/02/06/did-the-supreme-court-accidentally-allow-states-to-lower-the-drinking-age-with-impunity/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2015/02/imrs.jpeg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@_jeffguo"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/02/06/did-the-supreme-court-accidentally-allow-states-to-lower-the-drinking-age-with-impunity/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "minnesota, drinking, kahn, supreme court, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeff.y.guo"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "minnesota, drinking, kahn, supreme court, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e25\"", "article_summary": "Atkins, the Minnesota representative, said that the bill was doomed anyway because constituents just don\u2019t want to lower the drinking age.\nIt\u2019s exactly because that is such a small amount that Reagan\u2019s drinking age bill was allowed to stand some 30 years ago.\nPresident Ronald Reagan is the reason why the drinking age is 21 everywhere these days.\nIn 1984, Reagan signed a bill demanding that all states raise their drinking age to 21.\nEver since South Dakota v.
