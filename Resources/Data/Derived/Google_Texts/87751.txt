Three Things You Should Know (and a Cartoon):

Advantage Obama: The verbal sparring between President Barack Obama and liberal hero Sen. Elizabeth Warren over the Trans-Pacific Partnership just kicked up a notch, a preview of the Democrats’ upcoming civil war on trade. Last round, Warren connected with a big left hook, slamming the TPP as a bad deal for the middle class and saying that’s the big reason Obama’s people are negotiating it in secret. On Friday, in a conference call with a group of journalists, however, the president reminded Warren why they call it a “bully pulpit.” Without calling her out by name, Obama answered Warren with some stiff right jabs: Critics, he says, are being “dishonest” about the TPP by suggesting it’s a closed-door process and are spreading “misinformation” to rile up the liberal base. Then he delivered a nasty one-two combination: “The one that gets on my nerves the most is the notion that this is a ‘secret’ deal. Every single one of the critics who I hear saying, ‘This is a secret deal,’ or send out emails to their fundraising base saying they’re working to prevent this secret deal, can walk over today and read the text of the agreement. There’s nothing secret about it.” Ouch – that had to sting. Stay tuned: With a key vote on the horizon, and neither side ready to throw in the towel, this one’s probably going all 12 rounds.
