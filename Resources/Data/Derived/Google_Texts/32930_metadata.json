Still, that\u2019s 22 percent of the total\u2014mostly in vulnerable, low income areas. A bare minimum of functionality probably isn\u2019t the bar we ought to be aiming to clear.\n\nRelated: Ted Cruz Says Obama\u2019s Public Health Officials Can\u2019t Be Trusted on Ebola\n\nUnfortunately, as a recent report issued by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials shows, state-level budget cuts have been eating away at the capacity of state health agencies since the onset of the Great Recession in 2008.\n\n\u201cSHAs continue to experience budget cuts and job losses, resulting in the reduction or elimination of critical public health programs and services,\u201d the report found. \u201cCritical SHA programs and services have been cut or reduced, staff positions have been eliminated and many staff have been laid off or furloughed.\u201d\n\nState-level health agencies, like many state functions were frequently subject to budget cuts during the recession and in the years that followed. By 2013, according to ASTHO data, 100 percent of their members had implemented travel restrictions, and virtually reported various kinds of staffing reductions, including hiring freezes, involuntary furloughs, elimination of vacant positions, and delayed hiring of vacant positions.\n\nThe result has been the elimination or curtailment of various kinds of programs. For instance, the state of Georgia \u201chas limited the scope of services provided for genetic testing, diagnosis, counseling, and management for children, along with care coordination and other needed medical and health services for children and youth with chronic conditions,\u201d the report said.\n\nRelated: Ebola Czar\u2019s First Challenge Is Calming the Public\n\nThe situation is just as critical, if not more so, at the state and local level \u2013 the first line of defense against an epidemic. The National Association of County and City Health Officials, local health departments across the country lost 44,000 jobs between 2008 and 2013. And NACCHO found that funding for emergency preparedness programs was typically one of the first victims of budget cuts.\n\nThe cuts to individual agencies, according to the Institute of Medicine, come at the same time that efforts to plan and coordinate responses to widespread public health crises have been neglected.\n\nIf the U.S. does face a public health crisis, the report said, that\u2019s very bad news. \u201cThese planning efforts are essential,\u201d it read, \u201cbecause, absent careful planning, there is enormous potential for confusion, chaos, and flawed decision making in a catastrophic public health emergency or disaster.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ebola isn\u2019t going to turn the U.S. into a hot zone like Liberia or Sierra Leone, but the appearance of the deadly virus in the Texas ought to convince us to look at our public health infrastructure, which has been badly neglected in recent years.", "title": "Public Health Funding Cuts Could Damage Our Defense Against Epidemics", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/21/Public-Health-Funding-Cuts-Could-Damage-Our-Defense-Against-Epidemics", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10132014_Ebola_Disinfection_Texas_POTD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/21/Public-Health-Funding-Cuts-Could-Damage-Our-Defense-Against-Epidemics", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10132014_Ebola_Disinfection_Texas_POTD.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ebola isn\u2019t going to turn the U.S. into a hot zone like Liberia or Sierra Leone, but the appearance of the deadly virus in the Texas ought to convince us to look at our public health infrastructure, which has been badly neglected in recent years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc44\"", "article_summary": "The National Association of County and City Health Officials, local health departments across the country lost 44,000 jobs between 2008 and 2013.\n\u201cSHAs continue to experience budget cuts and job losses, resulting in the reduction or elimination of critical public health programs and services,\u201d the report found.\nIf the U.S. does face a public health crisis, the report said, that\u2019s very bad news.\nAnd NACCHO found that funding for emergency preparedness programs was typically one of the first victims of budget cuts.\n\u201cThese planning efforts are essential,\u201d it read, \u201cbecause, absent careful planning, there is enormous potential for confusion, chaos, and flawed decision making in a catastrophic public health emergency or disaster.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times"}
