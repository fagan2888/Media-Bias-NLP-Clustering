(Hello, November election.)\n\nSo he likes to cite successful private sector endeavors as alleged, though-actually-antithetical visual aides of his government takeover model. He heaps praise upon them \u2013 and then announces he is going to bury them with government.\n\nThis bait-and-switch approach is working less and less. And sometimes, for some, it never works at all. Remember this?\n\nObama Loves Mayo, But Mayo Does Not Love Him\n\nThroughout his push for (ObamaCare), President Obama has (repeatedly) held up the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota as an example of great medicine at lower prices \u2013 something that could and should be emulated all over the country with guidance from his health care overhaul\u2026.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic does not approve. And, as he\u2019s pointed out, they should know.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are some positive provisions in the current House Tri-Committee bill \u2013 including insurance for all and payment reform demonstration projects \u2013 the proposed legislation misses the opportunity to help create higher-quality, more affordable health care for patients. In fact, it will do the opposite.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, Mayo was exactly right.\n\nAnd let us not forget the many private companies who supported ObamaCare \u2013 but then experienced grievous endorsers\u2019 remorse. For instance:\n\nInsurers Regret Backing ObamaCare\n\nNow the President wants to do to the Internet what he\u2019s done to health care.\n\nDramatically increase regulations on private companies \u2013 which will demolish the private sector. And steamroll state laws and dramatically increase federal government funding of local government Internet providers \u2013 to replace the private sector he demolished.\n\nAnd the President has picked his government Internet visual aide.\n\nObama Touts Municipal Web in Cedar Falls, Where Everyone\u2019s Wired\n\nObama used the the well-wired city of Cedar Falls, Iowa, which provides broadband access that\u2019s almost 100 times faster than the national average, as an example for the rest of the country.\n\n(The President said) \u201cIf you live, or have a business in Cedar Falls, you can get a \u2018gig\u2019 \u2026 for less than many Americans pay for premium cable.\u201d\n\nExcept:\n\nObama Lied: Broadband Speeds Aren\u2019t Faster or Cheaper in Cedar Falls\n\n(Cedar Falls\u2019) 1 gig service\u2026costs more than the most expensive programming packages offered by Comcast, Time Warner Cable, DIRECTV, and DISH Network\u2026.\n\n(And) there is no evidence that Internet speeds in Cedar Falls are \u201calmost 100 times faster than the national average.\u201d This statement in the White House \u201cfact sheet\u201d assumes that the national average download speed is about 10 megabits per second (a Gbps is equivalent to 1,000 Mbps).\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what the President meant by this, but it fails to pass muster no matter how it\u2019s construed.\n\nOh \u2013 and:\n\nObama\u2019s Favorite Internet Provider Hates His Net-Neutrality Plan\n\nIn a filing made public Tuesday, Cedar Falls Utilities argued that Obama\u2019s net-neutrality plan would burden the company with unnecessary federal regulations.\n\nBetty Zeman, an executive for Cedar Falls Utilities, along with representatives from other small Internet providers, met with FCC staff last week\u2026.\n\n(They said) the president\u2019s net-neutrality plan would hurt the finances of small providers and hamper their ability to expand their services, the industry representatives said.\u2026\n\nThe small Internet service providers warned that the move could also empower the FCC to enact other regulations, such as price controls.\n\nWhen Big Brother has lost Little Brothers \u2013 the local-government-run \u201ccompanies\u201d to whom Big Brother is pledging to give tens of billions of dollars (more than he already has) \u2013 just how far from the path has he strayed?\n\nAnd what do you want to bet that many, many, MANY of the private companies (and just about everyone else) that currently support President Obama\u2019s Internet takeover \u2013 end up like the aforementioned health insurers? Deeply regretting that they ever said anything positive about dramatically more government in their sector.\n\nThe only question is \u2013 how does anyone not see coming the government\u2019s next inevitable, disastrous failure?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "How does anyone not see coming the government\u2019s next inevitable, disastrous failure?", "title": "Obama's Internet power grab visual aide hates his Net Neutrality | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/491651817-480x375.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/02/09/obamas-internet-power-grab-visual-aide-hates-his-net-neutrality/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "How does anyone not see coming the government\u2019s next inevitable, disastrous failure?", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/491651817-480x375.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "How does anyone not see coming the government\u2019s next inevitable, disastrous failure?"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fcd\"", "article_summary": "So he likes to cite successful private sector endeavors as alleged, though-actually-antithetical visual aides of his government takeover model.\nDramatically increase regulations on private companies \u2013 which will demolish the private sector.\nAnd steamroll state laws and dramatically increase federal government funding of local government Internet providers \u2013 to replace the private sector he demolished.\nBetty Zeman, an executive for Cedar Falls Utilities, along with representatives from other small Internet providers, met with FCC staff last week\u2026.\nAnd let us not forget the many private companies who supported ObamaCare \u2013 but then experienced grievous endorsers\u2019 remorse."}
