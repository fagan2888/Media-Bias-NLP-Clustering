As the company\u2019s contract with Moncks Corner-based electric utility Santee Cooper was to expire at year\u2019s end, Bless wanted to start the new year buying all of Mount Holly\u2019s power on the open market. Santee Cooper officials refused, saying the proposal would raise rates for its other industrial customers. The two sides were deadlocked for months.\n\nThen, in mid-December \u2014 as the first of Mount Holly\u2019s two pot lines was shut down, leading to layoffs for half of the plant\u2019s workers \u2014 Bless and local politicians forged their agreement. Mount Holly would continue to buy some of its power from Santee Cooper for the next six months until a new law, passed during the upcoming legislative session, gave Century the right to buy power from the cheapest source available.\n\nThe agreement saved 300 jobs from the outset, and Bless said he plans to bring back the rest of Mount Holly\u2019s workers as the plant ramps up to full capacity through 2016.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Century Aluminum chief Michael Bless fights for Berkeley plant jobs, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Century Aluminum,Michael Bless,Mount Holly,Santee Cooper", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Just days before Century Aluminum\u2019s Mount Holly smelter was due to shut down, probably for good, Michael Bless was still working to strike a deal that would save at least some of the 35-year-old plant\u2019s 600 jobs and nearly $1 billion in", "title": "Century Aluminum chief Michael Bless fights for Berkeley plant jobs", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151227/151229596/century-aluminum-chief-michael-bless-fights-for-berkeley-plant-jobs", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151227/PC16/151229596/AR/0/AR-151229596.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151227/PC16/151229596/AR/0/AR-151229596.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just days before Century Aluminum\u2019s Mount Holly smelter was due to shut down, probably for good, Michael Bless was still working to strike a deal that would save at least some of the 35-year-old plant\u2019s 600 jobs and nearly $1 billion in", "title": "Century Aluminum chief Michael Bless fights for Berkeley plant jobs", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151227/PC16/151229596/AR/0/AR-151229596.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151229596}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Century Aluminum chief Michael Bless fights for Berkeley plant jobs , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Century Aluminum,Michael Bless,Mount Holly,Santee Cooper", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T09:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-24T15:04:00Z", "author": "David Wren"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Just days before Century Aluminum\u2019s Mount Holly smelter was due to shut down, probably for good, Michael Bless was still working to strike a deal that would save at least some of the 35-year-old plant\u2019s 600 jobs and nearly $1 billion in"}, "article_summary": "Making aluminum takes a lot of electricity \u2014 about $150 million worth a year at the Mount Holly plant.\nThe agreement saved 300 jobs from the outset, and Bless said he plans to bring back the rest of Mount Holly\u2019s workers as the plant ramps up to full capacity through 2016.\nSantee Cooper officials refused, saying the proposal would raise rates for its other industrial customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pulling every lever we can,\u201d Bless, Century\u2019s president and CEO, said of his last-minute negotiations with state lawmakers on a plan to keep Mount Holly open.\nThen, in mid-December \u2014 as the first of Mount Holly\u2019s two pot lines was shut down, leading to layoffs for half of the plant\u2019s workers \u2014 Bless and local politicians forged their agreement."}
