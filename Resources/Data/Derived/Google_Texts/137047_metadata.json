And maybe the UN, which says it represents the voice of the world, should take notice. After all, the UN\u2019s own poll shows that the people don\u2019t care about \u201cclimate change,\u201d and for good reasons that don\u2019t comport with the UN\u2019s aims.\n\nVia a Watts Up With That post by Willis Eschenbach comes word of a recent poll released by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) gauging what the people of the world are most concerned about.\n\nThe poll \u2014 answered by millions \u2014 asked the world about its most vital concerns. Among the choices were \u201ca good eduction,\u201d \u201cbetter healthcare,\u201d \u201caccess to clean water,\u201d and \u201cprotection against crime and violence.\u201d The survey\u2019s 16 questions even asked how important \u201cfreedom from discrimination and persecution\u201d was to their lives, as well as \u201cpolitical freedoms.\u201d Those last two are pretty vital to anyone in the world who yearns for a tolerable quality of life.\n\nThe survey also asked how important \u201caction taken on climate change\u201d was to their lives and outlook on the world. That last bit came in dead last.\n\nAs Willis writes at WUWT:\n\nThe revealed truth is that of the sixteen choices given to people regarding what they think are the important issues in their lives, climate change is dead last. Not only that, but in every sub-category, by age, by sex, by education, by country grouping, it\u2019s right down at the bottom of the list. NOBODY thinks it\u2019s important. Now, people are always saying how the US is some kind of outlier in this regard, because polls in the US always put climate change down at the bottom, whereas polls in Europe generally rate it somewhat higher. But this is a global poll, with people chiming in from all over the planet. The top fifteen countries, in order of the number of people voting, were Mexico, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Philippines, Thailand, Cameroon, United States, Ghana, Rwanda, Brazil, Jordan, and Morocco \u2026 so this appears to be truly representative of the world, which is mostly non-industrialized nations. So the next time someone tries to claim that climate change is \u201cthe most important challenge facing the world\u201d \u2026 point them to the website of the study, and gently inform them that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t buy that kind of alarmist hogwash for one minute. People are not as stupid as their leaders think, folks know what\u2019s important and what\u2019s trivial in their lives, and trying to control the climate is definitely in the latter group.\n\nThis raises the question of \u201cwhy\u201d? Why, if global warming is the least-important factor in the lives of the people of the world, do the leaders of the world put curing \u201cclimate change\u201d at the top of their priority list? Maybe it\u2019s because the United Nations has proven it can\u2019t organize the world to competently address healthcare, or equality between men and women, or better transport and roads, or better job opportunities. You know, the kind of stuff that industrialized societies handle pretty well.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: The reason why the United Nations and the world\u2019s governments focus on fighting climate change is because that mission gives them license to control everything about the economy of every state in the world. When you control the economy of a state, you better control its people \u2014 and state control is the inverse of individual liberty. In short, the world\u2019s leaders focus on what no actual people care about \u2014 climate change \u2014 as a pretense to usurp your freedom.\n\nEveryone who cherishes his or her liberty cannot continue to be passive about the question of \u201cman-caused climate change.\u201d That notion is a myth, and you must say so a publicly and often as possible. Humans are not causing a climate crisis that warrants our economy and our lives managed by our \u201cbetters.\u201d\n\nShare with your friends the videos from The Heartland Institute\u2019s nine International Conferences on Climate Change.
