The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is joining the University of Iowa and the University of California-Santa Barbara in a research study attempting to understand the long-term impact of disasters on families.

The study is hoping for input from victims of the Waldo Canyon fire in 2012 as well as the 2013 Black Forest fire.

Both fires destroyed hundreds of Colorado homes.

According to the researchers, participants and their children will take a 20-minute survey on their lives since the fire, family communication and any feelings of stress and anxiety.

Another survey would be taken six months after the first, and a third a year later.

“They’re trying to find ways to help families become more resilient in the face of these disasters,” Carolyn Hughes Bluhm said. Bluhm, who works for the city of Denver’s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, is helping distribute the survey.

She and her family were evacuated in the Black Forest fire.

Bluhm said the project started in response to wildfires that struck California in 2012.

Participants and their children each will receive a $5 online gift certificate for the first survey, increasing to $10 for the second and $15 gift certificate for the third. Parents will also be entered into a drawing for a $200 gift certificate for each survey.
