Here are the people on the vanguard in 2013 \u2014 and those whom history has somewhat left behind.\n\nWINNER: Jason Collins\n\nCollins, a career NBA player, came out of the closet this year and would have been the first gay athlete in a major U.S. sport had he been picked up by a team for another season. Even still, his confession in the pages of Sports Illustrated set a classy example for those athletes who might follow in his footsteps \u2014 like Olympic diver Tom Daley, who came out later in the year. Other stars who were already out continued to triumph (between Tony and Emmy hosting gigs and a lucrative final season of \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d Neil Patrick Harris looks more and more each day like the most universally beloved all-around entertainer) and stars who came out were generally greeted with admiration for both their bravery and the lack of interest they had in publicity mileage \u2014 actor and writer Wentworth Miller came out in protest of Russian laws, while actress Maria Bello wrote about her relationship with a woman in order to make a statement about what a family looks like.\n\nLOSER: The NFL, still\n\nThough there\u2019s been much speculation that there are closeted gay NFL stars, there has never been an out player in America\u2019s most macho pastime. Perhaps that\u2019s because opinions like those of San Francisco 49er Chris Culliver, who said before last year\u2019s Super Bowl that a gay player would not be welcome on his team. While Culliver\u2019s in the minority as someone who goes there publicly, attitudes like his are still far from rare. An NFL player coming out in the future (it has to happen someday!) will surely be a huge news story \u2014 and would silence the Cullivers of the world.\n\nLOSER: Howard Kurtz\n\nThe Daily Beast media critic took the occasion of Collins\u2019s coming-out to make bizarre and false claims about Collins having misled the public over his past engagement to a woman. Kurtz is a dolt who gets plenty wrong, but Collins was an easy target for this strange smear, as Kurtz tried to convince the public and himself that a newly out man was somehow disingenuous. He ended up losing his job, and now is among like-minded folks at Fox News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This was a huge year for the gay rights movement.
