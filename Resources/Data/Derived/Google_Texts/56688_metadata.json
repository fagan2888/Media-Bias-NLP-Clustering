Initially, police failed to hand over a second tape, until additional evidence surfaced of a second police car at the scene, the news station reports. The tape showed Jeter complying with police, even as one punched him repeatedly in the head.\n\nNow, prosecutors have dismissed all the criminal charges against Jeter, who faced five years in prison, and indicted two Bloomfield police officers for falsifying reports. One officer was indicted for assault after the recording showed police beating Jeter during a traffic stop, the report says. A third has pleaded guilty to tampering.\n\nThe incident began when cops were called to the Bloomfield home where Jeter, a DJ, lives with his girlfriend. Initially, charges were not filed, and Jeter says he left after briefly talking to officers. But later, camera footage shows police, with guns drawn, stopping him on the side of a highway. Jeter, whose hands were up during the encounter, told ABC 7\u2019s Sarah Wallace that he did not exit the vehicle because he was afraid.\n\n\"It was incredible, I didn't believe it at that point in time,\" he said. \"The next thing I know, one of them busts the door and there is glass all over my face.\"\n\nThen he told Wallace that the officers were hitting him and telling him not to resist arrest.\n\n\"All I keep saying is I'm not doing anything,\" he told Wallace. \"They handcuffed me and one of them hits me in the back.\"\n\nAs soon as prosecutors reviewed the video, they dismissed all of the charges against Jeter.\n\n\u201cI believe the blame is with the Bloomfield police department for not providing that tape,\u201d Brown told Wallace. \u201cIf we hadn't had the tapes in this case, an innocent man would be in jail today.\"\n\nRead more at ABC 7 New York.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The officers were indicted on charges of falsifying reports and one for assault.", "sailthru.author": "Lynette Holloway", "description": "The officers were indicted on charges of falsifying reports and one for assault.", "author": "Lynette Holloway", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"NJ Man Freed After Police Dash Cam Shows Abuse, Cops Indicted\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/02/nj_man_freed_after_police_dash_cam_footage_shows_abuse_cops_indicted.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.theroot.com/content/dam/theroot/new%20jersey-man-cleared-by-police-dash-cam-cops-indicted.png.CROP.hd-medium.png\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100140223004\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-23T09:44:56Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Culture\",\n  \"author\": \"Lynette Holloway\",\n  \"tags\": [\"Breaking\"]\n}", "twitter": {"description": "Thirty-year-old Marcus Jeter of Bloomfield, N.J., was facing a five-year prison sentence until he was freed by evidence from a dashboard camera on the police cruiser of the very officers who falsified reports, according to ABC 7 New York.
