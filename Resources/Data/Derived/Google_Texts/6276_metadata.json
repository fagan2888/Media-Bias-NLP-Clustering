If the court rules against the White House and strikes the subsidies, Republicans say they want to be ready to protect the more than 6 million people who could lose their subsidies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn a closed-door meeting Wednesday, Republicans crafted the outline of a plan that would extend the subsidies for a period of time \u2014 potentially through 2017 \u2014 and couple it with a delayed repeal of big-ticket pieces of Obamacare, such as the individual and employer mandates.\n\nDemocrats are unlikely to embrace any plan that derails the health law and President Barack Obama has said he would veto any bill that hurts his signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nRepublicans plan to frame the extension as a way to help people who would lose subsidies because of the law\u2019s flawed construction, not as an extension of Obamacare. Sources said they may even call it a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of the existing subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be prepared,\u201d said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t call them subsidies. But we\u2019d certainly keep people whole so that they wouldn\u2019t suffer because of this interim time.\u201d\n\nHatch and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that restoring the subsidies through the end of 2017 is on the table, although other sources said that no timeline had been determined. That timeline would give the next president the ability to craft a replacement health plan. Insurers will also be watching the timeline closely as they set rates many months before a plan year begins.\n\nNo specific legislation has been selected as a response, senators said, although there are pieces of bills written by GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Ben Sasse of Nebraska that Republicans mulled over at the meeting.\n\nRepublicans will look to point the finger at President Barack Obama, not the Supreme Court, on behalf of the 6.4 million people who suddenly find themselves without subsidies.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s the No 1. consideration \u2014 that people aren\u2019t hurt any more by Obamacare,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas.) \u201cBe clear that this is because of the way this law is written if the court happens to strike down [the subsidies]. It\u2019s not the Supreme Court\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not the people who voted against it. It\u2019s the people who voted for this bill.\u201d\n\nThe struggle for Republicans will be to protect the people who lose subsidies while not looking like they\u2019re embracing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cNobody said that it would be an easy needle to thread, but I think that we\u2019re well on our way to doing that,\u201d said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).\n\n\u201cI think it will be clear that on the one hand we want to make sure that we protect anybody currently in a plan so that they\u2019re not hurt but at the same time that we intend to end Obamacare,\u201d said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).\n\nAfter the Wednesday meeting, several Republicans said there was broad consensus for the outline of the plan but cautioned that the details will be important \u2014 and all of it could change depending on the wording of the court\u2019s ruling. If the court sides with the challengers, it could delay its ruling taking effect for an indefinite period of time.\n\nThe GOP goal before the ruling is to get its fractured conference in the same place \u2014 then link across chambers with House members to make sure that congressional Republicans are all on the same page. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has spoken out against a long-term extension of the subsidies, did not speak in the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that we need to be ready immediately. And it would be good to have a unified response, and when I mean unified I mean not just the Senate but the House as well,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, a former House member.\n\nOne of the Republicans\u2019 biggest fears is that the Supreme Court decision will be handed down during a congressional recess, leaving lawmakers strewn across the country and unable to mount a concerted response to the president\u2019s bully pulpit. So much of the Senate discussion revolved around how to talk about their response in a way that makes clear the GOP is not on board with Obamacare.\n\nTheir talking points are short and sweet: Talk about aiding the more than 6 million people who rely on subsidized health insurance via Obamacare, and bash the law\u2019s mandates and make clear that Republicans are aiding people, not the health care law, senators said.\n\n\u201cThere is an overriding concern that we\u2019re all together that we come up with a single strategy and a single position,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nIn the House, several top Republicans met with rank-and-file members Wednesday and outlined a similar plan that is still under development.\n\nUnder the House framework, subsidies would be kept through 2015 if the court doesn\u2019t allow it already. In 2016, states will have the choice of opting out of all ACA rules and regulations.\n\nIf the state chooses to do so, it would get a block grant to set up a health program. If the state doesn\u2019t want the block grant, its residents would still get subsidies to use on any plan on or off the exchange. In 2017, all of this would sunset to encourage a new president to find a new solution.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we give the power, instead of requiring or forcing governors to enter Obamacare, we give them the power to opt out of Obamacare [and] the money to take care of those who are on some form of subsidy for a specific period of time, until we can put in place a full-system replacement,\u201d said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.)\n\nManu Raju and Erin Mershon contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Democrats are unlikely to embrace any plan that derails the health law.", "title": "Senate GOP floats 2-year Obamacare fix", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/senate-republicans-obamacare-scotus-fix-119121.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/17/150617_orrin_hatch_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Senate Republicans,Obamacare,Ben Sasse,John Hoeven,Lindsey Graham,Supreme Court,HealthCare.Gov,Ron Johnson,Republicans,Health Care,Democrats,Richard Burr,Orrin Hatch,John Cornyn", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Democrats are unlikely to embrace any plan that derails the health law.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Senate GOP floats 2-year Obamacare fixSenate Republicans are coalescing around a plan to extend Obamacare subsidies for up to two years if the Supreme Court strikes them this month.\nThat timeline would give the next president the ability to craft a replacement health plan.\nRepublicans plan to frame the extension as a way to help people who would lose subsidies because of the law\u2019s flawed construction, not as an extension of Obamacare.\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s the No 1. consideration \u2014 that people aren\u2019t hurt any more by Obamacare,\u201d said Sen.
