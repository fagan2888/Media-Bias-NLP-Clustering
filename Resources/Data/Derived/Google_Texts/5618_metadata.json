However, after Boston Red Sox player David Ortiz snapped a pic with POTUS last week, selifes may be banned from the White House.\n\nOrtiz, aka Big Papi, took a photo with the President last week, during the Red Sox\u2019s visit to the White House in honor of the team\u2019s 2013 World Series win. The problem? The baseball player had an agreement with Samsung. Ortiz tweeted the picture that was taken on his Galaxy Note 3, which was then retweeted and promoted by Samsung.\n\nAnd thanks to Ortiz, the photo policy might change at the White House, according to senior White House advisor Dan Pfeiffer.\n\nIn an interview with Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation, Pfeiffer said that there is a possibility that there will be no more Obama selfies. Schieffer brought up the incident asking about the President\u2019s take on the situation.\n\n\u201cHe obviously didn\u2019t know anything about Samsung\u2019s connection to this,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cAnd perhaps maybe this will be the end of all selfies.\u201d\n\nHe added that it\u2019s a problem when people attempt to use the President to promote their products.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney, however, tried to tamp down fears of a selfie ban Monday, saying Pfeiffer wasn\u2019t being all that serious.\n\nAccording to Pfeiffer, the White House has expressed their concerns to Samsung about the promotional stunt. He refused to further comment on the subject saying that he will \u201cleave that to the lawyers.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney, however, tried to tamp down fears of a selfie ban Monday, saying that there has been \u201cno discussion\u201d of such a policy and that Pfeiffer wasn\u2019t being all that serious.\n\n\u201cHe was saying, I think, humorously, the end of all selfies, and I don\u2019t think he just meant the White House,\u201d Carney said.\n\nRegardless, a ban on presidential selfies may not be such a bad thing after the last Obama selfie incident, which involved Nelson Mandela\u2019s memorial service.\n\n(This piece has been updated.)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Everyone loves taking a good selfie, even President Barack Obama.
