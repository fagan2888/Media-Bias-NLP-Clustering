The Jackrabbits dropped to 5-2 overall and 2-2 in league play.\n\n\n\nThe game was a defensive battle throughout and remained scoreless until late in the first half, when Michael Schmadeke connected on a 24-yard field goal. Schmadeke\u2019s kick capped an 11-play, 92-yard drive that started at the UNI 2-yard line and included a 41-yard run by Bailey.\n\n\n\nSDSU put together its longest drive of the game on its second possession of the third quarter. Backup quarterback Taryn Christion completed a pass for 41 yards to Jake Wieneke on third down and later threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Connor Landberg that gave the Jackrabbits a 7-3 lead following the extra point by Jay Carlson.\n\n\n\nUNI responded on its next possession, taking advantage of a Jackrabbit penalty and picking up the remaining 64 yards of the five-play, 79-yard drive on the ground. Bailey scampered up the middle for the final 35 yards for the touchdown with 6 minutes and four seconds remaining in the third quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Jackrabbits stopped UNI short of a first down on fourth-and-2 from the SDSU 22 midway through the fourth quarter and were on their way to either tying the game or taking the lead. Helped by a pair of Panther penalties and two passes from Christion to Wieneke that totaled 31 yards, SDSU was faced with fourth-and-1 from the UNI 10 with under two minutes to play.\n\n\n\nRather than opting to attempt a field goal that would likely have forced overtime, the Jackrabbits decided to go for it and were stuffed on a rushing attempt by Kyle Paris as Panther rover Tim Kilfoy tackled Paris for a loss.\n\n\n\nUNI\u2019s defense recorded 12 tackles for loss, including five sacks. Karter Schult tallied four tackles for loss, including three sacks, while Brett McMakin registered 10 stops.\n\n\n\nBailey and the Panthers then ran out the clock, with Bailey sealing the win with a 17-yard run for a first down.\n\n\n\nUNI held a 336-259 advantage in total offense, including a 223-95 edge on the ground. Tyvis Smith added 54 yards on 12 carries. Bailey completed 8-of-17 passes for 113 yards, with Charles Brown notching three catches for 29 yards.\n\n\n\nFor the Jackrabbits, Christion was the leading ground-gainer, carrying 16 times for 61 yards, while completing 15-of-20 passes for 156 yards. Paris added 12 carries for 30 yards and Wieneke led the receiving corps with four catches for 85 yards.\n\n\n\nZach Lujan returned to the Jackrabbit starting lineup at quarterback after missing the last two games due to injury, but ran only two offensive series. Lujan completed 1-of-5 passes for eight yards.\n\n\n\nJesse Bobbit shared game-high honors with 10 tackles for the Jackrabbits. T.J. Lally was credited with eight stops.\n\n\n\nSDSU returns to action Oct. 31 at Missouri State. Kickoff is slated for 2 p.m.\n\n\n\nNOTES: Northern Iowa leads the all-time series, 29-19-2 \u2026 SDSU dropped to 59-38-5 in its 102 Hobo Day games, including a 31-23 mark at Coughlin-Alumni Stadium \u2026 the Jackrabbits fell for the third consecutive year on Hobo Day, with all three games decided by three points \u2026 Je Ryan Butler set a Jackrabbit career record with 66 punt returns, breaking the mark of 63 previously held by Paul Aanonson from 2004-07 \u2026 Bobbit recorded double figures in tackles for the fourth time this season \u2026 SDSU committed eight penalties for 75 yards, while UNI was flagged seven times for 66 yards \u2026 the Jackrabbits were 5 of 14 on third-down attempts, compared to 3 of 12 by UNI \u2026 the attendance of 16,042 was the fifth-largest crowd in Coughlin-Alumni Stadium history and the second largest for a Hobo Day, trailing the crowd of 16,193 for the 1985 Hobo Day game against South Dakota\n\n\n\nJason Hove\n\nAssistant AD-Sports Information\n\nSouth Dakota State University\n\n\n\nCollege {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 Associated Press.
