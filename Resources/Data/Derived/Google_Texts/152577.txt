Rihanna finally dyed her hair red again, and all is right with the world.

Rihanna is so beautiful, did you know that? Do you have eyes? Is your vision unimpaired? Then of course you know, because you can see, and Rihanna’s beauty is not a matter of opinion. Disagree? This website may help. She looks good with makeup, without it, with clothes, without them. Rihanna could wear a loose-fitting trash bag while dumpster-diving for candy corn and it would be considered a Fashion Moment.

What do you remember about 2010? Do you remember that Obamacare was signed into law that year? No. You remember Rihanna’s red hair, because she is an icon and that look was major. Fans have long lamented the loss of that bold shade, but now that it’s back we can all breathe steady again, sleep well again, finally live our lives once more. There is a Goddess, and Her name is Rihanna.

The “Bitch Better Have My Money” singer first debuted a reddish-brown bob at the 2015 Met Gala, but the blogosphere did not care nearly as much as it should have because did you see her yellow cape? It was like seven million canaries were skinned alive and sewn together, but in such a beautiful way.

We figured that bob was as close as we’d get to Loud-era Rihanna, but then she was seen walking around and her hair was red and it was long and all the terrible things that have happened over the past five years suddenly faded into the recesses of our minds, because nothing else matters.

Have you ever had red hair? It is an impossible color to maintain. But Rihanna’s red could fade into that brassy, orange-brown sewer-water looking mess and still look good on her. We’re ready for it, Rihanna.

You can — and should — check out a photo of Rihanna’s red hair over at MTV.
