That law gives the administration some leeway to define the rules.\n\nThe law requires most workers to be paid overtime \u2014 1.5 times their regular wages \u2014 if they work more than 40 hours per week. The law allows exemptions for executives, managers and professional workers and sets the salary threshold above which workers don\u2019t have to get overtime pay. The law also gives employers leeway to define workers as supervisors, and thus ineligible for overtime, even if they spend much of their work day performing non-supervisory work.\n\nNew rules would likely establish a minimum amount of managerial duties that a worker would have to carry out to be exempt from overtime.\n\nThe rules are aimed at workers currently designated as supervisory employees but exempt from overtime because they get paid a salary of more than $455 a week, or $23,660 a year. Obama ordered the Labor Department to recommend regulations that would increase that salary threshold and change the definition of what constitutes a supervisor.\n\nPerez did not elaborate on why the delay was necessary.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that our proposal, which we expect to release in the coming months, is informed by as many stakeholder views as possible,\u201d he told the House Education and Workforce Committee.\n\nThe salary limit separating those who get overtime and those who don\u2019t was increased to $455 in 2004 during the Bush administration. At the time, it hadn\u2019t been increased since the mid-1970s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new overtime rule could result in larger paychecks for millions of workers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The new overtime rule could result in larger paychecks for millions of workers.", "title": "Labor Secretary: New Overtime Rules Coming Soon", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/labor-secretary-new-overtime-rules-coming-soon/203514/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Overtime_Muha.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new overtime rule could result in larger paychecks for millions of workers.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Overtime_Muha.jpg", "title": "Labor Secretary: New Overtime Rules Coming Soon", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "workers\u2019 rights", "published_time": "2015-03-19T11:12:55-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Labor Secretary: New Overtime Rules Coming SoonThe new rule could result in larger paychecks for millions of workers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually working overtime on this,\u201d Perez told a House panel.\nNew rules would likely establish a minimum amount of managerial duties that a worker would have to carry out to be exempt from overtime.\nThe law requires most workers to be paid overtime \u2014 1.5 times their regular wages \u2014 if they work more than 40 hours per week.\nThe salary limit separating those who get overtime and those who don\u2019t was increased to $455 in 2004 during the Bush administration."}
