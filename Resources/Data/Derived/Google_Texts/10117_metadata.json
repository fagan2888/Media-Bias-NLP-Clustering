Held believes patients will suffer under the new health care law.\n\nYou see, health insurance has evolved such that insurers and government have inserted themselves smack-dab in the middle of the once sacred patient-doctor relationship. I am called a provider- not a doctor. My patient is now yours- not mine. What I can do as a physician now has strangulating strings and nonsensical numbers attached- to you and government and money-not the best interests of the patients. Obamacare, the \u201claw of the land\u201d, contains ever-changing-at-the-whim-of-HHS, politically-expedient mandates, rewards, penalties, rules and regulations with which I cannot rationally or morally treat my patients and run a practice, much-less interpret, implement, or comply.\n\nHeld goes on to say that both doctors and patients are commodified under the new law and now must endure \u201cimpersonal, inconsiderate, and cavalier treatment.\u201d She sees Obamacare as collusion:\n\nIt saddens me to think of the decreased access to care from actual physicians and the shockingly increased costs Aetna patients will now experience because of your choice to collude with big government rather than collaborate with patients and physicians.\n\nIt seems that Held is stuck in this relationship a bit longer, as she tweeted that she is contractually obligated to Aetna for another year, whether she likes it or not. One hopes that a doctor with such high standards will continue to treat her patients well, despite her obvious disregard for Obamacare.\n\nRead \u201cTexas Doctor Writes Epic Letter Breaking Up With Insurance Company: I Will Not Comply\u201d at Independent Journal Review.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Kristin Held, a Texas physician, wrote a \"Dear John\" letter to Aetna, one insurance provider under which she works that now mandates Obamacare.
