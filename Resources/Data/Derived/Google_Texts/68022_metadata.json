They\u2019re going to have to keep waiting.\n\nThe Commerce Department on Monday said personal spending was essentially flat in April \u2014it fell less than 0.1 percent \u2014 even as personal income rose a better-than-expected 0.4 percent. Americans made more money in April but they didn\u2019t spend more. Instead, they socked it away, raising the savings rate \u2014 personal savings as a percentage of disposable income \u2014 from 5.2 percent in March to 5.6 percent in April.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Could Be Squeezing Consumer Spending\u200b\u200b\n\nThe April spending picture was the reverse of that from March, when incomes growth stalled but spending rose. Overall, though, Americans still look to be hesitant about opening up their wallets.\n\n\u201cThis report clearly indicates that the bounce back in March did not continue into April,\u201d Chris G. Christopher, Jr., director of consumer economics at HIS Global Insight, said in a note to clients. \u201cIt is becoming blatantly obvious that the so-called consumer gasoline price dividend is not motivating the average American household to increase their discretionary spending in any meaningful manner.\u201d\n\nEnergy prices have risen lately, but they are still down 20 percent from where they were a year ago, notes PNC Senior Macroeconomist Gus Faucher. Eventually, that should still translate to more spending as long as the job market recovery continues apace.\n\n\u201cClearly, consumption is hardly booming, but the lag between declines in gas prices and the response in the spending numbers is long, typically six or seven months,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomcs, said in a note to clients. \u201cGas prices did begin to fall rapidly until November, with the biggest single drop in January, so we don't expect to see consumption accelerate properly until the summer.\u201d\n\nFor now, the economists \u2014 and the economy \u2014 keep waiting.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Economists have been waiting for a surge in consumer spending fueled by savings at the gas pump and a stronger job market boosting personal incomes.
