Frequently, these complaints include traffic congestion, blocked roadways and overall confusion prior to the deputy\u2019s arrival. The responding deputy is duty-bound to first assist with any injuries, then to establish traffic control and gradually ease traffic congestion if possible. Impatient drivers who take it personally that their travel has been delayed and decide to pass on the shoulder make the situation worse, endanger lives, and are subject to arrest.\n\nWe\u2019ve all witnessed the frustrating sight of a driver attempting to bypass a traffic jam by using the shoulder as his own personal lane, with total disregard for the line of people waiting their turn. Here are the risks:\n\nTicket. Riding the shoulder and using the shoulder as a lane\u2026 if not an emergency or highway vehicle\u2026 is illegal. If caught, you could be issued a citation or be arrested.\n\nCollision. Although it is illegal, you may not be the only driver who is willing to take the risk of being caught. Therefore, the shoulder may appear to be clear as you drive down it, but other cars may break the law as well, moving into your path without warning.\n\nPreventing authorized vehicles from getting through. The shoulder is specifically used for emergency personnel to be able to get through at times of traffic jams. If you find yourself blocking the shoulder when an emergency vehicle is trying to get through, you not only suffer the consequences of legal ramifications, but you may also be liable for damages sustained if you prevented or delayed an ambulance, a fire truck, or a police car from getting to a victim.\n\nJail time. Any officer who has probable cause to issue a citation also has probable cause for physical arrest. A citation is a summons for court, which is considered a form of arrest. So, according to the discretion of the officer, you could find yourself behind bars.\n\nThe law in Louisiana is clear. LA R.S. 32:74 states\u2026 \u201c\u2026 The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only under conditions permitting such movement in safety. In no event shall such movement be made by driving off the pavement or main traveled portion of the highway.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless specifically directed to do so by a deputy on the scene\u2026 for instance a deputy directing traffic flow onto the shoulder in order to move traffic around a crash scene\u2026 passing on the shoulder, even in a traffic jam, is illegal and dangerous,\" said St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz.\n\nThe above information is intended for information purposes only and not for legal advice.
