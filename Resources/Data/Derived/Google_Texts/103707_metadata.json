If the Legislature passes a fuel tax, we will work with others to refer it to the ballot,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOregon\u2019s clean fuels program was created in 2009 as part of a multistate attempt to create a biofuels mandate throughout the West Coast. California and British Columbia are already enforcing their programs.\n\nBut the initial legislation in Oregon included a sunset date at the end of this year. Democrats narrowly voted early in this year\u2019s legislative session to remove the sunset, allowing the program to take effect beginning next year. The program seeks to reduce carbon emissions from transportation in Oregon by 7.7 million tons by 2025.\n\nAfter the vote to implement the program, Republicans said they wouldn\u2019t support a gas tax increase needed to fund road and bridge construction unless lawmakers repealed the low-carbon fuel standard.\n\nGov. Kate Brown convened a group of lawmakers who tried to repeal and replace the clean fuels program with a different biofuel blending program and greenhouse gas-cutting measures such as incentives for electric vehicles. But the high-wire attempt fell apart late in the session, leaving the clean fuels program in place.\n\nUnder the program, oil companies in Oregon will need to gradually lower their fuels\u2019 carbon intensity \u2014 a measure of the amount of greenhouse gases that will be released into the atmosphere \u2014 or buy credits to comply with the law. Credits are generated when companies produce fuel that has a lower carbon intensity than required.\n\nThose credits sold at an average of $34 per credit in California from 2012 through 2014, according to that state\u2019s most recent figures through September. In Oregon, one credit is equal to one ton of carbon reductions.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 406-589-4347,\n\ntanderson@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALEM \u2014 In another victory for Oregon\u2019s low-carbon fuel standard, a federal judge threw out a challenge to the biofuels legislation that seeks to lower carbon emissions from gasoline burned in the state.
