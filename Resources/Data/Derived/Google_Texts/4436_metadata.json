Many veterans fall in the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d \u2014 earning too little to buy private insurance but too much to qualify for Medicaid in Missouri \u2014 which affects about 300,000 citizens. According to Silvey, there are an estimated 22,000 veterans and their spouses that are not receiving health care, however it is unclear whether or not that number includes children and extended family.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem we\u2019ve identified, and I\u2019m trying to solve it,\u201d said Silvey.\n\nHe plans to propose the Veterans Family Healthcare Act later today, which will specifically target veterans. The bill will expand Medicaid access to any veteran making 138 percent of the federal poverty level, mirroring the broader Medicaid expansion legislation supported by Missouri Democrats and a small number of Republicans.\n\nThe move comes as Silvey and his party\u2019s leadership are likely to clash later this year over expanding Medicaid in Missouri as called for in the Affordable Care Act. Silvey, who serves as Vice Chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations committee, is a proponent of a \u201cconservative\u201d plan to expand Medicaid, and the latest move to begin discussions around expansion as it relates strictly to veterans is no doubt a move with deep political implications as well.\n\n\u201cIf we are already OK with having the debate of increasing the asset limit [for Medicaid] or adding back the procedures that we recently cut, then we ought to be putting money into taking care of our veterans with the health care system that we have,\u201d Silvey said.\n\nDewey Riehn, member of MAVO, stated that the organization would not testify one way or another in terms of Medicaid expansion for everyone. Their goal is to focus solely on veterans and their families. While Silvey plans to propose at least four heath care bills this session, is easy to assume that the Veterans Family Healthcare Act will have a higher chance of passing because it is aimed only at veterans.\n\nSilvey expects to file the bill within the next few days.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY \u2014 Earlier today state senator Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City, and the Missouri Association of Veterans Organizations (MAVO) joined together to discuss expansion of healthcare coverage for veterans in Missouri.
