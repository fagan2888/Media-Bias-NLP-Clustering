The vote was 53-44.\n\nIf passed, the legislation would have expanded oversight over the central bank and, for the first time, empowered the Government Accountability Office to audit the institution.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., had spearheaded the effort, fast-tracking the legislation in November to ensure a vote this year. Before the vote, Paul drummed up support for the measure, called the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, saying on the Senate floor:\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s monetary policy views\u2014regardless of whether you think interest rates should be higher or lower\u2014everyone can and should agree that for the sake of our country\u2019s economic well-being, we need to know what has been going on behind the Federal Reserve\u2019s cloak of secrecy.\n\nSimilar legislation sponsored by Rep.
