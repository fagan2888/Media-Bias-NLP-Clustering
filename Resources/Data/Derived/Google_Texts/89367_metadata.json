The reigning Super Bowl MVP carried it in for a score on the next play, reaching over the line to convert in a way Kansas City couldn\u2019t Saturday.\n\nBrady threw for two touchdowns to Rob Gronkowski and sneaked for another, and the defending Super Bowl champions reached their fifth straight AFC title game with a 27-20 victory over the Chiefs.\n\nNew England (13-4) will meet the winner of Sunday\u2019s game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for a spot in Super Bowl 50. The Patriots are trying to become the first team to win back-to-back NFL titles since they did it in 2003-04.\n\n\u201cSounds pretty good,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to prepare hard this week. See who we\u2019re playing after tonight\u2019s game and just do what we have to do next week to get ready for the game.\u201d\n\nAfter spending the last two weeks recovering from knee and back injuries, Gronkowski caught seven passes for 83 yards, including touchdowns from 8 and 16 yards out. Gronkowski also recovered an onside kick after Kansas City cut the deficit to 27-20 with just over one minute left.\n\nJulian Edelman returned from a broken foot to catch 10 passes for 100 yards for New England.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just great to have those guys back,\u201d Gronkowski said of wide receivers Edelman and Danny Amendola, who had a quiet game. \u201cThey\u2019re hard workers, they\u2019re great players. The chemistry was clicking tonight.\u201d\n\nAlex Smith completed 29 of 50 passes for 246 yards and one touchdown for Kansas City (12-6). The Chiefs had won 11 consecutive games, including a 30-0 victory over Houston in the wild-card round last week for their first playoff victory since 1993.\n\nBrady led New England to a score on the opening drive, throwing 11 straight passes and completing eight \u2014 the last an 8-yard score to Gronkowski. The Chiefs then made it to the Patriots 16, but settled for a field goal.\n\nAfter trading punts twice, the Patriots started on their when punt returner Danny Amendola was flagged for a helmet-first hit to coverage man Jamell Fleming. The drive was in danger of stalling at the Kansas City 35 when Chiefs linebacker Dezman Moses hit Brady late and was called for roughing the passer.\n\nThe stadium erupted in cheers of \u201cBrady!\u201d \u2014 just as it had four months ago when the four-time Super Bowl champion returned from his looming \u201cDeflategate\u201d suspension to play in the season opener.\n\nFour plays later, unable to find an open receiver, Brady sprinted \u2014 sort of \u2014 for the corner of the end zone. The Chiefs managed to keep him out, but only for one more play. On the next snap, Brady leaned forward and reached into the end zone to make it 14-3.\n\nPatriots defensive lineman Chandler Jones forced Knile Davis\u2019 fumble on the Chiefs\u2019 first possession of the second half, then Brady added another touchdown pass to Gronkowski to make it 21-6.\n\nSmith had the Chiefs into New England territory on their first six possessions, but they managed just six points before he hit Albert Wilson on a 10-yard pass that made it 21-13.\n\nNOTES: Jones started the game, six days after he wandered to the local police station, shirtless and confused. Police said his house reeked of burnt marijuana. \u2026 The Patriots are 18-4 all-time in the playoffs at Gillette Stadium. \u2026 Jon Bon Jovi, a friend of Patriots coach Bill Belichick, was in the owner\u2019s box and led the stadium in a sing-along of his band\u2019s hit song \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer.\u201d \u2026 Belichick reached the conference title game for the 10th time, tied with Tom Landry for most all-time.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patriots to 5th straight AFC title game with victory over Chiefs", "title": "Patriots to 5th straight AFC title game with victory over Chiefs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/patriots-to-5th-straight-afc-title-game-with-victory-over-chiefs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__505308674p1.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__505308674p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T18:00:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:56:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Brady threw for two touchdowns to Rob Gronkowski and sneaked for another, and the defending Super Bowl champions reached their fifth straight AFC title game with a 27-20 victory over the Chiefs.\nThe drive was in danger of stalling at the Kansas City 35 when Chiefs linebacker Dezman Moses hit Brady late and was called for roughing the passer.\nNew England (13-4) will meet the winner of Sunday\u2019s game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for a spot in Super Bowl 50.\nThe Patriots are trying to become the first team to win back-to-back NFL titles since they did it in 2003-04.\nThe Chiefs then made it to the Patriots 16, but settled for a field goal."}
