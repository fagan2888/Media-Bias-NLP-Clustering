“The whole environment is geared to adults having a good time,” said Aaron Herzberg, marijuana legal strategist with Electrum Partners based Irvine, Calif. “Tourists spend money on gambling, going out to clubs, strip bars, drinking, and I imagine a large amount of people will add marijuana to that list of activities to do when visiting Vegas.”

But for now only medicinal use has been approved.

“The motivation of dispensary applicants is that Nevada will have full recreational by 2016 and the business opportunity for that is through the roof,” Herzberg said.

With his legal background, Herzberg assisted several hopefuls with compliance and legal review, legal entity and equity structure, tax issues, land use permitting and developing policy and procedures.

“Locating properties was a huge burden in a short period of time,” he said. More than 520 applications were received by the State of Nevada, and 70% were in Clark County where the city of Las Vegas is located

“I saw people applying without knowing the extent of the commitment they need to make,” said Leslie Bocskor, founding chairman with the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA). “The costs associated with assembling one of these applications in a comprehensive way can approach a million dollars or more and that is all risk capital. Then if you win a license, you need the people and money to execute the business model.”
