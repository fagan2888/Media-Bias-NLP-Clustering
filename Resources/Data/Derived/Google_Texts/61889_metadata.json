His book calls for an alliance between libertarians, conservatives, and progressives to combat the growing ties between big business and government.\n\n>>> At Least 74 Cases of Fraud and Corruption at Ex-Im Bank Since 2009\n\nThe charter for the Ex-Im Bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans to foreign companies and countries to buy U.S. products, expires Sept. 30 unless Congress acts to save the agency. But many conservatives in the Republican-led House indicate they have no plans to reauthorize Ex-Im.\n\nOpponents of the bank, led by Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, argue it furthers cronyism and corporate welfare. Proponents view Ex-Im as a boon to small businesses and job creation, saying it helps small companies remain competitive in the global market.\n\nAfter his speech at Cato, Nader told The Daily Signal the bank should be abolished and warned that government financing for big companies such as Boeing and General Electric reinforces the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d mantra.\n\nDuring the speech, Nader said:\n\nI use the word corporate capitalism to contrast the capitalism we associate with small business who, if they don\u2019t succeed, they\u2019re free to go bankrupt. And big business, if it doesn\u2019t succeed because of mismanagement, crime, or other irregularities, they go to Washington.\n\nIf big businesses do go bankrupt, he said, it immediately becomes \u201ctied to a government bailout.\u201d\n\n>>> A Taxpayer\u2019s Guide: Export-Import Bank Under Microscope at House Hearing\n\nTim Carney, columnist for The Washington Examiner, joined Nader at Cato and said allowing Ex-Im\u2019s charter to expire would be a notable defeat of corporate cronyism:\n\nBefore the last month, nobody ever heard of the Export-Import Bank. \u2026 These are things that if people cared about and knew about, I think they would say it\u2019s a bad idea for U.S. taxpayers to be forced to subsidize Boeing\u2019s sales to the Chinese government.\n\nPresident Obama joins Democrats and at least 40 House Republicans in advocating that the bank be reauthorized by the end of September.\n\nIf the House fails to pass a bill reauthorizing the agency, thus allowing the charter to expire, the Department of Treasury could assume jurisdiction over Ex-Im. Should that occur, the bank would continue to oversee existing loans but lack the authority to enter into new contracts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader calls for abolishing the Export-Income Bank in an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader calls for abolishing the Export-Income Bank in an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal.", "title": "Ralph Nader Calls for Ending 'Secretive' Export-Import Bank", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140627_RalphNader.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-27T19:35:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yVw9do"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader calls for abolishing the Export-Income Bank in an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal.", "title": "Ralph Nader Calls for Ending 'Secretive' Export-Import Bank", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140627_RalphNader.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2014-06-27T18:42:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T19:35:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ralph Nader, Export-Import Bank, Cato Institute, Jeb Hensarling, Tim Carney, Washington Examiner, Unstoppable, Boeing, Barack Obama, Department of Treasury"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6a0\"", "article_summary": "Consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader called for the end of the Export-Import Bank in an exclusive interview today with The Daily Signal.\nHis book calls for an alliance between libertarians, conservatives, and progressives to combat the growing ties between big business and government.\nAnd big business, if it doesn\u2019t succeed because of mismanagement, crime, or other irregularities, they go to Washington.\nNader cited the 80-year-old federal agency as an example of the growing power that big business has over government and said the \u201csecretive\u201d bank perpetuates the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d narrative.\n>>> At Least 74 Cases of Fraud and Corruption at Ex-Im Bank Since 2009The charter for the Ex-Im Bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans to foreign companies and countries to buy U.S. products, expires Sept. 30 unless Congress acts to save the agency."}
