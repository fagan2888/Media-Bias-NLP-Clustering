Yet many providers are still utilizing technology that goes back decades and doesn\u2019t have the functionality for an increasingly complex billing landscape.\n\nIt raises the question \u2013 are first-generation RCMs ripe for a \u201crip and replace\u201d treatment? Or can they continue to be used if they show no sign of obsolescence?\n\n[Also: How consumerism is changing revenue cycle]\n\nPatrick Hall, executive vice president for Austin, Texas-based e-MDs, said it comes down to a simple conclusion: \u201cWhen your current system doesn\u2019t work for you anymore, it is time to upgrade.\u201d\n\nEvery provider organization should evaluate its RCM system every year or two to determine if it can meet the expectations of the billing workflow processes, Hall said. With the changes to the Medicare and commercial health plans from fee-for-service to more advanced value-based business models, he says revenue cycle methods are evolving into a more sophisticated methodology.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that clinical and revenue cycle workflows are merging \u2013 it is a reflection of the new dynamics in which integrated systems are preferable,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe elephant in the room is the drive for quality and better data. Practices and medical businesses are facing ICD-10 coding and won\u2019t make the jump or make it well without a sufficient RCM system.\u201d\n\n\u2018Touchless\u2019 system\n\nHealthcare providers should be striving for a \u201ctouchless\u201d billing process from patient intake all the way through to claims adjudication, said Jay Deady, CEO of Denver-based Recondo.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to automate as much of the process as possible, eliminating manual intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking what was thought of as the \u2018back office\u2019 work, bringing it up front and making the claims as clean as possible. This includes registry, eligibility and estimation information.\u201d\n\n[Also: High deductibles affecting revenue cycle]\n\nThe emphasis should be on upfront cash collection, Deady said, so the provider can settle a patient\u2019s status ahead of time. Recondo\u2019s Reconbot technology takes the out-of-pocket estimation and drives it for 30 percent to 40 percent more accuracy, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just patient deductibles at the plan level, but out-of-pocket collection,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process moves to the front and accurate tools secure it in the record for adjudication.\u201d\n\nManual processes are indeed part of a circuitous path patient data often follows with antiquated systems, but Hall says the manual handling that can be part of the mix is more an education issue than a technological one.\n\n\u201cThey have the capability to automate the process, but it still has to be correctly implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cThey still have to ask for the money and it can be hard for some people to do.\u201d\n\nForensic claims chasing\n\nWeaving critical patient insurance information into the initial encounter ensures that all the necessary details are included for claims submission that is correct the first time, RCM specialists say. Otherwise, back office personnel are left to engage in an often convoluted, time-consuming series of forensic investigations.\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\n\u201cThe big gap is real-time adjudication of services,\u201d Hall said. \u201cA lot of private plans have co-insurance models\u2026more like a Medicare deductible without the gap. It is imperative to get that information from the patient right at the start.\u201d\n\nRecondo\u2019s technology mines payer sites of documents associated with the claims, grabs it, takes a \u201csnapshot,\u201d brings it back into the system, parses it and combines it with the claim in the work queue. This eliminates the need for staff to check payer sites for claim status, letting them bypass clean claims and focus on potential problem claims.\n\n\u201cThe savings comes from not having to check on the status of every claim,\u201d Deady said. \u201cIf the claims are clean, they don\u2019t need checking \u2013 just the ones that need help. It results in quicker payment and better cash flow.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/its-time-hospitals-upgrade-their-revenue-cycle-technology-experts-say", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/billing-statement-feature_6.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Many providers are still utilizing technology that goes back decades and doesn\u2019t have the functionality for an increasingly complex billing landscape, which raises the question: Are first-generation RCMs ripe for a \"rip and replace\" treatment?", "title": "It's time hospitals upgrade their revenue cycle technology, experts say"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/billing-statement-feature_6.gif"}, "title": "It's time hospitals upgrade their revenue cycle technology, experts say", "description": "Many providers are still utilizing technology that goes back decades and doesn\u2019t have the functionality for an increasingly complex billing landscape, which raises the question: Are first-generation RCMs ripe for a \"rip and replace\" treatment?", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "The original revenue cycle management systems were designed to improve the speed and accuracy of claims filing for healthcare organizations and their implementation has, for the most part, succeeded in helping to reach those goals.
