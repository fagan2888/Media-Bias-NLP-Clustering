We chose the zoo, Legoland and the beach instead.\n\nSeaWorld fell out of favor after the 2013 documentary \u201cBlackfish,\u201d which has become a PR nightmare. The film explains the deadly consequences of keeping killer whales in captivity, chronicling the violent behavior and circumstances behind a whale at SeaWorld that was responsible for the deaths of three people.\n\nThe film\u2019s underlying point is that holding the majestic whales captive in concrete tanks has caused them mental and physical stress.\n\nA year after the film\u2019s release, visits to the theme parks dropped 4 percent.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock dropped more than 40 percent. And CEO Jim Atchison resigned in December.\n\nNow, a book written by former trainer John Hargrove, who was also featured in \u201cBlackfish,\u201d is compounding those problems.\n\nHargrove alleges SeaWorld\u2019s practices include separating young whales from their mothers and inbreeding.\n\nSeaWorld has launched a counterattack, sending out a disparaging video of Hargrove.\n\nHe appears drunk and uses offensive language, including a racial slur a number of times.\n\nHargrove has called the video\u2019s release a smear, which it is. But he should be ashamed.\n\nThe theme park also recently unveiled a publicity campaign that focuses on its efforts to care for animals in captivity and in the wild.\n\nAnd SeaWorld announced last year it will rebuild its whale tanks, starting in San Diego\u2019s park. The tanks will double in size and be completed by 2018.\n\nAs a display of the good work SeaWorld does, workers are being called in to help with the sudden calamity of hundreds of starving sea lions washing ashore on California\u2019s beaches.\n\nThe theme park\u2019s officials have ardently defended its whale program, saying it has increased conservation awareness. And they are adamant that they treat the animals with utmost care.\n\nThe officials are trying to strike a difficult balance for a theme park that relies on animals for entertainment but also has a mission of conservation and research.\n\nI still cannot get past the horrifying and sad allegations.\n\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey faced similar criticism for how it treats its elephants. The circus should be applauded for recently announcing it would phase out its elephant shows by 2018 \u2014 a smart move.\n\nSeaWorld has built its brand on the killer whales. It needs to diversify. It should follow the lead of Ringling Brothers.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that it hasn\u2019t been that long ago that moviegoers were driven to tears by the film \u201cFree Willy,\u201d in which a boy releases a killer whale back to the ocean.\n\nDespite SeaWorld execs\u2019 assurances that they are treating these magnificent and smart mammals well, the public knows better, and is voting with its feet.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
