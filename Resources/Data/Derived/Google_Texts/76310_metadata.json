A textiles plant, packaging maker, newspaper - doesn\u2019t matter. The owners whimper for a government handout, \"for the workers,\" who are meanwhile picketing and burning tires.\n\nThe story makes prime-time but the media generally regresses to generalities - the state of the Israeli worker, plus how much the CEO made. Some call for nationalization of the plant, and are promptly slimed as communists.\n\nThen it's over. Maybe a solution was found. More usually, public interest waned.\n\nLast week it happened again, but this time, the story wasn't some small-town towel manufacturer, it was a hospital. And not just any hospital: the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, flagship of the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization and probably the most prestigious hospital complex in Israel.\n\nHadassah, once a symbol of Zionist success, had degenerated into a bloated, debt-ridden, mess teetering on the brink. Its workers - doctors, nurses - barricaded themselves within the hospital, leaving their patients beside themselves with uncertainty and fear.\n\nTake two bailouts and call me in the morning\n\nHospitals are not supposed to fail. Banks fail. Hospitals are not supposed to be in the business of being bailed out. Once again, that\u2019s for the finance sector. A hospital is not supposed to go on strike. It is always there. We need it to always be there. We want that certainty in an otherwise unpredictable, cruel world.\n\nBut 95 years after its foundation, Hadassah looks more like a failed bank or a bankrupt carmaker than an institution of healing. It's stiffing its suppliers and its staff got only half their January salaries. For two weeks now - (until today, in fact) - it's been turning away the sick, accepting only emergencies and births.\n\nGiven that Hadassah normally treats about a million patients, that translates into a lot of patients under stress.\n\nOver the past 10 days, many - too many - reasons were found for Hadassah\u2019s crisis: egregious mismanagement that caused the hospital to rack up 1.3 billion shekels in debt. The casualness with which management approved construction of a new tower - at a cost of, well, 1.3 billion shekels, while workers haven\u2019t been paid. The crisis at the Hadassah Women\u2019s organization itself following the Madoff scandal.\n\nAnd, the weird situation in which Hadassah remained a semi-private, semi-public hospital, thinly regulated and run with very little supervision from very far away. And now the trouble has cast a spotlight on a very sore point - the hospital\u2019s thriving private medical services, known in Israel by the Hebrew acronym Sharap.\n\nPrivate care at public's expense\n\nIn recent years, Hadassah\u2019s doctors allocated more and more of their time to private patients and medical tourists: instead of working mornings and midday as public doctors and only devoting the afternoons to private work, as they were supposed to, they began to work privately in the mornings as well. This forced patients from the general public to either wait months on end for one of the few remaining slots in the morning, or pay up.\n\nDue to antiquated rules, though the private business was booming, making hundreds of millions of shekels each year - very little of that money - 22%, to be exact - went to Hadassah itself, even though the hospital carried all the expenses. The doctors kept most of the money and the state of the hospital and its services deteriorated further.\n\nThis week the scorned public began to see Hadassah\u2019s private business as the chief culprit behind the medical center's troubles.\n\nThis view was not entirely unfounded. The public learned just how badly things have gotten at Hadassah. They were outraged to learn of bloated pay for doctors who, instead of treating everyone equally, allocated more and more of their time and the hospital's resources to private patients.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Hadassah itself a year ago, public patients waited an average of 55 days for treatment. For private patients, the average wait was 7 days.\n\nWho dunnit\n\nTo be fair, it probably wasn't just the Sharap - less than 10% of the medical center\u2019s activity, the hospital claims \u2013 that's killing Hadassah. But it is the factor that caused the most indignation.\n\nBecoming the face of medical tourism and private healthcare in Israel over the last decade, Hadassah has come to emblemize the wrongness infecting Israel\u2019s healthcare system. Thanks to its private services jacking up the prices of healthcare, it made the health system in Jerusalem the most expensive in Israel. Thus Jerusalem became a place where - instead of getting treatments through their HMOs - patients were forced to pay more just to get the same treatment by the same doctors. They could suffer, or pay for Sharap.\n\nHadassah is a leading contributor to Israel becoming a country with two healthcare systems: one for the rich and medical tourists, and one for everyone else.\n\nThis is why many Israelis see the Hadassah saga not as being about Hadassah itself, but about Israel\u2019s healthcare system. And this is why more and more voices are calling for the hospital's nationalization. Even the small-government crowd is screaming for Hadassah to be nationalized.\n\nAgain, Hadassah isn't alone. It was just the best at consuming public resources for a good other than the greater one.\n\nAnd thus nationalization is seen as a sensible option. Because a hospital is not a factory, and it is not a bank. Israel\u2019s universal healthcare system used to be a symbol of Zionism at its best, and Sharap has become a symbol of everything that went wrong.\n\nIt probably won't happen. Hadassah will not be nationalized. A temporary deal has been reached between management and the workers. For the first time in two weeks Hadassah's doctors and nurses are back on the job. The hospital\u2019s debts have also been frozen, for now.\n\nBut the near-universal demand to nationalize Hadassah shows how Israelis felt when they got a glimpse of American-style health care. Israelis did not like it. And whether Hadassah itself will be nationalized or not, the simple fact is that this week has taught us where our priorities lie - and they lie with public health.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/web/images/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Haaretz", "description": "The public was outraged to learn just how its growing private-medicine practice hurt Hadassah, and its ordinary patients.", "application-name": "Haaretz", "og": {"site_name": "Haaretz.com", "description": "The public was outraged to learn just how its growing private-medicine practice hurt Hadassah, and its ordinary patients.", "title": "The Hadassah crisis //Obamacare in Israel, and the people are horrified - Features", "url": "http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/1.575265", "image": "http://www.haaretz.com/polopoly_fs/1.575267!/image/1254128188.jpg_gen/derivatives/headline_1200x630/1254128188.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#006381", "fb": {"app_id": 287530407927859}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504537897", "vr": {"image": "http://www.haaretz.com", "published_time": "Thu Feb 20 11:04:00 IST 2014", "title": "The Hadassah crisis //Obamacare in Israel, and the people are horrified - Features"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/web/images/mstile-144x144.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Israel culture,  Israel tourism,  Hadassah", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/haaretzcom"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Israel culture,  Israel tourism,  Hadassah"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a09\"", "article_summary": "And not just any hospital: the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, flagship of the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization and probably the most prestigious hospital complex in Israel.\nAnd now the trouble has cast a spotlight on a very sore point - the hospital\u2019s thriving private medical services, known in Israel by the Hebrew acronym Sharap.\nBecoming the face of medical tourism and private healthcare in Israel over the last decade, Hadassah has come to emblemize the wrongness infecting Israel\u2019s healthcare system.\nIts workers - doctors, nurses - barricaded themselves within the hospital, leaving their patients beside themselves with uncertainty and fear.\nAccording to a study conducted by Hadassah itself a year ago, public patients waited an average of 55 days for treatment."}
