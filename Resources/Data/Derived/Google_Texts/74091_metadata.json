They weren\u2019t articulating their rage; they were having fun.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of blame to go around \u2013 most of it on the rioters themselves \u2013 but also on the various critics of the Ferguson, Missouri police department like Al Sharpton and others who\u2019ve made a living off race-baiting (even if they haven\u2019t paid taxes on that living) who have, through their overheated rhetoric, lit a rhetorical match and destroyed the department\u2019s ability to respond to the fire.\n\n\n\n[READ: Views You Can Use: Was Justice Served in Ferguson?]\n\nIt is no small matter that its critics have made the department reluctant to react with appropriate force. They are stuck in the unenviable position of trying to keep the peace while psychologically handicapped by the knowledge that any suspected lawbreaker they try to arrest could provoke a confrontation that, captured by the news media or on cell phone cameras, will be used to further propagandize the issue.\n\nWhat should have happened is that, instead of calling out the National Guard, Missouri Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon should have called out the state police and had them on the frontlines of defense in Ferguson. The issue before the governor and other political leaders was not riot control. They confused themselves in the hype \u2013 it was crime control.\n\nEveryone who helped burn down a store, flip a police vehicle or loot stores and leave with items they didn\u2019t pay for is not an oppressed civil rights martyr; they are all criminals and should be treated as such.\n\nWhat should be happening now is close scrutiny of all the footage with the intent of identifying the lawbreakers (again, not rioters but lawbreakers). They should be identified, arrested, given all the rights entitled to them under due process and, if found guilty, punished to the full extent of the law. That is the only way to deal with situations like these. Being nice, being a negotiator, being an appeaser doesn\u2019t work. The president of St. Louis University found this out after negotiating last month with non-student protesters who occupied parts of campus. Instead of having them arrested or kicked off campus, he cut a deal with them. They left \u2013 only to come back after the grand jury\u2019s decision was announced.\n\n\n\n[READ: Twitter Reactions to the Ferguson Grand Jury Decision]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Don't Appease Ferguson Lawbreakers", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Looting and violence are crimes and should be treated as such.", "title": "Protesting Is Not a Crime and Criminal Acts Aren't Protest", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/11/26/dont-appease-ferguson-lawbreakers", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a1/b42fbeb2e4bcd5e16df0197ad6f960/media:a405dc47247247e886f1a091d73f9ac6Ferguson.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Don't Appease Ferguson Lawbreakers", "description": "Looting and violence are crimes and should be treated as such.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Nov. 26, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Ferguson, Missouri,violence,picks,crime,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Looting and violence are crimes and should be treated as such."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf496\"", "article_summary": "[READ: Twitter Reactions to the Ferguson Grand Jury Decision]\nWhat should be happening now is close scrutiny of all the footage with the intent of identifying the lawbreakers (again, not rioters but lawbreakers).\nJay Nixon should have called out the state police and had them on the frontlines of defense in Ferguson.\nThey left \u2013 only to come back after the grand jury\u2019s decision was announced.\n[READ: Views You Can Use: Was Justice Served in Ferguson?]"}
