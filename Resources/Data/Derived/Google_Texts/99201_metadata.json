Grower Tests Workplace Democracy\n\nThousands of California farmworkers are facing a tough choice: pay dues to a union they don\u2019t want to represent them or lose their jobs.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The sealed ballot boxes now stored in the regional office of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board in Visalia, Calif., contain the votes of thousands of employees of Gerawan Farming Inc., the nation\u2019s largest peach producer.\n\nThe workers cast those votes in November to decide whether to strip the United Farm Workers, the union co-founded by legendary activist Cesar Chavez, of its right to represent them. The union had been certified in 1992 but, after only one contract negotiation session with management, effectively abandoned its Gerawan membership.\n\nIn October 2012, the UFW notified Gerawan that it was ready to bargain again over a contract even though, according to the company, 98 percent of current employees weren\u2019t even around at the time the union was certified.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cWe thought it would be easy to get rid of the union,\u201d Silvia Lopez, the employee who organized the campaign to decertify the UFW, told MintPress News in an interview.\n\nBut because of an extraordinary labor dispute that has roiled California\u2019s agricultural industry like no other since Chavez\u2019s early battles with growers, the decertification votes may never be counted.\n\nAnd Lopez and thousands of her co-workers at Gerawan Farming could be facing the Hobson\u2019s choice of having to pay dues amounting to 3 percent of their paychecks to a union they don\u2019t want to represent them \u2014 or lose their jobs.\n\nThe workers are required to pay the dues under a contract that was drafted by a mediator under a controversial 2003 mandatory mediation law.\n\n\u201c[T]he dream of farm workers using democratic processes to choose their own future has become a nightmare for Ms. Lopez and her fellow workers whom the [California Agricultural Labor Relations Act] is designed to protect,\u201d Anthony Raimondo, an attorney representing Lopez, wrote in a court document.\n\nThe union claims Gerawan has a \u201clong history of egregious labor law violations\u201d and the Nov. 5 decertification vote should be vacated because of election fraud.\n\nAccording to the union, the mediated contract will pay most Gerawan employees about $1,074 in additional compensation retroactive to July 2013 and \u201cmany millions of dollars for workers over its duration.\u201d\n\n\u201cGerawan Farming \u2026 epitomizes the agricultural industry\u2019s ongoing, entrenched resistance to unionization,\u201d UFW spokesman Marc Grossman told MintPress.\n\nWhat has Gerawan, other growers and some labor lawyers most concerned, however, is that the Agricultural Labor Relations Board appears to have sided with the union. In a case scheduled to be heard by a Fresno, Calif., judge on May 27, the board, which is responsible for enforcing the state\u2019s Agricultural Labor Relations Act, is seeking a court order that would force Gerawan to implement the mediated contract.\n\nGerawan has launched a legal counter-attack, filing a petition that asks an appeals court to declare the mandatory mediation law unconstitutional or that the board exceeded its authority in imposing a collective bargaining agreement on the company.\n\n\u201cThe very agency that was designed to protect [farmworkers] and bring peace to the fields has completely abdicated that role and is now actually against farmworkers,\u201d Dan Gerawan, president of Gerawan Farming, told MintPress.\n\nLegacy of Chavez\n\nSilvia Lopez has worked in California\u2019s Central Valley for Gerawan since 1998, picking peaches in its vast orchards for $10 an hour. The family-run company also grows nectarines and plums and employs as many as 12,000 people over the course of a year.\n\nLike the vast majority of her co-workers, Lopez wasn\u2019t around when the UFW was certified at Gerawan. And she doesn\u2019t see why after its lengthy absence, it should now be allowed to represent her.\n\n\u201cThere is no new thing that they offer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like they still think they\u2019re in the 1960s when Cesar Chavez was fighting for [farmworkers\u2019] rights.\u201d\n\nChavez\u2019s signature achievement, the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, was passed in 1975. He died in 1993 and, to some, the UFW has been trading on his legacy ever since amid declining membership. According to a recent regulatory filing, it only has 4,200 members out of a total agricultural labor force in California of some half a million.\n\nDonors are \u201csympathetic to the legacy of Cesar Chavez,\u201d Raimondo, Lopez\u2019s attorney, told MintPress, noting that most of the UFW\u2019s income comes from donations rather than dues.\n\nChavez himself led the drive for union representation at Gerawan, intervening after another union initially filed for an election. It isn\u2019t clear why the union walked away from Gerawan a few years after being certified. According to the UFW, contract talks broke down in 1995 after a Gerawan executive said, \u201cI don\u2019t want the union and I don\u2019t need the union.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve just made feeble excuses for disappearing for 20 years,\u201d Dan Gerawan said.\n\nBy the time the UFW resurfaced at Gerawan in 2012, the law requiring mandatory mediation of a contract when grower-labor negotiations reach an impasse was in place. Any contract fashioned through the mediation process is not subject to worker ratification.\n\nAfter 10 bargaining sessions, the UFW invoked the 2003 law, resulting in a three-year contract that would, among other things, provide a 2.5 percent wage increase, retroactive to July 2013, to workers including irrigators, tractor drivers and pesticide sprayers, with a further 5 percent hike in 2014 and 2015.\n\nGerawan Farming has strenuously objected to the mediation process, saying that having \u201cabandoned\u201d its members for so long, the UFW had no legal standing to seek arbitration and that the statute was only intended to \u201caddress extreme instances of employer intransigence in collective bargaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were no negotiations to drag out,\u201d Dan Gerawan said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nGrower-union disputes, of course, are far from unusual in agribusiness. But what has made the situation at Gerawan Farming so remarkable is the position of the workers supposedly represented by the UFW. Far from welcoming the mediated contract, they initiated one of the largest sustained union decertification drives in California agricultural labor history.\n\nAfter the Agricultural Labor Relations Board dismissed the first decertification petition, a second petition drive collected about 2,600 worker signatures.\n\n\u201cThis is not us against the UFW,\u201d Dan Gerawan told MintPress. \u201cThis is our employees against the UFW and the [Agricultural Labor Relations Board].\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we want in this,\u201d he added, \u201cis what our employees want. They want the right to choose a union.\u201d\n\nWorkplace democracy\n\nThe passions stirred by the fight at Gerawan Farming were on display outside a Fresno courthouse on April 10. While on one side of the street about 500 Gerawan workers had gathered, some of them brandishing signs saying \u201cCount Now,\u201d a smaller group of UFW supporters demonstrated on behalf of the union on the other side.\n\nTwo days earlier, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board had sued Gerawan for a court order enforcing the mediated contract, taking that action even though the votes from the decertification election remained uncounted in its regional office and Gerawan had asked the Fifth District Court of Appeals to declare the mandatory mediation law unconstitutional.\n\nInside the courthouse, attorneys for Gerawan, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, the UFW and Lopez spoke at a hearing before Fresno County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Y. Hamilton.\n\n\u201cWe are not on the side of the UFW,\u201d board attorney Alegria De La Cruz assured him. \u201cWe are here in the service of the state of California\u201d to stop Gerawan from \u201cbreaking the law\u201d by not implementing the contract.\n\nThe board, she said, had chosen to impound the decertification ballots because \u201cthere were so many problems leading up to the election.\u201d\n\nBut Judge Hamilton put off a decision on the lawsuit, expressing concerns about the board\u2019s neutrality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit disingenuous to say you\u2019re protecting these workers\u2019 rights [when] you\u2019re blocking their elections at every turn,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are wanting me to impose something that perhaps a majority [of workers] don\u2019t want. And then you\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t know because we didn\u2019t count.\u2019 So it\u2019s really kind of like a huge shell game you\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you are being neutrally transparent and saying, \u2018We represent all the workers, we don\u2019t represent UFW. We want to know what these workers really want,\u2019\u201d Hamilton concluded before setting another hearing for May 27. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it sounds like.\u201d\n\nBarry Bedwell, president of the California Grape and Tree Fruit League, which represents growers, believes the foundations of workplace democracy would be undermined if the contract at Gerawan was enforced without the decertification votes being tallied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a forced unionization,\u201d he told MintPress, adding, \u201cThis seems about as undemocratic as you can get.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether or not there should be a union at all should be decided by the workers themselves,\u201d Raimondo, the attorney, said. \u201cThat\u2019s what labor laws stand for.\u201d\n\nAs for Lopez, she filed a federal suit in February alleging the Agricultural Labor Relations Board\u2019s refusal to count the decertification votes and reveal the results of the Nov. 5 election violates her rights of \u201cself-governance and freedom of association.\u201d\n\nLopez says she and her co-workers are \u201cvery worried\u201d about having to choose between paying dues to a union they don\u2019t want or losing their jobs.\n\n\u201cBut my co-workers say, \u2018One day we\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u201d she told MintPress. \u201cThey say, \u2018We won\u2019t have the UFW come. They won\u2019t take our money away.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of California farmworkers are facing a tough choice: pay dues to a union they don\u2019t want to represent them or lose their jobs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Matthew Heller", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Thousands of California farmworkers are facing a tough choice: pay dues to a union they don\u2019t want to represent them or lose their jobs.", "title": "Fight At Big Calif.
