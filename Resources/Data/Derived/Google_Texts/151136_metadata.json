They then narrowed in on the 1,950 patients who had COPD, a degenerative, progressive weakening of the lungs\u2019 ability to process air, often caused by smoking or air pollutants.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors like a patient\u2019s age, gender, and smoking history, they found that COPD wasn\u2019t directly linked to stroke or embolism, but that it was associated with a 54 percent chance of increased mortality in general. As the authors note, COPD does place a greater burden on the heart, and their results bolster the overall perception that conditions like coronary artery disease and COPD are inevitably tied to one another. But it\u2019s been harder to determine a clear relationship between COPD and stroke. COPD may still indirectly influence stroke risk because of its connection to cardiovascular disease, which is in turn has been linked to stroke, the authors note.\n\nAs things stand, COPD is the third leading cause of death in America, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. And being able to know what accompanying risks and health conditions can arise in the presence of COPD is invaluable information. Similarly, the authors were pleased to know that the medications the patients were given did not interact poorly with COPD. \u201cThe presence of COPD doesn't need to affect provider's choice of an anticoagulant,\" lead author Dr. Michael Durheim of Duke said in a press release.\n\nWhether it\u2019s stroke, COPD, or heart issues though, we do know that these ailments are all closely linked to or aggravated by risk factors like smoking and sedentary behavior. So no matter how you look at it, it seems that what\u2019s good for the goose will no doubt be good for the gander, at least when it comes to healthy lifestyle choices.\n\nSource: Durheim M, Cyr D, Al-Khatib S, et al.
