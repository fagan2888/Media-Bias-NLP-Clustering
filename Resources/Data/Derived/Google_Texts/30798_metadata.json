The punishment: 32 months in federal prison, two years\u2019 probation, 100 hours of community service, $886,000 in restitution, and another $507,000 in forfeiture.\n\nThe transcript, released with approval by both parties on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, shows Beale speaking admiringly of the smarts of his onetime boss, current EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, who had tapped him to be in the office more often to help her run the Office of Air and Radiation. (McCarthy, at the time assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, never directly quizzed him about his bogus CIA story but did revoke a bonus she decided was contrary to policy.)\n\nBefore McCarthy, the EPA general counsel and, eventually, its inspector general realized the fraud, Beale said he had told only two colleagues and a few administrative assistants that he was working on the side as a spook -- a tall tale that grew more elaborate as the years went on. In another sign of sloppiness, he was even thrown a joint retirement party in 2012 but continued to show up intermittently at EPA and be paid well into 2013.\n\nAsked precisely why he engineered the scam, Beale said, \u201cThat\u2019s a good question, and I don\u2019t know that I know all the answers. I think greed is clearly a part of it,\u201d according to the transcript. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019ll be working on the rest of the answers for a long time trying to figure that out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
