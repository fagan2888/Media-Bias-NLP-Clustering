(Photo: FILE)Buy Photo\n\nA Princeton University student from New Jersey who quickly went from launching his own blog on economics to writing for the Washington Post is among 32 Rhodes scholars who have been chosen to pursue post-graduate studies at Oxford University.\n\nEvan Soltas, of Rumson, is one of four Princeton students who were announced as winners early Sunday by the Rhodes Trust. The 22-year-old economics major, who is working on research related to the federal food stamp program, plans to pursue a degree in applied statistics.\n\nSoltas started blogging on his own as a way to explore and learn economics but soon began working with Ezra Klein on the Post\u2019s Wonkblog. He has also contributed to Klein\u2019s Vox.com and Bloomberg View.\n\n\u201cMy long-term aspiration is really to bridge the gap between economics and public policy and really find a way \u2026 to the extent that I can help, do research that helps guide the choices that policy-makers make,\u201d Soltas said. \u201cThe way I see my role is not so much, \u2018I think this policy is a good idea, or I think this policy is a bad idea,\u2019 but let me help clarify the trade-offs that you face.\u201d\n\nHe has cut down on his writing as he got more involved in research on the federal SNAP program, seeking to answer the question of whether it\u2019s making a meaningful difference. He said his research so far has found that the program works, with the biggest impact coming on those suffering from extreme food insecurity. His goal is to create better measurements of the effect of SNAP on food security.\n\nSoltas\u2019 family moved to Rumson from New York City when he was young. He graduated from the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire.\n\nThe Rhodes scholar winners were chosen from 869 applicants who were endorsed by 316 colleges and universities.\n\nThe other Princeton winners are Richard Lu, of Ballwin, Missouri, Katherine Clifton, of Honolulu, Hawaii, and Cameron Platt, of Santa Barbara, California.\n\nThe scholarships cover all expenses for two or three years of study at the prestigious university in England starting next October. The scholarships are worth about $50,000 per year.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
