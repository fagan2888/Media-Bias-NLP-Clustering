It's a big weekend for a Meridian church.

First Baptist Church in Meridian is officially celebrating its 175th anniversary. The church hosted a fish fry and open house Saturday afternoon. Sunday, the church will welcome Congressman Gregg Harper for a special 90-minute service. The church says it's hard to put into words how special this time is.

"Oh listen, we've been working on this since Feburary of 2013," Janet Heggie says. "So for today to arrive and it just be such a beautiful day, people have really come out and supported us."

The special 175th anniversary church service begins at 10 a.m. Sunday at First Baptist Church.
