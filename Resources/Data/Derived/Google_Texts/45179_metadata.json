Sexual harassment accusations followed - from nearly 20 other women, resulting in Filner's resigning, getting sued and being sentenced to home confinement.\n\nA foot-in-mouth moment occurred on the November night Massachusetts state Senator Marty Walsh was elected mayor of Boston. As new mayor Walsh prepared to greet supporters, another Marty Walsh - a Boston public affairs consultant - saw an unfamiliar 202 number pop up on his cell phone.\n\n\"Congratulations, Marty, you son of a gun. You did it!\" he heard the voice of the U.S. vice president shout gleefully, before he realized his mistake.\n\nIn October, the federal government shutdown led to some strange stories, including the blackout of the wildly popular online Giant Panda Cam at the National Zoo in Washington and the furloughing of poison ivy-eating goats in New Jersey and New York.\n\nMonths later, the fumbled launch of Healthcare.gov whipped up a search for the \"Obamacare Girl,\" who was re-named \"Glitch Girl\" after her smiling face remained frozen on the home page that frustrated millions of computer users.\n\n\n\nAP Photo/Joe Raymond, File\n\nIn the sports world, former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o put a new twist on the old adage that it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Romantics were drawn to the tale of his devotion to Lennay Kekua and her tragic death from cancer - until her very existence was exposed as a fraud. The snarky Twittersphere was flooded with photos of people \"Te'oing\" - hugging empty chairs or puckering up in an otherwise empty room.\n\nBroken hearts were mended after a New Jersey commercial fisherman lost $12,000 in cash he had saved to buy an engagement ring. His backpack had a faulty zipper and the money fell out as he rode his motorcycle to the docks. Much of the loose cash was scooped up, but after the story came out, good Samaritans returned it to him.\n\nElsewhere on the Jersey Shore, Wildwood officials banned saggy pants on the boardwalk, pressing their crusade for decency with the threat of a $200 fine for pants that sag more than three inches below the waist. To those who invoked their right to wear low-slung pants, Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr. said: \"I have a right not to look at your rear end.\n\nAnimals acting up got their share of attention in 2013. A foul-mouthed Rhode Island cockatoo landed its owner in trouble by cursing at a next-door neighbor, who happened to be the girlfriend of the owner's ex-husband. The City of Warwick initially slapped the woman with a $15 fine for the bird's salty language, but eventually dropped the case.\n\nIn Colorado, a man on his way to his brother's wedding 600 miles away in Utah was arrested for being drunk while riding his horse. He had a small dog in his backpack.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, an African flamingo that had been on the lam for eight years after escaping from a zoo in Wichita, Kansas, was spotted this month cavorting with a companion in the Gulf of Mexico off the Texas coast. Flamingos pair up for life, but the gender of these two birds was unknown, a zoo official said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From &quot;Carlos Danger&quot; to Manti Te&#039;O&#039;s imaginary girlfriend, there were many laughs \u2013 at other people&#039;s expense", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/glitches-and-hitches-a-look-at-the-gaffes-and-goofs-of-2013/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/09/05/acf1651d-251d-11e3-9283-005056850598/thumbnail/1200x630/5d8b62912dfb3578630a424d76892a4a/ctm_0905_weiner.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "From \"Carlos Danger\" to Manti Te'O's imaginary girlfriend, there were many laughs \u2013 at other people's expense", "title": "Glitches and hitches, a look at the gaffes and goofs of 2013"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"Carlos Danger\" to Manti Te'O's imaginary girlfriend, there were many laughs \u2013 at other people's expense", "title": "Glitches and hitches, a look at the gaffes and goofs of 2013", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/glitches-and-hitches-a-look-at-the-gaffes-and-goofs-of-2013/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/glitches-and-hitches-a-look-at-the-gaffes-and-goofs-of-2013/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/glitches-and-hitches-a-look-at-the-gaffes-and-goofs-of-2013/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/09/05/acf1651d-251d-11e3-9283-005056850598/thumbnail/1200x630/5d8b62912dfb3578630a424d76892a4a/ctm_0905_weiner.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/glitches-and-hitches-a-look-at-the-gaffes-and-goofs-of-2013/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/glitches-and-hitches-a-look-at-the-gaffes-and-goofs-of-2013/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb744\"", "article_summary": "To those who invoked their right to wear low-slung pants, Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr. said: \"I have a right not to look at your rear end.\nA foot-in-mouth moment occurred on the November night Massachusetts state Senator Marty Walsh was elected mayor of Boston.\nAs new mayor Walsh prepared to greet supporters, another Marty Walsh - a Boston public affairs consultant - saw an unfamiliar 202 number pop up on his cell phone.\nOn the West Coast, San Diego Mayor Bob Filner made the headlines with what came to be known as the \"Filner Headlock.\"\nMuch of the loose cash was scooped up, but after the story came out, good Samaritans returned it to him."}
