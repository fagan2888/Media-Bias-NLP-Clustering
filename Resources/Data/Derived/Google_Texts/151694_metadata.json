To avoid punishment by the national Democratic Party, the plan was to wait until 2020 to implement the changes. According to one DNC Vice Chair, Maine can't exactly do this--not now, not in 2020, and probably not ever.\n\nRep. Diane Russell (D-Portland), the state representative who introduced the amendment to bind superdelegates to the results of the caucus or primary, shared the comment on her Facebook page. She also suggested that the superdelegate system should be abolished entirely.\n\nRussell is a supporter of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Despite Sanders' overwhelming victory in the Maine Democratic caucuses, most of the state's superdelegates are supporting Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt looks as though the battle over the superdelegates in the Democratic Party won't be over any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Battle over superdelegates continues. .05/26/2016 18:41:17PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Battle over superdelegates continues.", "title": "DNC Vice Chair: Maine, You Can't Just Get Rid of Superdelegates", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/05/11/dnc-chair-maine-you-cant-just-get-rid-of-superdelegates-n2161456", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/132/62b17f25-c90c-4295-bf08-dd937d7d2fde.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Battle over superdelegates continues.", "title": "DNC Vice Chair: Maine, You Can't Just Get Rid of Superdelegates", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/05/11/dnc-chair-maine-you-cant-just-get-rid-of-superdelegates-n2161456", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/132/62b17f25-c90c-4295-bf08-dd937d7d2fde.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "DNC Vice Chair: Maine, You Can't Just Get Rid of Superdelegates, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Over the weekend, the Maine Democratic Party decided to strip the ability of superdelegates to support the candidate of their choosing.\nIt looks as though the battle over the superdelegates in the Democratic Party won't be over any time soon.\nAccording to one DNC Vice Chair, Maine can't exactly do this--not now, not in 2020, and probably not ever.\nDespite Sanders' overwhelming victory in the Maine Democratic caucuses, most of the state's superdelegates are supporting Hillary Clinton.\nTo avoid punishment by the national Democratic Party, the plan was to wait until 2020 to implement the changes."}
