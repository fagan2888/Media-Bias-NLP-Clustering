But this much is certain: Temperatures will climb above freezing, briefly, but iced-over roads will refreeze tonight. Authorities are asking people to continue to stay off the roads, especially in Fort Worth and points west, where Texas Department of Transportation crews are trying to clear the most treacherous and troublesome areas. And the weather is being blamed for at least three deaths in Dallas since Saturday afternoon alone, including a 75-year-old woman in Bluffview who slipped on the ice in her front yard yesterday, and a 26-year-old man who crashed his car near Preston Royal just past midnight Sunday.]\n\nUpdate at 9:36 p.m.: Oncor says there are 20,000 outages remaining in the D/FW area.\n\nAn Oncor spokesperson said 9,000 of those outages are from the original storm, while 11,000 are new outages from Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThey hope to restore power to nearly all the 9,000 original outages by late Sunday night and the rest by Monday afternoon.\n\nUpdate at 8:55 p.m.: The list of school closures and delays has continued to change throughout the night. Click here to see the latest.\n\nUpdate at 8:43 p.m.: Fort Worth police are strongly urging drivers to stay off I-20 and I-30 as roads, that have been plagued with stranded vehicles and ice, are beginning to refreeze.\n\nTask Forces are currently out attempting to de-ice the roads. TxDOT\u2019s Dallas office spokeswoman Lisa Wazl said TxDOT will continue their operations throughout the night.\n\nIn addition to plowing roads, they will salt bridges and overpasses as temperatures are expected to drop below freezing Sunday night and black ice is expected to form.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about black ice in the morning,\u201d Wazl said. \u201cWe are sending out the message to drivers to be very cautious.\n\nDrivers should be wary of black ice as Wazl says it is very difficult to see.\n\n\u201cSlow down and give distance between cars because in some cases you don\u2019t see it before you hit it,\u201d she said.\n\nUpdate at 6:39: The National Weather Service has announced there is a freezing fog advisory until Monday at 10 a.m..\n\nMost districts have announced they are cancelling classes and activities tomorrow as roads are still too dangerous. You can check out the list of closures and delays here.\n\nUpdate at 5:30 p.m. by Julie Fancher: Oncor is reporting that about 30,000 people are still without power.\n\nOncor spokeswoman Anna Kurian said 15,000 of those power outages are new because of ice and trees falling on power lines.\n\nShe said workers still hope to have power restored to almost everyone by late Sunday.\n\nTraffic wise, I-30 in Tarrant County continues to be treacherous. Fort Worth police say I-30 eastbound is partially blocked by a stranded 18-wheeler and I-30 westbound past Summit is at a standstill due to slow traffic and ice.\n\nUpdate at 5:00 p.m. by Michael Lindenberger: DART spokesman Morgan Lyons says the agency expects its light rail service to be up and running in time for Monday\u2019s commute \u2014 but isn\u2019t making any guarantees.\n\n\u201cOur tests have been encouraging,\u201d said Lyons, noting that crews have been busy testing segments of the sprawling light rail system \u2014 the largest in America at the time of its last expansion. Not everywhere is a go, yet.\n\nHe said the agency expects the system to be working in full, but just in case will have buses ready to operate at every station as a backup.\n\nTrains haven\u2019t been able to make it all the way to northern end of the Red and Green Lines, but Lyons said crews are optimistic that everything will be running by about midnight. Crews will continue to work to bring back trains that were stranded when the ice story made it impossible for the system to work.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more on what to expect with DART later.\n\nUpdate at 4:15 p.m.: Some schools will remain closed tomorrow due to lingering ice on roadways, among them the University of North Texas. Others will open at 10 a.m., including Highland Park. But the Dallas Independent School District has not yet decided. District officials ask you check its Twitter account for updates.\n\nUpdate at 3:43 p.m. by Michael Lindenberger: Careful with the ice today. As the temps rise a bit, pipes and other items may start springing leaks. Or, as the video below shows, the ice itself might start dropping from dangerous heights. Taken by Amanda Christian at the Parkside at Legacy Apartments in Plano.\n\nUpdate at 2:36 p.m.: This bit of bright news just in from reporter Melissa Repko. She says that despite the ice storm. The UT Southwestern School of Health Professions commencement ceremony is proceeding as planned.\n\nUpdate at 2:12 p.m. from Melissa Repko and Michael Lindenberger: Dallas-area residents ought to check on elderly neighbors, emergency response officials said Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, emergency responders have been busy over the past few days. Turns out, nothing stops a baby from coming, not even an ice storm. Dozens of mothers about to deliver have called for emergency rides to the hospital, officials said.\n\nEmergency responders continue to field calls from people injured in car accidents and slips on the ice. Over the weekend, MedStar fielded twice as many 911 calls as usual in Fort Worth and most of Tarrant County, said Matt Zavadsky, spokesman for MedStar Mobile Healthcare. The emergency provider had four to eight extra crews for each shift during the storm.\n\nAbout 88 percent of calls reported falls or traumatic injuries from slips, Zavadsky said. Dispatchers also saw a surge in pregnancy and labor calls from people who were nervous to drive themselves to the hospital. There\u2019s usually an average of four pregnancy calls per day. From Friday to Sunday morning, there were 40, he said.\n\nIcy conditions also increased the length of responses. Each call took an average of 90 minutes to complete, instead of the typical 60 minutes, he said.\n\nSome churches cancelled services Sunday to encourage congregants to stay inside and off the roads. That included Zavadsky\u2019s own church, Marine Creek Community Church, which cancelled all three Sunday services.\n\n\u201cThankfully, most of the churches in our service area did cancel church,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helped keep the call volume down this morning.\u201d\n\nBut Zavadsky urged drivers to stay off the road, if possible, and remain cautious. Roads may appear wet and slushy as temperatures briefly rise, but they may become slick again tonight and tomorrow, he said.\n\n\u201cAs soon as this starts to freeze again, all of this water is going to become black ice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very concerned about the afternoon, evening and especially morning commute. \u2026 Although a lot of the streets are slush and water right now, as soon as the temperatures get below freezing, they are going to become even worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re driving along and some areas of the road look dry and you can\u2019t see some of the ice, you\u2019re not going to realize it until too late. People need to be even more hyper-vigilant than they have been tonight and tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nSo far, insurance claims for property damage has not been unusual for a winter storm, said Mark Hanna, of the Insurance Council of Texas. But that could change tomorrow. Usually, he said, it\u2019s when the temperatures start rising \u2014 as they are expected to do this afternoon, if only briefly \u2014 when residents realize their water pipes have frozen. That usually requires several days of sub-freezing temps.\n\nHe said most auto accidents on a weekend like this one are minor, and total damages are therefore not as much as they would be in other kinds of events, like tornadoes or even a bad hail storm.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make dealing with a minor crash any less of a horrendous pain in the neck, however, especially since most police agencies are reserving responses to critical situations.\n\nUpdate at 12:52 p.m. from Michael Lindenberger:Ten people sheltered overnight in the Dallas city emergency shelter, spokesman Frank Librio said in a statement just moments ago.\n\nHe said that with 25,000 or more Dallas residents without power, the shelter will stay open as long as it is needed \u2014 at until 9 a..m. anyway.\n\nHe said city sanding efforts have dropped off significantly, as temperatures are expected to go over freezing later this afternoon. (At noon, though, it was still just 28 degrees.) That\u2019s good news, except that when temperatures drop against tonight, there\u2019ll be fresh slush to freeze all over again.\n\n\u201cBecause of a potential thaw / re-freeze occurrence, Street Services will continue to monitor the roads for ice and debris hazards throughout the rest of the day and overnight,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn addition to its sanding operations, Street Services has also continued to respond to service requests for down trees throughout the weekend. Staff has received approximately 400 service calls for downed trees during this winter weather event.\u201d\n\nMost of those have been cleared, the statement said, though more could be needed as the new week begins. \u201cWe anticipate more calls to continue throughout the week-end and the first part of next week,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe chainsaw crews continue to mobilize throughout the City to clear the roadways to ensure mobility. Immediately following the thawing of roadways, Street Services stands ready to begin its sand removal operations.\u201d\n\nUpdate at 12:04 p.m. from Michael Lindenberger: Reporter Melissa Repko has been out this morning talking to folks dealing with another day of ice and cold. Her report on what\u2019s shaking at the local grocery stores below, but first a word from DFW International Airport.\n\nThe airport has opened its third runway, and has crews working round the clock to open as many as two more by tomorrow, spokesman David Magana. DFW airport has seven runways total, though it uses just five on a typical day at full-scale operations.\n\nMagana said the ice storm has been among the worst disruptions for the airport in years, on par with the super ice-out of 2011, which came during Super Bowl week. Some 1,800 workers are employed by the airport \u2014 with more than 50,000 working for vendors, airlines and others within the massive facility \u2014 and many of them have been on call around the clock, he said.\n\nStill, there\u2019s only so much the airport can do to keep its runways open \u2014 or for airlines to keep clear the taxiways and ramps for which they are responsible. \u201cWhen Mother Nature drops an hockey rink on your airport, there\u2019s only so much you can do,\u201d Magana said.\n\nThe five-hour window with warmer temps later today may be enough to get a lot of additional planes moving, he said. and meanwhile, a bright spot: Hundreds of rental cars are still available. And for those stuck in the airport, free sandwiches and entertainment is being offered.\n\nAs for the grocery scene, Melissa Repko\u2019s post follows:\n\nCustomers trickled into grocery stores Sunday morning to begin restocking their pantries and trying to return to normal after being stuck indoors.\n\nBut at the Kroger in Oak Lawn, some grocery items were still missing from the shelves. Onions, carrots and other soup ingredients in the produce section were picked over or out of stock. There were no bananas and few loaves of sliced bread.\n\nIsrael Gonzales, the store\u2019s produce manager, said the Kroger sold a record of about $15,000 in produce alone Thursday when a rush of customers prepared for the ice storm. Since then, few daily delivery trucks have managed to make it from a warehouse in Keller. On Saturday, only a truck with sacks of potatoes arrived, he said.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re going to come in to deliver, but we don\u2019t know when,\u201d he said.\n\nGonzales said it\u2019s been more challenging to stay in stock than during the Super Bowl ice storm. Back then, he said, trucks showed up late, but could make it on the roadways.\n\nIn the dairy aisle, Steve White of Dallas said he was eager to get out of the house after a weekend of watching TV \u2014 even if only for a grocery trip. He said he was glad the roads were starting to clear and above-freezing temperatures were in the forecast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too cold,\u201d White said. \u201cI moved here to get away from the cold.\u201d\n\nAt the Whole Foods in Highland Park, Kevin Neave of Dallas filled up his cart with vegetables, milk and bread. He walked a few blocks to the store because he said he didn\u2019t want to dig out his ice-covered car.\n\nUpdate at 10:46 a.m. from Michael Lindenberger: I can see a new advertising campaign in the works: NTTA\u2019s roads aren\u2019t free, but they do work \u2014 even in the ice.\n\nThat\u2019s more than TxDOT can say, though that\u2019s probably not fair to the state since it has so many more miles of highway to worry about. And it\u2019s sure as shooting more than mass transit can say, now that DART trains remain idle for another and bus service is iffy in Denton in the morning.\n\nOver at NTTA, all its roads and ramps are open. Most accidents have been minor, though spokesman Michael Rey said the authority hasn\u2019t tracked the number of crashes throughout its system. Lower-than-usual speeds have helped keep the accidents that have occurred from being more serious, he said.\n\nThe Super Bowl storm of 2011 iced over NTTA\u2019s roads, despite the fact that hundreds of workers had been called out the night before trying to avoid the kind of publicity nightmare that ensured the week of the big game. One problem that year was that NTTA didn\u2019t have any snow plows. All it could do is sand and salt its roads over and over again. It wasn\u2019t enough, though it did manage to keep its roads passable.\n\nThis year, NTTA is using nine snowplow blades that it attached to existing trucks, bought after the big storm nearly three years ago. I didn\u2019t ask Rey what the investment cost, but it\u2019s paying plenty of dividends, whatever it was. \u201cThey were used last year during the Christmas storm and, of course, are being used extensively through this extraordinary event,\u201d Rey said this morning.\n\nUpdate at 10:30 a.m.: According to Dallas police reports, the icy, frigid weather appears to have played a factor in at least three deaths in the last 24 hours.\n\nPolice say that just after midnight Sunday, 26-year-old Sergio Diaz Jr. of Rockwall lost control of his 2006 Nissan Maxima on a patch of ice on Royal Lane near Preston Road. According to a police report, his car went into a spin, traveled some 83 feet, struck a curb on the south side of the street and hit a tree in a residential front yard. Police say Diaz, who was not wearing a seat belt, hit his head on the the windshield near the passenger side. He was pronounced dead at the scene by the Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, which says his next of kin has been notified.\n\nPolice also say that 75-year-old Marija Guimbellot was a likely victim of the winter storm.\n\nA report says that officers were dispatched to her home on Lakemont Drive in Bluffview, near Dallas Love Field, at 3:30 Saturday. According to police, a neighbor says she slipped on some ice while in her front yard at about 11:30 Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cThe neighbor was able to assist her back into her home after the complainant stated she was OK,\u201d says Dallas police spokesperson Melinda Gutierrez. The neighbor then went home. A few hours later, someone went to check on Guimbelot, at which point she was unresponsive. The medical examiner says her next of kin has been notified, but that the autopsy has not been finished.\n\nAt around the same time Saturday an unidentified black woman in her mid-40s was found in a parking lot along the 2500 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard near S.M. Wright Freeway. Officials believe her death is also weather-related, but an autopsy has not yet been performed.\n\nShe \u201cappears to have died from exposure to the winter elements,\u201d says Gutierrez. \u201cThere were no signs of trauma to the complainant.\u201d\n\nThe ME\u2019s office said this morning that it is \u201coverwhelmed,\u201d and police believe there might be more winter-storm-related deaths.\n\nThose deaths are in addition to the fatal plunge from the Lewisville Lake bridge that occurred early Saturday morning, and a car accident in Arlington Friday morning also blamed on treacherous road conditions.\n\nUpdate at 9:55 a.m. from Michael Lindenberger: Dallas Area Rapid Transit spokesman Mark Ball said DART is running 44 buses to shuttle passengers from rail station to rail station, as the light rail system continues to be completely off line.\n\nRegular Sunday bus service is running as normal, he said, noting that ridership is light as many churches have canceled service this morning. He said the agency will call additional operators to work as needed.\n\nNo major accidents or incidents to report, he said.\n\nTrees have fallen across the tracks in three locations, and maintenance crews are working on their removal this morning. He said the Paratransit service is on schedule.\n\nPerhaps most critically, the agency says its inspecting its overhead wires, the key feature of what will determine whether the trains can run tomorrow. \u201cWe are not in revenue service, but people may see vehicles being moved or removed along our system today as we start to get things operating again. For safety reasons, people should be aware of possible trains on our tracks again.\u201d\n\nUpdate at 9:38 a.m.: Our Liz Farmer reports via Twitter that despite the Dallas Marathon\u2019s cancellation, some folks gathered for a downtown run. Clearly they wanted more than just their T-shirts.\n\nThose of you itching to get out of the house should also know that the Dallas Museum of Art reports that it will open today. And at least Delta and United are back to normal operations at Dallas Love Field, for those trying to escape that way.\n\nNo doubt many folks will at least need somewhere to get warm: Oncor is now reporting that 45,680 are without power, a jump from the 7:30 a.m. update that had about 42,000 still in the dark.\n\nIn a release sent moments ago Oncor says that \u201calmost 5,000 Oncor employees, contractors and utility workers from other areas in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida were working in the field.\u201d They hope to have almost everyone\u2019s power on by late Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s been very difficult for our customers who have been without power as a result of the ice storm and ongoing subfreezing temperatures,\u201d says chief operating office Jim Greer. \u201cWe\u2019re using all available resources to restore power as quickly as we safely can.\u201d\n\nBut there are some folks who may not get their power back tonight.\n\n\u201cThis includes customers who may have damage to their home electrical equipment, such as their meter base,\u201d says Oncor. \u201cHomeowners who have meter bases (the box that surrounds a home\u2019s electrical meter) that are damaged or pulled away from their home will need to contact an electrician to complete necessary repairs. After electrician repairs are completed, either the homeowner or the electrician will need to contact the homeowner\u2019s city inspection office before Oncor can safely restore service.\u201d\n\nUpdate 9:35 a.m. from Michael Lindenberger:: Denton County Transit Administration official says it\u2019ll be \u201cwait and see\u201d on whether its buses will resume service Monday. (There is no Sunday service.) The transit agency suspended bus service Friday and Saturday, and will reopen for business Monday only if the highways are safe to travel.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, says spokeswoman Kristina Brevard, that service within Denton itself will resume before service to Lewisville and Highland Village. The agency\u2019s smaller buses service the latter locations, and must travel along ice-covered I-35E to get to their routes. Unless TxDOT\u2019s efforts to clear some six inches of solid ice along that interstate is successful, buses will probably not make it Monday, either. Today\u2019s brief rise above freezing could be enough, however, to get the city streets of Denton clear enough for the larger buses to operate by Monday, she said.\n\nTrain service, which has mostly been unaffected by the storm, will likely go off as scheduled, or with minor delays, she said. The heavier trains on the A-Line are powered by diesel fuel and not dependent on electricity, as are DART\u2019s light rail vehicles. DART rail has been shut down completely through the storm, but could resume limited service Monday, officials say.\n\nBrevard said Denton\u2019s trains have had to deal with occasional frozen switches, but that heaters are being used to keep that from becoming a more widespread problem.\n\nStill, with the area\u2019s universities closed Friday and DART\u2019s Green Line out of service, ridership on the A-Line has been greatly reduced. On Friday, fewer than 200 people boarded the trains \u2014 a total of about 250 trips \u2014 instead of the normal usage of about 2,500 trips.\n\nOriginal item posted at 8:06 a.m.: And so begins our third day of ice-storm coverage \u2026 and there could be a fourth.\n\nIt begins with this bit of good news: Power is being restored across North Texas (slowly, but surely), temperatures will warm a little today, and one of the biggest airports in the world is back up to three working runways.\n\nBy about 2 p.m. temperatures across the region should climb above freezing, however briefly. But, as our Brandon Formby notes in this morning\u2019s paper, the respite will be short-lived, perhaps three hours.\n\nAnd first we need to get past this Freezing Fog Advisory, which has been extended till noon Sunday, says Jennifer Dunn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. Dunn says some areas in southern Dallas County are actually seeing visibility of less than three-quarters of a mile.\n\nThe fog should dissipate around midday, when skies should begin clearing. So even before we rise above freezing \u2014 and it was 28 at Dallas Love Field at 8:30 a.m. \u2014 there could be some improvement, says Dunn.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll be back down to 28 tonight,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a significant improvement to the ice as it is right now, as we\u2019ll only be above freezing today for a short time today. And it\u2019s the same story Monday and Tuesday \u2014 a brief warm-up during the day, 20s at night.\u201d Dunn says it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t see the 40s until Wednesday.\n\nAnd, as you\u2019re well aware, \u201canything that melts will refreeze tonight as temperatures fall below freezing again,\u201d says Dunn, who says officials are concerned that Monday morning\u2019s commute could be especially treacherous, as more folks venture out onto the roads.\n\nBut a day after a driver fell to her death when her truck plunged into Lewisville Lake, Texas Department of Transportation officials are begging folks to stay off them for at least one more day.\n\nCrews are sanding all over, and equipment is being brought into treat especially troublesome highways. But, clearly, some places are still far worse than others.\n\nIn Dallas, TxDOT asks drivers to \u201cstay home or go slow.\u201d But further west, TxDOT is discouraging travel altogether. Says TxDOT, Interstate 20 \u201ccontinues to be impassable west of Fort Worth\u201d to Palo Pinto. \u201cAll travel discouraged.\u201d\n\nAnd, as our Michael Lindenberger reports this morning, gas stations are running out of fuel.\n\nHere\u2019s the TxDOT travel map \u2014 a bit indecipherable, but not a pretty picture.\n\nOncor continues to bring in outside help to restore power to those who have been without \u2014 in some instances, since Thursday night, when the first drops of freezing rain began to fall.\n\nThe energy provider says 44,642 are still in the dark \u2014 a marked drop from the 75,000 trapped in the frigid darkness Saturday night. (But, at 8:44 a.m. Sunday, that\u2019s 2,000 more than were without power at 7:30 Sunday morning.)\n\n\u201cOur crews are working as quickly and as safely as they can to restore power to our customers impacted by the winter storm,\u201d says its latest winter-weather update. \u201cOncor has more than 3,700 company employees, contractors and utility workers from outside the state who will be working to restore any power outages from this winter storm. We believe nearly all of our customers will have power restored by late Sunday night. The only outages that may not be restored by that time are rural customers or customers whose electrical equipment was damaged by the storm.\u201d\n\nBut a note: If you\u2019re without don\u2019t keep asking Oncor when their crews are coming via those automated texts. Some neighborhoods in the dark were being told Friday and Saturday that there was \u201cno outage information\u201d available concerning their areas. And repair estimates flip-flopped wildly, which, perhaps, is why Oncor\u2019s outage map no longer provides them and says only that \u201cdamage evaluation and restoration efforts are still underway for the DFW Metroplex. Most restorations to be completed by late Sunday Night.\u201d\n\nIn another bit of good news, especially for those stranded and weary travelers hoping to get out of here, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport now says it has three runways open and operational. Airport spokesman David Magana says 2,076 passengers spent the night in the terminals, down from the 3,000 forced to camp-out Friday night.\n\nMagana says that about 400 departures by the airlines have been canceled so far for Sunday. The airport once again asks all passengers to check with their airlines to find out about flights or how to rebook them. You can also check the Flight Information page at www.dfwairport.com/flights.\n\nAlas, Dallas Area Rapid Transit\u2019s light-rail system is still out of commission.\n\n\u201cWe are still working to restore light rail,\u201d says the transit agency Sunday morning. \u201cThis involves cleaning and testing switches and making some equipment repairs. We have also cleared some trees that were knocked down by the storm. We have also put out more than 23 tons of ice melt on our operation and passenger facilities.\u201d\n\nOfficials hope to restore \u201csome level of light rail service\u201d by Monday. It has been out of service since the storm first hit Thursday night, despite assurances that trains would be running all night to make sure they didn\u2019t get stuck. As our Brandon Formby notes, this is the longest such outage in DART history.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s simply lots to do to get the tracks, overhead power lines and rail cars ready,\u201d says the update. \u201cWe will make sure we can operate safely before we start. We believe we will have the best opportunity to make progress on this after the temperature gets above freezing. Current models suggest that will happen Sunday.\u201d\n\nOne thing DART has working in its advantage: A reinforcing shot of cold air due between midnight and 3 a.m. Monday isn\u2019t going to be as frigid as earlier anticipated. Forecasts that once has us back in the teens Monday night now have us in the mid-20s, says the National Weather Service\u2019s Dunn.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEyL2V2ZW4td2l0aC10ZW1wZXJhdHVyZXMtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tcmlzZS1icmllZmx5LWFib3ZlLWZyZWV6aW5nLXdvZXMtcmVtYWluLWFzLTQzMDAwLXN0aWxsLXdpdGhvdXQtcG93ZXIuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "[Editor's note: We will continue to provide up-to-date information from the storm.
