Native Plant Society was formed in an effort to promote the awareness of native plant species and their importance in the Palmetto State\u2019s landscape, wildlife and history.\n\nThough still relatively small, with about 420 active members in the state, including 140 in the Lowcountry chapter, the dedicated group has worked closely with state agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and others to change minds and hearts about native plants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a lot further ahead than we were 20 years ago,\u201d says Jeff Jackson, a member of the Lowcountry chapter and past state president. \u201cBut we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nJackson says progress has been aided by more people rethinking the lawn and its dependency on synthetic chemicals and irrigation. He also points to those who want to provide food sources for bees, butterflies and birds, and to spend less time and money on manicuring yards.\n\nPart of the society\u2019s educational efforts over the years is holding an annual symposium in locations near one of its four chapters.\n\nNext weekend, the three-day symposium comes to North Charleston.\n\nThe symposium kicks off Friday with registration, cocktails and appetizers at Mixson Bath and Racquet Club in North Charleston.\n\nSaturday\u2019s events move to the Felix Davis Community Center at Park Circle in North Charleston and include talks by experts on hawthorns, coastal dune vegetation, plant propagation, indigo, rainwater harvesting and the urban landscape of Charleston\u2019s upper peninsula.\n\nThe weekend wraps up with field trips, all starting at 10 a.m. Sunday at different locations. Trips include a Capers Island boat excursion and tours and hikes of Sullivan\u2019s Island\u2019s accreted dune land, Cypress Gardens, Caw Caw County Park, Magnolia Plantation, Francis Marion National Forest (focusing on butterflies), Bonneau Ferry and Tibwin Plantation.\n\nThe fee for the weekend is $120. (While the registration form on the society\u2019s website http://scnps.org/2015-symposium/ says the deadline is Friday, the organization will be accepting late registrations.)\n\nLowcountry chapter member Colette DeGarady says the society hopes not only to draw master naturalists, teachers and agency staff but everyday gardeners and families.\n\nDeGarady says other local chapter events include plant sales, workshops and field trips, all designed to underscore the importance of protecting and planting native species.\n\n\u201cI view everybody\u2019s property and landscape as a little habitat,\u201d says DeGarady, who works for the local Nature Conservancy. \u201cYou can improve it, degrade it or keep it the same. I see planting natives as a way of improving it.\u201d\n\nReach David Quick at 937-5516.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "South Carolina native plant experts and enthusiasts to converge on North Charleston next weekend, Features, \r\nFeaturesTourism, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nHome & Garden, Colette DeGarady,Jeff Jackson,Jeff Kline,native plants,S.C.
