That night, Kobe Bryant, a living legend, looked like a mere mortal. Air balls. No late game takeover. No explosion to the rim.\n\nMortal.\n\nThat was the fourth game of the season. Bryant hasn\u2019t looked any better since.\n\nOn Friday, Lakers coach Byron Scott was placed in the unenviable position of defending a star whose star is fading. Or has faded. Bryant is suffering through the worst season of his career. His shooting percentages are lower than low. The Lakers are losing games hand over fist.\n\nBecause of all of this, what began as a murmur is growing into a chorus. If he\u2019s playing terribly, even if his name is Kobe Bryant, shouldn\u2019t his minutes be reduced? Shouldn\u2019t someone play in his place?\n\nScott\u2019s response was quick and unequivocal.\n\nNo.\n\nThat was the right answer.\n\nThe Lakers are going nowhere but back to the lottery at the conclusion of this season, and that is their advantage in navigating these waters. If Bryant wants to go out in a blaze of inglorious jump-shooting, well, five titles, two Finals MVPs and one league MVP say he has more than earned the right to do so.\n\nAnd he\u2019s doing it without hurting anything. Not much anyway. There is a matter of developing a great young talent in guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, the second pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft. But Russell\u2019s struggles and general lack of confidence and aggressiveness are other issues. And, anyway, it was probably never destined to go smoothly with one of the more overbearing athletes of the past 20 years hovering over him and taking the most shots on the team.\n\nThe similarities to the Broncos\u2019 plight with Peyton Manning are striking. And the Broncos have been masterful at doing what they can to keep Manning\u2019s legacy and dignity intact by keeping his struggles this year explained away by injury. It\u2019s a cloudier situation because the Broncos have a team that has legitimate title aspirations. Player performance matters in Denver, while it can be summarily dismissed in Los Angeles, maybe even turned into a positive if the end result is getting the No. 1 draft pick, and LSU star freshman Ben Simmons pulls on a Lakers jersey next season.\n\nRest assured, no one is hurting more over this than Bryant. For 20 seasons, he has prided himself on excellence. He has laser-focused his way through workouts, through off-court troubles that would derail most other players\u2019 performance and through anything else that stood in his way.\n\nHe has been great. And he\u2019ll not suffer through another one of these seasons. He\u2019ll retire before that happens.\n\nThen, the Lakers can move on.\n\nNow? Now everyone will have to endure the 1-for-14 nights. There have been two already. As with Manning, only Kobe can stop the suffering by removing himself from the equation. But superstars don\u2019t get to be superstars by suppressing their egos.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easier to watch. In fact, it makes it more difficult, seeing a player who has been truly great succumb to Father Time.\n\nBut letting Bryant play it out is the right thing to do.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nKevin Love, F, Cavaliers\n\nWhen: While Stephen Curry mania continues to spread throughout the NBA, other players who have gotten out to hot starts have flown under the radar nationally. Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love is one of those players. But he doesn\u2019t slip past our radar. He is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Love averaged 24.5 points, 12.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists in four games last week. He shot 57.6 percent from the field, including 55.6 percent on 3-point line attempts. Most important, the Cavs won three of the four games. They have started the season strong despite LeBron James\u2019 complaints about too much Cavs complacency.\n\nBackground: You\u2019re familiar with this tale: Team signs talented player. Talented player doesn\u2019t have chemistry with existing star player. Talented player isn\u2019t accustomed to the best of his talents. Talented player gets hurt and watches the remainder of the season. That about sums up Love\u2019s first year with the Cavs (last season). Things are different now. He\u2019s been a force inside and out, similar to what he was for so many successful individual seasons as part of the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: The Cavaliers clearly learned lessons from last season\u2019s misuse of Love. Now they\u2019re allowing him to be him, to work on the block, to crash the boards \u2014 and to step outside and knock down 3-point shots. Love is a big reason the Cavaliers sprinted to a 12-4 start. If the Cavs do what most think they will do \u2014 advance to the NBA Finals \u2014 Love\u2019s play will be a huge reason.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Kobe, or not Kobe \u2013 there\u2019s no question", "title": "Dempsey: Kobe, or not Kobe \u2013 there\u2019s no question", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/dempsey-kobe-or-not-kobe-theres-no-question/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T17:46:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:46:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "Talented player doesn\u2019t have chemistry with existing star player.\nHe is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\nOn Friday, Lakers coach Byron Scott was placed in the unenviable position of defending a star whose star is fading.\nTalented player isn\u2019t accustomed to the best of his talents.\nBackground: You\u2019re familiar with this tale: Team signs talented player."}
