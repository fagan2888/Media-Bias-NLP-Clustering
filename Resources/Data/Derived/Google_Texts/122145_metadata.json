Vivitrol is a non-narcotic that works with the same receptors that Suboxone and methadone effort. Vivitrol prevents the user from feeling the effects of an opioid. The pharmaceutical company that produces the medication, Alkermes, Inc., will provide the initial injection as part of a scholarship program at no cost to the county or inmate. The medication can also be used by alcoholics who need the additional assistance to remain sober. Inmates are pre-screened by Twin County Recovery Services and if they are deemed appropriate participants for the program, must agree to certain conditions before beginning the program, including outpatient counseling and treatment when released from the county jail. The injection will be given to the inmates before their release from jail and must apply for insurance while still in the facility. When released from jail, inmates must ensure that their insurance coverage has started. The insurance enrollment program began last year in conjunction with the Columbia County Healthcare Consortium to begin enrolling inmates in the county jail under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWith the current heroin epidemic that is impacting our county, to participate in a program that may help one person change their life and at the same time have no financial impact to the county, is something that we must pursue,\u201d said Sheriff David Bartlett.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Hudson Valley, Westchester County, Putnam County, Rockland County, White Plains, Peekskill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26f4\"", "article_summary": "This includes rewriting, broadcasting and/or printing of material from MidHudsonNews.com, by websites, radio and television stations, newspapers or other mediaHUDSON \u2013 The Columbia County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Twin County Recovery Service will implement a Vivitrol program for inmates at the county jail.\nThe insurance enrollment program began last year in conjunction with the Columbia County Healthcare Consortium to begin enrolling inmates in the county jail under the Affordable Care Act.\nInmates are pre-screened by Twin County Recovery Services and if they are deemed appropriate participants for the program, must agree to certain conditions before beginning the program, including outpatient counseling and treatment when released from the county jail.\nWhen released from jail, inmates must ensure that their insurance coverage has started.\nThe injection will be given to the inmates before their release from jail and must apply for insurance while still in the facility."}
