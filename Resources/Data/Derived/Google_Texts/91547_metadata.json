Bush administration official who launched the nonprofit group, which officially describes itself as nonpartisan, in 2011 with the stated purpose of helping to lift Latinos by offering workshops on a variety of topics.\n\nAnd, hand-in-hand with that, Libre is laying the groundwork for expanding the population of Latino conservatives.\n\nLibre gets much of its funding \u2013 reportedly more than $10 million \u2013 from the conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch.\n\nThe group\u2019s driving method of operation is to be embedded in Latino communities. Many of those communities are in places that are politically important \u2013 battleground states such as Florida, Nevada, Texas and Virginia, to name a few.\n\nAt the moment, Libre is in eight states, and expanding to a ninth \u2013 Wisconsin \u2013 later this year.\n\nThe organization has 65 full-time staff members, which is scheduled to grow to 80 by the end of the year.\n\nIn Nevada, Libre has held classes to teach Latinos, including many who are undocumented, about driving rules. Nevada allows people who are here illegally to obtain a driving card \u2013 a restricted document that allows people to drive but cannot be used as a government ID.\n\nBut many people had difficulty passing the test, which is where Libre sought to fill a void.\n\nIn Texas and Florida, Libre offers free classes and assistance in tax preparation, its members give food away to the needy, as well as award academic scholarships and provide wellness check-ups. The group regularly has a presence at community fairs.\n\nTheir outreach adapts to what a local population\u2019s needs might be.\n\n\u201cThe Latino community is so diverse,\u201d said Garza, the son of Mexican farmworkers who pulled himself up from the bootstraps, getting his GED after initially dropping out of high school, eventually attending college and then landing a string of powerful government jobs. \u201cA lot of people have a one-dimensional sense of the Latino community. Many Latino immigrants need help, but many Latinos have moved on and up, like all immigrants do.\u201d\n\nLibre often turns to trusted members of a community to make inroads.\n\nIn Central Florida, which has seen soaring growth in the Latino population \u2013 much of it from Puerto Rico \u2013 Libre counts among its ground troops David Velasquez, a local pastor.\n\nVelasquez has a broad range of contacts in the Latino community, Garza noted, that cut across socioeconomic lines. There are people who arrive with very little from their native homelands \u2013 and some end up homeless \u2013 and others who come with Rolex watches and advanced college degrees.\n\n\u201cHe deals a lot with the faith community, and he\u2019s plugged in with colleges, businesses and other groups,\u201d Garza said. \u201cHe works in different dimensions, that\u2019s what you have to do\u201d to penetrate a community.\n\nMaribel Velasquez, a longtime Orlando resident of Puerto Rican descent (who is of no relation to the pastor David Velasquez), praises Libre for offering services to the Latino community she says are rare and valuable, especially at no charge.\n\nVelasquez had never heard of Libre before a fellow parishioner at her church, where she leads a women\u2019s group, mentioned a workshop the organization was holding for women on how to start a business.\n\n\u201cI love business, I love starting businesses, and that got my attention,\u201d said Velasquez, who co-owns a mobile floor installation business with her husband. \u201cI asked a bunch of questions about the workshop and attended it and it was fabulous. It was well-run, informative and the presenters offered us follow-up consultations at no charge.\u201d\n\nVelasquez learned about other workshops catering to female empowerment, but they were in the Miami area, she said. When she asked if Libre could hold one of those workshops \u2013 on personal finance for women \u2013 at her church, they quickly obliged.\n\n\u201cThey provided appetizers, three female experts on financing conducted the workshop, it was extremely informative and motivating,\u201d said Velasquez, a self-described \u201cnon-political person\u201d who voted just once in her life.\n\nIt\u2019s especially key, Garza said, to get to Latinos while they\u2019re still assimilating.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks do not have an ideological foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the conversation begin with them, not only to get them engaged here but inform them about what would create a better society.\u201d\n\nAnd that includes, Libre tells them, school choice, immigration reform \u2013 although LIBRE opposes presidential executive action to achieve it \u2013 and a smaller government role in people\u2019s lives.\n\nLibre does not support the Affordable Care Act, arguing that makes access to healthcare harder for Latinos.\n\nIn published essays, Garza has written that younger Latinos are facing more than a 40 percent rise in health insurance premiums, that under the program it has been become harder for Latinos to find a doctor and that many Latinos have lost the insurance they had and preferred.\n\nOne of the topics being discussed at the Orlando phone bank was the Affordable Care Act. The volunteers asked callers what their experience has been so far with the program.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interesting dynamic happening in Central Florida, with the Puerto Rican community that\u2019s different from the rest of the state,\u201d Garza said. \u201cMany people have no political affiliation, and we want to drive the conversation as far as priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who are already there \u2013 who have been there for the past 10, 15 years \u2013 are barely beginning to develop politically. They remain very much at a crossroads.\u201d\n\nLibre\u2019s opposition to such programs and policies that are generally supported by liberals \u2013 like the Affordable Care Act and Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration \u2013 have drawn the ire of other Latino groups such as Latino Decisions, the voter polling firm, and Latino Victory Project, which aims to increase the number of Hispanic voters and Latinos running for office.\n\n\"We've tangled with Libre in the past,\" Latino Victory Project president Crist\u00f3bal Alex told Fox News Latino. \"It's an organization we watch very, very carefully. You can't dismiss them.\"\n\nAlex went on to say, \"What Dan Garza, whom I respect a great deal, has done in a very short period of time is build an organization that is highly sophisticated in engaging Latinos. He has the resources, thanks to the Koch brothers, to be a major player in the coming presidential elections.\"\n\nBut Alex accuses Libre of undermining Latinos by holding views and pushing for policies that work against the community's best interests.\n\n\"There's their opposition to the president's executive action on immigration, their opposition to raising the minimum wage, their opposition to the Affordable Care Act,\" Alex said. \"Garza is on the wrong side of the issues. His counterarguments line up almost perfectly with the tea party narrative, and that's a threat for what many us have worked for over the years \u2013 social justice and elevating Latino political power.\"\n\nGarza scoffs at the criticism, which he has grown accustomed to hearing since Libre launched and its link to the Koch brothers became known.\n\nHe says liberal groups are being disingenuous when they take aim at Libre.\n\n\"Liberals criticize Libre because they do what liberal organizations have been doing,\" said Alfonso Aguilar, a former official in the George W. Bush administration and executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that promotes conservatism among Latinos.\n\n\"These liberal groups want to treat Latinos as a monolithic group,\u201d Aguilar told FNL. \u201cIt's condescending to Latinos for groups to criticize Libre by saying they're against issues that all Latinos support. Liberals just don't like to see a conversation.\"\n\nAs for criticism that Libre takes money from the Koch brothers, Aguilar says that is also duplicitous and misguided.\n\n\"So many of these liberal organizations get financial support from George Soros,\" he said, referring to the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist whose foundation bankrolls many liberal causes and Democratic campaigns.\n\nBesides longtime Latino gateways such as Florida and Texas, Libre sets its sights on making forays into newer destinations for Latinos.\n\nThey held a forum on school choice in Wisconsin, for instance.\n\n\u201cMilwaukee has a huge Latino population, and there\u2019s huge support for school choice,\u201d Garza said. \u201cWe had a massive turnout of Hispanic parents. We\u2019ve been blown away.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.
