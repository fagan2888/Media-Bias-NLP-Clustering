The growth came in spite of the expiration of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed and all that horrible winter weather.\n\nSo what exactly did the Obamacare rollout do to cause such a rise? For one, it expanded the Medicaid program, a critical and highly controversial aspect of the law, by adding up to a $19 billion in benefits in January. On top of that, health care enrollees additionally received another near $15 billion in the form of tax credits as a result of the rollout, according to the BEA.\n\nTogether the two changes have freed up many Americans to spend money that would have gone towards health care premiums on goods and services instead.\n\nThe benefits of the Obamacare rollout thus far also appear to throw cold water on the idea that the law will hamper the economy -- especially when considering last January. Back then, both consumer spending and personal incomes had their worst month in years and fell by several percentage points after the battle in Congress over the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" ended with recession-era payroll tax cuts not being extended.\n\nOverall, that tax hike resulted in a $700 per worker tax increase on average, according to the Tax Policy Center. Who's killing the economy again?\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this post attributed a drop in consumer spending to an increase in the payroll tax. In fact, the payroll tax did not increase. A temporary payroll tax cut expired.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obamacare's Biggest Losers Obamacare's Biggest Losers\n\n1 of 15 #15 California Share this slide:\n\nAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Glenn Beck once said Obamaca...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-03-05 16:04:57 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Glenn Beck once said Obamaca...", "title": "Obamacare Just Made Americans Richer Without Anyone Noticing", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/04/obamacare-january-bea_n_4892267.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1655995/images/o-OBAMA-POINTING-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Glenn Beck once said Obamaca...", "title": "Obamacare Just Made Americans Richer Without Anyone Noticing", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1655995/images/o-OBAMA-POINTING-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "kevinashort", "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-04 16:04:57 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4892267", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "medicaid expansion,obamacare,payroll tax cut,Affordable Care Act,obama,Chamber of Commerce,medicaid,Bureau of Economic Analysis", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "medicaid expansion,obamacare,payroll tax cut,Affordable Care Act,obama,Chamber of Commerce,medicaid,Bureau of Economic Analysis", "published_time": "2014-03-04 16:04:57 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-03-05 15:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb47\"", "article_summary": "But so far, it turns out President Obama's 2010 health law is actually putting money in Americans' wallets.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this post attributed a drop in consumer spending to an increase in the payroll tax.\nA temporary payroll tax cut expired.\nIn fact, the payroll tax did not increase.\nOverall, that tax hike resulted in a $700 per worker tax increase on average, according to the Tax Policy Center."}
