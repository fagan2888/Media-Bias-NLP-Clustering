The restaurantt is open for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Saturday.\n\n\n\nBuilding has been steady at Hollow Creek, where Housing Resource of Western Colorado has been helping families build their own homes through the programagency\u2019s self-help housing program. HRWC has 14 lots remaining in the subdivision and is on the lookout for more lots in the Fruita area.\n\n\n\nThe Cowboy Mercantile opened in February at 316 Highway 6 & 50 in Fruita. The store carries both new and consignent saddles and bridles, as well as other Western-themed products. The store will also carry locally raised, USDA-inspected beef and pork, raised by Patti Heinz, one of the store\u2019s owners.\n\n\n\nThe city of Fruita opened the Fremont Trail in Fruita last fall, which provides school children a safe route to walk to and from school.\n\nFruita embraces its small-town charm and quirkiness, but is constantly working on the balancing act to create a vibrant community for business while maintaining its family-friendly vibe and small-town feel.\n\nTrails are an important feature for Fruita residents, and the town opened up the Fremont Trail, near 18 1/2 between Ottley and the Fruita 8/9 School to provide a safe way for children to walk to school last fall.\n\n\u201cThere are a ton of kids using it and it\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Clint Kinney, Fruita city manager. \u201cIt\u2019s in the exact right spot to get kids to and from school.\u201d\n\nThe town is also currently working to extend the Salt Wash Trail from where it meanders west of town along Highway 6 & 50 underneath both Interstate 70 and the railroad all the way to the Colorado River State Park, which could give local riders one more prime destination when they\u2019re looking for a paved route in the Fruita area.\n\n\u201cThe Fruita Bike Park will be done by the end of April,\u201d Kinney said. The Bike Park, which is on the east side of Highway 340 near the Colorado River, has picnic shelters, a small playground area and plenty of terrain for bikers of all levels. It\u2019s a great addition to a town that\u2019s already well-known for biking.\n\nThe Fruita Chamber of Commerce is continually trying to raise the visibility of businesses on both sides of Interstate 70 and has recently formed a focus group with businesses on the south side of the interstate.\n\n\u201cThey feel like they\u2019re forgotten over there,\u201d said Shauna Exner, director of the Fruita Chamber. The focus group, which meets on the third Wednesday of the month, has already decided to hold a big Fourth of July celebration on its side of the freeway to encourage people to drive over to the south side.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have a concert, kids\u2019s games, a penny scramble and a teen stage,\u201d Exner said.\n\nThere is still plenty of commercial land available for development on the south side of the interstate, and the chamber is actively engaged in looking for an anchor store that will help draw consumers to that side of the freeway.\n\nThe John McConnell Math and Science Center is considering a move from Orchard Mesa to Fruita that would put them on the south side of the freeway next to Dinosaur Journey. Right now, the math and science center and the museum are considering a partnership that would give them some shared spaces and some separate spaces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve looked all over the Grand Valley,\u201d said Teresa Coons, director of the math and science center. \u201cHow cool would it be to develop a museum and educational complex?\u201d\n\nThe new math and science facility would be where the old railroad car in the parking lot of Dinosaur Journey currently sits, and the plan is still in very preliminary stages. It will be at least two to three years before the center is ready to build.\n\nThe math and science center would have a separate building for exhibits and administration and there would be a joint building with an auditorium and classroom that would be used by both Dinosaur Journey and the math and science center. With the new Children\u2019s Nature Center that recently opened on Jurassic Avenue across Highway 340, that gives families plenty of options for a learning adventure in Fruita.\n\nFamilies who want to move to Fruita can be assured that Fruita remains a rural community under the guidelines of the USDA, which offers housing loans with 100 percent financing in rural communities.
