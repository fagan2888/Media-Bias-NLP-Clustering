Berlin police spokesman Michael Gassen, who confirmed authorities worked with Brand, said so far some 100 tons of art has been loaded onto trucks in the southwestern spa town of Bad Duerkheim where they were found in warehouses.\n\nEight suspects, whose identities have not been released by police, are under investigation on suspicion of dealing in stolen goods and fraud, Gassen said.\n\nBut Attorney Andreas Hiemsch, who represents the Bad Duerkheim man who was in possession of the art, denied the allegations, telling The Associated Press that his client had rightfully obtained the pieces from the Russian army more than 25 years ago.\n\nHiemsch said in an email that his client had even loaned certain pieces by artist Arno Brekers to a museum near Cologne over the past 20 years and had \u201ca few years ago\u201d offered the bronze horses by artist Josef Thorak to a \u201cfederal museum exhibit\u201d but that he wasn\u2019t taken seriously.\n\nBrand, who runs a Dutch agency that helps track the provenance of artworks and advises buyers on the authenticity of works, says he was shocked when he pieced together enough evidence to prove that recent photos of the Thorak horses were not fakes.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Brand said when he first saw the photos, \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, right, those horses were destroyed. This is ridiculous.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dutch art sleuth helps German police track down Nazi art", "title": "Dutch art sleuth helps German police track down Nazi art", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dutch art sleuth helps German police track down Nazi art", "title": "Dutch art sleuth helps German police track down Nazi art", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/22/dutch_art_sleuth_helps_german_police_track_down_nazi_art/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/germany-hitlers-horses.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dutch art sleuth helps German police track down Nazi art", "title": "Dutch art sleuth helps German police track down Nazi art", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/germany-hitlers-horses.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Corder and David Rising", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23de\"", "article_summary": "Arthur Brand provided tips to German detectives who made the stunning discovery in a series of coordinated raids, capping a long investigation into illegal art trafficking.\nIn a telephone interview, Brand said when he first saw the photos, \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, right, those horses were destroyed.\nEight suspects, whose identities have not been released by police, are under investigation on suspicion of dealing in stolen goods and fraud, Gassen said.\nBrand, who runs a Dutch agency that helps track the provenance of artworks and advises buyers on the authenticity of works, says he was shocked when he pieced together enough evidence to prove that recent photos of the Thorak horses were not fakes.\nBerlin police spokesman Michael Gassen, who confirmed authorities worked with Brand, said so far some 100 tons of art has been loaded onto trucks in the southwestern spa town of Bad Duerkheim where they were found in warehouses."}
