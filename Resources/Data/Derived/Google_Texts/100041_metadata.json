(AP) - Florida Democrats must decide whether their best shot at winning the Senate seat now held by Marco Rubio is a liberal firebrand who has said the GOP health plan was to hope people die quickly, or a moderate Democrat who often votes with Republicans.\n\nRubio is giving up his seat to seek the Republican nomination for president, and it\u2019s targeted by Democrats hoping to regain a majority in the chamber. The two major candidates are U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, a bomb thrower who has endeared himself to the far left of his party, and U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, a former Republican who has sided with the GOP on issues like loosening banking regulations, weakening President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul and forming a committee to investigate the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nThe Democratic establishment is behind Murphy, seeing him as the stronger general election candidate in a state that tends to be moderate, while Grayson says he\u2019s the only true Democrat in the race. Republicans on the sideline are working to give credence to that claim.\n\nThe contest mirrors recent Republican primaries around the country where tea party candidates challenged establishment-backed candidates. Republicans learned in states like Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana and Colorado that nominating someone who represents the extreme side of the party can cost them the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happened with politics nationally,\u201d said David Beattie, a Florida-based Democratic pollster unaffiliated with either campaign. \u201cThere are staunch portions of both Democratic primaries and Republican primaries that seem further out of where the mainstream of the nation is.\u201d\n\nRepublicans would like nothing more than to face Grayson, who promotes himself to his party\u2019s left extreme much the same way tea party candidates appeal to the extreme of the Republican Party. The Republicans have four major candidates, U.S. Rep. Ron Desantis, a tea party favorite backed by conservative groups; U.S. Rep. David Jolly, a former Washington lobbyist and congressional aide; Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and businessman Todd Wilcox, who has never run for political office.\n\nBeattie said Florida today is like a flip side of the 2012 Missouri Senate race. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill now acknowledges she manipulated the Republican primary to help then-U.S. Rep. Todd Akin win the nomination. McCaskill was considered one of the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats, and she saw Akin as the easiest Republican to beat. Her plan worked - Akin\u2019s comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and other extreme positions cost him the election.\n\nThe Republican Party of Florida and the National Republican Senatorial Committee are bombarding reporters with anti-Murphy emails while leaving Grayson relatively untouched.\n\nThere are clear differences in their voting records - though Murphy has voted with his party more often since deciding to run for Senate. The Associated Press reviewed every U.S. House roll call vote the past two years, more than 1,200 in all. In 2014, Murphy and Grayson voted differently 20 percent of the time. That dropped to about 10 percent after Murphy entered the Senate race last year.\n\nMurphy sided with Republicans on several key bills opposed by Obama and most House Democrats. He supported of the Keystone XL pipeline; voted to condemn Obama for the exchange of American prisoner Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and supported a resolution seeking an investigation on whether the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups.\n\nMurphy also supported a bill sponsored by potential Republican opponent Rep. Ron DeSantis seeking to rein in Obama\u2019s use of executive orders on issues like health care and immigration.\n\nGrayson said the differences show Murphy isn\u2019t a true Democrat, though he acknowledged Murphy has voted more in line with Democrats since entering the Senate race. The two will square off in the Florida primary in August.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to run away from his own history as one of the worst Democrats in the House of Representatives,\u201d Grayson said in a phone interview. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s so utterly unscrupulous that he wants to run away from his own record just underscores the fact that he\u2019s basically a Democrat in name only, what we call a DINO.\u201d\n\nNot that there weren\u2019t moments Grayson didn\u2019t vote with his party. He was the only Democrat to vote against the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that guarantees loans to major exporters. Grayson also opposed resolutions to support Ukraine and to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin that had near unanimous support from both parties.\n\nMurphy, who answered questions about his voting record via email after his campaign asked for them in advance, said he stays true to core Democratic values. He said he doesn\u2019t want to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but he said improvements can be made. Likewise, he said he supports Wall Street reform but thinks changes can be made to the Dodd-Frank Act to help small and mid-size banks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of where I stand, and I\u2019m proud to be a Democrat. My priorities are exactly where most Floridians and most Democrats are, fiscally responsible and socially progressive,\u201d Murphy wrote.\n\nFlorida Democrats don\u2019t always support the more liberal candidate, especially in rural areas and in the north where Southern Democrats are more conservative, and the race could come down to more than just voting records.\n\n\u201cThe average voter is not going to feel that there\u2019s vast policy differences between them. It\u2019s going to be demeanor and trust and who they like, and I think that is an advantage for Murphy,\u201d Beattie said. \u201cThere are people in the primary that are looking for a staunch, liberal firebrand, and that\u2019s a position that Grayson has happily owned for years. The lower the turnout in the primary, probably the better it is for Grayson.\u201d\n\nAnd unlike tea party Republicans elsewhere, Grayson doesn\u2019t have an equivalent Democratic movement he can tap to boost his campaign, said Florida-based Democratic pollster Tom Eldon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no tea party, there\u2019s no organization, there\u2019s no ground troops, there\u2019s no Americans For Progress bankrolling everything,\u201d Eldon said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty much a lone wolf out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Democrats must decide whether their best shot at winning the Senate seat now held by Marco Rubio is a liberal firebrand who has said the GOP health plan was to hope people die quickly, or a moderate Democrat who often votes with Republicans.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Florida Democrats must decide whether their best shot at winning the Senate seat now held by Marco Rubio is a liberal firebrand who has said the GOP health plan was to hope people die quickly, or a moderate Democrat who often votes with Republicans.", "title": "Florida Democrats have clear choice in race to replace Rubio", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/28/florida-democrats-have-clear-choice-in-race-to-rep/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/28/senate_2016_florida_democrats.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/28/senate_2016_florida_democrats.jpeg", "description": "Florida Democrats must decide whether their best shot at winning the Senate seat now held by Marco Rubio is a liberal firebrand who has said the GOP health plan was to hope people die quickly, or a mo", "card": "summary", "title": "Florida Democrats have clear choice in race to replace Rubio"}, "Author": "BRENDAN FARRINGTON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s no tea party, there\u2019s no organization, there\u2019s no ground troops, there\u2019s no Americans For Progress bankrolling everything,\u201d Eldon said.\nThe Republican Party of Florida and the National Republican Senatorial Committee are bombarding reporters with anti-Murphy emails while leaving Grayson relatively untouched.\nThe contest mirrors recent Republican primaries around the country where tea party candidates challenged establishment-backed candidates.\nGrayson said the differences show Murphy isn\u2019t a true Democrat, though he acknowledged Murphy has voted more in line with Democrats since entering the Senate race.\nMcCaskill was considered one of the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats, and she saw Akin as the easiest Republican to beat."}
