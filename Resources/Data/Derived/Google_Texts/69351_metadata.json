Sharon Sunderman, his mother, videotaped his reaction and it\u2019s the best.\n\nBen can be seen reading carefully though his acceptance letter from Embassy Suites, where he applied for an internship. His voice is even throughout the video before he gets to the end and his mother asks him what it all means. He breaks into a huge smile, shouting, \u201cI get it! I get a job!\u201d\n\nSharon told ABC News Ben applied for the job through Project Search, a program devoted to training children with disabilities to transition from high school to entry-level positions in the work force. Though individuals with Down syndrome experience cognitive delays, the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) says \u201cthe effect is usually mild to moderate and is not indicative of the many strengths and talents that each individual possesses.\u201d\n\nThe NDSS added that with quality programs, a stimulating home environment, great health care, and a supportive community \u2014 including friends and family \u2014 individuals with Down syndrome can go on to develop their full potential and lead fulfilling lives.\n\n\"Adults with disabilities can really add value,\" Sharon said. \"Just the joy that Ben has at the fact that he is able to get a job and be part of the community. That's what every parent wants for their kid.\"\n\nSharon encourages other parents who have children with disabilities to set their expectations high. She\u2019s always encouraged Ben to do everything he wanted, including laundry and making the bed like his brother and sister. Last year, he was voted prom king and now, he'll have a new job.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "texas, teen, down, syndrome, gets, his, first, job, mom, reminds, other, parents, set", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ben Sunderman, 19, will start an internship at Embassy Suites in August.", "title": "This Teen With Down Syndrome Gets His First Job, And His Reaction Is The Best [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/texas-teen-down-syndrome-gets-his-first-job-mom-reminds-other-parents-set-329822", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/18/ben-sunderman.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Sunderman, 19, will start an internship at Embassy Suites in August.", "title": "This Teen With Down Syndrome Gets His First Job, And His Reaction Is The Best [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/texas-teen-down-syndrome-gets-his-first-job-mom-reminds-other-parents-set-329822", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/18/ben-sunderman.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/18/ben-sunderman.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-18T13:26:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-18T13:45:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ben Sunderman, 19, will start an internship at Embassy Suites in August."}, "article_summary": "Ben Sunderman is a 19-year-old from Texas with Down syndrome, and he just got his first job.\nSharon Sunderman, his mother, videotaped his reaction and it\u2019s the best.\nSharon encourages other parents who have children with disabilities to set their expectations high.\nShe\u2019s always encouraged Ben to do everything he wanted, including laundry and making the bed like his brother and sister.\nHis voice is even throughout the video before he gets to the end and his mother asks him what it all means."}
