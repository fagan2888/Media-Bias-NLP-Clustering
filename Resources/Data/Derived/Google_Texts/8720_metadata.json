Finally someone in a newsroom digs into the faith history of a local activist and finds a huge backstory.\n\nAmong a new generation of Black Lives Matter activists who use confrontative tactics to get attention is a woman whose views were shaped by her church and the theology classes she took at a local Christian college. The reporter tracked down which professors influenced her turn toward radicalism and interviewed them. One encouraged her to take a feminist look at the Bible which in itself is somewhat unusual for a conservative Christian college. Then again, maybe SPU isn't all that conservative? That could be a story.\n\nBut her church, an evangelical congregation in west Seattle, wasn\u2019t moving fast enough for the 24-year-old biracial woman and by this spring, she felt abandoned by her fellow Christians, the article said. Because Johnson did not say much in the one brief interview she gave the Times, the reporter had to dig through tapes of events at which Johnson had spoken or had disrupted by shouting down the speakers. She also interviewed Johnson\u2019s pastor.\n\nThe reporter then dug up the head of SPU\u2019s John Perkins Center for Reconciliation, Leadership Training and Community Development and found out that older blacks are put off by Johnson\u2019s tactics and have called her on the carpet for it. Not that she\u2019s listened, as illustrated in her recent disruption of the Bernie Sanders speech.\n\nThe bottom line: What is fascinating is how the article explains how the mainstream African-American church is not a part of today\u2019s protests.\n\nAn SPU theology professor on the panel, Brenda Salter McNeil, said she saw the disconnect between the church and the Black Lives Matters movement firsthand when she went to Ferguson around the time of the riots. Cussing freely in front of her, young people announced they found the church hypocritical and misogynistic.\n\n\u201cThere is a big distinction between what is happening now and what happened in the days of Selma,\u201d she said, referring to the famous civil-rights marches of 50 years ago. Then, she said, \u201cpeople met in churches. They came down the streets singing church songs. This ain\u2019t that movement.\u201d\n\nIf the article has a failing, it\u2019s in not explaining how Johnson can justify her actions -- as a Christian -- in exercising the heckler\u2019s veto.\n\nThe writer implies Johnson has gone post-Christian but, as evidenced by the large cross-shaped earrings she wears at demonstrations, the activist hasn\u2019t completely dumped her beliefs. This is one complex individual. As some of the 388-plus commentators ask at the end of this piece, at what level is her activism? Why does she attend a mostly white church instead of a historic black one, for starters?\n\nOthers asked the Seattle Times why it was giving Johnson A-1 placement on a Sunday front page. Maybe it's because BLM activists are disrupting other rallies as well.\n\nThe article was worth doing, even if it chronicles the actions of a lost soul. The research the reporter did on Johnson was standard for a good religion story; that is, go to this woman\u2019s church, interview the professors at the Christian university Johnson attended and build your story from there. Find the voices and quote them.\n\nSo many reporters these days don\u2019t respect the religion element enough to do that.
