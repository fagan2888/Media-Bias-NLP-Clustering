After her exercise physiologist Marco Borges recommended the plant-based diet, not only did she lose 8 pounds, but she was able to keep it off as well.\n\nIt all began on Dec. 3, 2013, when Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z announced they would start a 22-day vegan challenge together, after the power couple entered into a partnership with their trainer Borges for the vegan meal delivery service, \u201cThe 22-Day Revolution.\u201d The plant-based diet relies on the theory it takes 21 days to form or break a habit, turning veganism into a lifestyle change instead of just a three-week cleanse.\n\n\u201cI am not a naturally thin woman,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told GMA. \u201cI have curves and I am proud of my curves. I have struggled since a young age with diets, and finding something that actually works and actually keeps the weight off has been difficult for me.\u201d\n\nABC News Videos | ABC Entertainment News\n\nSome Beyonc\u00e9 fans weren\u2019t happy with the hyped GMA announcement, which many speculated would be the release of a studio album or news of a second pregnancy. One fan took to Twitter and wrote, \u201cThey had the dramatic music in the Beyonc\u00e9 /GMA interview commercial and she\u2019s announcing that she only eats grass lmao.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not just eating grass. Beyonc\u00e9 admits to bending the rules a little when it comes to her diet; she incorporates a high quantity of vegetables into daily meals. The diet recommends eating three meals a day, choosing plants over processed foods, following the 80-10-10 ratio (80 percent carbohydrates, 10 percent fat, and 10 percent protein), exercising for 30 minutes every day, and drinking plenty of water. In addition to removing all animal products like fish, meat, and dairy from the diet, Borges encourages to also completely cut alcohol intake in order to experience the full effects. Pushing pass 21 days is the trick to forming life-long diets because the brain's pattern-enforcing synapses build pathways, which form habits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection, it\u2019s about progression,\u201d Borges said on TODAY. \u201cWe know that we should be eating more vegetables. The problem is the majority of our diet is meat-based products. We try to incorporate more plant-based products, but we don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\nAt first, Beyonc\u00e9 was apprehensive, fearing she would miss out on celebrations, restaurants, and that she would experience headaches and become irritable from the diet restrictions. But instead, she said her energy naturally increased, she started to sleep better, experienced sustainable weight loss, improved digestion, and clarity. Best of all, she says she has \u201can incredibly positive feeling for my actions and the effects it would have on those around me and the environment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beyonce, reveals, unsurprising, weight, loss, secret, vegan, diet, how, you, can, sustain, while", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 announced her new diet, which incorporates 22 days of hearty helpings of vegetables, water, and more.", "title": "How You Can Eat Like Queen Bey (For More Than 22 Days) [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beyonce-reveals-unsurprising-weight-loss-secret-vegan-diet-how-you-can-sustain-while-337052", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/08/beyonce-veganism.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beyonc\u00e9 announced her new diet, which incorporates 22 days of hearty helpings of vegetables, water, and more.", "title": "How You Can Eat Like Queen Bey (For More Than 22 Days) [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beyonce-reveals-unsurprising-weight-loss-secret-vegan-diet-how-you-can-sustain-while-337052", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/08/beyonce-veganism.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/08/beyonce-veganism.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-06-08T15:26:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T15:42:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 announced her new diet, which incorporates 22 days of hearty helpings of vegetables, water, and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd902d\"", "article_summary": "After her exercise physiologist Marco Borges recommended the plant-based diet, not only did she lose 8 pounds, but she was able to keep it off as well.\nBut instead, she said her energy naturally increased, she started to sleep better, experienced sustainable weight loss, improved digestion, and clarity.\nBeyonc\u00e9 admits to bending the rules a little when it comes to her diet; she incorporates a high quantity of vegetables into daily meals.\nOne fan took to Twitter and wrote, \u201cThey had the dramatic music in the Beyonc\u00e9 /GMA interview commercial and she\u2019s announcing that she only eats grass lmao.\u201dShe\u2019s not just eating grass.\nIn addition to removing all animal products like fish, meat, and dairy from the diet, Borges encourages to also completely cut alcohol intake in order to experience the full effects."}
