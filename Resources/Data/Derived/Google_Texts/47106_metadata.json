But as the only Democratic debate scheduled to air on a weeknight before the February 1 Iowa caucuses, Tuesday night\u2019s face-off comes with high stakes for the five candidates slated to appear onstage at the Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nHillary Clinton, who retains a comfortable but diminished lead, hopes to assuage doubts about her candidacy, but she must avoid a repeat of the disastrous 2007 performance in which she took multiple stances on driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants \u2014 in the space of one answer. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders will seek to expand his appeal beyond the white progressive activists who have cheered his egalitarian message, and Martin O\u2019Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee will compete to score break-out performances.\n\nBut while much of the post-debate analysis will focus on how well candidates met their own objectives \u2014 Did Clinton stanch the bleeding after a summer of tough headlines and declining polls? Does Sanders look like a viable nominee? Did Chafee manage to remind people he exists? \u2014 in a better world, we\u2019d focus just as much on how well the debate informed voters about the candidates\u2019 policy proposals, worldviews, and track records. So here\u2019s a list of questions \u2014 Salon settled for one per candidate \u2014 that we hope to see moderators Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper ask the hopefuls. They\u2019re designed to probe the candidates\u2019 positions, illuminate what drives them, and get at the core rationale for their candidacies.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nMadam Secretary, last week you announced your opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, arguing that the pact failed to meet your taste of creating American jobs, boosting wages, and promoting American national security. Yet as Secretary of State in 2012, you championed TPP as \u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements,\u201d specifically citing its protections for workers, wages, and American strategic interests.\n\nDuring your tenure as Secretary, you also advocated for the U.S. free trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea, both of which you fiercely opposed during your 2008 campaign. In that race, you also, along with then-Sen. Obama, called for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, although it emerged that your campaign, like Obama\u2019s, met privately to tell Canadian officials that your campaign-stump skepticism of NAFTA should be taken \u201cwith a grain of salt.\u201d\n\nThis came just eight years after you expressed concerns about NAFTA during your 2000 Senate campaign \u2014 only to praise the agreement in your 2003 memoir.\n\nGiven your record of saying one thing about free trade agreements while you\u2019re campaigning and doing another while in office, why should Democratic voters trust your latest word on TPP?\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nSen. Sanders, you\u2019ve attracted an impassioned following with your call for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d against the \u201cbillionaire class,\u201d a call which resonates deeply amid widespread anxiety over economic inequality and a growing sense that the deck is stacked against working and middle class families.\n\nLeading that revolution has become the raison d\u2019etre of your campaign, and you\u2019ve also proposed massive investments in health, education, jobs, and infrastructure as a means of improving the economic lot of ordinary Americans.\n\nBut while domestic and economic issues are at the forefront of many voters\u2019 minds, the next president will confront a host of international problems, from the long-brewing to the unforeseen. And though you have touted your opposition to the war in Iraq, foreign policy issues have received relatively short shrift during your campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With so few debates this cycle, tomorrow night's Las Vegas showdown comes with high stakes for all Dem hopefuls", "title": "The Democrats play Vegas: The tough debate questions Salon would ask the candidates", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With so few debates this cycle, tomorrow night's Las Vegas showdown comes with high stakes for all Dem hopefuls", "title": "The Democrats play Vegas: The tough debate questions Salon would ask the candidates", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/12/the_democrats_play_vegas_the_tough_debate_questions_salon_would_ask_the_candidates/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/omalley_sanders_chafee_hillary.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With so few debates this cycle, tomorrow night's Las Vegas showdown comes with high stakes for all Dem hopefuls", "title": "The Democrats play Vegas: The tough debate questions Salon would ask the candidates", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/omalley_sanders_chafee_hillary.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Democratic primary, 2016 Elections, Bernie Sanders, Democratic debates, Democratic Leadership Council, Democratic Party, Editor's Picks, Foreign policy, Free Trade, Hillary Clinton, Jim Webb, Lincoln Chafee, Martin O'Malley, The Trans-Pacific Partnership", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd159\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 in a better world, we\u2019d focus just as much on how well the debate informed voters about the candidates\u2019 policy proposals, worldviews, and track records.\nGiven your record of saying one thing about free trade agreements while you\u2019re campaigning and doing another while in office, why should Democratic voters trust your latest word on TPP?\nThey\u2019re designed to probe the candidates\u2019 positions, illuminate what drives them, and get at the core rationale for their candidacies.\nSo here\u2019s a list of questions \u2014 Salon settled for one per candidate \u2014 that we hope to see moderators Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper ask the hopefuls.\nDuring your tenure as Secretary, you also advocated for the U.S. free trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea, both of which you fiercely opposed during your 2008 campaign."}
