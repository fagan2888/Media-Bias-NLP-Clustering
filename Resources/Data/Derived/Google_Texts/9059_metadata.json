Warren Buffett and other stock gurus have made the same case.\n\nThe argument for Hillary is that she\u2019s predictable and that Wall Street knows what she will do. Mr. Trump, by contrast, is the high beta candidate, and let\u2019s face it: no one knows exactly what you get with a President Trump. She\u2019s the safer bet. Investors also are drooling for a return to the 1990s and the bull market returns under Bill Clinton \u2014 when stocks tripled in value. I know I am.\n\nHillary is seen as less likely to spark a trade war that could send stocks tumbling.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with each of these arguments. It\u2019s true that Hillary brings far more certainty, but what this means is that we are absolutely certain to get bad ideas. I never have bought the argument that Wall Street wants the devil they know.\n\nIf you\u2019re walking down a dark street at night and there\u2019s a 100 percent chance that you will get mugged on the left side of the street and a 50 percent chance if you cross over to the right side of the street, what\u2019s the logical move?\n\nHillary is 100 percent predictable. She is going to raise tax rates; she is going to spend trillions more over the next decade; she is going to stop drilling for oil and gas and shutdown our coal industry; she is going to double down on Obamacare; and she is going to wage war against the rich on Wall Street. Is that the certainty Wall Street is craving?\n\nLet\u2019s take taxes. Mr. Trump wants a 20 percent capital gains tax. Hillary wants a 46 percent capital gains tax. Now these are direct taxes on investors. What is the difference between these two policy courses? A share of stock is worth the discounted present value of the returns after tax. So let us assume a stock earns $10 a share. Under Hillary the stock\u2019s after-tax return is $5.54 a share. Under Mr. Trump the after-tax return is $8.00. This is an oversimplification because Hillary would tax longer held stocks at a rate of 23.8 percent. But the stocks have a much higher return under Mr. Trump.\n\nBut the corporate tax also has an effect on stock values. Hillary wants to keep the 35 percent rate. Mr. Trump wants a 15 percent rate. So under Hillary the government takes one-third of corporate profits, and under Mr. Trump the government takes one-sixth of the profits. It\u2019s true the effective tax rate is lower for many multinationals, but the broader point is obvious: Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan is much, much, much better for stocks than Hillary\u2018s. By the way I didn\u2019t even mention that Mr. Trump wants a lower estate tax \u2014 another tax on stocks \u2014 and Hillary wants a more confiscatory system.\n\nBut stocks did phenomenally well under Hillary\u2019s husband. True but this isn\u2019t Bill Clinton\u2019s party anymore. Hillary is running as Bernie-lite, not Bill-lite. The days of the centrist Democrats are long past. Bill balanced budgets, cut spending, cut the capital gains tax and signed welfare reform. Hillary stands on the other side on all these issues.\n\nOn trade, Mr. Trump\u2019s black mark, Hillary might be better, but not by much. She\u2019s against the Asia trade deal. She was against lifting the export ban on American oil and gas.\n\nWill there be a Hillary Clinton bull market? I\u2019d short that bet. And in some ways, Mr. Trump could be the most pro-investor president in decades.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is an economics consultant with Freedom Works and a Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a supremely weird election season the latest weird twist is the consensus emerging on Wall Street that Hillary Clinton would be better for financial markets than Donald Trump.", "Author": "Stephen Moore", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In a supremely weird election season the latest weird twist is the consensus emerging on Wall Street that Hillary Clinton would be better for financial markets than Donald Trump.", "title": "STEPHEN MOORE: The Hillary Clinton Recession", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/20/stephen-moore-the-hillary-clinton-recession/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/20/3_202016_moore-chart-0321-20-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/20/3_202016_moore-chart-0321-20-28201.jpg", "title": "STEPHEN MOORE: The Hillary Clinton Recession", "description": "In a supremely weird election season the latest weird twist is the consensus emerging on Wall Street that Hillary Clinton would be better for financial markets than Donald Trump.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump"}, "article_summary": "The usually sensible Barrons magazine concluded its cover story last week that Hillary-onomics is better for investors than Mr. Trump.\nI never have bought the argument that Wall Street wants the devil they know.\nBy the way I didn\u2019t even mention that Mr. Trump wants a lower estate tax \u2014 another tax on stocks \u2014 and Hillary wants a more confiscatory system.\nMr. Trump, by contrast, is the high beta candidate, and let\u2019s face it: no one knows exactly what you get with a President Trump.\nThe argument for Hillary is that she\u2019s predictable and that Wall Street knows what she will do."}
