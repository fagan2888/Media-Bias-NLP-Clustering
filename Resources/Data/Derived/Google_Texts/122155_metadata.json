[API/S] [EIA/S]\n\nAPI's numbers often vary to official supply-demand figures for oil released each Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nEven so, some traders braced for the possibility of the EIA reporting a large build as well in crude inventories for last week that could cut short the oil market rebound of the past two weeks. Crude prices rose in eight of the last 13 sessions, gaining 22 percent in all.\n\n\"This is a big build that surprised even me,\" said Tariq Zahir, an oil bear who has bet on weaker U.S. crude oil prices for more than a year now. \"If the EIA has equally bearish numbers tomorrow, we can really see pressure come on to this oil rally.\"\n\nU.S. crude was up 14 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $33.89 a barrel by 5:17 p.m. EST (2217 GMT). It had settled up 65 cents, or 2 percent, at $34.40 a barrel.\n\nBrent, the global benchmark for crude, was up 4 cents at $36.61, after trading in the negative earlier. It had settled up 24 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $36.81.\n\nOil rose during the session after being buoyed by a rally on Wall Street. Equity markets and oil have mostly traded in tandem for weeks and Wall Street's key index for U.S. stocks, the S&P 500 rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday.\n\nCrude prices were also supported by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak's remarks that oil firms in the country support a pledge to average production this year at January's levels.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin spoke of \"more radical\" measures to balance the global oil market, on top of a production freeze plan jointly pursued by Moscow with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela.\n\nCrude prices have trended higher since hitting 12-year lows under $30 a barrel between late January and mid-February. Despite the rebound, the market is still down about two-thirds from highs above $100 in mid-2014.\n\n(Additional reporting by Karolin Schaps in London; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Chris Reese)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil markets closed up as much as 2 percent on Tuesday, before giv", "title": "Oil ends up on Wall Street, but pulls back on U.S. crude builds", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/29/Oil-prices-defend-gains-output-dips-China-boosts-consumption", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-global-oil_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/29/Oil-prices-defend-gains-output-dips-China-boosts-consumption", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-global-oil_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil markets closed up as much as 2 percent on Tuesday, before giv", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26f9\"", "article_summary": "Crude prices rose in eight of the last 13 sessions, gaining 22 percent in all.\nOil rose during the session after being buoyed by a rally on Wall Street.\nCrude prices have trended higher since hitting 12-year lows under $30 a barrel between late January and mid-February.\n\"This is a big build that surprised even me,\" said Tariq Zahir, an oil bear who has bet on weaker U.S. crude oil prices for more than a year now.\nCrude prices were also supported by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak's remarks that oil firms in the country support a pledge to average production this year at January's levels."}
