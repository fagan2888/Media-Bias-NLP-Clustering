Different hospitals have different types of patients in them. It\u2019s impossible to put standard performance figures on all hospitals, because the types of patients in those hospitals are different.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Very Incremental Change\u2019\n\nMarc Joffe, senior policy analyst at the California Policy Center, says the new standards only tweak Covered California\u2019s hospital and insurance system, rather than provide a much-needed overhaul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a matter of mending and shaping than creating competition,\u201d Joffe said. \u201cI think one point is that this is a heavily regulated industry already. It\u2019s a very incremental change.\u201d\n\nJoffe says patients do need a system that weeds out low-performing hospitals.\n\n\u201cIf a hospital is providing very poor cost-benefit in the world of third-party payment, then we need a mechanism to deter such things,\u201d Joffe said. \u201cIt is already forced spending on the part of the consumer.\u201d\n\nMichael McGrady (mmcgrady@uccs.edu) writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ff1\"", "article_summary": "California\u2019s health insurance exchange contracts for 2017\u201319 will require insurers to identify and exclude from exchange plans hospitals providing low-quality or unjustifiably expensive care.\nIt\u2019s a very incremental change.\u201dJoffe says patients do need a system that weeds out low-performing hospitals.\nThe new system adopts an incentive-based compensation system for hospitals, putting at least 6 percent of reimbursement \u201cat-risk or subject to a bonus payment for quality performance,\u201d the draft states.\n\u201cFor them to start deciding which hospitals are offering value and quality care is absolutely ridiculous.\n\u2018Absolutely Ridiculous\u2019Sally Pipes, president and CEO of the Pacific Research Institute, says Covered California is unequipped to manage sound judgments of the value individual hospitals offer patients."}
