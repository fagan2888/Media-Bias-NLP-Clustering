It would also cut tariffs on Japanese vehicles exported to the United States, but over a period of time expected to be 20 years or more.\n\nAlthough Japan does not impose tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles, U.S. automakers have complained for decades that the market is essentially shut to them because of barriers of other kinds, including difficulty in securing distribution networks and the need to meet separate safety certification.\n\nThe bilateral deal between the United States and Japan would include a first-of-its-kind dispute resolution mechanism that would impose penalties if Japan were judged to have fallen short of its commitments, the second person said.\n\nAt the same time, Japan's auto manufacturers would be given clearance to buy more parts for cars manufactured in North America without paying trade tariffs under the terms of the deal being discussed.\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico mandates that vehicles have a local content of 62.5 percent. The way that rule is implemented means that just over half of a vehicle needs to be manufactured locally.\n\nThe set of rules under discussion in Atlanta would bring that to 45 percent, or about 55 percent under a separate calculation used by Japan's auto industry and regulators, people with knowledge of discussions have told Reuters.\n\nMexico is keen to maintain high thresholds to protect its booming auto and auto parts industry. Since 2009, seven auto production plants have been announced for North America and all of them are in Mexico.\n\nBolstered by its relatively cheap labor and proximity to the U.S. market, Mexico is on track to overtake South Korea as the sixth-largest auto producer by 2020, according to IHS Automotive.\n\nBy accepting a lower local content threshold for autos, Mexican officials would be betting that it would be able to sustain its post NAFTA-boom and attract new investment even if some cheap and lower-margin parts are imported for assembly, people involved have said.\n\nA Pacific trade deal would be a legacy-defining achievement for U.S. President Barack Obama, who has said it should also open export markets to Detroit automakers.\n\nand Daimler's Mercedes.
