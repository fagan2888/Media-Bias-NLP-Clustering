There\u2019s no such thing as unconditional love for your spouse.\n\nI just blew your mind, didn\u2019t I? Here\u2019s the thing: Your spouse isn\u2019t your child. Your spouse is your partner, a fellow adult whom you chose to spend the rest of your life with. You are not guaranteed to love that person every single day (or month, or even year) and guess what? They don\u2019t have to love you back.\n\nMy whole life, all I\u2019d heard was, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to always like your husband, but you\u2019ll always love him.\u201d\n\nSo when we came upon hard times I was worried that our marriage was over. After all, there wasn\u2019t much love when we were acting so awful toward one another. And isn\u2019t marriage about unconditional love?\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d said our fantastic marriage therapist. \u201cWho told you that? He\u2019s not your child. You\u2019re not guaranteed each other\u2019s unconditional love.\u201d\n\nWhen I realized that unconditional love was not a requirement of marriage, a lightbulb went off. Maybe we can still be a happy couple, a happy family, even if there are rough times when the love isn\u2019t flowing. For us, the love did flow again stronger than ever. Bottom line: You have to earn each other\u2019s love \u2013 even five years, ten years, forty years in.\n\n2. The first two years after having a baby can be the hardest of your entire relationship. Don\u2019t let that become the model for the rest of your lives together.\n\nYes, a baby is one of the greatest joys in life for people who want to have a family. But even if you\u2019ve wanted to be parents your entire lives, things are going to be shaken up when that bundle arrives. You\u2019ve probably had years to establish routines and ways of resolving conflict, and routines for how you connect. But that\u2019s all going to get shot out of the water.\n\nPeople tell you to be sure to put your marriage first \u2013 and I agree with that (obviously, as long as you\u2019re also prioritizing the health and happiness of your children). But I want you to know that it can seriously suck having a new baby at times. You don\u2019t sleep, your hormones may be messed up, you may be \u201ctouched out\u201d, your entire frame of mind may change.\n\nBut do not \u2013 I repeat DO NOT \u2013 let this hard time become the model for the way you\u2019ll see and treat your spouse the rest of your lives together. It\u2019s tempting to let resentments build and to stop framing your partner as the person you fell madly in love with, but you need to fight that. Do the personal work to be forgiving. Watch your temper and practice building your patience.\n\nI know, easier said than done. But that\u2019s what therapists, elders, or religious leaders are for (or whomever you trust to guide you and give you perspective): Ask for help. Accept help. Get support. Do better and be better. Bottom line: Don\u2019t let hostility become the only way you know how to relate to one another.\n\n3. Your relationship isn\u2019t always going to be about sexual desire.\n\nSorry ladies and gents, but as much as you love sex, it\u2019s not always going to be as plentiful as you think. Over the course of a lifetime, you\u2019ll probably come up against times where you have mis-matched libidos.\n\nI wish I had brilliant advice for these times, how to make someone want more or less sex, but I don\u2019t.\n\nA friend of ours who is a successful marriage and family therapist tells his clients, \u201cYour sexual desire isn\u2019t your partner\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nBut a huge and growing sex issue is both of your problem.\n\nYou need to do what you can do to not let your sex life die off completely over a long period of time. You shouldn\u2019t have sex when you don\u2019t want to, instead, try everything you can to get yourself to where you have genuine desire: a sex therapist, a romance novel, sexy photos. I don\u2019t know what your values system includes here, but don\u2019t give up on yourself.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re the one who has more desire? You don\u2019t get to be a jerk about it. Ever. Bottom line: The best thing you can do is appreciate all the forms of desire you have for one another and really focus on those. You desire to hear their voice on the other end of the phone when you\u2019re sad or when you have great news. You desire to snuggle up while you watch TV. You desire to make them happy by cooking for them or watching their favorite movie or whatever. You desire to make them laugh. You desire the feeling of their skin against yours in the middle of the night \u2013 sex or not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sooner you understand that there's no such thing as unconditional love for your spouse, the happier you'll be", "title": "6 things I wish I\u2019d known about marriage when I got married", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The sooner you understand that there's no such thing as unconditional love for your spouse, the happier you'll be", "title": "6 things I wish I\u2019d known about marriage when I got married", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/04/6_things_i_wish_i_knew_about_marriage_when_i_got_married_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_133378736.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The sooner you understand that there's no such thing as unconditional love for your spouse, the happier you'll be", "title": "6 things I wish I\u2019d known about marriage when I got married", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/shutterstock_133378736.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Schroeder", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Happiness, Marriage, relationships, Sex, The Good Men Project", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4aa8\"", "article_summary": "Sorry ladies and gents, but as much as you love sex, it\u2019s not always going to be as plentiful as you think.\nBottom line: Don\u2019t let hostility become the only way you know how to relate to one another.\nAnd isn\u2019t marriage about unconditional love?\nMaybe we can still be a happy couple, a happy family, even if there are rough times when the love isn\u2019t flowing.\nDon\u2019t let that become the model for the rest of your lives together."}
