REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4193348\n\nThe Obama administration will spend over $1 billion on HealthCare.gov, the still-incomplete Obamacare website, by the end of the year, according to Obama nominee Sylvia Burwell\u2019s testimony to Congress.\n\nTennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander asked Burwell, the nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, to provide details on federal spending on the embattled health care website during a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. Alexander serves as the ranking Republican.\n\nBurwell responded with specifics of HealthCare.gov\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIt is my understanding that as of February 28, 2014, CMS has obligated a total of approximately $834 million on Marketplace-related IT contracts and interagency agreements,\u201d Burwell wrote to the HELP Committee. \u201cThese expenditures include the website and the systems that support enrollment through the Marketplace, such as the data services hub as well as other supporting IT infrastructure, including cloud computing, to support Marketplace IT development.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just through February. By the end of the year, HealthCare.gov spending is expected to rise to over $1 billion.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s budget reflects a need for approximately $200 million for all Marketplace-related IT in FY 2015, some of which is funded through user fees,\u201d she continued. \u201cMuch of this amount reflects ongoing operational and maintenance costs of healthcare.gov, as well as continued development.\u201d\n\nAfter HealthCare.gov\u2019s disastrous roll-out last fall, the Obama administration\u2019s tech surge managed to fix a significant portion of consumer-facing problems on the website. But the back end of the website, which communicates application information between the federal government and insurance companies, still hasn\u2019t been finished.\n\nStandardized insurance forms and verification systems for premium subsidies still haven\u2019t been finished, and in theory, will be set up by 2015 using the extra $200 million the White House has requested.\n\nBurwell notes that some of the funding will come from user fees \u2014 typically a 1-3 percent tax that Obamacare customers pay on their insurance premiums each month to fund the exchange\u2019s operations. Many state-run exchanges are struggling to fund their own costly operations with just monthly user fees.

Four state-run exchanges on the edge of collapse have used $474 million in federal taxpayer dollars so far.
