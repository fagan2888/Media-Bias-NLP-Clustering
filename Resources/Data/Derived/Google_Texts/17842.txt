KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — Remarkable performances by Ted Ligety in giant slalom are nothing new to those with the difficult task of trying to be competitive in an event he has dominated for years, but what he did in the first run GS Wednesday was another stunner.

With his top four pursuers already in the finish, Ligety blew them away by 1.3-1.4 seconds, an enormous margin in GS. It was like taking a 28-0 halftime lead at the Super Bowl.

A couple more racers came down to fill the gap, but Ligety still has a commanding lead of 0.93 seconds going into the second run. At this point the race is his to lose in a second run that begins at 3:30 a.m. Denver time.

“I’ve had a lot of races where I’ve had this kind of lead, and a pretty good track record maintaining that and winning those,” Ligety said. “I know I don’t have to take the mega-risks. If I was only winning by two-hundredths, you’d have to take big risks on some of those rolls in order to gain every 10th of time. A 10th isn’t super important right now, but it’s really important to still go as hard as you can the sections that you can.”

Ligety said the course isn’t difficult technically, but it is a tactical challenge because of some terrain changes that have to be skied intelligently.

“I was trying to be smart over those big tactical terrain changes,” Ligety said, “and then push as hard as I could in the sections where I knew I could take some risks and knew I had to push hard.”

At one point he hit his edges hard in what appeared to be a possible mistake, but he was deliberately sacrificing speed there to set himself up for the terrain that followed.

“I was trying to ditch some speed coming over those rolls, because snow contact is super key in order to be able to look for speed down those pitches,” Ligety said. “I maybe ditched a little more than I’d like to, but it was definitely advantageous from the standpoint of not being too risky.”
