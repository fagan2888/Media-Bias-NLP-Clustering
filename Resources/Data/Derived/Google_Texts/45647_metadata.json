John Kasich has faced criticism from fellow Republicans for his decision to accept federal funds to expand his state\u2019s Medicaid program under Obamacare.\n\nAt a GOP luncheon in Fulton County, Georgia, on May 26, Kasich explained his decision, saying it was sustainable in his state and that it helped Ohio\u2019s poor.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely sustainable in my state,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cAnd frankly, what I really want is\u2014I really want the federal government to block grant that program back to me. And let me operate my program for the poor in Ohio. I shouldn\u2019t have to come on bended knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so I think a lot of these programs ought to be sent back. We can take fewer dollars in many cases if they just get rid of the strings.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the Medicaid expansion has \u201chelped a lot of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy choice in that decision was to ignore some of the most vulnerable people in our population. I\u2019ve been, you know, criticized for this decision. Do you think it bothers me? It doesn\u2019t. And we\u2019ve helped a lot of people. And my folks have probably saved some lives in the process. And so I think it was the right decision,\u201d Kasich said.\n\n\u201cAnd everybody\u2019s got to decide. That\u2019s why we have states. Everybody has to decide what works best for them and whatever they decided here is great. And, in our state, we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve been able to do this.\u201d\n\nKasich said that the $14 billion Ohio accepted from the federal government was just money Ohioans had sent to Washington in the first place and that it would save the state money in other ways.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how it works: again, we\u2019re bringing back $14 billion\u2014the first, I don\u2019t know, two, three, four years\u2014the federal government just sends our money back, which is our money.\u201d\n\nKasich built upon comments he made earlier at the lunch, asserting that treating the mentally ill would lower state expenditures on prison inmates and emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cOur prison population\u2014think about this,\u201d he suggested to his audience, \u201cIf I don\u2019t treat the mentally ill, they come out, and guess where they end up? Back in. At $22,500 a year. Now, if I don\u2019t provide some kind of health care for those who are the working poor where do we see them? Where do we see them? Emergency rooms. Are they healthier or sicker?\u201d\n\n\u201cSicker,\u201d the audience called back.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cSo we are now seeing emergency room visits decline.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3796189, "userid": 2870875}, "description": "\"I've been, you know, criticized for this decision.
