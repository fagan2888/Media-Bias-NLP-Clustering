This time frame is called their biological clock. By their mid-30s, they\u2019ll be past their fertility prime. By their 40s, the risks of having a baby with birth defects, such as Down syndrome, are higher. Although more women are waiting to have children despite their ticking biological clocks, a new study shows that some may subliminally trick themselves into wanting kids sooner, thanks to (strangely) having a ticking clock nearby.\n\nThese clocks, researchers from the Florida State University found, primed women in the most subtle way to seek motherhood more quickly. Hearing the barely audible ticks of the clock\u2019s second hand reminded women \u2014 particularly those with a lower socioeconomic background \u2014 subconsciously that their biological clocks were also ticking, moving them to want a child sooner, and to change the preconceived standards they held for a potential partner. Both of which are \u201ccentral aspects of women\u2019s mating-related psychology,\u201d study author Justin Moss said in a press release.\n\nThe researchers based their study on the idea that a woman\u2019s childhood years, socioeconomic status, and other environmental factors influence their attitudes toward childbearing and partner choice. But it\u2019s questionable that having a ticking clock at home would influence a woman to seek just any partner and have children sooner. After all, having a kid isn\u2019t the first and only thing on most women\u2019s minds, even when a clock is ticking nearby.\n\nFor the study, however, 59 men and women were asked questions about the age that they\u2019d like to get married and have kids, while a ticking clock loomed nearby. During this first experiment, the researchers also took into account each person\u2019s socioeconomic status. For a second experiment, 74 participants were asked about the compromises they would make to their own standards just to have a child sooner \u2014 also while a clock ticked nearby.\n\nThey found that the ticking clocks worked especially well among women of lower socioeconomic status to influence their interest in having their first child at a younger age, while also lowering the priority they placed on men\u2019s social status and long-term earning potential. The ticking clock didn\u2019t work, however, among men, or women with a higher socioeconomic status.\n\nIn the press release, study co-author Jon Maner said that the \u201cfindings suggest that a woman\u2019s childhood years can interact with subtle environmental stimuli to affect her reproductive timing during childhood.\u201d\n\nBut the reason these women chose to have children sooner may not have been the ticking clock. Other research has already shown that women without college degrees tend to have children earlier and outside of marriage. These women also tend to be poorer. When that poverty is paired with the expenses of having a child around, it makes sense that the women from the current study who chose to have a kid earlier also lowered their standards for the men they would seek \u2014 these men could help in some child-rearing duties.\n\nOverall, 21.8 percent of American children were living below the poverty line in 2012, according to the National Center for Law and Economic Justice. More often than not, it\u2019s these kids\u2019 moms who head the household.\n\nSource: Moss J, Maner J.
