The letters tell what these families would like for Christmas but cannot afford, usually ranging from clothing, toys and video games to gas cards to get them to and from treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one time of year where it\u2019s almost certain that I\u2019ll cry every day,\u201d Robertson said, referring to having to read the emotional letters on air.\n\n\u201cChristmas Wish\u201d has generated more than $250,000 to help featured families.\n\nHe will read one letter each weekday starting Monday and ending Dec. 11. He encourages listeners to donate whatever they can afford. An account is set up for each family. The families don\u2019t get cash, but gift cards to get the things they say they want and need most.\n\nRobertson said donations over the past 16 years have come from throughout the Savannah area, including Bryan County.\n\n\u201cSometimes donors wish to be anonymous, and often area businesses collect money in lieu of Christmas parties or buying a gift for the boss. That\u2019s when the tears begin,\u201d he said, \u201cand they don\u2019t stop until I surprise these families with gifts, thanks to the generosity of our listeners.\u201d\n\nTo find out more, and to read this year\u2019s letters as they are presented, visit www.987theriver.com keyword: Christmas wish", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bryancountynews.com/archives/40926/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/bryancountynews/database_files/BCN_FacebookDisplay.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For the 17th year, 98.7 The River\u2019s \u201cChristmas Wish\u201d aims to brighten the holidays for families coping with the cancer of a child or parent.", "title": "Christmas Wish helps  families dealing with cancer"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Christmas Wish helps  families dealing with cancer"}, "article_summary": "The families don\u2019t get cash, but gift cards to get the things they say they want and need most.\nFor the 17th year, 98.7 The River\u2019s \u201cChristmas Wish\u201d aims to brighten the holidays for families coping with the cancer of a child or parent.\n\u201cChristmas Wish\u201d has generated more than $250,000 to help featured families.\nRobertson said donations over the past 16 years have come from throughout the Savannah area, including Bryan County.\n\u201cSometimes donors wish to be anonymous, and often area businesses collect money in lieu of Christmas parties or buying a gift for the boss."}
