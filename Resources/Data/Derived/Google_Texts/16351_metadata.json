Bob McDonnell, who was convicted on federal corruption charges.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted him and his wife Maureen McDonnell on 14 counts for receiving $177,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie R. Williams Sr., an executive at dietary supplement company Star Scientific.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcDonnell and his wife were found guilty on multiple counts in September of 2014. He was sentenced to two years; and his wife to a year and a day.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals unanimously upheld McDonnell\u2019s conviction in July 2015, despite his arguments that there were a \u201cmultitude of errors\u201d during his district court trial.\n\nMcDonnell challenged the jury instructions specifically. He claimed that the district court misstated the law and the sufficiency of the evidence against him. He also argued that his trial should have been separate from his wife\u2019s and that the jury selection process violated his Sixth Amendment rights to an impartial jury.\n\nThe conviction marked a stunning downfall for McDonnell who was on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney's vice presidential shortlist and seen as a potential 2016 contender.\n\nThis story was updated at 4:26 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "McDonnell and his wife were convicted on federal corruption charges.", "description": "McDonnell and his wife were convicted on federal corruption charges.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "McDonnell and his wife were convicted on federal corruption charges.", "title": "Supreme Court to review Ex-Gov.
