Choice is good, but too much choice can be stressful. Some investment services limit the choice to only mutual funds or only ETFs. That\u2019s not the best approach because you will miss opportunities on both sides.\n\nWhether to use mutual funds or ETFs doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or selection; it\u2019s a matter of what you\u2019re trying to do in your portfolio and which investments are most likely to get you there. Embrace the freedom to use whatever is best. There shouldn\u2019t be pressure to use only one or the other.\n\nWell-constructed portfolios are a composition of diversified risks. Using a broad asset-allocation approach, we seek exposures to the unique risks of different asset classes expected to provide a future return. The next step is to analyze indexes that track each asset class. Many types of indexes have been introduced in recent years and have made this analysis more complex, so it\u2019s best to keep it simple with the broadest capitalization-weighted indexes available.\n\nAfter selecting indexes that represent the risks you\u2019re seeking, research the products that track those indexes. Sometimes these products exist as mutual funds, sometimes as ETFs and sometimes as both. When there are both, you have a choice to make.\n\nA benefit of mutual funds is that they trade at their end-of-day, net asset value (NAV). This means all buyers and sellers on any given day get the same price. That\u2019s appealing to me. Commissions can be an issue. Mutual funds purchased directly through a no-load fund company also have no commission to buy or sell. There\u2019s typically a commission charge when a mutual fund is bought or sold through a brokerage firm, and the commission can be high. In addition, there may be restrictions on how often you\u2019re allowed to trade mutual funds.\n\nETFs are traded on stock exchanges. This allows you to buy and sell shares during the day when the exchanges are open. The main problem with ETFs is pricing. The price you receive may not be NAV or even close to it. It depends on the liquidity of the underlying securities. Trading ETFs is not free either. Commissions are charged by brokerage firms unless an ETF is part of a no-commission program. Even then there is always a pricing difference between the buy (ask) and the sell (bid).\n\nWhere you invest also matters in the choices you might make. Access to low-cost index strategies may only be available through ETFs if you invest through a full-service broker or through one of the new automated \u201crobo-adviser\u201d investment services. If you\u2019re a do-it-yourself investor and select your own custodians, or you invest with an independent adviser who doesn\u2019t limit their portfolios to only ETFs or mutual funds, you\u2019ll have access to everything in the marketplace.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t limit your investment selection to only mutual funds or ETFs. Invest in whatever is best.\n\nRead the latest Investing in Funds & ETFs Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "There are thousands of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to U.S. investors.
