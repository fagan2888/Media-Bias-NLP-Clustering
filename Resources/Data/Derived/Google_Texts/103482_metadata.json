He has said he will not seek reelection in 2016 and has been traveling the state to help to boost Republican chances to win statewide office. He is thought to be considering statewide office himself, but when asked has only said he has not ruled it out.\n\n\"We need a budget that replaces sequester with pro-growth, fiscally responsible policies that create jobs and guide us back to a balanced budget,\" Gibson said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, this budget codified the sequester. Still, I\u2019m hopeful that as the year unfolds we\u2019ll reach another bipartisan agreement like the Ryan-Murray budget we enacted in December 2013 that replaced sequester for two years. Such a budget would better reflect the priorities of NY-19, our state, and the nation.\"\n\nKatko is in his first term representing a swing district in central New York, which includes Syracuse. He defeated incumbent Democrat Dan Maffei in 2014 and the district is likely to be a Democratic target in 2016.\n\nKatko's office did not responded to a request for comment on his vote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/05/8567181/gibson-and-katko-vote-against-republican-budget", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20Chris%20Gibson_3.png", "type": "article", "title": "Gibson and Katko vote against Republican budget"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "House of Representatives passes budget"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddaf7\"", "article_summary": "The two New York Republicans who voted against the bill were Chris Gibson and John Katko, who each represent districts upstate.\nHe is thought to be considering statewide office himself, but when asked has only said he has not ruled it out.\n\"We need a budget that replaces sequester with pro-growth, fiscally responsible policies that create jobs and guide us back to a balanced budget,\" Gibson said in a statement.\nHe has said he will not seek reelection in 2016 and has been traveling the state to help to boost Republican chances to win statewide office.\nTwo New York representatives were among the 14 Republicans who broke with the party to vote against a budget bill that was passed by the House of Representatives on Thursday night."}
