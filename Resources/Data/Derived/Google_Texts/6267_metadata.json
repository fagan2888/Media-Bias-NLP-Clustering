The results are published May 18 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\n\"This data shows routine hospital admission is not the best strategy for this group,\" Weinstock said. \"We tend to admit a lot of people with chest pain out of concern for missing a heart attack or some other life-ending irregularity. To me, this [new finding] says we can think more about what's best for the patient long term.\"\n\nPlus, patients who visit the ER for chest pain often wish to return home as soon as possible, Weinstock said.\n\n\"I've been having these conversations with my patients, and only one wanted to stay in the hospital,\" he said. \"Most people want to go home and get tests done the next day.\"\n\nThe researchers called for a reassessment of current national guidelines to routinely admit, observe and test patients with chest pain who have received a \"clean\" evaluation in the ER.\n\n\"We'd like to see more emergency medicine physicians having that bedside conversation to ensure the chest pain patient knows the risks and benefits of hospitalization compared to outpatient evaluation. We think continuing evaluation in an outpatient setting is not only safer for the patient, it's a less costly approach for the health care system,\" Weinstock said.\n\nTwo experts who reviewed the study agreed that early discharge from the hospital may work for many patients with chest pain.\n\nPrompt discharge for patients with normal test results \"is safe and will likely improve efficacy in an era of continued attempts to reduce growing health care costs,\" said Dr. Kevin Marzo, chief of cardiology at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\nDr. Eric Cruzen, medical director of the Lenox Hill HealthPlex in New York City, said that \"the results of this study may help to better select which patients are likely to benefit from hospital admission and which patients may be safely sent home.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about chest pain.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/general-health-information-16/emergencies-and-first-aid-news-227/many-er-patients-with-chest-pain-can-be-sent-home-study-finds-699484.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/ERsign_18173.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Vast majority who have normal cardiac test results are in no immediate danger, researchers say", "title": "Many ER Patients With Chest Pain Can Be Sent Home, Study Finds"}, "description": "Vast majority who have normal cardiac test results are in no immediate danger, researchers say", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Plus, patients who visit the ER for chest pain often wish to return home as soon as possible, Weinstock said.\nTwo experts who reviewed the study agreed that early discharge from the hospital may work for many patients with chest pain.\nHis team looked at data from more than 11,000 visits by patients experiencing chest pain to three hospitals in Columbus, Ohio between 2008 and 2013.\nThe researchers called for a reassessment of current national guidelines to routinely admit, observe and test patients with chest pain who have received a \"clean\" evaluation in the ER.\nOverall, the study found a low short-term risk of life-threatening heart problems among patients with chest pain who have normal cardiac blood tests, vital signs and electrocardiograms."}
