He spread the ball evenly, connecting with six different receivers, three of which had more than 100 yards apiece.\n\nHelbig, who\u2019s been receiving Division I looks in both basketball and football, owns the Tigers\u2019 single-season passing yards record, throwing for 3,117 last year \u2014 good enough for 11th all-time in state history.\n\nAfter one game, Helbig is on pace to throw for 6,070 yards, shattering Bear Creek\u2019s Justin Holland\u2019s record of 4,181 in 1998. It is doubtful he\u2019ll continue at that pace.\n\nMost passing yards in a game\n\nPlayer School Date Yards 1. Chris Helbig Holy Family Sept. 4, 2015 607 2.
