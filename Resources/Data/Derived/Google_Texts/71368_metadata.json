Carson, who also ran a scholarship fund for inner-city students, later came to his school for a visit. Watkins, who grew up in Baltimore\u2019s rugged east side, where drugs and violence are a reality, remembers feeling inspired by Carson at the time.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt meant something to me\u2014I felt like he was a guy who made it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he could do it, I could do it.\u201d\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nWatkins did make it\u2014though he stumbled for a while, including a stint as a drug dealer, which he now writes about in essays. But as Carson has moved up in the Republican primary polls in recent weeks, Watkins has come to revisit Gifted Hands as an adult. He now sees it much more differently, telling a local newspaper that he views it as fiction.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. In recent years, Carson has found new fame with a different audience, primarily evangelical Christians and conservative Republicans who are backing his campaign. But that has come at a cost, as many in the black community now view him unfavorably.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because Carson has been outspoken in his opposition to President Obama, whom he has called a \u201cpsychopath,\u201d an anti-Semite and the \u201cdivider-in-chief.\u201d It\u2019s also due to the conservative tenor of his political views, which include comparing Obamacare to slavery, a strict stance on abortion and recent comments about Muslims being eligible to run for president.\n\nBut the campaign has laid bare a tension that was present all along. When Carson was telling his life story in his book, and later in a movie of the same name, it was viewed as aspirational, something like a self-help book. But when he began telling those same anecdotes in the context of a campaign, many African-Americans viewed it as validating conservative views on poverty that they disagree with.\n\nRead More: Inside Ben Carson\u2019s Unlikely\u2014and Uncommonly Spiritual\u2014Campaign\n\nDr. Leah Wright Rigueur, author of The Loneliness of the Black Republican, a history of 20th century African-American conservatism, says that many in the black community view people like Carson differently depending on whether they are speaking within the community or to the broader public.\n\nAlthough they may not have agreed with some of his more conservative beliefs, Wright Rigueur says they were willing to overlook them, like an uncle who says impolitic things at Thanksgiving. But once he began running for office that changed.\n\n\u201cHis conservatism, that\u2019s exhibited in his speeches, was safe, it was private, a conversation among people within the community,\u201d says Wright Rigueur, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cHe kind of hadn\u2019t violated the unspoken rule of speaking out of turn.\u201d\n\nIn the years after publishing Gifted Hands, Carson spread his message at speaking engagements and through charitable work like his Carson Scholars program. He told TIME that at various times \u201c12 to 15 movie producers\u201d approached him about turning the book into a film, but he wouldn\u2019t agree because they wanted to take some \u201cartistic license\u201d with his story.\n\nWhen producer Dan Angel came to Carson about making the film, he had to promise to go to battle for Carson and it took years to get TNT to agree to the project. Angel says he and his team at The Hatchery, a production outfit whose goal is to make uplifting content for families, were willing to put their careers on the line for the movie, which helped convince Carson.\n\nRead More: Ben Carson Imagines His Debate Opponents as \u2018Cute Little Babies\u2019\n\n\u201cI really wanted something that would truly be inspirational,\u201d Carson told TIME in a recent interview. \u201cWe went on the set and Cuba [Gooding Jr.] and everybody said you know, this is not a job for us. This is a mission.\u201d\n\nIf the book had been a turning point with his relationship with the black community, the 2009 movie was the beginning of a shift in the other direction. It proved immensely popular with evangelical Christians, according to one of the film\u2019s producers, and is now the No. 1 faith movie on Amazon.\n\n\u201cThe movie has made it possible for people to share his story overnight,\u201d said producer Margaret Losch. \u201cHollywood might not have wanted the movie, but there is a large faith community around the country.\u201d\n\nAlthough many of the themes in Carson\u2019s speeches have remained the same over the years, the emphasis has shifted. In 1997, when he was invited to speak at the National Prayer Breakfast, he made self-deprecating jokes and talked about his life story.\n\nWhen he returned to the event in 2013, the outline remained the same, but he went further, describing conservative ideas for health care and tax reform while standing just a few feet from President Obama.\n\nThe speech attracted a new audience to Carson, which was fed by other speeches and interviews in which he became even more political, often using harsh language, such as the time he referred to Obamacare as the worst thing since slavery.\n\nRead More: Ben Carson Says Muslim Comments Were Taken Out of Context\n\nThe newfound attention was enough to land him as a runner-up on Gallup\u2019s annual \u201cmost admired man\u201d list in 2014, alongside the likes of Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nSince his presidential campaign launched in May, Carson has jumped to second place in the polls, after Donald Trump. But much of his support draws on white voters, who backed him by 57 percent in a head-to-head against Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical matchup in a recent Quinnipiac poll, compared to just 18 percent of black voters.\n\nFor black conservatives such as Rita Davenport, Carson is a gift. She has been \u201call in for Ben\u201d since February 2014, when she discovered the Carson SuperPAC on Facebook. \u201cPersonally, I like what he says and it sounds like what I believe,\u201d said Davenport, who has campaigned for Carson in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cHe\u2019s at the top, pinnacle of his field, and he\u2019s listening to people telling him to run putting aside his own personal happiness to run.\u201d\n\nBut for Watkins, Carson\u2019s new success among conservatives contains an element of betrayal: \u201cTo a certain extent, it\u2019s still a good story, I just disagree with his politics. It\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t believe it when I hear him talk.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Why Ben Carson Is Running for President\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story incorrectly described Ben Carson\u2019s breakthrough surgery.
