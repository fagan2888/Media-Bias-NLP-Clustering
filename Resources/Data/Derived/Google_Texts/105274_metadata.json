It\u2019s no small thing to drop 20 pounds as a mixed martial artist, and the Brazilian veteran believes he\u2019ll get the payoff for his sacrifices at UFC 175.\n\nMachida has won and lost a UFC championship belt during his lengthy career, and he moved down from light heavyweight to middleweight in his quest to win another title.\n\n\u201cI feel good and strong,\u201d Machida said through a translator. \u201cI knew I could do it, and I did it the right way. Now I\u2019m going to show everybody that I can win at any weight.\u201d\n\nMachida (21-4) takes on middleweight champion Chris Weidman in the main event at UFC 175 in Las Vegas on Saturday night, headlining the promotion\u2019s biggest event of the summer. Bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey also faces Alexis Davis on the card in the UFC\u2019s hometown.\n\nMachida changed his body last year to move down from the 205-pound light heavyweight limit to the 185-pound middleweight class, but he didn\u2019t change his approach. Machida\u2019s slippery, unorthodox, karate-based fighting style is still a puzzle for his opponents, and respected middleweights Mark Munoz and Gegard Mousasi failed to solve it in his first two 185-pound bouts.\n\nMachida believes his agility and power haven\u2019t suffered in the change. He feels quicker than most of his opponents, and his highly technical fighting style has worked well against the smaller men.\n\nYet nobody has ever figured out how to take on Weidman (11-0), the former Hofstra wrestler with remarkable punching power.\n\nWeidman is back in the cage for the first time since his second victory over Anderson Silva in devastating fashion. The former middleweight king broke his shin while kicking Weidman\u2019s knee in the second round of their December bout, sending him howling to the Vegas canvas in pain.\n\nWeidman first beat Silva a year ago, stunning the long-reigning champion with a second-round knockout. He was slated to defend his title against Brazil\u2019s Vitor Belfort in March, but Belfort missed the bout after the Nevada Athletic Commission banned testosterone replacement therapy.\n\nWeidman then was scheduled to face Machida at UFC 173 on May 24, but sustained a minor knee injury that required surgery. He is back at full strength for his second title defense, eager to prove his two strange victories over Silva weren\u2019t flukes.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is always going to have critics out there,\u201d Weidman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really one of my motivating factors to silence those critics.\u201d\n\nWeidman and Machida are an intriguing contrast of styles. Weidman\u2019s wrestling abilities pose a challenge for Machida, who has had trouble against standout wrestlers before.\n\nBut Machida believes his elusive skills are daunting for middleweights, and he intends to join Randy Couture and B.J. Penn as the only two-division champions in UFC history.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any added pressure, because I know I can do it,\u201d Machida said. \u201cI\u2019m very well-prepared.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lyota Machida to take on champ Chris Weidman at UFC 175", "title": "Lyota Machida to take on champ Chris Weidman at UFC 175", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/04/lyota-machida-to-take-on-champ-chris-weidman-at-ufc-175/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704_064457_lyoto-machida.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704_064457_lyoto-machida.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T18:42:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:28:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd200b\"", "article_summary": "But Machida believes his elusive skills are daunting for middleweights, and he intends to join Randy Couture and B.J.\nMachida believes his agility and power haven\u2019t suffered in the change.\nWeidman then was scheduled to face Machida at UFC 173 on May 24, but sustained a minor knee injury that required surgery.\nWeidman is back in the cage for the first time since his second victory over Anderson Silva in devastating fashion.\nMachida has won and lost a UFC championship belt during his lengthy career, and he moved down from light heavyweight to middleweight in his quest to win another title."}
