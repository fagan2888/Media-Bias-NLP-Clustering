Starting in August, AARP state offices nationwide will be offering free forums on cyber security in multiple locations.\n\nThe survey results unveil a high incidence of risky online behaviors:\n\nAmong those who say they use free public Wi-Fi, more than a quarter of respondents (27%) say they have banked online via public Wi-Fi in the last three months.\n\nSimilarly, 27% of those who use free public Wi-Fi have purchased a product or service over public Wi-Fi using a credit card.\n\n26% of smartphone users do not use a passcode on their phones.\n\n61% do not have online access to all of their bank accounts.\n\nAmong those who have set up access to all or some of their online banking accounts, almost half (45%) say they have not changed their online banking passwords in the past 90 days. Experts say that online bank account passwords should be changed every 90 days.\n\nNearly half of survey respondents (45%) failed a quiz about online and wireless safety. Approximately 40% of respondents were not aware that:\n\nIt is NOT okay to use the same password on more than one site even if it contains a complex mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\n\nEven if you are not using the Internet, if you\u2019re in a location with a public Wi-Fi network, you should disable your wireless connection.\n\nIt is NOT safe to access websites with sensitive information, such as banking or credit cards, while using a public Wi-Fi network, even if the website is secured by https.\n\nMore than 8 in 10 (84%) people surveyed did not know that the most up-to-date security for a home Wi-Fi network is NOT WEP -- Wired Equivalent Privacy. Experts advise using at least WPA2 wireless encryption for better protection.\n\n\u201cThe Fraud Watch Network\u2019s \u201cWatch Your Wi-Fi\u201d campaign is giving people the information they need to stay connected without sacrificing their personal security,\u201d said Shadel.\n\nA newly launched FWN cyber scam website features \u201cFour Things Never to Do on Public Wi-Fi:\u201d\n\n\n\n1. Don\u2019t fall for a fake: Con artists often set up unsecure networks with names similar to a legitimate coffee shop, hotel or other free Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n\n2. Mind your business: Don't access your email, online bank or credit card accounts using public Wi-Fi.\n\n\n\n3. Watch your settings: Don't let your mobile device automatically connect to nearby Wi-Fi.\n\n4. Stick to your cell: Don\u2019t surf using an unknown public network if the website requires sensitive information - like online shopping. Your cell phone network is safer.\n\nConsumers may also visit the new website to learn about three scams frequently associated with public Wi-Fi, including the \u201cman-in-the-middle attack,\u201d an \u201cevil twin\u201d ruse, and the \u201cwar driving attack.\u201d\n\nFor additional information, including a video demonstrating the risks of unsecure Wi-Fi, visit the AARP Fraud Watch Network.\n\nSurvey Methodology: Alan Newman Research completed a total of 800 interviews (559 by landline and 241 by cell phone). Respondents were screened for being age 18 or older and accessing the internet at least a couple of times per month. A total of 11,700 records were dialed. The total sample of 800 respondents yields a maximum statistical error of \u00b1 3.5% at the 95% level of confidence. This means that in 95 out of 100 samples of this size, the results obtained in the sample would be within \u00b1 3.5 percentage points of the results obtained had everyone in the population been interviewed. Interviews took place April 2 through April 11, 2015\n\n# # #\n\nAbout AARP:\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
