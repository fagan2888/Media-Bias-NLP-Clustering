â€” Fayetteville police arrested a 30-year-old man Saturday who investigators say fired shots into a home on Morehead Avenue early Thursday, narrowly missing a sleeping infant.

Trellis Buie is charged with shooting into an occupied dwelling and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.

According to police, Buie went to a home at 1615 Morehead Ave. at about 8:45 a.m. with the intent to cause a disturbance. He was confronted by two people inside who asked him to leave the property. Buie then went to his car, grabbed a handgun and fired shots in the direction of the home.

No injuries were reported, but authorities said one of the bullets missed a sleeping infant by about 4 inches.

Buie was being held in the Cumberland County Detention Center under a $150,000 bond.
