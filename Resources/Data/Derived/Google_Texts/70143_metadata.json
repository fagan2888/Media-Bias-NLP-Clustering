Wright, the Defense Department\u2019s acting undersecretary for personnel and readiness.\n\nWright described the illegal aliens, who as children were brought to the US illegally as \u201csome of the best and brightest in America that we could capitalize on.\u201d\n\nWright said the decision would come by summer\u2019s end and involved the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the White House.\n\nWere Obama and Wright to proceed with their plan it would appear to be a direct violation of the plain language of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(b)(1).\n\nWhat\u2019s more under current law and regulations all U.S. military officers be must be U.S. citizens. Non-U.S. citizens legally residing in the United States may join the military as enlisted service members only, and do not have access to Officer or Warrant Officer ranking positions.\n\nSome military specialties are also limited to citizens only. For example, federal law prohibits granting security clearance to non-citizens, which excludes non-citizens from military assignments that require such security clearance.\n\nAs Senator Jeff Sessions noted in a recent interview with Breitbart\u2019s Matthew Boyle, \u201cSuch a policy would be another unacceptable action that sends a message that this nation is not willing to take the most basic actions to end the immigration lawlessness. The first step is to stop rewarding it, as with a career in the United States military\u2014which is not a job Americans won't do. It is a high calling and a noble career. I am not aware of any evidence indicating that there is a lack of qualified applicants to meet the needs of the armed services.\u201d\n\nAnd Senator Sessions is right. As our friends at NumbersUSA documented, by 2017, the Army needs to downsize from its recent peak of 570,000 active duty troops from 2006-08 to 450,000 troops.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that most of the reductions will come from voluntary retirements, resignations, and decreased enlistments, but 3,000 officers will be forced out over the next few years to meet the lower personnel requirement.\n\nWe\u2019ve documented regularly and in great detail the litany of lawbreaking by President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sibelius, BLM Director Neil Kornz and other members of the Obama administration.\n\nFrom refusing to deport criminal aliens, to refusing to enforce politically inconvenient provisions of Obamacare, to the refusal to prosecute the new Black Panthers for voter intimidation the law is a malleable thing in the hands of Obama and his political henchmen in government.\n\nWere Obama\u2019s plan to allow illegal aliens the privilege of serving in the armed forces of the United States to go forward how long would it take for the first lawsuit to be filed claiming discrimination and demanding illegal alien access to officer training or a security clearance?\n\nObama\u2019s plan to allow illegal aliens to enlist in the armed forces of the United States in exchange for citizenship is of a piece with the rest of his politically motivated lawbreaking, but for the first time Obama's lawbreaking has real national security implications.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "National Security Alert: Obama\u2019s Plan to Allow Illegal Aliens in the Military"}}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama\u2019s administration is reviewing a plan to allow military enlistment by thousands of illegal aliens according to Jessica L.
