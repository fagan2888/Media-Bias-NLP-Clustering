A press release for HRSA says its programs \u201ccomplement and align with other federal efforts, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services-funded Navigator program.\u201d Her work involves enrolling people in the Affordable Care Act and helping them understand their choices, and it entails the same access to sensitive financial and health information as a navigator \u2014 leading observers to define \u201cassister\u201d as another name for \u201cnavigator.\u201d\n\nWells was certified as an Obamacare navigator despite her financial history, which includes a bankruptcy in 2003, a 2007 civil charge from a local check cashing business called Midwest Checkrite for writing a bad check, being more than $1700 behind on her state tax bill, and having an outstanding arrest warrant in nearby Shawnee County. Wells lives and works in Douglass County.\n\nReached by phone, The Shawnee County Sheriff\u2019s Office would not elaborate on the specific charges related to Wells\u2019 arrest warrant.\n\nNavigators are creations of the federal government and they are paid to work closely with consumers \u2014 and their personal information \u2014 to help them navigate the newly-created Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe Obamacare navigator program has fallen under heavy criticism for its privacy pitfalls, with the House Oversight Committee issuing a report only two weeks ago which warned that navigators would not be properly vetted to protect consumers.\n\nThe report pointed out navigators would have access to all sorts of personal data.\n\n\u201c[T]he main concern for consumers is the heightened risk of identity theft and financial loss from a poorly managed outreach campaign,\u201d the Oversight Committee report said. \u201cNavigators and Assisters will come into contact with a plethora of personally identifiable information (PII), including an applicant\u2019s Social Security number, date of birth and income, as well as the PII of everyone in an applicant\u2019s household.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s decision not to require background checks for navigators compounds the privacy risks, the Oversight Committee wrote.\n\n\u201cIn part, substantial risks remain because the Administration decided not to require background checks and fingerprinting of individuals hired by Navigator and Assister organizations,\u201d the committee wrote. \u201cUnder the Administration\u2019s plan, unless states have already taken actions to protect their citizens, Navigators and Assisters are not prohibited from hiring convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael Volpe", "description": "'Community health center' organizer is wanted by police", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A woman with an outstanding warrant for her arrest is currently serving as an Obamacare \"navigator\" in Lawrence, Kansas.
