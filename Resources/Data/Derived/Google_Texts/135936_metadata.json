Why did it happen at all?\n\nWe get a hint of why from a statement from the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hasan al-Banna (1906-1949) of Egypt. He said: \u201cIt is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law on all nations, and to extend its power to the entire planet.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another factor as well, and that deals with the personal motivation of the hijackers. 9/11 happened because of bad theology. Nineteen men believed the promise that if they died in a state of Jihad, they would go to Paradise and receive their 72 virgins. Nineteen men sought assurance of salvation in the wrong place and killed thousands of innocent people on the way.\n\nMohammad Atta, who led the hijacking of American Airlines flight 11 and flew it into the World Trade Center\u2019s north tower, had a suitcase that providentially ended up on a different plane.\n\nAuthorities found his wedding suit all lain out in that suitcase, along with an ornate copy of the Qu\u2019ran. He was preparing for his big wedding day in the afterlife.\n\nWhether one can be saved or not is unknowable in Islam, as is forgiveness of sins.\n\nSteven Masood is a former Muslim from Pakistan, who now runs the ministry Jesus to Muslims.\n\nHe told me of Jihadists in general, \u201cthey believe that, well, if we are killed, we will go straight into Paradise. It\u2019s much easier for us to go into Paradise that way than by performing all the ritual performance and everything and still not knowing that we are going to Paradise of god or not. But because the Koran says that martyrs killed in the way of god, or in the fight for god\u2026will go straight into the Paradise of god.\u201d\n\nLawrence Wright writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11: \u201cMartyrdom promised such young men and ideal alternative to a life that was so sparing in its rewards. A glorious death beckoned to the sinner, who would be forgiven, it is said, with the first spurt of blood, and he would behold his place in Paradise even before his death. Seventy members of his household might be spared the fires of hell because of his sacrifice\u201d (p. 123).\n\n\u201cThe martyr who is poor will be crowned in heaven with a jewel more valuable than the earth itself. And for those young men who came from cultures where women are shuttered away and rendered unattainable for someone without prospects, martyrdom offered the conjugal pleasures of seventy-two virgins---\u2018the dark-eyed houris,\u2019 as the Quran describes them, \u2018chaste as hidden pearls.\u2019 They awaited the martyr with feats of meat and fruit and cups of the purest wine.\u201d\n\nI have interviewed Robert Spencer many times. He is an expert on Islam, the director of jihadwatch.org, and the author of many books, including Arab Winter Comes to America.\n\nI once asked him about the seeming incongruity between strict Islam and the pornography found in Osama Bin Laden\u2019s compound, or the fact that some of the 9/11 hijackers, it was learned later, had gone to strip clubs before that fateful day.\n\nSpence said, \u201cYou have to understand that Islam has a very different moral outlook from Christianity, and there is no redemption or forgiveness in Islam; there is only the principle that if your good deeds outweigh your bad deeds, then you\u2019ll enter paradise, and if your bad deeds outweigh your good deeds then you\u2019ll go to hell; that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAlso: \u201cThe thing is though that Jihad is the best deed of all and outweighs all the others, and so if you\u2019re waging Jihad you essentially have a free pass to do whatever you want otherwise because none of the bad deeds you\u2019re going to do are going to outweigh your great deed of Jihad.\u201d\n\nThis greatly contrasts to historic Christianity with its \u201cblessed assurance.\u201d Christianity and experience teach that we are all sinful. But even though a righteous God judges sin, we can be assured of salvation when our sins are paid for---and our righteousness provided---by Another.\n\nWarning: to ears that are only used to multi-culturalism, the following statement from the Bible will offend. But let God be true and every man a liar.\n\nIn the New Testament, John the Apostle writes, \u201cGod has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know you have eternal life\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nThat\u2019s what Atta et al were missing and what they missed out on. In short, those planes were driven into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania by bad theology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did you know that since 9/11, there have been 23,780 separate deadly terror attacks carried out by Islamic extremists, according to thereligionofpiece.com?.05/25/2016 23:44:56PM EST.", "author": "Jerry Newcombe", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Did you know that since 9/11, there have been 23,780 separate deadly terror attacks carried out by Islamic extremists, according to thereligionofpiece.com?", "title": "- The Root of 9/11: Bad Theology", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jerrynewcombe/2014/09/11/draft-n1889980", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/225/c6cc207d-0104-417e-a47b-6281e75af967.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Did you know that since 9/11, there have been 23,780 separate deadly terror attacks carried out by Islamic extremists, according to thereligionofpiece.com?", "title": "- The Root of 9/11: Bad Theology", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/jerrynewcombe/2014/09/11/draft-n1889980", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/225/c6cc207d-0104-417e-a47b-6281e75af967.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Root of 9/11: Bad Theology, Jerry Newcombe, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe080c\"", "article_summary": "9/11 happened because of bad theology.\nIn short, those planes were driven into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania by bad theology.\nHe who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.\nDid you know that since 9/11, there have been 23,780 separate deadly terror attacks carried out by Islamic extremists, according to thereligionofpiece.com?\nIn the New Testament, John the Apostle writes, \u201cGod has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."}
