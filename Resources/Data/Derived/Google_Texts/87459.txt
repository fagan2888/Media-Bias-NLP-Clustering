Rochester, MN

A Minnesota teenager says he went in and out of consciousness as rescuers worked to free him during a harrowing canoe accident on a waterfall in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area on the U.S.-Canadian border.



Sixteen-year-old Asher Bloom, of Rochester, was on a church trip with two friends when their canoe got sucked into Upper Basswood Falls on Tuesday. Asher's foot was pinned against the rocks by their damaged canoe. It took around six hours for authorities to reach and free Asher in the remote wilderness area.



The youth and his canoe-mates said in television interviews Friday that they kept praying for a miracle.



Asher is now recovering at home in Rochester. His foot is swollen but expected to heal. And they say they plan to canoe the BWCA again.
