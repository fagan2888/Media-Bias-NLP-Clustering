It\u2019s a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,\u201d Gruber said in remarks from 2012 that aired Wednesday evening on \u201cOn the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The selling of Obamacare 2. 0)\n\nGruber has been causing headaches for the White House as conservatives have had a field day that began with comments the MIT professor made in 2013.\n\n\u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter, or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass,\u201d Gruber said at the time, according to one of the videos that has recently come to light.\n\nIn another video clip of a separate event, while talking about tax credits in the Affordable Care Act, he said, \u201cAmerican voters are too stupid to understand the difference.\u201d\n\nGruber apologized for the comments during an appearance earlier this week on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cRonan Farrow Daily\u201d:\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Ted Cruz out on a limb on Obamacare repeal)\n\n\u201cI was speaking off the cuff, and I was basically speaking inappropriately, and I regret having made those comments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dismissed Gruber\u2019s role in Obamacare on Thursday, telling the press, \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. He didn\u2019t help write our bill.\u201d\n\nMany outlets were quick to point out that Pelosi cited Gruber in a \u201cHealth Insurance Reform Mythbuster\u201d on her official website in 2009.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner released a statement Thursday, slamming Gruber for his comments.\n\n\u201cIf there was ever any doubt that ObamaCare was rammed through Congress with a heavy dose of arrogance, duplicity, and contempt for the will of the American people, recent comments by one of the law\u2019s chief architects, Jonathan Gruber, put that to rest,\u201d the top Republican said.\n\nThe statement continues, \u201cThe American people are anything but \u2018stupid.\u2019 They\u2019re the ones bearing the consequences of the president\u2019s health care law and, unsurprisingly, they continue to oppose it.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The administration distances itself from remarks made by Obamacare's architect.", "title": "White House says Gruber's wrong, attacks GOP", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/jonathan-gruber-obamacare-voters-white-house-response-112856.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Barack Obama,White House,Jonathan Gruber", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The administration distances itself from remarks made by Obamacare's architect.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd109d\"", "article_summary": "White House says Gruber's wrong, attacks GOPThe White House is denouncing comments from key Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber that a lack of transparency and the stupidity of voters helped in the passage of the health care law and is instead pointing a finger at Republicans.\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is, the process associated with the writing and passing and implementing of the Affordable Care Act has been extraordinarily transparent,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during a news briefing in Myanmar, according to a transcript provided by the White House.\n0)Gruber has been causing headaches for the White House as conservatives have had a field day that began with comments the MIT professor made in 2013.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner released a statement Thursday, slamming Gruber for his comments.\nStory Continued Below\u201cI disagree vigorously with that assessment,\u201d Earnest responded when asked about Gruber\u2019s claim that Obamacare wouldn\u2019t have passed if the administration was more transparent and voters more intelligent."}
