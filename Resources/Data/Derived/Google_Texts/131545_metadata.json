Really? For what? You\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job?\u201d\n\nHe must have killed in a private meeting last month with activists who were pushing him to waive more immigration laws. According to POLITICO, the president resorted to one his favorite comic riffs: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me impeached, are you?\u201d\n\nOne can only imagine the comedic possibilities in his 9-0 defeat in the Supreme Court in June for his blatantly abusive recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board or any of the court\u2019s other recent unanimous rebukes of his executive overreach.\n\nIt takes a truly blithe spirit to play the constitutional deformation of his office, and the ensuing congressional reaction, for laughs. Lightheartedness aside, if Obama means what he says, he doesn\u2019t understand the nature of his office. It\u2019s not the job of the president to defy the law if it\u2019s inconvenient, or to create new laws in the absence of congressional enactment. Rather, the opposite.\n\nThe constitutional injunction that the executive \u201ctake care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u201d is not a suggestion. It is a requirement. It is designed to prevent the executive from unilaterally suspending laws, as English kings claimed the right to do. As a constitutional lawyer, the president must be familiar with the seedbed of American liberties, the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which states that \u201cthe pretended power of suspending of laws, or the execution of laws, by regal authority, without consent of parliament, is illegal.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit against the president undertaken by House Speaker John Boehner targets the serial delay of Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, just one of a number of seat-of-the-pants delays and alterations in the law. According to the text of the Affordable Care Act, the mandate was supposed to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2014. The administration nonetheless delayed it for an entire year via a Treasury Department blog post in July 2013.\n\nBefore his adoring audiences, the president says he has to act because Congress won\u2019t. In this case, Congress was happy to act. In fact, the House passed a bill to delay the mandate until Jan. 1, 2015. President Obama threatened to veto it.\n\nLast February, the administration delayed the mandate yet again. It made a distinction between employers with 50 to 99 workers (the mandate won\u2019t apply to them until 2016) and employers with 100 or more workers (the mandate will apply to them beginning in 2015) that has no basis in the law, and layered on additional rules also created ex nihilo.\n\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: Some of Obama's best material lately has to do with his abuse of his powers.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Hilarious Lawlessness", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/president-obamas-hilarious-lawlessness-109019.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/16/140716_barack_obama_1_gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Opinion", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: Some of Obama's best material lately has to do with his abuse of his powers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4c0a\"", "article_summary": "Opinion Obama\u2019s Hilarious LawlessnessPresident Barack Obama styles himself a wit, and some of his best material lately has to do with his abuse of his powers.\nPresident Obama threatened to veto it.\nAccording to the text of the Affordable Care Act, the mandate was supposed to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\u201cMiddle-class families can\u2019t wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff,\u201d Obama told a crowd on the Georgetown Waterfront on July 1.\nThe constitutional injunction that the executive \u201ctake care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u201d is not a suggestion."}
