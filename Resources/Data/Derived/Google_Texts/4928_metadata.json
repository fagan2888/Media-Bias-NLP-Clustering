It's not filled with tchotchkes and clothing, instead, it's a rundown of businesses that are or are not supportive of LBGTQ employees and causes. The list is by no means exhaustive\u2014the furnishings section leaves off Jonathan Adler, whose partner Simon Doonan is the creative ambassador-at-large to Barneys, for instance\u2014but it's a start.\n\nWinners include Kenneth Cole for its supportive ads and pro-marriage equality apparel, Ralph Lauren for its work with the institute that operates the Harvey Milk School for LGBT youth, Nike for its support of marriage equality efforts on the West Coast and Aeropostale, Tiffany & Co., PetSmart, Armani Exchange, and Coach for each company's extensive non-discrimination policies and support of LBGTQ employees. Also getting snaps are Best Buy, Fab.com, Overstock.com and Amazon.\n\nIn the furnishings department, the Advocate recommends Williams-Sonoma and its equally-friendly offspring, West Elm and Pottery Barn. Crate & Barrel scores an almost perfect rating; Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams aces the rankings.\n\nIn the \"proceed with caution category\" falls Radio Shack, a company which has not taken steps to protect its transgendered workers. LBGTQ shoppers should also cast a side eye at Kohl's, whose policies to protect gay, lesbian and transgendered workers are relatively weak, and Hobby Lobby, whose recent moves concerning the Affordable Care Act place it on the conservative side of the spectrum. Thanks to its evangelical Christian doctrine and its refusal to extend benefits to same-sex partners, the Salvation Army also gets a pass.\n\n\u00b7 Holiday Guide: Shop Here, Not There [Advocate]\n\n\u00b7 Simon Doonan's 'Dark Suspicions' About 'Devil Wears Prada' [Racked]", "article_metadata": {"outbrainsection": "intelligence", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Gay news source The Advocate has come out with a shopping guide for the holidays.
