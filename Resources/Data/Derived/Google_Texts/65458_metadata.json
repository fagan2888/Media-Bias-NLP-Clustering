Chan School of Public Health in Boston.\n\nHe and his colleagues write in JAMA that nearly 12 million Americans gained health insurance through the 2010 law's marketplaces. By law, insurance plans are supposed to ensure \"reasonable access\" to providers.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers looked at 135 health insurance plans in 34 state marketplaces that were available during the 2015 open enrollment period, when people can select their plans.\n\nUsing the plans' physician directories, they looked for in-network specialists who would be covered by insurance, including obstetricians/gynecologists, dermatologists, cardiologists, psychiatrists, oncologists, neurologists, endocrinologists, rheumatologists and pulmnologists.\n\nOverall, in April 2015, 18 plans in nine states lacked in-network specialists for at least one specialty within a 100-mile search area, and 19 lacked specialists within a 50-mile radius.\n\nEndocrinology, rheumatology and psychiatry were the most commonly excluded specialties.\n\nAnother seven to 14 plans had fewer than five in-network doctors in those fields.\n\nWhen the researchers repeated their search in May, six of the 19 plans lacking specialists had added more providers.\n\nThe researchers also found that people enrolled in plans that lacked access to specialists had high out-of-network charges for doctors' visits and medication. In some cases, they had to pay half or more of all costs.\n\n\"What this basically translates into is huge out-of-pocket costs for the consumers,\" Dorner said.\n\nClare Krusing, the press secretary for America's Health Insurance Plans, told Reuters by email that the new research ignored state standards for time and distance requirements.\n\nAlso, Krusing said the researchers did not account for the number of specialists operating in specific states, and didn't acknowledge that plans have processes and programs in place to ensure patient access.\n\n\"The study's limitations speak for themselves, and account for the fact that the report presents a misleading picture of what's happening in the market today,\" she said. \"Health plans must meet state and federal network adequacy requirements that ensure patients have a wide range of providers and specialists available to them.\"\n\nThe researchers say the study relied on network directories, which are known to overestimate in-network providers (see Reuters Health story of Oct. 29, 2014 here: http://reut.rs/1N5R0mS). They add that the problem of access to in-network specialists may be even worse in rural areas.\n\n\"I think on the consumer side, they need to be really watchful of what is actually contained in their plans and what they're getting,\" Dorner said.\n\nAdditionally, he said the terms to evaluate plans should be better defined, and existing regulations should be enforced.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, lacking, specialized, healthcare", "pubdate": "2015-10-28T09:09:34", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Some health insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace may not provide reasonable access to medical specialists, according to a new analysis.", "title": "Obamacare Plans Lacking Specialized Healthcare", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/obamacare-lacking-specialized-healthcare/2015/10/28/id/699356/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=8da2a2a0-7fa9-4726-94e6-438fcce0c5de&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/obamacare-lacking-specialized-healthcare/2015/10/28/id/699356/", "title": "Obamacare Plans Lacking Specialized Healthcare", "description": "Some health insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace may not provide reasonable access to medical specialists, according to a new analysis.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1446023374, "google-site-verification": "NGHoAlboUoF7pnpHdT37QmA1nt1KoKHiKR6SZcSv1nI", "keywords": "obamacare, lacking, specialized, healthcare", "article": {"section": "Health-News", "published_time": "2015-10-28T09:09:34"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/obamacare-lacking-specialized-healthcare/2015/10/28/id/699356/", "description": "Some health insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace may not provide reasonable access to medical specialists, according to a new analysis."}, "article_summary": "He and his colleagues write in JAMA that nearly 12 million Americans gained health insurance through the 2010 law's marketplaces.\nUnder the act, also known as Obamacare, the federal marketplace offers subsidized private health insurance to consumers in states that didn't establish their own health insurance exchanges.\nSome health insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace may not provide reasonable access to medical specialists, new research suggests.\nClare Krusing, the press secretary for America's Health Insurance Plans, told Reuters by email that the new research ignored state standards for time and distance requirements.\nWhen the researchers repeated their search in May, six of the 19 plans lacking specialists had added more providers."}
