Leading the fight for states' rights\n\nFrom behind his desk in Topeka, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach exerts an influence on states\u2019 issues far beyond the borders of his own.\n\nThe Harvard-, Yale- and Oxford-educated lawyer, former constitutional law professor and ex-chief immigration law adviser to Attorney General John Ashcroft has now established himself as, in effect, the \u201clead attorney\u201d for the increasingly active states\u2019 rights movement across the country. Both in his capacity as secretary of state and as a private attorney, Kobach has drawn national notice for developing strategies, legislation and legal arguments for pushing back against the federal government on matters ranging from voter identification to gun rights to immigration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKobach, 47, says he is trying to \u201cstand in the gap\u201d against what he and his supporters see as a growth in federal power and erosion of states\u2019 rights \u2014 an issue he\u2019s been passionate about since being a law professor starting in 1996.\n\n\u201cYou know, 10 years ago, if you gave a talk on states\u2019 rights, people would fall asleep \u2026 but now things have changed,\u201d Kobach said in an interview.\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on immigration)\n\nIn recent years states have been pushing nullification-style bills, with 20 of them passing laws rejecting some or all of Obamacare and gun law-nullification bills being introduced in 37 states in 2013 alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of factors,\u201d Kobach continued. \u201cOne is the Obama administration\u2019s assertion of federal power, and then on top of that, you\u2019ve got these scandals, and there\u2019s several of them, the NSA scandal, there\u2019s also the abuse of power with regard to the DREAM Act amnesty which the Obama administration did in violation of federal law. So many people are looking at the federal government and saying, \u2018There\u2019s a real problem here.\u2019\u201d\n\nKobach\u2019s work on immigration is well-known: He authored the Arizona immigration bill that ended up before the Supreme Court, advised Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign on immigration, and is credited with developing the candidate\u2019s much-maligned \u201cself-deportation\u201d position, and in his work as an attorney he has represented states and cities in courts across the country on a range of immigration cases.\n\nBut Kobach has expanded his portfolio well beyond that. And with his rising profile, he is drawing increasing criticism. Civil liberties advocates call his policies dangerous, and some charge he\u2019s been getting shot down in the courts on case after case.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP leaders hit from within)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always touting how successful he is, but it\u2019s because he\u2019s distorting his record,\u201d said Gary Brunk, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri. \u201cOn immigration issues, I think that clearly his time has passed. \u2026 I don\u2019t know how far he\u2019s going to get on voting issues. In Kansas he\u2019s also jumped on Second Amendment issues. When people saw that, the reaction among people I\u2019m familiar with was, \u2018Well, Kris is jumping on another issue because his old issues are not working for him anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nKobach filed a lawsuit with Arizona in August asking the federal government to require proof of citizenship on voter registration forms in Kansas, the first action of its kind after a Supreme Court decision on voting registration forms last year invited such a lawsuit from states who wished to require citizenship proof. The move came after he successfully advocated for tough voter ID laws in Kansas that require voters registering to prove they are citizens.\n\nEarlier this month, Kobach announced that if the state loses its lawsuit, it would move ahead with a system that would allow voters who use the federal form and don\u2019t prove their citizenship to vote only in federal elections, whereas voters who registered with the state form and offered proof of citizenship could vote in statewide and local elections, as well. He said the state is not spending money on implementing the \u201ccontingency plan\u201d because it is confident its lawsuit will succeed, but if fails, the state would be forced to go ahead.\n\nAnd Kobach has spearheaded an effort called Interstate Cross Check, by which states submit their voter rolls to a database that checks for duplicates and can then follow up to purge ineligible voters from the rolls. Late last month, Nevada became the 25th state to join on to Kobach\u2019s effort.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP identity crisis plays out in Alabama)\n\nKobach also helped draft a bill signed into law this summer nullifying federal gun laws on weapons that never leave Kansas borders, an effort that was tried with varying levels of success in nearly three-quarters of states in 2013. He defended the law after Attorney General Eric Holder wrote the Kansas governor warning it was unconstitutional, with Kobach saying the law was drafted to withstand legal challenge and he would \u201chappily meet Mr. Holder in court.\u201d\n\nKobach, who was born in Wisconsin but moved to Kansas at age 7, lives in Piper, Kansas, with his family. His wife, Heather, is a former environmental systems engineer who now has a part-time photography business in addition to homeschooling their four daughters. Kobach grew up mostly in Topeka, where is father owned a car dealership.\n\nHis allies say Kobach brings a number of qualities that make him a valuable leader on their side.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Kris Kobach says his work is at the core of the Republican Party\u2019s ideals.", "title": "Leading the fight for states' rights", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/kris-kobach-states-rights-98879.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/19/130919_kris_kobach2_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Kris Kobach (4),Gun Control (784),Kansas (48),States' Rights (13),Obamacare (775)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Kris Kobach says his work is at the core of the Republican Party\u2019s ideals.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ca9\"", "article_summary": "Leading the fight for states' rightsFrom behind his desk in Topeka, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach exerts an influence on states\u2019 issues far beyond the borders of his own.\n\u201cOn immigration issues, I think that clearly his time has passed.\n\u201cYou know, 10 years ago, if you gave a talk on states\u2019 rights, people would fall asleep \u2026 but now things have changed,\u201d Kobach said in an interview.\nThe Harvard-, Yale- and Oxford-educated lawyer, former constitutional law professor and ex-chief immigration law adviser to Attorney General John Ashcroft has now established himself as, in effect, the \u201clead attorney\u201d for the increasingly active states\u2019 rights movement across the country.\nIn Kansas he\u2019s also jumped on Second Amendment issues."}
