When you put my name in as an author, my books wouldn\u2019t show up, just like they didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even worse, Preston said, when a customer clicked on the page for \u201cBlue Labyrinth\u201d and other Hachette titles, a pop-up window appeared, obscuring the Hachette book and redirecting the customer to another, similar book\u2014 not published by Hachette or its affiliates \u2014 and sold at the standard Amazon discount.\n\nHachette authors watched sales at Amazon \u2014 which accounts for 41 percent of all new books that are sold in the U.S., according to the Los Angeles Times \u2014 decline between 50 percent and 90 percent, Preston said.\n\nHachette and Amazon agreed to a settlement last month, but Preston and other authors continue to press for a federal investigation of what they believe to be antitrust violations by the online giant.\n\nThe sanctions were \u201creally devastating, financially,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a best-selling author, so I\u2019m OK. The real tragedy is what it did to the many hundreds of struggling young authors who saw their books vanish without a trace, without finding the audience they needed \u2014 which means they\u2019re not going to get another chance \u2026 What Amazon did was absolutely crushing to their career hopes.\u201d\n\nIn May, New York Times reporter David Streitfeld broke the Amazon-Hachette story, revealing details of \u201cAmazon\u2019s secret campaign to discourage customers from buying books by Hachette\u201d \u2014 and Preston penned a letter to Amazon\u2019s board of directors protesting Amazon\u2019s tactics. Then he began looking for other writers to co-sign, and found early support from Maine authors Stephen King of Bangor and Richard Russo, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist who lives in Portland.\n\nIn an email Wednesday to the Bangor Daily News, Russo wrote, \u201cI believe Amazon\u2019s ambitions are monopolistic, and not in the best interests of the larger publishing ecosystem, and certainly not in the interest of a diverse literature.\u201d\n\nHe added that his daughter is an independent bookseller, \u201cand, as such, is in Amazon\u2019s crosshairs, so for me it\u2019s very personal.\u201d\n\nAuthors United\n\nBy early July, about 900 authors \u2014 \u201ceverything from cookbook authors to literary authors \u2014 had added their names to the protest letter, Preston said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a diversity of authors come together for any reason.\u201d\n\nThe group took form as Authors United and in September wrote to the company\u2019s board, appealing to them to remove the \u201csanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral thousand Hachette authors have watched their readership decline, or, in the case of new authors, have seen their books sink out of sight without finding an adequate readership,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cThese men and women are deeply concerned about what this means for their future careers.\u201d\n\nThe letter ran as a double-page ad in the New York Times \u2014 a \u201csix-figure\u201d expenditure financed by a number of writers including Preston, King, John Grisham and Nora Roberts. That ad, Preston said, caught the attention of media around the world.\n\nSome called on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Amazon for allegedly violating antitrust laws. Nobel Prize-winning columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Amazon is \u201ca monopsonist, a dominant buyer with the power to push prices down.\u201d\n\nEven comedian and author Stephen Colbert took aim at the online retailer, encouraging people to download and print stickers to put on books that say \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it on Amazon.\u201d\n\nAmazon executives also took note of the ad, and Preston said several called him directly. Russell Grandinetti, vice president for Kindle at Amazon.com, made what Preston described as \u201ca threatening call. He called me a rich, entitled author. Another called me an opportunist. There was a lot of nastiness.\u201d\n\nThe war of words continued, now in public, and in late October the New York Times reported that Amazon\u2019s third-quarter sales dropped 18.5 percent \u2014 or $250 million below what the company had anticipated. Preston believes Authors Unlimited influenced those numbers by encouraging customers to boycott Amazon.\n\nOn Nov. 13, Amazon and Hachette settled the dispute. According to a joint release from the two companies, Hachette would continue to set the prices for its ebooks. Streitfield reported that Amazon would continue to collect 30 percent of the profits of ebooks.\n\n\u201cIn both those issues, Amazon lost,\u201d Preston said Wednesday. However, he said the contract does allow Amazon to offer incentives to Hachette to reduce the retail price, among other concessions.\n\nHachette did not return phone calls and emails seeking comment for this story.\n\nOn Friday, Amazon spokeswoman Sophie Cottrell declined to comment but forwarded the joint statement and a letter from Hachette to authors and agents in which the company wrote that its authors\u2019 books \u201cwill be restored as soon as possible to normal avaiilability on Amazon, will be available for pre-order, and will be included in promotions on the site.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not going away\u2019\n\nWhile the immediate dispute has been settled, Preston said, \u201cThe basic problem hasn\u2019t gone away, and we\u2019re not going away.\u201d\n\nAuthors United has consulted with antitrust lawyers, Preston said, and plans to file a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice early next year.\n\n\u201cThey believe there is a case to be made that Amazon is abusing its market power,\u201d Preston said. \u201cWe authors were subject to eight months of sanctions, and many careers were permanently damaged \u2014 even ruined. I know authors who had to go back to bartending or waiting tables because their first book at Hachette failed because of Amazon.\u201d\n\nNew York Times best-selling author Meryl Gordon\u2019s second book, \u201cThe Phantom of Fifth Avenue: The Mysterious Life and Scandalous Death of Heiress Huguette Clark,\u201d was published May 27, 2014, just as the sanctions geared up. The timing, she said Thursday, could not have been worse.\n\nTwo days before the book was published, Amazon removed the \u201cBuy\u201d button, Gordon said. A week later, Amazon increased the shipping time of the book to two to four weeks and removed its discount.\n\nGordon, whose first book, \u201cMrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach\u201d was a New York Times best seller, said she\u2019s not sure of exact figures, but estimates she lost 12 percent of her sales during the sanctions. Gordon said she was \u201ceither lucky or smart\u201d that Hachette already had accepted her proposal for a third book before the declining sales figures were available.\n\nAuthor Daniel Shulman\u2019s \u201cSons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America\u2019s Most Powerful and Private Dynasty,\u201d was published a week before Gordon\u2019s. The book landed on the New York Times best seller list the first week, according to Shulman.\n\n\u201cYou go on a media blitz right after the book comes out, and people see you on TV or hear you on the radio and say, \u2018This book sounds interesting,\u2019\u201d Shulman said Thursday by phone. \u201cThen they go to Amazon and basically it says you have to wait three to five weeks and it\u2019s not being discounted. Some people might say, \u2018Never mind.\u2019\u201d\n\nGordon said she and other established authors felt compelled to speak out on behalf of the newer authors, who are reluctant to protest because they fear retaliation and \u201cbecause Amazon has a long reach.\u201d\n\nIn addition to advocating for less-established writers, Preston said Wednesday that Authors United will continue to press for a federal investigation into whether Amazon is violating antitrust laws.\n\n\u201cAmazon has made it quite clear that they have no respect for authors or their careers and will do anything to get what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level of outrage and resentment among the literary community in this country is astonishing, and it\u2019s not going away. And we\u2019re not going away.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nAuthor Meryl Gordon\u2019s second book was \u201cThe Phantom of Fifth Avenue: The Mysterious Life and Scandalous Death of Heiress Huguette Clark, published in May 2014. Her first book, \u201cMrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach,\u201d appeared on a New York Times best-seller list in December 2008.
