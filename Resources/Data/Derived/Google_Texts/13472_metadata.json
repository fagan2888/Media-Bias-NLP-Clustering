Vine / ChiefSmokes\n\nA Vine video uploaded by an unidentified user known as \u201cChiefSmokes\u201d shows a toddler dressed in Mickey Mouse pajamas and sitting on a toilet, smoking from a joint while adults laugh in the background.\n\nIt appears that the adults in the video are cupping the blunt as the child inhales, then laugh while saying, \u201cHe\u2019s smoking it, he\u2019s smoking it!\u201d It\u2019s uncertain whether the adults are the child\u2019s parents.\n\nThe user behind ChiefSmokes\u2019 Vine profile claims he\u2019s not the one who handed the kid marijuana. ChiefSmokes posted another video which appears to be the toddler bouncing around after he got high, and wrestling playfully with a black man. But ChiefSmokes captioned it, \u201cThis is not me lol I\u2019m not black.\u201d\n\nAngry commenters still directed their fury at him, however. \u201cWhere are you getting these videos from?\u201d One user, MuhvaMelly, writes. \u201c[I don\u2019t care] if you\u2019re not black or it\u2019s not u. You are promoting it.\u201d ChiefSmokes has posted about 53 videos and has over 400 followers.\n\nThe active ingredient in marijuana, THC, can have a significant effect on the formation of nerve cell connections in the brains of children and adolescents, which can leave them impaired in later years. It especially impacts the cerebral cortex, which involves thinking skills and memories.\n\nThe video has been retweeted over 39,000 times and revined over 9,000 times. One Reddit user, skidoorider21, wrote, \u201cAfter watching this I immediately downloaded the video, took screenshots and reported it to CPS in California as it is where the user is from. This is no environment for a child to be in. He needs a good parent not someone to hurt him or bring him down.\u201d\n\nHowever, the user who uploaded the video is apparently not the child\u2019s parent and it has yet to be investigated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vine video marijuana, baby smokes weed, marijuana", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Vine user uploaded a video showing a child smoking marijuana to the chagrin of Internet users, who are now demanding the parents be jailed.", "title": "Vine Video Shows Toddler Smoking Marijuana [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vine-video-shows-toddler-smoking-marijuana-adults-laugh-background-internet-outraged-276262", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/toddler-smoking-weed.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Vine user uploaded a video showing a child smoking marijuana to the chagrin of Internet users, who are now demanding the parents be jailed.", "title": "Vine Video Shows Toddler Smoking Marijuana [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vine-video-shows-toddler-smoking-marijuana-adults-laugh-background-internet-outraged-276262", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/toddler-smoking-weed.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/toddler-smoking-weed.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-04-12T16:48:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-12T16:48:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Vine user uploaded a video showing a child smoking marijuana to the chagrin of Internet users, who are now demanding the parents be jailed."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f1d\"", "article_summary": "Vine / ChiefSmokesA Vine video uploaded by an unidentified user known as \u201cChiefSmokes\u201d shows a toddler dressed in Mickey Mouse pajamas and sitting on a toilet, smoking from a joint while adults laugh in the background.\nIt appears that the adults in the video are cupping the blunt as the child inhales, then laugh while saying, \u201cHe\u2019s smoking it, he\u2019s smoking it!\u201d It\u2019s uncertain whether the adults are the child\u2019s parents.\nA Vine video of a small child being given a joint has gone viral on the Internet, outraging people over the parents' lack of judgment.\nThe user behind ChiefSmokes\u2019 Vine profile claims he\u2019s not the one who handed the kid marijuana.\nChiefSmokes posted another video which appears to be the toddler bouncing around after he got high, and wrestling playfully with a black man."}
