Entitled \u201cThe Affordable Care Act: Effects on College Students,\u201d the event is being sponsored by the school\u2019s Office of the Provost and presented as an impartial discussion on what Obamacare will mean for young people.\n\nBut the guest speaker at the event, Dr. John Hassett, has a well-documented record of comparing Obamacare to the Holocaust and equating progressives to the Nazis.\n\nHassett has been involved in Tea Party groups throughout Long Island for years, even running as a Tea Party candidate for a village trustee seat in the small town of Malverne in Nassau County (his campaign was derailed by violations of state campaign finance laws). Numerous conservative groups have invited Hassett to deliver speeches on Obamacare, and he has used those opportunities to compare President Obama and Democrats to Nazis and equate the Affordable Care Act to the Holocaust.\n\nAt a speech last May organized by a group calling itself The Guardians of Religious Freedom, Hassett laid out the comparison for attendees by claiming \u2014 falsely \u2014 that a single person will be responsible for doling out health care and will be making all health care decisions for anyone enrolled through Medicare or the state\u2019s exchanges. It\u2019s the same argument that conservatives made when raising the alarm over so-called death panels, but Hassett expanded on the idea further.\n\n\u201cThat was the initial steps in Germany, before they headed to the sterilizations and murders,\u201d he said. \u201cHow does this relate to Obamacare? Very closely unfortunately, if you follow paradigms from the past.\u201d\n\nJewish leaders at Stony Brook University (full disclosure, this reporter\u2019s alma mater) reacted with disappointment over Hassett\u2019s remarks and his invitation to speak. \u201cAny comparison of the Affordable Care Act to the Holocaust is not only absurd, but offensive as well,\u201d said Rabbi Joseph Topek, head of the university\u2019s Hillel. \u201cTo make that correlation is offensive to victims of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nHassett is hardly the first conservative to make the connection, but it\u2019s unusual to see a public entity like a state university involve itself with such controversial figures. Indeed, students involved in the planning of the event have said they did not realize Hassett had such a checkered past.\n\nA representative from the university was not immediately available for a comment.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Dr. John Hassett has a well-documented history of extreme rhetoric on Obamacare, like warning New Yorkers about impending \"death panels.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Dr. John Hassett has a well-documented history of extreme rhetoric on Obamacare, like warning New Yorkers about impending \"death panels.\"", "title": "Public University Hosts Event With Doctor Who Compared Obamacare To The Holocaust", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/10/3425091/university-obamacare-holocaust/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare_protest_tpftd-e1386179784306.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. John Hassett has a well-documented history of extreme rhetoric on Obamacare, like warning New Yorkers about impending \"death panels.\"", "creator": "@AdamReports", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare_protest_tpftd-e1386179784306-321x214.jpg", "title": "Public University Hosts Event With Doctor Who Compared Obamacare To The Holocaust", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare_protest_tpftd-e1386179784306.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obamacare_protest_tpftd-e1386179784306.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-10T12:19:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6ee\"", "article_summary": "One such event is being hosted at Stony Brook University, a public university in New York.\n\u201cAny comparison of the Affordable Care Act to the Holocaust is not only absurd, but offensive as well,\u201d said Rabbi Joseph Topek, head of the university\u2019s Hillel.\nBut the guest speaker at the event, Dr. John Hassett, has a well-documented record of comparing Obamacare to the Holocaust and equating progressives to the Nazis.\nEntitled \u201cThe Affordable Care Act: Effects on College Students,\u201d the event is being sponsored by the school\u2019s Office of the Provost and presented as an impartial discussion on what Obamacare will mean for young people.\nIndeed, students involved in the planning of the event have said they did not realize Hassett had such a checkered past."}
