To read all the entries in the series, click here\n\nWe\u2019re sitting on the sofa in my studio apartment, mere inches from the bed where, moments earlier, his mouth and hands teased the rolls and folds of my body, where he\u2019d turned my back-fat into an altar. The sheets haven\u2019t cooled yet, and he\u2019s telling me about the things he won\u2019t do in public, just to keep things between us from getting \u201cconfusing.\u201d He won\u2019t hold my hand.\n\nFor most of my dating life, my amplitude was something to be overlooked, overcome. Tolerated. I remember one man, an alcoholic who\u2019d begun taking red wine before his morning coffee, sitting across from me as I held a vegetable roll between my chopsticks, and asking, with an earnest obliviousness, if I might consider \u201ceating healthier food.\u201d My suitors were always taken enough with everything beneath my skin \u2014 heart and wit and good old-fashioned moxie \u2014 but only taken so far. Even if our breakups were rooted in banality of mismatched ambitions, uneven libidos, or just plain stupid youth, there was always a thin tendril muscling up from that root, one that choked our relationships: the stigma of dating a fat girl.\n\nNot this guy. He\u2019d been unabashedly open, enthusiastic even, about his preference for those of us on the Melissa McCarthy end of the size spectrum. He\u2019d reached out to thank me for an essay I wrote about my choice to duck-and-roll off the hamster wheel of constant dieting and accept, even embrace, my size 24 figure. We talked, and wrote, with increasing length and flirtatiousness, about body acceptance and the vanquishing of secret shame, our upbringings (or lack thereof) and aspirations; ours was a courtship knit by the camaraderie of misfits, an affection that felt as easy and natural as spring grass, and as vital as rain.\n\nThat affection ends with a confession like a record skipping just before the bridge in my favorite song. He would touch me everywhere; he just wouldn\u2019t hold my hand. And he\u2019s telling me now, because he doesn\u2019t want me to get the wrong idea, to think that his unwillingness is \u201ca matter of optics.\u201d A matter of how a thin man \u2014 any man, really \u2014 looks when he shows up with his hand in mine.\n\nFor weeks afterward, \u201ca matter of optics\u201d became shorthand among my friends and me for any act of casual, oblivious cruelty. (\u201cThat asshole didn\u2019t look while changing lanes \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of optics\u201d; or, \u201cI got this assignment piled on me at five p.m. on a Friday. Optics!\u201d) Humor staved my nearest and dearest from embracing their inner Sonny Corleones, and it did help me slowly get over my belief that this could have been something different, that he could have been someone better. I healed the way a bruise heals, reabsorbing the tender, ticking parts of myself \u2014 the hope I\u2019d had, the disappointment that replaced it \u2014 under my skin; just another stiff spot that ached in the cold.\n\n* * *\n\nMany of my female friends recall their youths in requited crushes and the sweet fumbling tenderness of first kisses; moments when they became aware of the power wielded in a smile or a flash of thigh, when they knew what it meant to be cherished. I was a 12 year old in a tent dress, and my forays into cat\u2019s eyeliner and pastel lip gloss couldn\u2019t save me from the viciousness of schoolboys who\u2019d ask me out for sport. Guileless and desperate for affection, I\u2019d believed them, believed that I\u2019d have all the pleasures and privileges of being \u201ca real girl.\u201d Then, the boy would break character and start snickering. And the peanut gallery of his pals, or the kids-he-was-trying-to-impress would high-five, congratulating him on the big game of the low-hanging fruit.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve gleaned from Facebook, many of those boys have their parents\u2019 hand-me-down lives, middle-class and middle-of-the-road: the slim wives and chubby babies, a sports team to follow and an entry-level job that\u2019s held steady for the past five years. Good for them. But they rutted me to the core, planted deep seeds of resentment and mistrust that still makes it hard, almost impossible, for me to accept that men would want me for me, not me-minus-50 (or 75) (or 100) pounds \u2014 not me in spite of myself.\n\nWhen I was in my late teens and early 20s, I wanted so desperately to feel a part of something \u2014 I wanted love; more than this, I wanted to feel normal. I wanted someone to call me \u201cjust to say goodnight\u201d whenever I stayed out of town; to become acquainted with every freckle and scar, to soften and sadden over those scars because of how I got them, but to still respect them because how I got them has made me, me; to take me out for cocktails and brunches and beam at me over the rims of martini glasses and coffee mugs with the tender, solicitous bewitchment of a man in love. I starved myself for that affection. I purged and popped pills that turned my pulse into a pendulum and made me fear I\u2019d lost my mind. And all for a few zipless fucks who\u2019d button up their shirts, kiss my forehead, and promise calls that never came.\n\nEven when I could press the heels of my hands to my ribcage, even when my skirts slid down my ass, I was still the fat girl. Even when Mr. Last Night turned into Mr. Okay for a While, I knew that, eventually, that red wine at dinner would turn into an inch on my hips, and that inch would turn into 10 inches. Experience taught me what to expect, then. I distrusted these men before I could ever give them a chance.\n\nMy mother would tell me I\u2019d need \u201ca special sort of man,\u201d one who would be \u201caccepting\u201d of me, just as I am. Older men. \u201cWorking men.\u201d Men from \u201cdifferent cultures.\u201d She\u2019d speak in a slow, sugared tone reserved to comfort a dying animal. The implication \u2014 made overt by a therapist who insisted that a husband and two children were the only balms to soothe the full-body thermal burns of growing up inside a volcano \u2014 was that any man who could appreciate, let alone delight in, all 200-plus pounds of me was fundamentally askew. Broken. I\u2019d never be more than a momentary indent on a mattress, a ghost in the sheets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For too many men, my weight is a problem, or a fetish.
