Chris Christie engaged in a tense debate with an Obamacare advocate during a town hall in South River, N.J., on Tuesday, telling her the state won\u2019t invest taxpayer in a \u201cfailed federal program.\u201d\n\nMaura Collinsgru, of New Jersey Citizen Action, accused Christie of failing to facilitate Medicaid expansion, thus getting in the way of people getting the coverage they need. She also accused the governor\u2019s administration of responding with \u201csilence\u201d when her group has attempted to contact them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the silence you\u2019ve been met with when I expanded the Medicaid program? Let me ask you this: When I expanded the Medicaid program, is that silence?\u201d Christie asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re simply wrong,\u201d he added, explaining that New Jersey is spending more federal and state dollars on Medicaid than when he took office.\n\nChristie also made it clear that he does not support Obamacare, which he called a \u201cfailed federal program.\u201d The crowd responded with applause when he took a swipe at President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nBecause New Jersey missed a deadline to submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services last month to show how it would use a $7.6 million federal grant to help insure the uninsured, the state had to return the money. New Jersey did not set up its own online insurance exchange, instead directing residents to use the federal exchange.\n\nWatch the tense exchange via CNN here:\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey Gov.
