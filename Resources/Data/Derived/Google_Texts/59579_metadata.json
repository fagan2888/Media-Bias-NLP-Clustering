According to the CDC, 200,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized due to flu-related problems every year, and up to 20 percent of the population gets infected with the flu.\n\nWhile vaccines typically protect against the current strain going around that season, they might not cover all the strains floating around. That\u2019s why researchers from The Ohio State University are attempting to develop a treatment that could prevent all strains of the flu from occurring in the first place, ridding the need for a vaccine completely.\n\n\u201cThe flu vaccine needs to change every year because the virus is constantly mutating,\u201d Jacob Yount, assistant professor of microbial infection and immunity at The Ohio State University, said in the press release. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is targeting a more fundamental process that is not specific to any particular strain of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe researchers boosted the level of a particular protein known as IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) in mouse and human cells in their experiments. IFITM3 is known to be one protein that can defend against all strains of influenza, and it\u2019s naturally released in cells after the virus has already infected the body. In these cases, IFITM3 fights the infection by trapping the virus and stopping its ability to recreate itself.\n\nThe researchers wanted to see if boosting IFITM3 in cells before infection, however, could prevent the flu altogether \u2014 and they saw promising results. But there was one more aspect they had to account for: an enzyme known as NEDD4, which typically degrades IFITM3 by attaching a chain of molecules to it. They needed to inhibit NEDD4 in order for IFITM3 to increase in the cell to their desired level, and found it was effective in both mouse and human cells.\n\n\u201cWe figured out a way to induce just this single interferon response \u2014 the most important thing interferon does for flu,\u201d Yount said in the press release. \u201cThat was a huge finding \u2014 that you don\u2019t need an infection or interferon to increase the level of IFITM3. The steady-state level of the protein is enough to inhibit the virus if you get rid of NEDD4.\u201d\n\nRecently, scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced that soon, they may be developing a universal flu vaccine \u2014 one that can protect against a wide variety of strains, rather than just one. But preventing the flu even before it hits could be an even better strategy in protecting thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cIf we were to have an outbreak of some pandemic influenza virus similar to what we experienced in 2009, I could envision using this technique to help people who are particularly vulnerable to infection,\u201d Yount said in the press release. \u201cIt would work best if used before an infection, because the strategy prevents cells from becoming infected in the first place.\u201d\n\nSource: Yount JS, Chesarino NM, McMichael TM.
