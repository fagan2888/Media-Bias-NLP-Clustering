Less than a year later, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise referred to as Obamacare, was signed into law.\n\nThose two events are emblematic of the transformation and disruption roiling the healthcare industry as it deals with an influx of amazing technologies and a forced migration away from traditional \u201cfee for service\u201d quantitative business models toward qualitative pay for performance and integrated care models.\n\nGreg Walton, CIO of El Camino Hospital and a 45-year IT veteran, joined the organization in late 2007, a little over a year after the new facility\u2019s groundbreaking. He says ACA and other mandates, combined with new technology and business pressures, will lead to increased innovation by healthcare organizations. \u201cInnovation is only going to accelerate; I see that on the ground as CIO every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this organization take that in stride and run with it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the latest advancements in medical technology, El Camino\u2019s new facility represented the latest in healthcare IT, including biometric palm scanning patient registration; computer physician order entry (CPOE) and medication bar coding; medical grade bedside computers with \"real-time\" medical record processing; telemedicine capabilities and wall-to-wall wireless technology.\n\n\u201cThe automation we\u2019ve deployed here is working well,\u201d says Walton. \u201cIt\u2019s a little older; we\u2019ve refreshed some things, and we\u2019ve continued to deploy what we did in this building to other buildings.\u201d Between Mountain View and a sister campus in Los Gatos, the non-profit organization has a medical staff of 1,300, with 443 licensed beds, and annually experiences more than 18,000 admissions and more than 50,000 emergency room visits.\n\nThe industry as a whole is facing disruptive changes as it seeks to complete Stage 2 of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\u2019s Meaningful Use electronic health records (EHR) incentives program, and El Camino is in the midst of migrating to a new EHR system.\n\nSome worry that rapid consolidation among EHR vendors may stifle innovation, but Walton has an opposite view. Referring to futurist Joel Barker's assertion that innovation at the verge of ecosystems creates new categories of products and services, Walton believes EHR adoption will \u201cbecome the foundation for innovation that will involve cloud, social, mobile and personalize consumer technology.\u201d\n\nWalton says he\u2019s worked with Silicon Valley venture capital and incubator company that has vetted 1,000 companies in the healthcare sector and is helping to bring to market solutions that \u201csolve problems that EHRs don\u2019t solve.\u201d One such problem, he says, is the burgeoning elderly population most countries are dealing with. That\u2019s spurring innovations ranging from dishes that are easier for the elderly to feed themselves, to devices that will predict or prevent falling, he points out.\n\n\u201cWhen I started in this field 45 years ago I thought I would be all done by now and at mid-career I\u2019d have to look for something new,\u201d he says. \u201cThe degree of knowledge and science has expanded exponentially. We\u2019ve accomplished so much in healthcare sector, but there is so much more to do.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment reflects his belief that people are attracted to healthcare IT because they want to work at an organization with a service-to-others mission, rather than one of the multitudes of startup companies in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s why, he says, it\u2019s no harder hiring the right IT skills there than in any other part of the country. \u201cThe hottest demand right now is for security skills, and while it took longer than we liked, we hired some good people in that area.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not likely that those distribution robots traversing the halls or even the robotic surgical systems are going to replace the need for human skills any time soon. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the robots, and they continue to serve us well; one of the things about them is they don\u2019t mind working nights and holidays,\u201d he says.\n\nThey have supplemented rather than displaced humans and, although there were some initial staff concerns over adverse consequences, the organization didn\u2019t think it would be an issue, and it wasn\u2019t, he says.\n\nIn fact, after the Bay Area-based Golden State Warriors won the National Basketball Association championship in mid-June, the next day staffers affixed photos of Warriors team members to each of the robots. \u201cI won\u2019t say they\u2019re like pets, but they are part of the family,\u201d he says.\n\nGreg Walton, a nationally known leader in health information technology with more than 35 years of industry experience, joined El Camino Hospital in late 2007. Before coming to El Camino Hospital, he served as senior vice president and chief information officer at Carilion Health System in Roanoke, Virginia. Mr. Walton has also held management positions at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Cap Gemini, and SMS. His professional accomplishments include serving as the former Executive Advisor to the Commonwealth of Virginia's Task Force for Health Care Information Systems, and serving on the Sub Committee Chair for The Governor's Task Force for Electronic Health Records.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With robots scuttling through hallways to distribute drugs, and robotic-surgery enabling new minimally invasive procedures, El Camino Hospital in late 2009 opened a new $450 million \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d facility in Mountain View, virtually the heart of Silicon Valley.
