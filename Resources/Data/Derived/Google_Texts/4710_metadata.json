Then, something interesting happens. Sandler\u2019s Chuck stops dead for a speech.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we hurt people, people we wouldn\u2019t want to hurt in a million years, by doing what we did,\u201d he says of the gay ruse. \u201cFor the record,\u201d he says, referring to an anti-gay slur, \u201cthat\u2019s a bad word. Don\u2019t use it. I used to say it more than anybody, but I was ignorant. It\u2019s hurtful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a disarming moment of apology, and it\u2019s more than the character talking; it\u2019s Sandler, owning up to his public. While it can\u2019t help but sound hypocritical in the context of the rest of the picture, it\u2019s one small step for mainstream acceptance of legalized gay marriage, which seemed a long way off eight years ago.\n\nNow I wonder if Sandler might take the events of the past week as an opportunity for some related soul-searching.\n\nOn April 22 and 23, a Native American cultural adviser and several Native performers and extras walked off the set of \u201cThe Ridiculous 6,\u201d a Netflix-produced Western spoof co-written and starring Sandler. One actress, Allison Young, blanched at doing a scene requiring her to fall down drunk, surrounded by jeering white men who rouse her by dousing her with more alcohol. Various versions of the script leaked online include characters with names such as \u201cBeaver Breath\u201d and \u201cNo Bra.\u201d\n\nYoung told one interviewer: \u201cWe talked to the producers about our concerns. They just told us, \u2018If you guys are so sensitive, you should leave\u2019 \u2026 This is supposed to be a comedy that makes you laugh. A film like this should not make someone feel this way.\u201d\n\nNetflix countered with the usual defense for a cheap, lowbrow comedy. \u201cThe movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason: because it is ridiculous,\u201d the Netflix spokesperson said. \u201cIt is a broad satire of Western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of \u2014 but in on \u2014 the joke.\u201d\n\nThe movie is months away from completion. We don\u2019t know if any of the Native American characters are in on any of the jokes, which rely (judging from versions of the script leaked online) on guys talking about putting their \u201cpee-pee\u201d into someone\u2019s \u201cteepee.\u201d\n\nAs the title of Bob Hope\u2019s final starring vehicle put it: Cancel my reservation.\n\nThis much is clear. People of color, to say nothing of women, who have been marginalized, patronized or humiliated by a stupid joke in an Adam Sandler movie over the last few years constitute the biggest club in modern Hollywood. And until last week, that club was one of the least heralded, if only because its members have been putting up with the demeaning treatment for a century.\n\nWe routinely give comedy, and comedians, a pass because (according to the traditional argument) you can\u2019t get a laugh without offending somebody. One person\u2019s edgy winner (\u201cBorat,\u201d for example) is another\u2019s cause for outrage.\n\nBut something has been bubbling beneath the surface of too many Sandler comedies in recent years, a cold, mean-spirited smugness reeking of unexamined white-male privilege.\n\nComing off his previous comedy, \u201cBlended,\u201d which was widely derided for its patronizing depiction of its black South African characters propping up the white leads, Sandler must now feel he can\u2019t win. The movies that appeal to many critics, notably Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s bizarre, intense romantic fable \u201cPunch-Drunk Love,\u201d reveal him to be an interesting and effective actor. These are the ones that tank with Sandler\u2019s core audience.\n\nThrough thick and thin (or, as Mel Brooks used to say, \u201cthrough thin\u201d), that audience for years could be counted on to support Sandler in comedies best described as low and lower, some of them pretty entertaining. \u201cYou Don\u2019t Mess with the Zohan\u201d is a weirdly compelling burlesque on Israeli/Arab tensions; it\u2019s leagues ahead of the other ones, the terrible ones: \u201cJack and Jill\u201d and \u201cJust Go With It\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s My Boy.\u201d\n\nSandler\u2019s comedies have plenty of admirers, among them Bilge Ebiri, who wrote for Vulture of the star\u2019s \u201cprofound sense of self-loathing\u201d as a comic and dramatic virtue. \u201cWhether his character is being sensitive or cruel, victimized or boiling over with anger, falling in love or engaging in romantic duplicity, he remains above it all,\u201d Ebiri wrote. \u201cHe still can\u2019t seem to be bothered to care.\u201d I don\u2019t consider that quality as much of a virtue as Ebiri does, but to each his own.\n\nThe history of screen performance hides a parallel history of performers who held and continue to hold their noses while figuring out how to play demeaning roles. Just ask half the men in Hollywood, and nearly all of the women, and every single actress or actor of any sort of color.\n\nIt\u2019s best to let \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d make its way to its final destination, aka Netflix, before we pass judgment on the quality of its humor or its filmmaking or the way it deploys ethnic stereotype for laughs. For now, though, it\u2019s hard not to take heart from a small group of infrequently employed Native American performers who decided that enough was enough, and the taste in their mouths wasn\u2019t worth it. Sandler might want to reassess that \u201cChuck and Larry\u201d speech about the ignorance and hurtfulness of certain words and certain cultural-dustbin depictions of human beings.\n\nAlso, making funnier movies wouldn\u2019t hurt.
