HARRISON, N.J. — Bradley Wright-Phillips and Peguy Luyindula scored, and the New York Red Bulls beat D.C. United 2-0 on Sunday in the first leg of Major League Soccer’s Eastern Conference semifinals.

Thierry Henry set up both goals with brilliant passes. The first was a no-look assist off his back heel to an unmarked Wright-Phillips, who punched it past goalkeeper Bill Hamid in the 40th minute.

Luyindula doubled the lead in the 73rd minute, gathering Henry’s well-placed delivery from midfield and slotting the finish through Hamid’s legs.

Hamid finished with five saves, but Luis Robles needed only two to hold United without an away goal.

The Red Bulls visit United for the second leg of the total-goals series next Saturday.
