ESTES PARK — A 9-year-old girl was fatally struck by an SUV Friday in an apartment building parking lot in the 1200 block of Graves Avenue.

Emergency responders tried unsuccessfully to revive Ayana Fernandez Portillo, but she was pronounced dead at the scene, Estes Park police said.

The Estes Park Trail-Gazette reports the accident is under investigation. Both the driver of the SUV and the passenger, who is the child’s sister, are cooperating, police said.

“An investigation is underway, but initially this appears to be a tragic accident,” said Wes Kufel, Estes Park police chief. “We are extremely saddened by this loss and our hearts are with Ayana’s family.”
