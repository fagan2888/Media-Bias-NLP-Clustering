Earlier this week, the Greeks filled in some details on how they intend to meet the terms. So how did it go?\n\nWell, if you were to believe many of the news reports and opinion pieces of the past few days, you\u2019d think that it was a disaster \u2014 that it was a \u201csurrender\u201d on the part of Syriza, the new ruling coalition in Athens. Some factions within Syriza apparently think so, too. But it wasn\u2019t. On the contrary, Greece came out of the negotiations pretty well, although the big fights are still to come. And by doing O.K., Greece has done the rest of Europe a favor.\n\nTo make sense of what happened, you need to understand that the main issue of contention involves just one number: the size of the Greek primary surplus, the difference between government revenues and government expenditures not counting interest on the debt. The primary surplus measures the resources that Greece is actually transferring to its creditors. Everything else, including the notional size of the debt \u2014 which is a more or less arbitrary number at this point, with little bearing on the amount anyone expects Greece to pay \u2014 matters only to the extent that it affects the primary surplus Greece is forced to run.\n\nFor Greece to run any surplus at all \u2014 given the depression-level slump that it\u2019s in and the effect of that depression on revenues \u2014 is a remarkable achievement, the result of incredible sacrifices. Nonetheless, Syriza has always been clear that it intends to keep running a modest primary surplus. If you are angry that the negotiations didn\u2019t make room for a full reversal of austerity, a turn toward Keynesian fiscal stimulus, you weren\u2019t paying attention.\n\nThe question instead was whether Greece would be forced to impose still more austerity. The previous Greek government had agreed to a program under which the primary surplus would triple over the next few years, at immense cost to the nation\u2019s economy and people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy would any government agree to such a thing? Fear. Essentially, successive leaders in Greece and other debtor nations haven\u2019t dared to challenge extreme creditor demands, for fear that they would be punished \u2014 that the creditors would cut off their cash flow or, worse yet, implode their banking system if they balked at ever-harsher budget cuts.\n\nSo did the current Greek government back down and agree to aim for those economy-busting surpluses? No, it didn\u2019t. In fact, Greece won new flexibility for this year, and the language about future surpluses was obscure. It could mean anything or nothing.\n\nAnd the creditors did not pull the plug. Instead, they made financing available to carry Greece through the next few months. That is, if you like, putting Greece on a short leash, and it means that the big fight over the future is yet to come. But the Greek government didn\u2019t succumb to the bum\u2019s rush, and that in itself is a kind of victory.\n\nWhy, then, all the negative reporting? To be fair, fiscal policy isn\u2019t the only issue. There were and are also arguments about things like privatization of public assets, where Syriza has agreed not to reverse deals already made, and labor market regulation, where some of the \u201cstructural reform\u201d of the austerity era will apparently stand. Syriza also agreed to crack down on tax evasion, although why collecting taxes is supposed to be a defeat for a leftist government is a mystery to me.\n\nStill, nothing that just happened justifies the pervasive rhetoric of failure. Actually, my sense is that we\u2019re seeing an unholy alliance here between left-leaning writers with unrealistic expectations and the business press, which likes the story of Greek debacle because that\u2019s what is supposed to happen to uppity debtors. But there was no debacle. Provisionally, at least, Greece seems to have ended the cycle of ever-more-savage austerity.\n\nAnd, as I said, in so doing, Greece has done the rest of Europe a favor. Remember, in the background of the Greek drama is a European economy that, despite some positive numbers lately, still seems to be sliding into a deflationary trap. Europe as a whole desperately needs to end austerity madness, and this week there have been some slightly positive signs. Notably, the European Commission has decided not to fine France and Italy for exceeding their deficit targets.\n\nLevying these fines would have been insane given market realities; France can borrow for five years at an interest rate of 0.002 percent. That\u2019s right, 0.002 percent. But we\u2019ve seen a lot of similar insanity in recent years. And you have to wonder whether the Greek story played a role in this outbreak of reasonableness.\n\nMeanwhile, the first real debtor revolt against austerity is off to a decent start, even if nobody believes it.
