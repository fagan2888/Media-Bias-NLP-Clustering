Warren / AP In this photo made with a fish-eye wide-angle lens, the massive boring machine known as Bertha that is drilling a two-mile tunnel to replace Seattle's viaduct is shown before the project began.\n\nThe great Seattle mystery has been solved: The object blocking the world\u2019s largest tunnel boring machine isn\u2019t an old steamship or locomotive or alien spaceship \u2013 it\u2019s an 8-inch-diameter steel pipe.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Transportation said Friday that the steel pipe that stopped Bertha, as the borer is nicknamed, on Dec. 6 is a 119-foot-long well casing installed in 2002 to study groundwater movement under downtown Seattle.\n\n\u201cWe need to investigate further to see if there are other factors that could have contributed to the blockage,\u201d Matt Preedy, a deputy administrator on the project, said in a statement.\n\nWhen it got stuck, big Bertha was only about 1,000 feet into a two-mile-long boring journey under Seattle for the tunnel that will replace the city\u2019s waterfront viaduct \u2013 a necessity after damage from a 2001 earthquake. The borer is 60 feet below the surface in an area that actually was above ground when the city was founded but got buried in waves of industrial growth and redevelopment.\n\nThe mystery had intrigued Seattleites, with some speculating that an old locomotive or steamship boiler might have been buried in the fill.\n\n\"It could be Jimmy Hoffa, it might be Sasquatch or it could be a flying saucer, you know,\" local historian Feliks Banel told NBC News last month, more than a little tongue in cheek.\n\nThat the real culprit is something as mundane as a steel pipe buried only in the past decade might disappoint some, but not the Transportation Department.\n\n\u201cOur focus right now is on resuming tunneling as quickly and safely as possible,\u201d Preedy said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The great Seattle mystery has been solved: The object blocking the world\u2019s largest tunnel boring machine isn\u2019t an old steamship or locomotive or alien spaceship \u2013 it\u2019s an 8-inch-diameter steel pipe.\nThe Washington", "title": "Huge tunnel borer Bertha stopped by simple steel pipe in Seattle - U.S. News", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The great Seattle mystery has been solved: The object blocking the world&rsquo;s largest tunnel boring machine isn&rsquo;t an old steamship or locomotive or alien spaceship &ndash; it&rsquo;s an 8-inch-diameter steel pipe.\nThe Washington", "title": "Huge tunnel borer Bertha stopped by simple steel pipe in Seattle", "url": "http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/04/22181165-huge-tunnel-borer-bertha-stopped-by-simple-steel-pipe-in-seattle", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/140104-bertha-hmed-6p.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22181165, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"usnews\",\"displayName\":\"U.S. News\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/m.static.newsvine.com\\/servista\\/imagesizer?file=null-null241F51EE-A064-FA2F-4165-00271F9FF35C.jpg&width=30\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/usnews.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"4952\",\"articleCount\":\"13904\",\"seedCount\":\"13056\",\"memberCount\":\"54\",\"description\":\"Stories from NBC reporters around the country.\",\"createDate\":1189092600,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464204468,\"isEnabled\":1}", "author": "U.S. News", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"US news\",\"subSection\":\"usnewsfranchise\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22181165\",\"headline\":\"Huge tunnel borer Bertha stopped by simple steel pipe in Seattle\",\"pageSource\":\"U.S. News\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"U.S. News\",\"tags\":[\"seattle\",\"tunnel\",\"bertha\",\"tunnel-boring\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "204.2.187.38", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "date": "May 25, 2016, 1:33 pm", "server": "web02", "nv": {"contentId": 22181165, "contentType": "n"}, "canonical": "http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/04/22181165-huge-tunnel-borer-bertha-stopped-by-simple-steel-pipe-in-seattle"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfce4\"", "article_summary": "The great Seattle mystery has been solved: The object blocking the world\u2019s largest tunnel boring machine isn\u2019t an old steamship or locomotive or alien spaceship \u2013 it\u2019s an 8-inch-diameter steel pipe.\nThe Washington State Department of Transportation said Friday that the steel pipe that stopped Bertha, as the borer is nicknamed, on Dec. 6 is a 119-foot-long well casing installed in 2002 to study groundwater movement under downtown Seattle.\nThat the real culprit is something as mundane as a steel pipe buried only in the past decade might disappoint some, but not the Transportation Department.\nThe mystery had intrigued Seattleites, with some speculating that an old locomotive or steamship boiler might have been buried in the fill.\nWhen it got stuck, big Bertha was only about 1,000 feet into a two-mile-long boring journey under Seattle for the tunnel that will replace the city\u2019s waterfront viaduct \u2013 a necessity after damage from a 2001 earthquake."}
