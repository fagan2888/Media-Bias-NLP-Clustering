In the process of rendering his accustomed Obama apologia, this time on immigration, Axelrod made quite the interesting revelation.\n\nI can\u2019t quite tell whether Jorge Ramos\u2019 segment lead-in (\u201cYou know, I\u2019m really interested in immigration\u2026\u201d) is unintentional comedy or genius-level trolling of conservative media, but it does lead into a salient question that Axelrod is uniquely qualified to answer, which is: who in the White House killed immigration reform despite then candidate Obama\u2019s 100-day promise?\n\nAxelrod, of course, does not directly answer the question (\u201cThe politics is what stopped it\u2026\u201d). However, Axelrod\u2019s response is fascinating for other reasons.\n\nHidden between the distractors (\u201cwe had meetings in 2009\u201d, \u201celeven Republicans\u201d) is, first, an admission that comprehensive immigration reform took a back seat to the stimulus and Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of Congress was leery about moving (on immigration) when we were also doing several other things to try and fix the economy, to pass healthcare reform\u2026wanted to defer\u2026\u201d\n\nIn plain English, \u201cla promesa\u201d (the promise) died at the hands of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid as the President watched in silence. In the process of spinning away from that inconvenient truth, Axelrod threw additional chaff by lamenting that there were simply no Republican partners to join the President on immigration reform, and that \u201cwithout them, there was no passing this bill.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t recall a lack of Republican votes impeding the passage of Obamacare. In fact, it passed without a single Republican vote and after much legislative trickery and chicanery. It is up to my pro-amnesty friends to wonder why the Democrats neglected to do the same on their behalf.\n\nHad Jorge Ramos been interested in doing some of that famous \u201cafflict the comfortable\u201d advocacy journalism he seems so proud of, then perhaps he could have refuted Axelrod\u2019s revised history with something other than a meek \u201cI see\u201d, given that there were several pro-amnesty Senate Republicans ready to roll (see Graham, Lindsey) in addition to the filibuster-proof Democratic majority, not to mention a House that Nancy Pelosi ran with an iron fist.\n\nRamos chose instead to absolve Obama, legitimize his executive half-measures (\u201c\u2026since he couldn\u2019t pass immigration reform\u2026\u201d), and lay a foundation for Axelrod to both smear Judge Hanen and impugn the legitimacy of the suit filed against the Obama administration.\n\nWhen the spin clears, David Axelrod admitted that comprehensive immigration reform was neither a priority within the 111th Congress nor the Obama White House (and the political capital of its 70-percent-plus-approval ratings). When faced with this clear admission, Jorge Ramos chose to advance the network\u2019s partisan narrative rather than follow his own journalistic code.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Obama spinmaster David Axelrod recently went on (Univision sister network) Fusion\u2019s America with Jorge Ramos and discussed immigration policy, among other things.
