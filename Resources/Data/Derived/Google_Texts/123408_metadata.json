Remember how freaked out we were just a month ago? Chris Hayes does, and he reminded viewers last night of just how crazy CNN and Fox News went with hyping Ebola panic.\n\nThis week, Dr. Craig Spencer was officially released from the hospital, and New York (along with the rest of the nation) is now Ebola-free. \u201cPublic health experts said all along,\u201d Hayes said, \u201cEbola would very likely be contained in the U.S., and, you know, that\u2019s why I think all the commentators and pundits were so calm and rational about Ebola instead of panicking or trying to score political points.\u201d\n\nAnd then Hayes proceeded to show exactly the opposite in a segment titled \u201cThe Media\u2019s Totally Rational Response to Ebola,\u201d with clips from CNN and Fox News galore. They included Megyn Kelly calling Spencer \u201cirresponsible,\u201d CNN wondering if Ebola was Obama\u2019s Katrina, several different Fox News hosts using Ebola to push border security, and Fox\u2019s Jeanine Pirro freaking the ever-loving hell out over Ebola.\n\nHayes concluded with a smattering of applause and congratulated both networks for keeping their cool.\n\nWatch the video below, via MSNBC:\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are currently zero cases of Ebola in the United States.
