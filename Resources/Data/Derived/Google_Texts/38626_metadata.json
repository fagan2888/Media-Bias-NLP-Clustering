Peter Shumlin on Wednesday dropped his plan to enact a single-payer health care system in his state \u2014 a plan that had won praise from liberals but never really got much past the framework stage.\n\n\u201cThis is not the right time\u201d for enacting single payer, Shumlin said in a statement, citing the big tax increases that would be required to pay for it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShumlin faced deep skepticism that lawmakers could agree on a way to pay for his ambitious goal and that the feds would agree to everything he needed to create the first state-based single-payer system in 2017.\n\nAnd that was all before Shumlin, a Democrat, almost lost reelection last month in one of the country\u2019s most liberal states. And it was before MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, the now notorious Obamacare consultant who also advised Vermont until his $400,000 contract was killed amid the controversy, became political poison.\n\nShumlin had missed two earlier financing deadlines but finally released his proposal. But he immediately cast it as \u201cdetrimental to Vermonters.\u201d The model called for businesses to take on a double-digit payroll tax, while individuals would face up to a 9.5 percent premium assessment. Big businesses, in particular, didn\u2019t want to pay for Shumlin\u2019s plan while maintaining their own employee health plans.\n\n\u201cThese are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the Legislature to pass,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIn my judgment, the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nAnd that was for a plan that would not be truly single payer. Large companies with self-insured plans regulated by ERISA would have been exempt. And Medicare also would have operated separately, unless the state got a waiver, which was a long shot.\n\nShumlin added that federal funds available for the transition were $150 million less than expected.\n\nHe also has a lot less political capital than before November. Shumlin, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, still hasn\u2019t even officially won his own reelection bid: The Legislature will settle the outcome of the November race in January because Shumlin failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote. He\u2019s leading his Republican challenger by just a few thousand ballots.\n\nAnd the substance of the plan isn\u2019t its only politically problematic aspect. Gruber, now infamous for his blunt assessments of the Affordable Care Act and his remarks about \u201cstupid\u201d voters, was until recently a state consultant. Days after the election, video emerged of him dismissing criticism of Vermont\u2019s plan in 2011 by asking, \u201cWas this written by my adolescent children, by any chance?\u201d State officials said they would cut off his contract.\n\nAdvocates of a single-payer plan said Shumlin should not be able to cast aside Act 48, the 2011 law that called for the creation of Green Mountain Care, without repealing it. A group planned to hold a rally in front of the statehouse on Thursday to protest his decision.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s misguided decision was a completely unnecessary result of a failed policy calculation that he pursued without Democratic input,\u201d the group Healthcare Is a Human Right Campaign said in a statement.\n\nRachana Pradhan contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It's a plan that had won praise from liberals but never really got much past the framework stage.", "title": "Vermont bails on single-payer health care", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/vermont-peter-shumlin-single-payer-health-care-113653.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/17/141217_peter_shumlin_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Vermont,Peter Shumlin,Health Care", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "It's a plan that had won praise from liberals but never really got much past the framework stage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc495\"", "article_summary": "Vermont bails on single-payer health careVermont Gov.\nPeter Shumlin on Wednesday dropped his plan to enact a single-payer health care system in his state \u2014 a plan that had won praise from liberals but never really got much past the framework stage.\nAdvocates of a single-payer plan said Shumlin should not be able to cast aside Act 48, the 2011 law that called for the creation of Green Mountain Care, without repealing it.\nBig businesses, in particular, didn\u2019t want to pay for Shumlin\u2019s plan while maintaining their own employee health plans.\nGruber, now infamous for his blunt assessments of the Affordable Care Act and his remarks about \u201cstupid\u201d voters, was until recently a state consultant."}
