Jeralean Talley has advice for the rest of the world on making it to her 115th birthday.

The oldest American just turned 115 years old this weekend, and after seeing three centuries, she has collected words of wisdom for the rest of us. After visiting the doctor on Friday, “Mother Talley,” as she’s sometimes called, told the Associated Press that she still feels healthy.

Jeralean Talley, who now resides in Inkster, Mich., was born in Montrose, Ga., in 1899 where she grew up picking cotton and peanuts. It was there in Georgia that she met her husband, Alfred Talley, in 1936 and enjoyed a 52-year marriage before he passed away.

Talley’s record-holding old age is second only to Misao Okawa, a Japanese woman whose 116th birthday just passed in March, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which keeps a record of the validated longest-living people in the world. Okawa attributed her key to living a long life as eating sushi, getting at least eight hours of sleep a night, and learning to relax.

Talley is part of an exclusive group of 300 to 450 people across the world who live to be 110 years old or older. The number of Americans that are living to the age of 100 is steadily growing. The centenarian population has grown 65.8 percent in the past 30 years, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. In the U.S., the demographics of centenarians are considerably different from the overall population.

In 2010, 82.8 percent of centenarians were female, and an up-and-coming group of 72.2 percent of women is in their nineties. They’re also less diverse, with 82.5 percent of centenarians being Caucasian and 85.7 percent of all centenarians living in urban areas.

Talley listed seven nuggets of advice to WJBK-TV Fox Detroit for people to follow in order to live a longer life.
