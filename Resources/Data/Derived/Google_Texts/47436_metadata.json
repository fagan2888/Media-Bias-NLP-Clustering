Trumka, who berates private corporations for paying executives more than entry-level workers, was paid $304,121 last year.\n\nOther Missouri expenditures in AFL-CIO\u2019s 2015 annual report included $30,000 in state legislative consulting payments to a firm run by Ryan Burke, \u201cone of the rising stars in the field of Democratic operatives\u201d according to The Missouri Times.\n\nRELATED: Missouri workers lose against labor union Goliath\n\nAFL-CIO spending reported to the U.S. Department of Labor confirms Trumka\u2019s political interests extend beyond blocking right-to-work, and they aren\u2019t restricted to any particular state.\n\nFight for Florida, a \u201cdiverse coalition of labor, faith and community organizations\u201d campaigning for minimum wage hikes and other union priorities out of the Florida AFL-CIO\u2019s Tallahassee office, received $70,006 from AFL-CIO headquarters.\n\nThe Remington Road Group \u2014 led by Aaron Pickrell, a veteran of President Obama\u2019s 2012 and 2008 campaigns \u2014 was paid a total of $120,000 by AFL-CIO headquarters for state legislative consulting in Ohio.\n\nCalifornia-based Partnership for Working Families, a network of \u201csocial justice\u201d advocacy groups, received $124,000 from AFL-CIO to help with a minimum wage hike campaign.\n\nAFL-CIO sent $30,000 to Action for the Common Good and $60,000 to Center for Popular Democracy to support minimum wage hike efforts in New York, and it paid Pennsylvania-based Lemmon Tree Consulting $35,000 for help fighting right-to-work.\n\nMany of AFL-CIO\u2019s expenditures meant to influence state policy went to consulting firms in the nation\u2019s capital, making it difficult to determine where huge swaths of the union coalition\u2019s spending were targeted.\n\nThe Pivot Group received $1.1 million from AFL-CIO for state legislative advocacy work; AFL-CIO paid Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research $505,200 and Hart Research Associates $309,000 for state issue polling.\n\nMack-Sumner Communications in Alexandria, Virginia received payments from AFL-CIO totaling $873,636 for state issue fliers.\n\nState Innovation Exchange, a \u201cprogressive\u201d effort to mirror the American Legislative Exchange Council, received $50,000 from AFL-CIO. AFL-CIO gave $210,000 to secretive leftist donor network Democracy Alliance, plus $25,000 to DA\u2019s Committee on States project.\n\nAFL-CIO paid $888,565 to NGP VAN and $564,750 to Catalist, a pair of left-wing consulting firms accused of illegal coordination with Democratic campaign committees.\n\nA total of $4.1 million in AFL-CIO political expenditures went to Working America, AFL-CIO\u2019s in-house community organizing operation. Another $3 million went to the political action committee AFL-CIO uses to distribute campaign contributions.\n\nEconomic Policy Institute, a union think tank whose board of directors is chaired by Trumka, received $125,000 from AFL-CIO last year.\n\nTerry Bowman, a United Auto Workers member and president of Union Conservatives, told Watchdog members of AFL-CIO unions in right-to-work states should seriously consider exercising their right to opt out.\n\n\u201cAFL-CIO executives see the world through a very narrow lens,\u201d Bowman said in an email. \u201cThey surround themselves with workers and politicians who sing their praises, and separate themselves from the majority of workers who disagree with their political agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpending workers\u2019 money on a far-left, progressive political agenda rewards those union officials with perks and prestige,\u201d Bowman added. \u201cThe only way to stop their gravy train is for workers to stand up and exercise their Right to Work freedoms and protections.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the $44.8 million AFL-CIO spent on political activities and lobbying last year, AFL-CIO spent $29.6 million on \u201cRepresentational Activities\u201d \u2014 of the $29.6 million, $4.5 million went to Working America.\n\nAFL-CIO headquarters did not respond to questions about the spending disclosed in the union coalition\u2019s 2015 report to the Dept. of Labor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advocates of mandatory union dues in Missouri and across the country have a deep-pocketed friend in Richard Trumka, president of labor coalition AFL-CIO.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Advocates of mandatory union dues in Missouri and across the country have a deep-pocketed friend in Richard Trumka, president of labor coalition AFL-CIO.", "title": "Union coalition AFL-CIO sinks $44 million into politics - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/10/richard-trumka-nbc-2015-09.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-08T07:33:47+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/241282/aflcio-politics-2015/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Advocates of mandatory union dues in Missouri and across the country have a deep-pocketed friend in Richard Trumka, president of labor coalition AFL-CIO.", "title": "Union coalition AFL-CIO sinks $44 million into politics - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/10/richard-trumka-nbc-2015-09.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-10-08T04:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-08T07:33:47+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "union spending, union politics, union political spending, labor union political spending, union activism, richard trumka, union conservatives, terry bowman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0c9\"", "article_summary": "While Missouri unions and their left-wing allies fought right-to-work last year, AFL-CIO sent $88,073 to the Missouri AFL-CIO, $40,000 to activist group Progress Missouri and $10,000 to union front Missouri Jobs With Justice.\nA total of $4.1 million in AFL-CIO political expenditures went to Working America, AFL-CIO\u2019s in-house community organizing operation.\nAdvocates of mandatory union dues in Missouri and across the country have a deep-pocketed friend in Richard Trumka, president of labor coalition AFL-CIO.\nThe Pivot Group received $1.1 million from AFL-CIO for state legislative advocacy work; AFL-CIO paid Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research $505,200 and Hart Research Associates $309,000 for state issue polling.\nAFL-CIO headquarters did not respond to questions about the spending disclosed in the union coalition\u2019s 2015 report to the Dept."}
