Health is much simpler. I like this rendering from a kindergarten class.\n\n\"Kindergarten teacher asked class to create rules for living healthy. Here's what they came up with\" via @rickplus3 pic.twitter.com/cRmHfcfjrf \u2014 Brad Stulberg (@BStulberg) May 9, 2015\n\nWhen I was a trainee in electrophysiology, I spent oodles of time learning the underpinnings of the heart and its rhythm. I studied molecules, then cells, and then the physics (vectors) of how it all worked together. Catheter ablation of focal circuits or implantation of pacemakers for aging pacemaker cells are the appendectomies of EP. Curative. Clean. Easy.\n\nHeart rhythm care has changed. It is much harder. The majority of my patients now suffer not from fluky imperfections, but from the sequelae of deviations from the kindergarten rules of health.\n\nIt\u2019s weird; although I am a sub-subspecialist, a techie-doctor of sorts, most of my clinic days are spent teaching kindergarten health lessons.\n\nFor fun, let\u2019s make brief comment on each of these beautiful rules:\n\n1. Eat good food \u2014 Nothing to add here.\n\n2. Exercise every day \u2014 that you eat.\n\n3. Drink water \u2014 not sugary drinks.\n\n4. Brush teeth \u2014 so you look good smiling.\n\n5. Milk \u2014 No guideline or set of rules are perfect.\n\n6. Don\u2019t watch too much TV \u2014 or Internet.\n\n7. Sleep well \u2014 It\u2019s easier if you follow the previous rule.\n\n8. Listen to the teacher \u2014 just listen more.\n\n9. Remember stuff \u2014 See the previous three rules.\n\n10. Dream \u2014 but don\u2019t forget to work some as well.\n\n11. Play with friends \u2014 Maybe modify this to: play nicely with friends.\n\n12. Talk to people \u2014 I think they mean talk with people.\n\n13. Ask people to play \u2014 I love a great group bike ride or run.\n\n14. Calm down \u2014 It\u2019s easier if you follow the above rules, especially numbers 1,2, and 7.\n\n15. Express your feelings \u2014 Abscesses heal only when they are drained. Be careful though; pus comes out under pressure.\n\n16. Make peace \u2014 and enjoy lower inflammation.\n\nI\u2019d put these rules up against any mobile sensor, blood test, DNA swab, medication, or surgical procedure.\n\nIf only there was a way to more easily hold on to the mastery of the obvious that we once had as children. Then there would surely be less AF (and PVCs) out there.\n\nJMM\n\nH/t to @rickplus3 and Brad Stulberg", "article_metadata": {"description": "Social media is awash in news about digital health.
