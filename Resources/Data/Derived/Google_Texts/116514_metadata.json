Steve Daines and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke told Montana Republicans Saturday they need to unite to win seats in 2016 while the senator and congressman work to stem President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201coverreach.\u201d\n\nAbout 150 Republicans gathered at a statewide Lincoln Reagan Dinner in Helena, celebrating the party\u2019s 2014 victories and starting to gear up for the 2016 election season.\n\nDaines won a U.S. Senate seat in November that Montana Republicans have not held in more than a century by defeating Amanda Curtis, a late substitution by the Democrats after Sen. John Walsh dropped out of the race.\n\nHe said it\u2019s his job to continue to attempt to rein in what he calls Obama\u2019s severe constitutional overreach on issues including immigration, the Affordable Care Act and his \u201cwar on energy,\u201d especially in the coal industry.\n\n\u201cOur friends across the aisle, they are moving so far left, they are leaving the tribes behind and they\u2019re leaving the unions behind,\u201d Daines, of Bozeman, said.\n\nZinke told Republicans to keep their fights inside the locker room if they want to win the governor\u2019s seat and other state positions in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe time to fight is when you\u2019re planning. When you\u2019re on the field, it\u2019s time to unite,\u201d the freshman congressman from Whitefish said. \u201cIf we continue as a party to be divided, we will not win the next presidency nor will we win the governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nZinke defeated Democrat John Lewis for Montana\u2019s lone U.S. House seat in November after Daines left to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1MBG2mB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "About 150 Republicans gathered Saturday at the statewide Lincoln Reagan Dinner in Helena", "og": {"site_name": "Great Falls Tribune", "description": "About 150 Republicans gathered Saturday at the statewide Lincoln Reagan Dinner in Helena", "title": "Daines, Zinke tell state GOP: Unite to win in 2016", "url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2015/03/14/daines-zinke-tell-state-gop-unite-win/24793185/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greatfallstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About 150 Republicans gathered Saturday at the statewide Lincoln Reagan Dinner in Helena", "creator": "@GFTribune", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ea9bcf8e9b23410a06b3e95ecbf5efe1766f678/c=0-0-414-414&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreatFalls/2015/03/15/B9316608403Z.1_20150315171727_000_GPRA7JEP5.1-0.jpg", "title": "Daines, Zinke tell state GOP: Unite to win in 2016", "site": "@GFTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=863095595", "fb": {"app_id": 137930962930704}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd95f\"", "article_summary": "Zinke told Republicans to keep their fights inside the locker room if they want to win the governor\u2019s seat and other state positions in 2016.\n\u201cOur friends across the aisle, they are moving so far left, they are leaving the tribes behind and they\u2019re leaving the unions behind,\u201d Daines, of Bozeman, said.\nDaines won a U.S. Senate seat in November that Montana Republicans have not held in more than a century by defeating Amanda Curtis, a late substitution by the Democrats after Sen.
