Business Insider wrote, \u201cLiberal Britain just got slaughtered,\u201d while the Independent lamented, \u201cElection results: Britain has become a bluer, looser and less liberal country.\u201d Note that while blue in the U.K. is the color of the \u201cconservatives,\u201d in the United States it\u2019s the color assigned to the liberal Democrat Party \u2014 and this similarity is fitting. This brings us to the Telegraph\u2019s Tim Stanley, closer to correct in his election analysis in writing:\n\nThe Lib Dems dropped from 56 seats to 8. They polled fewer votes than Ukip and, in Scotland, held only one seat against the Nationalist surge.\n\n\u2026 But the defeat of the Lib Dems should not be confused with a defeat for liberalism. On the contrary, liberalism dominates British politics and its influence is so subtly pervasive that it is quite invisible to the naked eye. It is the air that we breathe. Occasionally, we even choke on it.\n\nThe phenomenon Stanley touches on is an important one. And it isn\u2019t only relevant in Britain, but in the United States and elsewhere, too. Consider just a few examples of how yesterday\u2019s liberalism has become today\u2019s status quo. While conservatives of yore opposed Social Security, cohabitation, and non-discrimination laws that trump freedom of association, today\u2019s conservatives don\u2019t bat an eye at them. Note that the point here isn\u2019t to convince anyone of the wisdom of accepting or rejecting the above, but only that the aforementioned \u2014 once recognized as liberal change \u2014 are now accepted as seamless parts of American life.\n\nAnd so it is always and in everything. When states repeatedly voted not to officially recognize faux marriage some years ago, many considered it a great victory for \u201cconservatism.\u201d It might have been, too, depending on your definition of the term. But it\u2019s much as if put forth as a referendum is the question, \u201cShould men beat their wives?\u201d If the public votes no, should it be seen as a great victory for women\u2019s rights?\n\nOr should one see a red flag because while the question wouldn\u2019t even have been entertained a decade before, it now seems realistic to ask it?\n\nAs the recent court rulings and, more significantly, changing public opinion on faux marriage evidence, the \u201cconservative victories\u201d were very fleeting. This is because they weren\u2019t true victories but merely a momentary and defensive political reaction to a changing culture listing and being lost, a culture drifting ever \u2014 should we say, \u201cleft\u201d? Again, though, left of what?\n\nFurther explaining how \u201cliberalism\u201d is the \u201cair we breathe,\u201d Stanley also wrote:\n\nDavid Cameron, for instance, is a liberal. He has said so. In 2010, shortly after he partnered up with Nick Clegg [recently resigned leader of the Lib Dem Party] in the Downing Street rose garden, Cameron told Andrew Marr that it was not a \u201cforced marriage of convenience\u201d but a coming together of shared values. \u201cI am a liberal Conservative,\u201d he said. And, in government, the happy couple went on to legalise gay marriage, take millions of low paid people out of tax and pursue environmentalism.\n\nStanley can be viewed as either right or wrong about Cameron, within the context of our provisional terminology. He\u2019s right in the sense that, as I\u2019ve pointed out for years and articulated in 2013 thus, \u201c\u2018[C]onservatives\u2019 in Western Europe are often our liberals\u2019 ideological soul mates.\u201d Cameron would be a liberal in the United States.\n\nOnly, he\u2019s not in the United States.\n\nThe point is that \u201cliberal\u201d (left) and \u201cconservative\u201d (right) are relative terms that can only be understood contextually. A \u201cconservative\u201d in the 1950s Soviet Union was a communist, while a contemporary conservative in the United States was staunchly anti-communist. So what definition of \u201cconservative\u201d would a communist (Stalin), European statist (Cameron), and staunch anti-communist (Joe McCarthy) all conform to? The only consistent one there is: \u201cA person who favors maintenance of the status quo.\u201d\n\nThus, as the status quo changes, so does the nature of the day\u2019s conservatives.\n\nSo right or left of what? Answer: The given civilization\u2019s center, which is determined by the consensus views of the people at the time.\n\nThere is a problem with this. The Aztecs, who sacrificed thousands a year on bloody altars, had a center; so did the Spartans with their infanticide and institutionalized pederasty. Every civilization does. The relevant question is: Does that center approximate the True Center? (Yes, that\u2019s a read-on tease.)\n\nRecognizing this problem of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft,\u201d one popular attempt to define the terms in an absolute sense holds that the political spectrum should be viewed as ranging from totalitarianism on the extreme left and complete anarchy on the extreme right. And the ideal government lies somewhere in-between, perhaps three-quarters of the way right, the thinking goes. The problem, however, is that this conception is merely quantitative, not qualitative; it lacks specificity. The Roman Empire actually provided more freedom from government intrusion than Uncle Sam does, with a handful of notable exceptions (such as of freedom of speech and religion). But would we want to live in Caesar\u2019s realm?\n\nThere is a saner way to view matters. There was a time, when people still believed in Truth, in which it was understood that there are only two states of being. Not right and left.\n\nRight and wrong.\n\nThese were known as orthodoxy and heterodoxy (or, to be wholly unfashionable, \u201cheresy\u201d). That is, since civilizations\u2019 centers change with the wind, defining ourselves relative to our center \u2014 and considering such a measure significant \u2014 is folly. For the real question is: To what extent is that center centered on Truth? And if a lie is its essence, what lie is it?\n\nGiven that most Americans today are relativists and thus don\u2019t believe in Truth, such thinking is certainly alien to them. Relativists are comfortable with relative terms and concepts, such as liberalism and conservatism. People who believe \u201cMan is the measure of all things\u201d only have man\u2019s center as a reference point. But this mentality guarantees inexorable loss for \u201cconservatives\u201d and the death of civilization.\n\nWhy? Because the only consistent definition of \u201cliberal\u201d is \u201ca desire to change the status quo.\u201d Liberals are the actuators. They approach the bargaining table requesting a change, and because it\u2019s reasonable to \u201ccompromise,\u201d conservatives give them a percentage of what they want. And it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 50, 25, or only five percent. For the liberals will come back again and again, year after year, asking for more; and, getting a crumb here and a slice there will eventually have the whole loaf.\n\nIt\u2019s as if liberals are the engine and conservatives the caboose. Sometimes the engine has more or less fuel and is more or less powerful; sometimes the caboose is heavier or lighter and provides more or less resistance. But while there may be slow \u201cprogress\u201d at times and even some stops, the movement is continual and doesn\u2019t cease until the last stop, which is always the abyss. Disconnection from Truth ensures this.\n\nSo people are befuddled, and feel betrayed, when Republicans sweep Congress but then fold on ObamaCare, fail to rein in an increasingly imperial presidency, behave impotently in the face of Democrat corruption, and begin to cave on amnesty. \u201cThey\u2019re not true conservatives!\u201d is the cry. But they\u2019re actually quintessential conservatives (and politicians). They\u2019re reacting to the changing status quo, that euphemistically labeled \u201cleftward shift\u201d that is actually progress toward the abyss. As an example and much as with Britain\u2019s National Health Service \u2014 which even conservative Margaret Thatcher didn\u2019t propose eliminating \u2014 ObamaCare is already becoming our status quo. So conservatives are conserving it. Note that to \u201cconserve\u201d means to \u201cpreserve.\u201d\n\nAlso note that the Founding Fathers didn\u2019t call themselves conservatives. They are correctly known as revolutionaries. And unless we\u2019re revolutionary enough to buck the age\u2019s relativism; believe in Truth, seek it, and not bend an inch on it, we will continue conserving the mistakes of the past \u2014 and capitulating to the mistakes of the future.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "U.K., election, conservatives, Tories, Labour, liberals", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/opinion/item/20887-the-uk-election-and-the-myth-of-dying-liberalism", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/5c4d3ed5dcba1c47729f1584d567838a_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Reports on the U.K. election make it sound as if conservatism is rising there, but that depends on how one defines conservatism. by Selwyn Duke", "title": "The U.K. Election and the Myth of Dying Liberalism"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/5c4d3ed5dcba1c47729f1584d567838a_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And it isn\u2019t only relevant in Britain, but in the United States and elsewhere, too.\nThe point is that \u201cliberal\u201d (left) and \u201cconservative\u201d (right) are relative terms that can only be understood contextually.\nA \u201cconservative\u201d in the 1950s Soviet Union was a communist, while a contemporary conservative in the United States was staunchly anti-communist.\n\u201cI am a liberal Conservative,\u201d he said.\nOnly, he\u2019s not in the United States."}
