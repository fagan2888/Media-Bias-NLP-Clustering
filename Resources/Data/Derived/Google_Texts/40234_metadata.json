Calhoun was a 19th century American vice president who supported slavery and championed state\u2019s rights. Robert A. Heinlein was a 20th century American science-fiction writer who opposed racism and championed space policy. The pair aren\u2019t often mentioned together, but Breitbart\u2019s pseudonymous \u201cHamilton\u201d claims they represent two kinds of libertarianism.\n\nToday in America, we see two kinds of libertarianism, which we might call \u201cCalhounian\u201d and \u201cHeinleinian.\u201d Both kinds believe in freedom, but they are very different in their emphasis\u2014and in their politics.\n\nI have a soft spot for brash, big-picture claims (like this one) even when they are probably mostly wrong (like this one). One aspect of the essay that is spot on, however, is the assessment of the \u201celite libertarian synthesis\u201d in mainstream political culture:\n\n\n\nToday, probably 90 percent of the Republican intelligentsia in Washington DC and New York City counts itself as libertarian on economic and social issues\u2014and that matters. Why? Because it\u2019s these libertarian experts/nerds/wonks who who write the articles, talking points, TV scripts, speeches, and books that shape Republican policy and politics. If there\u2019s a wonk in every office putting policy material in front of his or her boss, then it\u2019s the wonkocracy, overall, that not only sets the agenda, but also enforces the orthodoxy of the agenda. Indeed, the libertarian influence is so large today that quite a few Democratic intellectuals are also substantially libertarian. Really? Yeah, really.\n\nOn social issues, of course, it\u2019s a slam dunk favor of the libertarians\u2014in both parities. It\u2019s hard, for example, to find a Democratic wonk who is not in favor of gay marriage, unrestricted abortion, and legalized marijuana. In other words, on the social-issue side of libertarianism, the libertarian ascendancy in both parties is complete, save for a few conservative Republican holdouts. And even on economic issues, many Democrats accept the basic idea of market forces, from free trade to spectrum auctions to the ill-fated Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s possible to see a great deal of overlap between Republican and Democratic intellectuals: They tend to have gone to the same schools, read much of the same policy literature, and share typically the same secular outlook. So yes, the respective parties, and bitter partisanship, still divide the wonk class, but there\u2019s plenty still that unites them. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why abortion, for example, is always legal, or why gay marriage and free trade are always advancing, the answer is the quiet bipartisan libertarian consensus among the elites.\n\nBe sure to read the rest of the essay. The identification of \u201cCalhounian\u201d libertarians seems to miss the mark, though I think the \u201cHeinleinian\u201d classification is mostly accurate. Is this break-down really the future of libertarianism in America, though? And where do Christian libertarians fit into the picture?", "article_metadata": {"description": "John C.
