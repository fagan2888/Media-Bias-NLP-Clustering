Two men died Tuesday in a failed attempt to smuggle migrants over the U.S.-Mexico border in San Ysidro, authorities reported.

A medical emergency was reported at the border station in southwestern San Diego County about 2:30 p.m., according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Two ailing people were found in a vehicle, and one died at the scene, San Diego Fire-Rescue Department spokesman Lee Swanson said. The other was taken to a trauma center where he was declared dead. Both were Mexican citizens.

The incident was "related to an alleged illegal entry attempt," according to Angelica De Cima of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

A driver in an orange 2012 Dodge Challenger arrived at the San Ysidro Port of Entry about 2:30 p.m., NBC San Diego reported.

A CBP officer referred the car for a more thorough investigation after an imaging system found anomalies in the car's trunk. Officers found inside two men — one 28 and the other 20 — who were not breathing.

The car's driver was held for questioning.
