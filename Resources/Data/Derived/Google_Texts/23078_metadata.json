The government as well as business lobbies had recommended that voters reject the curbs on immigration.\n\nThe minister said he expected the decision to dampen Switzerland's economic growth and on Saturday met with business leaders to discuss how the immigration vote can be implemented.\n\nHe said everybody agreed the bilateral agreements should not be put at risk and the current level of education and research had to be preserved.\n\n\"I will submit proposals to the government for Erasmus and Horizon 2020,\" Schneider-Ammann said, adding, however, that the EU was expecting a solution for the free movement of persons with Croatia.\n\nThe EU and Switzerland signed bilateral agreements in 1999, including an agreement on the free movement of persons, which came into force in 2002.\n\nThousands demonstrated in the Swiss capital of Berne on Saturday for Switzerland to remain open.\n\n(Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; editing by Jason Neely)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Switzerland's economy minister wants to save bilateral agreements with the European Union, at risk after Switzerland voted to curb immigration from the bloc three weeks ago, he told a Swiss newspaper on Sunday.", "title": "Swiss economy minister wants to save bilateral agreements with EU", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140302&t=2&i=851740472&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA2110Y100", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, SWITZERLAND, ECON, MIN", "sailthru.title": "Swiss economy minister wants to save bilateral agreements with EU", "keywords": "US,SWITZERLAND,ECON,MIN,International Trade,Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties,East European Countries,Europe,European Union,Labour / Personnel,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Chemicals (Legacy),Government / Politics,Switzerland,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,Corporate Events,General News,Western Europe,Economic Events,Elections / Voting,Central / Eastern Europe", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_GCA-Economy2010": "USBREA210BE20140302", "news_keywords": "US;SWITZERLAND;ECON;MIN;International Trade;Fundamental Rights / Civil Liberties;East European Countries;Europe;European Union;Labour / Personnel;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Chemicals (Legacy);Government / Politics;Switzerland;Asylum / Immigration / Refugees;Corporate Events;General News;Western Europe;Economic Events;Elections / Voting;Central / Eastern Europe", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
