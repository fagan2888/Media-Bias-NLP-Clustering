(Dan Coyro -- Santa Cruz Sentinel)\n\nAUGMEDIX What: Health care technology company provides a way to more efficiently document patient records in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Founded in: 2012. Location: San Francisco. Co-founders: Ian Shakil and Pelu Tran. FastCompany recognition: Most innovative health care company of 2016. Employees: 700. Funding: $23 million in venture funding.\n\nSANTA CRUZ >> Doctors working in urgent care at Palo Alto Medical Foundation are using technology from a San Francisco startup with Google Glass to cut back on time spent record keeping and focus more on patients.\n\nAugmedix, co-founded in 2012 by millennial entrepreneurs Ian Shakil and Pelu Tran out of Stanford University, streams audio and visual information to a medical scribe in India or San Francisco who updates the patient\u2019s electronic medical record, a necessity in today\u2019s Affordable Care Act era.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a scribe in the room with you,\u201d said Dr. Terri Nauenberg, division head for primary care at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in Palo Alto, part of Sutter Health.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t sold on the idea at first.\n\n\u201cI was terrified,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut patients were grateful.\u201d\n\nNauenberg used to spend a third of her day at the computer, turning away from patients to type and update records, but no more.\n\nSutter Health is among the first six adopters of the technology, according to company officials, and is ahead of others in terms of the number of doctors involved.\n\nThe technology allows doctors to view the patient\u2019s entire medical record and patients can log in to read the notes.\n\nLast week, Nauenberg shared results from an 18-month pilot project involving 10 Palo Alto physicians: Notes completed in less than five minutes 84 percent of the time, doctor productivity up 15 percent and patient acceptance of 96 percent.\n\nTypically the same scribe is matched with the same doctor, and Nauenberg noted patients preferred the technology over a scribe in the room.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception if you\u2019re not making eye contact, you\u2019re not paying attention,\u201d said Trish Burgin, urgent care clinical manager for Palo Alto Medical Foundation in Santa Cruz.\n\n\u201cPatients like it,\u201d said Debbie Smallwood, a physician assistant in Santa Cruz, reporting only three patients turned down the technology.\n\nShe can print out a summary for patients after the visit and now has time to respond to patients throughout the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have all that discussion documented, especially with complicated patients,\u201d said Dr. Cynthia Hill, an urgent care physician in Santa Cruz, after three days of wearing Google Glass with Augmedix.\n\nHer scribe, Devendra Kumar in Delhi, told her, \u201cWe are trained medical transcriptionists working 15 years\u201d and \u201cwe have our own workspaces, we work independently.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTran, 27, who has three months left to complete his medical degree, contends Augmedix can enable a doctor to see one to one-and-a-half more patients per day.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant benefit when physicians are in short supply.\n\nIndeed, multiple openings are available for doctors in emergency or family medicine to join the Palo Alto Medical Foundation\u2019s Urgent Care department in Santa Cruz.\n\nThe new technology has not been all smooth sailing.\n\nThere have been some IT drops where upgrades are needed but Nauenberg envisions a day when primary care doctors can make referrals to the \u201cdermatologist of the day\u201d or a gastroenterologist via technology without the help of a receptionist or a medical assistant.\n\nAugmedix, which has attracted $23 million in venture funding and grown to 700 employees, was named by FastCompany.com as the most innovative health care company of 2016.\n\nAUGMEDIX\n\nWhat: Health care technology company provides a way to more efficiently document patient records in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
