Moreover, its former CEO is in prison for bribery, and CalPERS recently admitted that the pension plan was only 52 percent funded\u2013the worst of any state in the nation.\n\nDespite all of this sordid drama, liberals claim that the State of California, as the world\u2019s largest pension fund manager will enjoy access to better investment deals and will produce higher returns than individuals can find. The latest investment report by CalPERS for the year ending June 30, 2015, shows a return of only 2.4 percent. That performance was far below the CalPERS target return of 7.5 percent.\n\nSecure Choice claims the \u201cAutomatic IRA\u201d is not mandatory, because there is an opt-out clause. But poor employees that need money the most are probably not sophisticated enough to understand how to fill out the paperwork to opt out. Their employers will not want to give any instructions, for fear of being sued for giving investment advice.\n\nSecure Choice will offer two investment choices. One plan option has no protection against investment losses; the other option will supposedly create a reserve from good annual performances to cushion losses in bad years.\n\nLiberals are spinning Secure Choice as an opportunity for workers to have a more secure future. But that is the same argument liberals made for Covered California. With healthcare premiums spiking much faster than inflation and co-pays jumping, every Californian with insurance knows California\u2019s Obamacare initiative has hurt workers.\n\nWhat few taxpayers understand is that Covered California would have caused healthcare rates to spike even higher, except that the state in 2013 received $1.06 billion in federal dollars to subsidize the program\u2019s administrative costs. But due to massive cost overruns, that money is already gone, and healthcare premiums are expected to spike even higher next year.\n\nThe question on taxpayers\u2019 minds regarding Secure Choice should be: what happens if the stock market tanks or the state\u2019s supposedly sophisticated money managers make investments that are big losers? Lawsuits will start flying, and then the liberal California legislature will undoubtedly want to bail out their liberal friends running Secure Choice.\n\nAfter 2.5 years of spending money in planning, the Secure Choice board sent it investment proposal to the liberal-dominated California legislature last week. The \u201cAutomatic IRA\u201d is plan is expected to get final approval at a March 23 meeting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state legislature\u2019s liberal Democrats are poised to launch \"Secure Choice\" in an effort to take over Californian\u2019s individual retirement accounts (IRAs).", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The state legislature\u2019s liberal Democrats are poised to launch \"Secure Choice\" in an effort to take over Californian\u2019s individual retirement accounts (IRAs).", "title": "California Liberals Want Your IRA-Automatically - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3759, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Capitol-Dome.jpg", "height": 2820}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/20/california-liberals-want-your-ira-automatically/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state legislature\u2019s liberal Democrats are poised to launch \"Secure Choice\" in an effort to take over Californian\u2019s individual retirement accounts (IRAs).", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Capitol-Dome.jpg", "title": "California Liberals Want Your IRA-Automatically - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "California bail-out, California liberals, Covered California, IRA, SB 1234, Secure Choice,Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics,IRAs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Secure Choice", "published_time": "2016-01-20T10:52:07-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "With little fanfare, Sacramento passed the \u201cCalifornia Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program\u201d in 2012 to provide an \u201cAutomatic IRA\u201d deduction out of the paycheck of every California worker in a company with 5 or more employees.\nLawsuits will start flying, and then the liberal California legislature will undoubtedly want to bail out their liberal friends running Secure Choice.\nLiberals are spinning Secure Choice as an opportunity for workers to have a more secure future.\nAfter 2.5 years of spending money in planning, the Secure Choice board sent it investment proposal to the liberal-dominated California legislature last week.\nSecure Choice claims the \u201cAutomatic IRA\u201d is not mandatory, because there is an opt-out clause."}
