The pastime attracts sporting fishermen from around the world, part of a renowned saltwater recreational fishing industry that adds $2 billion to the Texas economy each year.\n\nSo the mere suggestion of new restrictions being placed on the saltwater fish has generated heated discussion along the coast \u2014 with some claiming that small-time fishermen will be pushed out to make way for richer anglers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big emotional deal,\u201d said Andrew Sansom, who led the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department from 1990 to 2001 and is now executive director of the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University. (The Texas State University System is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)\n\nFlounder and spotted trout have been the subject of strict regulation for 30 years, when their decimated populations prompted state officials to all but ban their commercial harvest. Only a few dozen commercial licenses to fish flounder exist today.\n\nLast week, officials with the Parks and Wildlife Department discussed the possibility of imposing additional restrictions on the two fish, which are among the most sought after in Texas. In November, during flounders\u2019 spawning season, fishermen can catch only two fish per day. The department is considering lengthening that period of such a low \u201cbag limit,\u201d or maximum allowable catch. In addition, the bag limit for spotted trout may be reduced to 5 from 10 year-round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about what we call helping the bag distribution, trying to get people to be able to harvest more fish,\u201d a statistician for the department, Jeremy Leitz, said.\n\nHe said that when it came to trout, \u201cnot many people catch the current bag limit at 10.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to show that changing these bag limits has increased the pleasure, has increased the numbers, increased anything,\u201d said Johnny Valentino, whose family manages a fishing camp on Galveston Bay that is popular with saltwater trout anglers. \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2018trophy trout\u2019 fishing,\u201d he added, referring to putting sport fishermen who want to catch the biggest fish ahead of anglers who just want to enjoy the sport and put some fresh food on the table.\n\nStrong opposition to new regulations has been voiced from around Galveston Bay.\n\nThat is understandable, given that the bay is one of the most successful spots for landing trout, said Everett Johnson, a retired fishing guide who is now the editor and publisher of the Texas Saltwater Fishing Magazine.\n\n\u201cThey have substantially more freshwater inflow by virtue of their geography,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of Galveston Bay. \u201cTrout do better in fresher water,\u201d so anglers there are the most likely to see no need for limiting an already-stellar catch.\n\nBut Galveston Bay might also represent a culture of fishing that has been slowly disappearing \u2014 the angler who fishes for food, Mr. Sansom said. Putting limits on their catch \u201cis a cultural assault.\u201d\n\nMr. Sansom agrees that such anglers would be hurt by additional regulation. But the threat to saltwater fish in Texas from severe weather and increasingly advanced and better fishing techniques is real, he said, and regulators should not wait until it is too late to protect them.\n\n\u201cRemember that all of these animals have to live in an environment that sustains them,\u201d Mr. Sansom said. \u201cYou can\u2019t affect the climate, and the state hasn\u2019t been very forthcoming in setting rigorous inflow standards\u201d for freshwater, so lowering the bag limit is \u201cwhat you\u2019re left with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime":
