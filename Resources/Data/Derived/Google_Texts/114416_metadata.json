There were also nine alcohol-related fatalities during that same period, according to preliminary reports.\n\nThis is compared to 1,508 arrests and 13 alcohol-related fatalities reported during the 2012 Labor Day Heat is On campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are probably plenty of factors that played a role in the reduced numbers,\u201d Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman Emily Wilfong said. \u201cBut we\u2019d like to think this new approach we took this year may have played a role.\u201d\n\nThat included a change in the state\u2019s message about drunk driving. A new tag line \u2014 \u201cDrink and Don\u2019t Drive\u201d \u2014 was used to emphasize the reality that people will drink but that they should use a designated driver, a cab or mass transit to get them safely home.\n\nA mobile \u201cDrink and Don\u2019t Drive\u201d billboard traveled around Denver and Fort Collins, hitting hot spots such as the Rocky Mountain Showdown in Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Colorado Rocky games and the Tour de Fat in Fort Collins.\n\nThe campaign also used an especially unique outreach tool: talking urinal cakes that play a 15-second audio message encouraging male bar patrons to avoid driving while impaired.\n\n\u201cWe hope people heard this new message and responded to it,\u201d said Wilfong.\n\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/montewhaley", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CDOT credits talking urinal cakes for drop in DUI deaths over Labor Day", "title": "CDOT credits talking urinal cakes for drop in DUI deaths over Labor Day", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/09/cdot-credits-talking-urinal-cakes-for-drop-in-dui-deaths-over-labor-day/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130825__20130826_A4_CD26DRUNKDRIVINGp1.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130825__20130826_A4_CD26DRUNKDRIVINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-09T12:09:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T18:52:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fff\"", "article_summary": "This is compared to 1,508 arrests and 13 alcohol-related fatalities reported during the 2012 Labor Day Heat is On campaign.\nA new twist on the old \u201cHeat is On\u201d campaign may have put a dent in drunk-driving related incidents and deaths over the Labor Day holiday.\nLaw enforcement agencies in Colorado and the Colorado State Patrol say 1,342 people were arrested for driving under the influence during the Aug. 16-Sept. 3 Labor Day enforcement period.\nThe campaign also used an especially unique outreach tool: talking urinal cakes that play a 15-second audio message encouraging male bar patrons to avoid driving while impaired.\n\u201cThere are probably plenty of factors that played a role in the reduced numbers,\u201d Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman Emily Wilfong said."}
