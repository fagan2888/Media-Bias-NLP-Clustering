On Friday’s episode of “The Kelly File,” Megyn Kelly battled Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of Obamacare, over the horrific rollout of the health care law. One of the most contentious topics of debate was whether Obama’s many assurances were “intentionally misleading or grossly mistaken.”

When Emanuel argued that it’s not Obamacare’s fault that people’s insurance companies are canceling their current health care plans, Kelly reminded him that the problem was “foreseeable” and people warned about the effect’s Obamacare would have on the individual insurance market.

Kelly also reminded Emanuel that she has had people on her show that say they liked their health care plan, but were forced onto a new plan thanks to Obamacare.

Emanuel countered by saying the plans with “minimum floor” coverage are better now and millions of uninsured people will now be covered under Obamacare.

When Kelly raised the potential problems facing Obamacare, like young people not signing up and the “huge swelling of the Medicaid rolls,” Emanuel deflected and called the numbers “totally irrelevant.”

“You have no idea whether you’re on track or not,” he hollered.

“Kathleen Sebelius won’t tell me!” Kelly replied.
