A vigil held Saturday honored a Navajo woman who was fatally shot by a Winslow police officer.

Authorities say the officer fired at Loreal Tsingine five times on March 27, killing her after she threatened the officer with scissors. Police had been responding to a report of shoplifting at a Winslow convenience store.

The officer responded by shooting Tsingine on a sidewalk a couple of blocks from the store, said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Raul Garcia.

Organizers of Saturday's event said the shooting was unjust.

They also wanted to draw attention to the struggles of American Indians in towns that border the Navajo Nation. A community-based organization known as "Red Nation" organized Saturday's event.

"We want to know how many times she was shot and why he shot her so many times?" said Floranda Dempsey, an aunt of Tsingine. "We want justice."

The Arizona Department of Public Safety is investigating Tsingine's death. Authorities have not released the officer's name but have said he's worked for Winslow police for three years.

Winslow borders the Navajo Nation about an hour east of Flagstaff and has a large American Indian population. The city was immortalized in pop culture by the 1972 by the Eagles' song, "Take it Easy," with the lyrics: "Standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona."
