Laconia firefighters-paramedics have increasingly had to use the opioid antagonist Narcan, naloxone hydrochloride, in recent weeks to deal with a surge of overdoses related to heroin and fentanyl in the City on the Lakes.





LACONIA - The City on the Lakes enters 2015 with 10 opiate-related deaths in 2014 and with municipal paramedics increasingly proficient at administering ever-larger amounts of the overdose reversal drug, Narcan...Designed to reverse the effects of an overdose if delivered in time, Narcan in the past year has been hailed by emergency responders everywhere as a wonder drug in the ongoing battle against heroin overdose deaths...Crackdowns since 2007 on prescription drugs such as Oxycontin and methadone - which, ironically, is an accepted treatment for heroin addiction - have led drug users to heroin.And suppliers have answered the call...The potency of some heroin now available is being boosted by the addition of the painkiller fentanyl, with fatal consequences.Dr. Thomas Andrew, the state's chief medical examiner, recently told the Laconia Citizen newspaper that in 2014, fentanyl claimed more lives than heroin in New Hampshire and that the two drugs combined would take even more...If not for Narcan, said Laconia police Chief Chris Adams, "we would have had 20" overdose deaths last year in the city, not just the 10, most of which involved a mix of heroin and fentanyl.Heroin is an epidemic, said Laconia Fire Chief Ken Erickson, adding "I don't think there's any simpler way to put it. We've had over 40 suspected heroin overdoses this year and our Narcan rate for 2014 was almost twice what it was last year when we did 21."..In several instances, the Narcan has revived individuals who were clinically dead, said Erickson.As the opiates have gotten more potent, his department's paramedics have had to administer stronger doses of Narcan, he said..."What we found so far," Erickson said, "is that the dose of the Narcan has to be increased almost 300 percent to counteract" the overdose induced by the fentanyl, which, when they first encountered it, LFD paramedics assumed was just a higher-strength heroin..."When it was first becoming a problem, the firefighter-paramedics thought somebody must have taken some type of powerful heroin because a two milligram dose had no effect and so they gave a second dose but in the last few weeks it seems that the Narcan rate has to be tripled to counteract what is almost straight fentanyl."..Despite its seemingly wondrous properties, Narcan - which can be administered as a nasal spray if the patient is breathing, intravenously, or, using a drill, injected directly into a bone, as Laconia paramedics have had to do when they can't find a vein - is not a cure for abuse, said Erickson...Making Narcan available to the public isn't a solution to opioid addiction, Erickson said, and, in fact, "I don't see an easy solution. There are a tremendous number of people who are addicted to drugs, and if they don't want to give up the drug, this problem isn't going to go away."..Addicts know that there's killer heroin, possibly mixed with fentanyl, being sold in Laconia and throughout the Lakes Region, "yet they still keep taking it," said Erickson.After eight methadone overdose deaths in 2007, city leaders in Laconia launched the "Eight is Enough" initiative that included a public education campaign, a fundamental change in how the Laconia Police Department treated untimely deaths and increased prosecution of drug dealers...Rather than waiting weeks for toxicology results, Laconia police began treating all untimely deaths as potential crimes, gathering evidence at the scene that the Belknap County Attorney has used to bring charges against people who supply the lethal drugs...Laconia City Councilor Brenda Baer said she and her colleagues are deeply concerned about drug abuse and overdoses.The chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee and the council's liaison to the Laconia Police Commission, Baer on Friday said she and her colleagues have allocated more money to local police to address the city's drug problem...Laconia has two police officers serving on the New Hampshire Drug Task Force and is allocating half of another officer's time to focus on what's happening in the city."It is a priority with the city council as it is with the police commission," said Baer, adding that drug abuse here, like throughout the state, is pervasive and, at present, is confronting the community with more questions than answers...jkoziol@newstote.com..
