The PATH Act also enhances certain breaks and puts a moratorium on some of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA\u2019s) controversial taxes.\n\nSeveral provisions in particular may produce significant tax savings for businesses in 2015 and beyond.\n\nSection 179 Expensing Election\n\nSec. 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) allows businesses to elect to immediately deduct \u2014 or \u201cexpense\u201d \u2014 the cost of certain tangible personal property acquired and placed in service during the tax year, instead of recovering the costs more slowly through depreciation deductions. However, the election can only offset net income; it can\u2019t reduce it below $0 to create a net operating loss.\n\nThe election is also subject to annual dollar limits. For 2014, businesses could expense up to $500,000 in qualified new or used assets, subject to a dollar-for-dollar phase-out once the cost of all qualifying property placed in service during the tax year exceeded $2 million.\n\nWithout the PATH Act, the expensing limit and the phase-out amounts for 2015 would have sunk to $25,000 and $200,000, respectively.\n\nThe new law makes the 2014 limits permanent, indexing them for inflation beginning in 2016. It also makes permanent the ability to apply Sec. 179 expensing to qualified real property, reviving the 2014 limit of $250,000 on such property for 2015 but raising it to the full Sec. 179 limit beginning in 2016. Qualified real property includes qualified leasehold-improvement, restaurant and retail-improvement property.\n\nFinally, the new law permanently includes off-the-shelf computer software on the list of qualified property. And, beginning in 2016, it adds air conditioning and heating units to the list.\n\nIf your business is eligible for full Sec. 179 expensing, you might obtain a greater benefit from it than from bonus depreciation (discussed below) because the expensing provision can allow you to deduct 100 percent of an asset acquisition\u2019s cost. Moreover, you can use Sec. 179 expensing for both new and used property.\n\nBonus Depreciation\n\nThe news is mixed on bonus depreciation, which allows businesses to recover the costs of depreciable property more quickly by claiming bonus first-year depreciation for qualified assets. It\u2019s been extended, but only through 2019 and with declining benefits in the later years. For property placed in service during 2015, 2016 and 2017, the bonus depreciation percentage is 50%. It drops to 40% for 2018 and 30% for 2019.\n\nThe provision continues to allow businesses to claim unused AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation. Beginning in 2016, the amount of unused AMT credits that may be claimed increases.\n\nQualified assets include new tangible property with a recovery period of 20 years or less (such as office furniture and equipment), off-the-shelf computer software, water utility property and qualified leasehold-improvement property. Beginning in 2016, qualified improvement property doesn\u2019t have to be leased to be eligible for bonus depreciation.\n\nNote that, if you qualify for Sec. 179 expensing, it could provide a greater tax benefit than bonus depreciation. (See above.) But bonus depreciation could benefit more taxpayers than Sec. 179 expensing, because it isn\u2019t subject to any asset purchase limit or net income requirement.\n\nAccelerated Depreciation of Certain Qualified Real Property\n\nThe PATH Act permanently extends the 15-year straight-line cost recovery period for qualified leasehold improvements (alterations in a building to suit the needs of a particular tenant), qualified restaurant property and qualified retail-improvement property. The provision exempts these expenditures from the normal 39-year depreciation period.\n\nThis is especially welcome news for restaurants and retailers, which typically remodel every five to seven years. If eligible, they may first apply Sec. 179 expensing and then enjoy this accelerated depreciation on qualified expenses in excess of the applicable Sec. 179 limit.\n\nResearch & Development Tax Credits\n\nThe research credit (commonly referred to as the \u201cresearch and development\u201d or \u201cresearch and experimentation\u201d credit) provides an incentive for businesses to increase their investments in research. But businesses have long complained that the annual threat of extinction to the credit deterred them from pursuing critical research into new products and technologies.\n\nThe PATH Act permanently extends the credit. Additionally, beginning in 2016, businesses with $50 million or less in gross receipts can claim the credit against alternative minimum tax (AMT) liability, and certain start-ups (in general, those with less than $5 million in gross receipts) that haven\u2019t yet incurred any income tax liability can use the credit against their payroll tax.\n\nWork Opportunity Credit\n\nThe Work Opportunity credit for employers that hire individuals who are members of a \u201ctarget group\u201d has been extended through 2019. The PATH Act also expands the credit beginning in 2016 to apply to employers that hire qualified individuals who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more.\n\nThe amount of the tax credit depends on the target group of the individual hired, the wages paid to that individual and the number of hours that individual worked during the first year of employment. The maximum tax credit that can be earned for each member of a target group is generally $2,400 per adult employee. The credit can be as high as $9,600 per qualified veteran. Employers aren\u2019t subject to a limit on the number of eligible individuals they can hire. In other words, if there are 10 individuals that qualify, the credit can be 10 times the amount listed.\n\nBear in mind that you must obtain certification that an employee is a member of a target group from the appropriate State Workforce Agency before you can claim the credit. The certification must be requested within 28 days after the employee begins work.\n\nFor 2015, the IRS may extend the deadline as it did for 2014, when legislation reviving the Work Opportunity credit for that year wasn\u2019t passed until late in the year \u2014 meaning that the 28-day period had already expired for many of the covered employees hired in 2014.\n\nPlan Ahead\n\nThe PATH Act\u2019s temporary and permanent extensions of numerous valuable tax breaks for businesses provide significant tax planning opportunities. We\u2019ve only touched on some of the most popular here; the new law may include other extensions and enhancements that can benefit your business. Consult with your tax advisor about how these tax changes may affect you in the future.\n\n\ufffd", "article_metadata": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "The maximum tax credit that can be earned for each member of a target group is generally $2,400 per adult employee.\nPlan AheadThe PATH Act\u2019s temporary and permanent extensions of numerous valuable tax breaks for businesses provide significant tax planning opportunities.\nFinally, the new law permanently includes off-the-shelf computer software on the list of qualified property.\n179 expensing, because it isn\u2019t subject to any asset purchase limit or net income requirement.\nIt makes many popular tax breaks \u2014 including some highly valued by businesses \u2014 permanent, while extending others through 2016 or 2019."}
