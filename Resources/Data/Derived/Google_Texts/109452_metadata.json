If the Bible recounts an action without tacking on moralistic criticism, does that signal divine endorsement, or only recording of facts that may be problematic?\n\nMormons are correct that there was \u201cpolygyny\u201d (one husband, multiple wives) in the Old Testament, though not the \u201cpolyandry\u201d (one wife, multiple husbands) that Smith also practiced. LDS Scripture disagrees with the Bible by listing Isaac as polygamous. As for others the church cites: Abraham married both Sarah and Keturah, though the latter perhaps after Sarah died, with Sarah\u2019s urging took servant Hagar as a concubine to produce offspring, and had other concubines. Jacob married two sisters, Leah and Rachel, because of their father\u2019s trickery, and each sister later gave Jacob servant girls as wives to produce more offspring. Moses had two wives. Polygamy was often associated with the ruling class, as with Kings David and Solomon. The latter overdid it with 700 wives and 300 cocubines (1 Kings 11:3), ignoring God\u2019s rule that the king \u201cshall not multiply wives for himself\u201d (Deuteronomy 17:17).\n\nThe traditional Jewish and Christian belief is that the biblical God established monogamy as the ideal (Genesis 2:18-25). Though Old Testament law permitted polygamy, the Bible often linked it with evil, envy, family strife, and spiritual and moral decline. Lamech, the first polygamist, was the symbol of brutality. Moses\u2019 second marriage stirred opposition to his leadership. Solomon\u2019s harem \u201cturned away his heart after other gods.\u201d And so forth. The later biblical prophets embraced monogamy to symbolize union with God. Mainstream Christianity from its earliest days required monogamy due to Jesus\u2019 scriptural teaching (Matthew 19:5, Mark 10:7-8, Luke 16:28).\n\nIn LDS history, polygamy was a major cause of persecution, including Smith\u2019s own assassination in 1844. Church authorities openly proclaimed their formerly hidden practice in 1852 but then abolished it in the 1890 \u201cManifesto\u201d following fierce U.S. government and culture pressures (though the polygamy command remains in the LDS Scriptures and the faith\u2019s theology of heaven).\n\nContinue reading \"What does the Bible teach about polygamy?\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE RELIGION GUY:\r\n\r\nNobody has yet posted a question about The Church of Jesus Christ of \r\nLatter-day Saints (a.k.a. \u201cMormon\u201d or \u201cLDS\u201d) acknowledging delicate details \r\nabout founding Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s polygamy, but The Guy decided he \r\nought to examine the classic\u00a0matter of how the Bible views polygamy.\r\n\r\nSmith declared that God was simply using him to restore \u201cplural marriage\u201d \r\n(the church prefers that term to \u201cpolygamy\u201d) that was divinely inspired in \r\nthe Old Testament.
