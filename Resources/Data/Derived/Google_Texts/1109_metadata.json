Studies have shown that what patients really want most from healthcare providers is a sense of connection and simple requests, such as uninterrupted sleep and for personnel to look them in the eye when they speak to them.\n\n\"From pre-admission to post discharge, each patient interaction with an employee or physician creates a lasting impression about the hospital,\" wrote R.J. Salus, director of patient experience at California's El Camino Hospital. \"These opinions inform future decisions about where to seek care and recommendations to others.\" Additionally, Salus said, hospitals that provide excellent customer experiences are also the best work environments, resulting in low employee turnover and increased institutional efficiency.\n\nEl Camino Hospital has improved patient engagement and care by building a patient-centered communication system. The hospital uses mobile technology during leadership rounds, implemented a tool that allows real-time patient feedback and conducts rounds with hospital staff. The organization also tracks issues referred to departments to ensure they are quickly resolved.\n\n\"Our patients think of El Camino Hospital as a member of their community--a hospital where they have access to the best possible care, delivered in the most personal way possible,\" Salus wrote.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe patient experience: 3 ways to increase satisfaction\n\nWhat patients really want from hospitals\n\nCultural competency, communication key to better HCAHPS scores\n\n4 Fierce patient experience videos\n\nThe link between compassionate care and patient satisfaction", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals that make an effort to improve the\u00a0patient experience\u00a0actually enhance performance across all departments and the goodwill and reputation in their communities.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals that make an effort to improve the\u00a0patient experience\u00a0actually enhance performance across all departments and the goodwill and reputation in their communities.", "title": "Patient experience efforts pay off with long-lasting relationships", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patient-experience-efforts-pay-long-lasting-relationships/2015-12-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "bottom line,care quality,El Camino Hospital,Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Experience,patient satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:The patient experience: 3 ways to increase satisfactionWhat patients really want from hospitalsCultural competency, communication key to better HCAHPS scores4 Fierce patient experience videosThe link between compassionate care and patient satisfaction\n\"From pre-admission to post discharge, each patient interaction with an employee or physician creates a lasting impression about the hospital,\" wrote R.J.
