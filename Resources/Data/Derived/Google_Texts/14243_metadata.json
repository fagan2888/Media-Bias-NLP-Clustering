John Kasich (R) in the state's gubernatorial primary, only a week after he had seemed ready to run.\n\nIn a release, Stevenot noted that his decision was not based on concerns about his running mate, Brenda Mack:\n\nAfter much personal thought, as well as in depth discussions with family, friends, and advisors, I have made the decision to withdraw my candidacy for governor. I do this reluctantly, because I know that part of what has gone wrong with our political process is that the two major parties have made it exceedingly difficult for a common person to run for office.\n\nThe executive director of the Portage County Tea Party, Tom Zawistowski, told The Associated Press that heavy media attention may have been a contributing factor in Stevenot's decision to drop out of the race.\n\n\"I just don't think a lot of people in our movement have experience with the media, and it's a little overwhelming for them,\" Zawistowski said.\n\nKasich may have invited a primary challenger from the right when he bypassed the state's Republican-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act for low-income Ohioans.\n\nJust prior to Stevenot's tenure as head of the Ohio Liberty Coalition, the group posted a photo on Facebook comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.\n\nTea party activists have until Feb. 5 to offer an alternative to Kasich in May's primary election.\n\n\n\nRelated on HuffPost: Tea Party Casualties Tea Party Casualties\n\n1 of 7 Mike Castle Tea Party insurgent Christine O'Donnell defeated GOP establishment candidate Mike Castle in Delaware's Republican Senate primary in 2010.
