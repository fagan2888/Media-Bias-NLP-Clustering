Young, study co-author and executive director of the UC Institute for Prediction Technology, said in a press release. \"There has been little research studying transgender communities, because they can be very closed communities who fear stigmatization. Our Institute has studied how to use 'social big data' to address public health needs and we wanted to apply this work to address the needs of transgender communities and researchers.\"\n\nYoung and his team collected 1,135 tweets using relevant hashtags, like #trans and #girlslikeus. The latter was created by Janet Mock, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cSo POPULAR!\u201d and author of Redefining Realness, for all trans women to have \u201can encouraging space, for debate, for love, for hope, for struggles\u2026to be frivolous, to talk about transition, to talk about genitals if they want, to ask after the types of procedures people had.\u201d This space was partly motivated by the response to Mock\u2019s coming out, published in Marie Claire, about her own transition.\n\nThe tweets the present study examined touched on issues, such as violence, discrimination, suicide, and sexual risk \u2014 and they were ultimately divided among four \u201ccategories of conversation\u201d having to do with positive and negative sentiments in a social and personal context, respectively.\n\nThe results showed nearly 55 percent of tweets were about positive social issues, such as Laverne Cox\u2019s Emmy nomination for the Netflix original series Orange is the New Black, while 26 were about negative social issues, including police mistreatment and ignorance. As for personal context, 11 percent of tweets had to do with pride, self-affirmation, and about two percent were negative, touching on suicide, depression, and eating disorders.\n\n\"These tweets provide real-time information that researchers can use to understand transgender individuals' health and well-being,\" explained Evan Krueger, study co-author and doctoral student in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. \"In addition, these findings provide evidence that free technologies, such as social media, can be used as secondary sources of information on understudied populations.\"\n\nWhile the study has limitations \u2014 tweets aren\u2019t controlled and often anonymous due to stigma \u2014 it stands to reason it could be used to better understand transgender people, preventing disease and predicting important trends in the process.\n\nSource: Young S.D., et al.
