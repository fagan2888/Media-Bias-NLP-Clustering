View Archive\n\nThis argument has strengths and weaknesses, but surely its most audacious suggestion is that the court should give legal weight to Hobby Lobby\u2019s religiously motivated \u201cdesire\u201d to provide employees with health insurance \u2014 even though the health-care law guarantees that workers could still get coverage, through the health-care exchanges, if Hobby Lobby declined to provide it.\n\nSounds to me like Hobby Lobby\u2019s religion requires the company \u2014 and only the company \u2014 to look out for its employees\u2019 health needs. That sure is a highly specific religious duty.\n\nNo doubt Hobby Lobby provides this insurance out of a sincere intent to fulfill that duty. But I\u2019ll bet the federal tax exemption for employer-paid health insurance plays a role, too.\n\n1 of 42 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles on health care View Photos A collection of cartoons on the debate.

The real question is: Why do we have to worry about thorny issues like this in the first place? We wouldn\u2019t have to if nearly 150 million Americans weren\u2019t covered through employer-paid health insurance.\n\nPotential crises of corporate religious conscience are just the latest pitfall of the employer-based system, whose accidental origins lie in World War II wage controls that encouraged companies to compensate employees with health care and other \u201cfringe benefits\u201d instead of cash.\n\nWorkers risk losing benefits when they switch employers; the resulting \u201cjob lock\u201d reduces labor-market flexibility. And the tax exemption encourages overconsumption of health care, which drives up costs for everyone.\n\nOn the surface, Obamacare reinforces the system through such devices as the insurance mandate for large employers such as Hobby Lobby. But in other ways, the 2010 law undermines it, such as by imposing an excise tax that offsets some of the tax subsidy for employer-paid benefits and by creating the exchanges as an alternative source of coverage.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, a former top health-care adviser to President Obama, predicts in a new book that Obamacare\u2019s incentives will cause large employers to cease offering health insurance; Emanuel thinks fewer than 20 percent of private-sector workers will still be getting it in 2025, down from nearly 60 percent now.\n\nFrom Emanuel\u2019s lips to God\u2019s ears. Of all the reasons to cheer the reported fulfillment of the administration\u2019s 7 million sign-up quota for the exchanges, one of the best is the prospect that this country might develop a robust individual health-insurance market \u2014 ending \u201cjob lock\u201d for millions.\n\nIf Republicans were thinking straight, they\u2019d be cheering, too. Yes, Obamacare is still very much a work in progress and could flop in a thousand different ways \u2014 including from the failure of many enrollees to actually make their insurance payments, as the GOP predicts.\n\nNevertheless, exchanges, or something like them, would be at the heart of any market-oriented Republican alternative. Indeed, then-GOP presidential nominee John McCain proposed in 2008 to eliminate the tax exemption for employer-paid benefits and use the savings to subsidize an individual market \u2014 albeit with a different and, Democrats said, weaker method of insuring people who have preexisting conditions than the one in Obamacare. Three Republican senators recently offered a similar proposal.\n\nIn 2008, Obama attacked McCain\u2019s plan as a tax increase, just as Republicans today are shortsightedly attacking Obamacare\u2019s excise tax on employer-paid benefits, among other things.\n\nBetter for Republicans to admit that, for all their current flaws, the exchanges could be the building blocks of a system that breaks the link between coverage and employment \u2014 and start offering ways to improve them.\n\nSome on the right concede as much. As Avik Roy, a health-care expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute told John Harwood of the New York Times, \u201cIt\u2019s a better world where people shop on their own.\u201d\n\nSooner or later, the GOP as a whole will have to embrace such arguments. Maybe after the election.\n\nRead more from Charles Lane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare exchanges, obamacare sign-up, hobby lobby, charles lane, chuck lane, washington post charles lane, charles lane column, obamacare employer mandate, supreme court hobby lobby, ezekiel emanuel health care, obama health care emanuel, internal revenue code, mccain health care employer paid benefits, hobby lobby religion, hobby lobby conscience birth control, obamacare health exchanges", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obamacare starts to break the employer-health care lock.
