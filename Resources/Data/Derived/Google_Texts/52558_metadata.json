Three people were arrested in Fountain Hills, Arizona for creating the traffic jam, and a few people were arrested in New York City; police had to use pepper spray in some instances:\n\nEnriquez described Shea Boulevard as the main artery into the area and the protesters' actions were causing motorists to drive into oncoming traffic as they tried to get around them. Traffic was backed up for miles due to the blockage.\n\nThis is causing huge issues for us,\" Enriquez told CNN. He added, \"We obviously have to get this road open.\"\n\nEnriquez later told CNN that three protesters were arrested and two cars were towed from the boulevard. The deputy emphasized that the arrests were due to protesters blocking the roadway, not because of the protest itself.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nWhile the protest in Arizona was underway, crowds of demonstrators gathered in Manhattan to march from Columbus Circle near Central Park to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.\n\nA small skirmish erupted when protesters started throwing water bottles at police, who were trying to keep them from impeding traffic. A handful of protesters were pepper-sprayed and some were arrested.\n\nAlong the march, tourists stopped to snap photos.\n\nProtesters carried signs with messages such as \"#CrushTrump\" and shouted, \"Hey, hey / ho, ho / Donald Trump has got to go.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "busy day for law enforcement....05/27/2016 9:47:15AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "busy day for law enforcement...", "title": "Trump Protestors Block Traffic In Arizona, Get Into Skirmishes With Police Near Trump Tower In NY", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/19/trump-protestors-block-traffic-in-arizona-get-into-skirmishes-with-police-near-trump-tower-in-ny-n2136482", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/19/2.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "busy day for law enforcement...", "title": "Trump Protestors Block Traffic In Arizona, Get Into Skirmishes With Police Near Trump Tower In NY", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/19/trump-protestors-block-traffic-in-arizona-get-into-skirmishes-with-police-near-trump-tower-in-ny-n2136482", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/19/2.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trump Protestors Block Traffic In Arizona, Get Into Skirmishes With Police Near Trump Tower In NY, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "[\u2026]While the protest in Arizona was underway, crowds of demonstrators gathered in Manhattan to march from Columbus Circle near Central Park to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.\nThis is causing huge issues for us,\" Enriquez told CNN.\nEnriquez later told CNN that three protesters were arrested and two cars were towed from the boulevard.\nProtesters carried signs with messages such as \"#CrushTrump\" and shouted, \"Hey, hey / ho, ho / Donald Trump has got to go.\"\n***As reported by CNN, law enforcement had their hands full in New York City and Arizona, as protestors blocked traffic for miles in Arizona\u2013and outside Trump Tower in New York, where protestors got into skirmishes with police after a few threw water bottles at them."}
