A song about chocolate rain. A man going full-psycho over double rainbows. Rebecca. Effing. Black. You didn\u2019t feel great about it, but you just couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nWe may never have a hard-and-fast gauge on what makes something go viral \u2014 something to do with wisdom tooth extraction meds? \u2014 but we can still, retroactively, attempt to make sense of some of it. That\u2019s why every week we\u2019ll be taking a look back at the things that went viral exactly five years prior.\n\nHere\u2019s what was buzzing around the Internet for the week of May 16, 2010:\n\nIf it were possible to organize viral videos by theme \u2014 or at all, for that matter \u2014 a good place to start would be with last month\u2019s stockpile of \u201cceleb interview walk-offs.\u201d Less forgivingly titled: \u201cceleb \u2018meltdowns.'\u201d First, there was the \u201cleaked footage\u201d of Dennis Quaid spouting expletives at his production team for being \u201cgarbage\u201d and storming out the door with the departing words \u201cblow me!\u201d Then, there was Robert Downey Jr. walking out of an \u201cAvengers\u201d press tour interview in a huff after a BBC presenter asked the actor to revisit a quote he gave the New York Times about his 2008 incarceration. But not before explaining that it was \u201cjust getting a little Diane Sawyer in here.\u201d God bless.\n\nThe first of the two, you\u2019ll recall, ended up being a huge made-to-go-viral stunt engineered by Funny or Die \u2014 just as media outlets had feared. But that hardly matters here, because the Internet was arrested by the footage just the same. The idea of a celebrity \u2014 especially one who starred in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d \u2014 so recklessly abandoning his Hollywood poise was fascinating to people. And this was far from the first time we saw this happen.\n\nWe saw it with an Oscar-winning actor who, by the year 2010, didn\u2019t actually have any Hollywood poise left to abandon. I\u2019m talking about Russell Crowe, of course.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years ago today, Russell Crowe stormed out of a BBC interview and a viral obsession was born VIDEO", "title": "Viral rewind: Why do we love celebrity walk-off videos so much?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Five years ago today, Russell Crowe stormed out of a BBC interview and a viral obsession was born VIDEO", "title": "Viral rewind: Why do we love celebrity walk-off videos so much?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/viral_rewind_why_do_we_love_celebrity_walk_off_videos_so_much/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/russell_crowe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five years ago today, Russell Crowe stormed out of a BBC interview and a viral obsession was born VIDEO", "title": "Viral rewind: Why do we love celebrity walk-off videos so much?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/russell_crowe.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Colin Gorenstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Entertainment, tbt, Video, Viral Reflections, viral rewind, Viral Video, what went viral 5 years ago today", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9771\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Entertainment, tbt, Video, Viral Reflections, viral rewind, Viral Video, what went viral 5 years ago today, Social News, Media News, Life News, Entertainment NewsYou held out for as long as you could, but one day \u2014 against your better judgment \u2014 you clicked on a viral video.\nThe idea of a celebrity \u2014 especially one who starred in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d \u2014 so recklessly abandoning his Hollywood poise was fascinating to people.\nThat\u2019s why every week we\u2019ll be taking a look back at the things that went viral exactly five years prior.\nWe saw it with an Oscar-winning actor who, by the year 2010, didn\u2019t actually have any Hollywood poise left to abandon.\nWe may never have a hard-and-fast gauge on what makes something go viral \u2014 something to do with wisdom tooth extraction meds?"}
