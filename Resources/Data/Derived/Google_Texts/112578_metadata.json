For much of the past 15 years, U.S. exports and our manufacturing sector have been on the decline. But that trend appears not only to be slowing, but reversing. The data is driven by America\u2019s increasing oil production, a commitment from retailers to buy more domestic goods, and other companies bringing their previously offshored manufacturing back home \u2014 a trend called \u2018reshoring.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAnd here\u2019s the not-made-in-America skinny: \u201cU.S. manufacturing accounted for 19 percent of global exports in the year 2000. By 2011, that number had shrunk to 11 percent. During that same time, Chinese manufacturing surged from 7 percent to 21 percent of global exports. For the American factory and its workers, not to mention the economy, these were troubling numbers,\u201d as dailyfinance.com reported.\n\nCorporate America, the 1 percenters being ripped to shreds by Big Labor and their bed partners \u2014 liberals and progressives \u2014 are seemingly flipping the well-scripted criticism of greed.\n\nAnalysts say that with manufacturers currently employing 12 million Americans, a U.S. export boom could push down our unemployment rate by 2 to 3 points to 5.4 percent \u2014 relief worth praying for.\n\nThe dailyfinance.com article said Chinese manufacturing is maturing and explained it this way: \u201cAccording to the Boston Consulting Group, the U.S. is becoming one of the least expensive places in the developed world for manufacturing. We\u2019ve got cheap domestic sources for energy (thanks to the shale gas production boom), as well as relatively low wages. These cost advantages make U.S. manufacturing more akin to China or India just a couple of years ago. BCG projects that by 2015, U.S. labor will cost between 8 percent and 18 percent less than in the other five major export economies (Germany, Japan, France, Italy, and Great Britain).\u201d\n\nCompanies banking on \u201cMade in America\u201d labels include Brooks Brothers, which bought a plant in Haverhill, Mass., a few years ago to make suits here instead of offshore, and Caterpillar opened a $200 million plant in Texas a year ago.\n\nAnd the No. 1 brand in motorcycling, Harley-Davidson, the 110-year-old stalwart of \u201cMade in America,\u201d is even reworking its management-labor relations by renegotiating with unions and granting workers more flexible job classifications and duties.\n\n\u201c[T]he combination of reshoring and building out new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. could create as many as 5 million new jobs here,\u201d dailyfinance.com said.\n\nSo, see. It\u2019s all good.\n\nThe dreamers in and around the comprehensive immigration-reform movement are having their say about being \u201cBorn in the USA.\u201d Well, corporate America is retrending toward having its say, too.\n\n\u201cMade in America?\u201d\n\nHard-working Americans should bet on it.\n\nHappy Labor Day.\n\n\u2022 Deborah Simmons can be reached at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "You needn't be a fan of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\" or a fashionista familiar with QVC designer Susan Graver, who proudly touts her U.S.-manufactured designs, to appreciate that being \"Made in America\" is making a comeback.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "You needn\u2019t be a fan of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d or a fashionista familiar with QVC designer Susan Graver, who proudly touts her U.S.-manufactured designs, to appreciate that being \u201cMade in America\u201d is making a comeback.", "title": "SIMMONS: \u2018Made in U.S.\u2019 not just a slogan anymore", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/1/simmons-made-in-us-not-just-a-slogan-anymore/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/10/17/simmons_horiz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/10/17/simmons_horiz.jpg", "description": "You needn't be a fan of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\" or a fashionista familiar with QVC designer Susan Graver, who proudly touts her U.S.-manufactured designs, to appreciate that being \"Made", "card": "summary", "title": "SIMMONS: \u2018Made in U.S.\u2019 not just a slogan anymore"}, "Author": "Deborah Simmons", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor Day  Us , Bruce Springsteen"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fa1\"", "article_summary": "During that same time, Chinese manufacturing surged from 7 percent to 21 percent of global exports.\nmanufacturing accounted for 19 percent of global exports in the year 2000.\nFor much of the past 15 years, U.S. exports and our manufacturing sector have been on the decline.\nFor the American factory and its workers, not to mention the economy, these were troubling numbers,\u201d as dailyfinance.com reported.\nWe\u2019ve got cheap domestic sources for energy (thanks to the shale gas production boom), as well as relatively low wages."}
