Board of Commissioners sets the tax rate for the next fiscal year.\n\nHall County officials are considering at least two budget scenarios for the 2016 fiscal year, including a potential property tax increase that could generate about $1.6 million in additional revenue for the general fund.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners will hold three public hearings later this month to work through the scenarios and finalize a budget, which must be done by July 1, when the new fiscal year begins.\n\nThe budget scenarios are already causing some division among the Board of Commissioners, with members Scott Gibbs and Jeff Stowe supporting a reduction in the property tax rate, while Billy Powell, Richard Mecum and Kathy Cooper agreed to consider options before moving forward.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us have any intention of raising taxes,\u201d Powell said during a work session discussion on Monday.\n\nOfficials are considering whether to keep the property tax millage rate in place at 5.989, or approve a rollback to 5.735 to account for increases in revenue from reassessments of commercial, industrial and residential properties this year.\n\nOf more than 4,200 commercial and industrial properties inspected this year, for example, about 60 percent will see a rise in value, according to Chief Tax Appraiser Steve Watson.\n\nHall County properties are assessed at 40 percent of their value for tax purposes, and 1 mill equals $1,000 of assessed value.\n\nNot rolling back the rate amounts to a tax increase under state law and the county must advertise the prospect of a tax hike even if officials do not wind up approving it.\n\nWith a full rollback, the projected revenue for the general fund is $92,179,874, while maintaining the current tax rate would produce an estimated $93,828,878.\n\nBoth revenue scenarios include the use of $3.5 million from the county fund balance, which is currently north of $20 million.\n\nThe current fiscal year budget is $90,268,561 and includes the use of $3.6 million in reserves.\n\nEach proposal this year also includes a budgeted 2-percent loss on appeals of property reassessments, which will likely reduce revenue when all is said and done.\n\nWith or without the revenue from reassessments, the general fund budget will increase for the 2016 fiscal year as a result of new growth and increased sales tax revenues, for example.\n\nGibbs said he is already committed to no tax increase.\n\n\u201cI was there in the bad times,\u201d he added, referring to 2011 when the county was facing a massive budget deficit. \u201cI just think we\u2019re in a good place now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that officials could set the tax rate somewhere between the two proposals on the table.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be some dialogue on this,\u201d said Mecum, the commission chairman, hinting at the contention that keeping the tax rate in place is only an increase in a very technical sense.\n\nPowell made the case for considering all options as a prudent approach despite the blowback he\u2019s likely to receive.\n\n\u201cWe have no options unless we advertise,\u201d he added. \u201cI know we\u2019ll get pounded for it.\u201d\n\nMurrayville resident Doug Aiken, a frequent attendee at county commission meetings, urged officials to commit to a full rollback.\n\n\u201cPeople need a break,\u201d he said before being cut off by commissioners for speaking too long.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I burdened y\u2019all,\u201d Aiken retorted.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url":
