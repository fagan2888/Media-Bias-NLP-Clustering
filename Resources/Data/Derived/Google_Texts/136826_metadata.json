As they left, a 19-year-old apparently jumped on to the back of a moving car. He fell off, hitting his head on the pavement.\n\nHe was taken to the hospital with what police are calling extremely critical injuries.\n\n\"We're waiting word from the hospital to see what his prognosis truly is,\" said Sergeant Jim Merrick. \"Head injuries can be tricky, a fall on pavement can sometimes be fatal.\"\n\nPolice say it appears alcohol was a factor. The car involved left the scene.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "It has been confirmed by the police that the man who fell off of a moving vehicle and hit his head was, indeed, 19-years-old.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-in-critical-condition-after-falling-and-hitting-his-head.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/carfallTylerax.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It has been confirmed by the police that the man who fell off of a moving vehicle and hit his head was, indeed, 19-years-old.", "title": "UPDATE: Man in critical condition after falling and hitting his head"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "It has been confirmed by the police that the man who fell off of a moving vehicle and hit his head was, indeed, 19-years-old.", "title": "UPDATE: Man in critical condition after falling and hitting his head", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-in-critical-condition-after-falling-and-hitting-his-head.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/carfallTylerax.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "UPDATE: Man in critical condition after falling and hitting his head", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Man in critical condition, after falling and hitting his"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe355d\"", "article_summary": "Parking lot of Side PocketsIt has been confirmed by the police that the man who fell off of a moving vehicle and hit his head was, indeed, 19-years-old.\nFull Story:A split-second decision while horse playing in a parking lot, puts a teen's life in jeopardy.\nAs of early Sunday morning the teen's condition is still critical.\nHe fell off, hitting his head on the pavement.\nHe was taken to the hospital with what police are calling extremely critical injuries."}
