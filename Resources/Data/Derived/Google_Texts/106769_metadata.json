Mike Beebe (D), Republican state lawmakers, and the Obama administration to provide health care coverage to low-income residents.\n\nData released on Thursday from 42 hospitals show that emergency room visits dropped by 2 percent, \u201cwhile the number of uninsured patients in those emergency rooms dropped by 24 percent,\u201d the Associated Press notes.\n\nErik Dorey, a spokesperson for Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), said that the survey results indicated that the state\u2019s implementation of health care reform is successfully providing insurance coverage to Arkansas families. \u201cBecause of Arkansas\u2019 private option, 150,000 working families already know the security of quality coverage, and its successful implementation is a credit to Republicans and Democrats in Arkansas coming together to pass it into law,\u201d Dorey said in a statement to ThinkProgress.\n\nIndeed, hospitals are already seeing impressive results. \u201cWith the private option, we have literally seen a 50 percent reduction in uninsured patients coming through our emergency room,\u201d chief executive officer Ray Montgomery of The White County Medical Center said. The program has removed \u201ca financial barrier for individuals who have needed care and needed service use, so they are not waiting later to have more complicated, less effective, more costly outcomes,\u201d Arkansas Surgeon General Joe Thompson added.\n\nThe \u201cprivate option\u201d allows Arkansas to use federal Obamacare dollars to help residents earning up to 1.38 times the poverty level to buy private plans through Arkansas\u2019 health care marketplace.\n\nLast week, a handful of publicly traded hospitals also reported a decrease in self-pay admissions in the states that have expanded their Medicaid programs and predicted that the law would lower those kind of admissions from 8 percent to 4 percent over a three-year period.\n\nRep.
