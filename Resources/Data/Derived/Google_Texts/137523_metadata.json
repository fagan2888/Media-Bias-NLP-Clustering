But I think I should step back and talk about the broader issue here.\n\nSo the CBO estimates that the incentive effects of the ACA will lead to a voluntary reduction in labor supply of around 1 1/2 percent, the equivalent of 2 million full-time jobs. Labor compensation would fall less, around 1 percent, because the reduction in hours would be skewed toward the less well paid. Although they don\u2019t say this, we would expect potential GDP to fall by roughly the same amount (assuming wages more or less reflect marginal productivity); since compensation is about 55 percent of GDP, this would mean reducing potential GDP by a bit over 0.5 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s not a very big number \u2014 nothing like the claims you hear on the right that Obamacare is bringing economic doom. Even so, however, it\u2019s a clear overstatement of the true economic costs of the program.\n\nWhy? Because when workers voluntarily withdraw 1 percent of their hours, it\u2019s very different from what happens when 1 percent of workers lose their jobs and become involuntarily unemployed.\n\nWhen workers lose their jobs, it\u2019s almost always a terrible experience: not only does it cause financial hardship, it eats away at the soul. Every study I\u2019ve seen says that the effects of unemployment on perceived welfare are vastly greater than you can explain simply as a result of the loss of income. So the true cost of 2 million workers laid off is huge, much more than the GDP loss.\n\nWhen workers choose to work less, by contrast, they presumably do so because they gain something that is, to them, worth more than the foregone income: more time with their children, an earlier retirement, etc.. Now, in making these choices they won\u2019t take into account the spillovers to the rest of society that come from their paying less in taxes or receiving more in benefits; so you probably don\u2019t want to think of the reduction in labor supply as a net economic good. But it\u2019s surely a smaller cost than the headline effect on GDP.\n\nA somewhat educated guess (I\u2019m thinking of the de facto marginal tax rate on lower-income workers, which for the wonks out there is the only source of first-order welfare effects from a small change in labor supply) is that the net economic losses from the kind of labor supply effect CBO analyzes are on the order of 0.3 percent of GDP.\n\nOh, and that\u2019s in the long run. In the next few years, with the economy still depressed, it\u2019s all positive: reduced work by some will open up job opportunities for others, and higher incomes for beneficiaries will mean higher overall employment.\n\nBut back to the long run: Even if CBO is completely right about labor supply, we\u2019re really talking about a very small economic cost here for a huge social benefit \u2014 giving Americans the assurance that they\u2019ll be able to afford essential health care.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140206091938, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 6, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Labor Supply and the Meaning of Life ( 20140206 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Choosing to work less versus losing a job.", "title": "Labor Supply and the Meaning of Life", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/labor-supply-and-the-meaning-of-life/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Choosing to work less versus losing a job.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 6, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1391696378, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T14:19:38-05:00"}, "utime": 20140206141938, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140206, "pdate": 20140206, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Choosing to work less versus losing a job.", "title": "Labor Supply and the Meaning of Life", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/labor-supply-and-the-meaning-of-life/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/labor-supply-and-the-meaning-of-life/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Labor Supply and the Meaning of Life", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "So the CBO estimates that the incentive effects of the ACA will lead to a voluntary reduction in labor supply of around 1 1/2 percent, the equivalent of 2 million full-time jobs.\nLabor compensation would fall less, around 1 percent, because the reduction in hours would be skewed toward the less well paid.\nBut back to the long run: Even if CBO is completely right about labor supply, we\u2019re really talking about a very small economic cost here for a huge social benefit \u2014 giving Americans the assurance that they\u2019ll be able to afford essential health care.\nSo the true cost of 2 million workers laid off is huge, much more than the GDP loss.\nThat\u2019s not a very big number \u2014 nothing like the claims you hear on the right that Obamacare is bringing economic doom."}
