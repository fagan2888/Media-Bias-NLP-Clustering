Matt Bevin\u2019s allegation of \u201cgreed and oftentimes corruption\u201d escalates the feud between the new governor, who took office in December, and the Beshear family: former Gov. Steven L. Beshear and his son Andy, the state attorney general. On April 11, Andy Beshear sued Mr. Bevin, saying the governor acted illegally in cutting higher education spending without approval by the Legislature. Steven Beshear is leading a public-relations campaign against his successor\u2019s moves to roll back the state\u2019s expansion of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA former state official close to the Beshears, Timothy M. Longmeyer, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a federal bribery charge, a case Mr. Bevin referred to in calling for a new investigation. As a member of Steve Beshear\u2019s cabinet, Mr. Longmeyer steered contracts related to the health plan for state employees to a company that paid him kickbacks. Mr. Longmeyer briefly served this year as a deputy attorney general, under Andy Beshear, before resigning.\n\nIn a brief statement, Mr. Bevin said that in his months in office, his administration had found evidence that state workers were forced to contribute last year to the campaigns of Andy Beshear and Jack Conway, the previous attorney general, who was Mr. Bevin\u2019s Democratic opponent in the race for governor. And he charged that the state had awarded a $3 million no-bid contract to a company with ties to Steve Beshear\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bevin said he had directed an official in his cabinet to hire an outside law firm to investigate the matters. \u201cA thorough, independent investigation like this can expose and cast light upon prior unsavory \u2014 and perhaps illegal \u2014 practices,\u201d he said.\n\nAndy Beshear released a statement saying that \u201cthe appropriate agency, however, for investigating the governor\u2019s allegations is the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission, an independent agency, and not a cabinet that answers to the governor.\u201d He accused Mr. Bevin of overstepping his authority and wasting public money.\n\nAs governor, Steven Beshear made Kentucky a national model for extending government-funded health insurance to more people through the Affordable Care Act, by creating a state-run insurance marketplace, Kynect, and expanding Medicaid eligibility.\n\nMr. Beshear and his health policies were popular, but voters last year chose Mr. Bevin, a conservative newcomer who vowed to undo much of his predecessor\u2019s efforts, which he said were too costly to sustain. He has set about dismantling Kynect, which would put consumers into an insurance exchange run by the federal government, and he has said he will pare the Medicaid expansion.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160419145650, "twitter": {"description": "A feud is heating up between the governor and his predecessor, Steven L.
