The official start of spring is a week away, but our smartphones got a jump on it by SPRINGING AHEAD today \u2013 the quicker to get to Selection Sunday and tipoff of basketball March Madness. Political March Madness has been raging all weekend ...\n\nBEING THERE \u2013 \u201cInside the Protest That Stopped the Trump Rally: The plan worked better than they\u2019d ever imagined. Then the trouble began,\u201d by Keith O\u2019Brien, an author on assignment in Chicago for Politico Magazine: \u201cIt had been a week in the making, and now everyone was in place: with roughly 2,500 on the street outside and hundreds more inside, including dozens working directly with Lewis. As they waited, the crowd growing loud around them, a few were starting to feel doubts about what they were hoping to do. ...\n\n\u201cI was just there to watch, but I could feel it myself. The protesters, mostly black and Latino and young, were standing shoulder to shoulder with the people that their protest would upset most. The crowd was white\u2014all of them\u2014sporting \u2018Hillary for Prison\u2019 and \u2018Bomb the Hell out of ISIS\u2019 pins, wearing camouflage ball caps, hunter orange, and N.R.A. gear, and shouting for their candidate, who was late ... \u2018U-S-A!\u2019 they chanted. And: \u2018Build that Wall\u2019 And: \u2018We want Trump!\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1QVL9Pb\n\nBREAKING \u2013 \u201cTrump outside Chicago arrives to calmer crowd\u201d \u2013 AP: \u201cTrump is returning to Illinois after canceling a Friday night appearance in Chicago amid clashes between protesters and his supporters. The mood was far more muted Sunday outside the Bloomington airport in central Illinois, where about 100 protesters gathered along an access road on an a foggy, overcast morning near the airplane hangar where Trump was scheduled to speak.\u201d\n\nANTI-TRUMP FORCES SOUND ALARM in new memo! \u201cTo: Our Principles PAC From: Ed Goeas Re: Does Donald Trump have a path to victory in November?\u201d: \u201c[A]ny Republican Presidential candidate will face a significant electoral challenge this fall. But this candidate, who is currently turning off more voters than he is turning on with the tone and tenor of his campaign and divisive persona, clearly appears to be winning his battles for the Republican nominating but losing the war for the White House in November.\n\n\u201cBased on all of the data I have seen, the answer to the question \u2018Does Donald Trump have a path to victory in November?\u2019 is clearly \u2018No.\u2019 The question is, how many down ballot Republicans will he take with him?\u201d See the 8-page memo. http://bit.ly/1TFHlqZ\n\n--BRIAN BAKER, strategist behind the Our Principles PAC anti-Trump effort: \u201cIf Trump has a bad night on Tuesday, the math shows that he has a very difficult path to Cleveland. But if he makes it to the general election, voters are making a Shermanesque judgment on Trump: If nominated, he will not win.\u201d\n\nJAKE TAPPER to MARCO RUBIO on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d: \u201cWould I be overstating matters if I said you sound like you're actually concerned somebody, before this is all over, somebody might lose their life?\u201d\n\nRUBIO: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about that. ... We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next here. I know that we\u2019ve reached the point now where people in American politics have decided that if they don\u2019t agree with you, that they can get angry at you, that you\u2019re a bad and evil person, that they can say anything they want about you. ... [A]ll the gates of civility have been blown apart and we\u2019ve now reached a point where, on both sides, everyone is just saying or doing whatever they want. ...\n\n\u201cThis is not about political correctness. This is about rules of civility and a way of society talking to each other. And let me ask everybody this: Do we really want to live in a country where everybody hates each other? Where everybody is at each other\u2019s throat? Where, because we disagree on the role of government or the tax rate or Obamacare or foreign policy, we now in this nation cannot have a discourse or agree on any other issue and end up hating each other?\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s what it feels like. It feels like we\u2019re reaching a point now, where in America, everyone hates each other. I\u2019m so tired of arguing and fighting with other Americans. ... I mean, all the gates -- all the rules that once governed our discourse have been blown away and we\u2019re headed in a very dangerous direction.\u201d\n\nHOT VIDEO \u2013 RUBIO\u2019s 13 minute presser yesterday where he strongly criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric http://bit.ly/1WiNszk\n\n** A message from BP: We give our offshore teams 24/7 support from onshore experts \u2013 so we have extra sets of eyes on our wells every day.

[S]ources familiar with the matter said Bennet is believed to be under consideration for a big newsroom role, and the possibility has created buzz in the newsroom in recent days. Bennet has been editor in chief of The Atlantic for the past 10 years. His previous Times tour lasted from 1991 to 2006 and spanned positions from White House correspondent to Jerusalem bureau chief.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of years, the Times has been reconfiguring its leadership ranks both on the business side and in the newsroom as the company has been transforming itself to respond to the rapidly changing media environment. Sources speculated that Bennet could potentially assume an important digital role, since The Atlantic has seen digital success under his leadership. If Bennet were to return to the Times in a high-ranking position, ... it could even put him in line to succeed executive editor Dean Baquet, for whom there is no single clear heir apparent among the newsroom\u2019s senior leaders. ...\n\n\u201cWhen Baquet\u2019s predecessor, Jill Abramson, was executive editor several years ago, she tried to hire Bennet for a digitally focused masthead position, and new CEO Mark Thompson even tried to convince Bennet to take the gig ... But Bennet was hesitant because it wasn't clear to him that the somewhat nebulous position he was being offered would come with significant stature or impact.\u201d http://politi.co/1LkpXp4\n\nSUNDAY BEST ... JAKE TAPPER, in Ohio for town hall tonight, to Trump, in Chicago, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d: \u201c[P]eople are getting hurt, and people are actually concerned that somebody might get seriously, seriously injured before this is all over, and that you are not taking down the temperature. You are, in the views of many of your fellow Republicans, making things worse -- inciting, encouraging violence. And you're a leader, sir.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cMy fellow Republicans \u2013 \u201d\n\nTAPPER: \u201cYou\u2019re the frontrunner of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cExcuse me. Excuse me. My fellow Republicans are running against me. They are losing big league. In Florida, we have a man, Marco Rubio, who doesn\u2019t even show up to vote in the U.S. Senate. He\u2019s a disgrace. He\u2019s weak, very weak on illegal immigration -- wants to give amnesty to everybody. He\u2019s a person that I don\u2019t think he could be elected dogcatcher in Florida, frankly. But I\u2019m running against \u2013 \u201d\n\nTAPPER: \u201cAll right. But with all due respect, sir \u2013 \u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIn -- if you look at -- excuse me. Excuse me. If you look at Ohio, we have a man that voted for NAFTA. NAFTA has destroyed Ohio, and now he\u2019s voting for TPP -- I mean, in Kasich. And give me a break \u2013 they\u2019re running against me.

Can it be contained?\u201d): \u201cAn already ugly presidential campaign has descended to a new level \u2014 one where the question is no longer whether Donald Trump can be stopped on his march to the Republican presidential nomination, but whether it is possible to contain what he has unleashed across the country. Violence at Trump\u2019s rallies has escalated sharply, and the reality-show quality of his campaign has taken a more ominous turn in the past few days. ...\n\n\u201cThe racially tinged anger that has both fueled Trump\u2019s political rise and stoked the opposition to it has turned into a force unto itself. It has also brought a reckoning from his three remaining rivals for the Republican nomination, who are shedding their fear of provoking Trump and of alienating the raging slice of their party\u2019s base that has claimed him as its leader. ...\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s presidential campaign, however, seems to have fallen into a bottomless spiral. ... Trump has delighted in mocking hecklers \u2014 and condoning attacks on them by his supporters ...
