But about a decade ago, Cohen made a mistake that he has never forgotten. And he doesn\u2019t want to forget.\n\nAt the time it happened, he was far from a rookie. He was a seasoned professional at the top of his game.\n\nAs Atul Gawande \u2014 a Boston surgeon and bestselling author \u2014 put forth in a 1999 article in the New Yorker magazine, \u201cWhen Doctors Make Mistakes,\u201d many medical mistakes are made by good, highly regarded doctors, not by the habitually negligent.\n\nAnd critical mistakes occur often. A recent study in the Journal of Patient Safety said that 210,000 to 440,000 patients each year who go to the hospital for care suffer some type of preventable harm that contributes to their death.\n\nCohen\u2019s mistake was simply a mix-up, but a troubling one. It all started when two of his patients, whom he calls A. Jones and B. Jones, visited his private practice office at about the same time.\n\nThe two women had the same last name, but different first names and very different prognoses.\n\nA. Jones was a patient of Cohen\u2019s with a known blood abnormality, and Cohen ordered laboratory tests to determine whether her condition had worsened.\n\nB. Jones, on the other hand, was a healthy woman who had come in for a periodic check-up. Cohen found nothing out of the ordinary during an examination, but as matter of routine, he had a sample of her blood drawn and sent to a lab for testing.\n\nIn the rush of a busy practice, mix-ups can happen.\n\nNumerous lab reports arrived at the office every day and were stuffed into patients\u2019 charts, where doctors read them and acted on them. In the hurried atmosphere, most doctors never questioned whether a particular lab report was in the right folder.\n\nWhen Cohen looked at the test results in B. Jones\u2019 folder, they showed significant abnormalities suggesting leukemia, even though she had seemed healthy a few days earlier. He immediately reached out to her and asked her to come in for a face-to-face consultation.\n\nB. Jones came in the next day and got the totally unexpected news that she appeared to have a serious illness.\n\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d she said, but she was also stunned and frightened.\n\nBut then her gaze focused on the chart in Cohen\u2019s hand, and she saw that something was amiss on the lab paperwork. The birth date was not hers.\n\nAs it happened, the worrisome test result actually belonged to A. Jones, the patient with a history of blood abnormalities. The result had mistakenly been put into B. Jones\u2019 folder.\n\nA wave of relief swept over B. Jones as she realized she was healthy after all and that her doctor had mistaken her for another patient. Cohen was quick to apologize for the blunder.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry I made you feel so stressed for 24 hours,\u2019 \u201d Cohen recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018We made a mistake.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithin 24 hours, Cohen notified A. Jones of her test result. It signaled a turn for the worse in her condition. But given her previous problems, she was disturbed by the news but not overwhelmed by it.\n\nApologizing may go a long way\n\nCohen felt horrible for the false alarm he had given B. Jones.\n\n\u201cFor a night there, I\u2019m sure this lady didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he says today.\n\nTo his surprise, the woman was so relieved when she was told about the mix-up that she gave him a big hug.\n\nThis is not as surprising as it seems. A 2010 study from researchers at the University of Michigan and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital showed that when doctors apologize for their mistakes, it can actually prevent malpractice lawsuits.\n\nIn fact, there are entire organizations devoted to this philosophy.\n\nSorry Works! Consulting, a company in Glen Carbon, Ill., provides training and resources to health care professionals to teach them to disclose when they have committed an error and apologize to patients and their families.\n\nThe company was started in 2005 by consultant Doug Wojcieszak. He had lost a brother to medical errors in 1998, and his goal was to reduce malpractice lawsuits as well as medical errors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often not bad individuals, it\u2019s poor systems that get in the way,\u201d says Dr. Scott Richardson, campus associate dean for curriculum at the GRU-UGA Medical Partnership in Athens.\n\nRichardson mentions systems redesign, an approach to health care championed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), as an important factor in reducing medical errors.\n\nIt includes mechanisms like electronic health records and checklists to limit the potential for human error. This strategy has been used to reduce medication errors, delays in performing surgery, and paperwork mix-ups like Cohen\u2019s, says Richardson.\n\nIn the New Yorker piece, Gawande described an error he made as a surgical resident in an emergency room. A car crash victim came into the ER with a blockage in her airway, and after Gawande and his medical team made repeated attempts at intubating her, she was no closer to breathing on her own.\n\nShe needed a tracheotomy to have the breathing tube inserted through her windpipe rather than orally.\n\nGawande, who blamed himself for the mistake, said he should have been preparing the patient for a tracheotomy, and instead let the emergency medicine attending physician continue attempting to intubate the patient.\n\nThis made her vocal cords swell, and her airway shut down. Eventually, the intubation was successful, but the long period of time she went without oxygen made it unclear how much brain function she would have when she regained consciousness.\n\nIn August 2012, Cohen put down his stethoscope to become a full-time medical school professor in Athens at the GRU-UGA Medical Partnership.\n\nImmediately after the mix-up in his office a few years ago, he met with the office manager and the staff to go over their policy for handling abnormal test results and verifying information before calling patients. A clearly defined procedure for notifying patients of lab results can prevent patients from being alarmed unnecessarily.\n\nAnd ever since that day, says Cohen, he has been more careful himself. He always double-checks in any situation where an error might occur.\n\nHe believes that electronic health records \u2014 which are increasingly being used in the United States and will become even more widespread under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 will reduce the likelihood of medical mistakes. But they will not eliminate them completely.\n\nThere is still the human factor.\n\n\u201cComputers may be infallible, but the data put into the computer may not be,\u201d he says.\n\nIan Branam is a second-year master\u2019s student in health and medical journalism at the University of Georgia.
