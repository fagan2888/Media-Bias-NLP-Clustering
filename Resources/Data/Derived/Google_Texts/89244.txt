The news is as good as could have been hoped for regarding Alex Tanguay: after skating a second straight day Tuesday Tanguay told coach Patrick Roy that he felt good and therefore the decision has been made to accelerate his rehab program.

Roy said Tanguay wants to push things even harder now, to hopefully fully recover from the hip problems that developed while rehabbing an earlier knee injury. He has been out since Nov. 2, and the Avs have missed him.

Obviously, feeling good after some relatively mild skating is not the same as feeling good skating in game-like conditions, but one step at a time.
