In fact, he claims, the bottom part of that photo makes sense while the top part does not.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence when he \u201cadmits\u201d that the bottom part is \u201ctotally confusing\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d But let\u2019s parse his main argument:\n\nThe top is how most of us learned subtraction. I\u2019m sure your teachers taught you what was going on mathematically, but do you really remember what they said? Probably not. For us, it\u2019s just an algorithm. You can do it without thinking. You hope there\u2019s no \u201cborrowing\u201d of numbers involved, but if you had to do it by hand, you could probably pull it off.\n\nThe problem with that method is that if I ask students to explain why it works, they\u2019d have a really hard time explaining it to me. They might be able to do the computation, but they don\u2019t get the math behind it. For some people, that\u2019s fine. For math teachers, that\u2019s a problem because it means a lot of students won\u2019t be able to grasp other math concepts in the future because they never really developed \u201cnumber sense.\u201d\n\nFirst off, no, I don\u2019t remember what my teachers said (who does?) Why is that even important? It\u2019s not. What matters is that they taught you math and you know how to use it.\n\nSecond, why is it important to know why it works as opposed to using it properly? It doesn\u2019t seem that crucial either. When you are balancing your checkbook, which matters more, that you know 100-12=88 or that you know why 100-12=88? I suspect that it\u2019s more important for most people who use math on a regular basis, such as engineers, computer programmers, accountants, etc., to be able to use the math correctly. I doubt the \u201cwhy\u201d of it does much to help them do their jobs properly.\n\nThird, even if the \u201cwhy it works\u201d is important, how does the bottom part teach that? You\u2019ll notice in Mehta\u2019s essay there is no explanation of how using the bottom approach enables a student to understand the \u201cwhy it works\u201d any better than the top part. It\u2019s also not clear it helps the student develop \u201cnumber sense\u201d (a term that, you\u2019ll also notice, Mehta never defines). Perhaps the bottom approach is better for those things, but without actually explaining why, Mehta seems to be saying \u201ctrust me on this.\u201d\n\nFinally, and related to number three, is there any evidence that the Common Core approach to math will help students learn the \u201cwhy\u201d or develop better \u201cnumber sense\u201d? And, more importantly, is there any evidence that they will be able to do math at least as well as the students who used the old method? Mehta doesn\u2019t point to any.\n\nPerhaps this approach was tested rigorously before being applied on a wide scale. But I\u2019m skeptical. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time the education establishment adopted a new approach that had little empircal evidence to back it up. Take a look at the controversy over the Phonics versus Whole Language approach to learning reading. By the early 1990s, Whole Language had largely replaced Phonics as the way of teaching reading.
