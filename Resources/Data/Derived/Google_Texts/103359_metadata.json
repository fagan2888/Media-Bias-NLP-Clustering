Since then, more than 132,000 Christmas meals have been served. He was expecting 2,500 guests Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe realize that for the vast majority of our guests today, this will be the only restaurant experience in the year,\u201d McDowell said.\n\nCancer survivor Zoe Rogers, 43, who lost her job as a security officer, brought her two girls and son, ages 9 to 12, to the restaurant Thursday because her apartment oven broke down several days ago and her landlord ignored her repeated pleas to get it fixed.\n\n\u201c(The Christmas dinner) saved our lives, basically,\u201d said 12-year-old Skylar. \u201cI love it. The people are nice and patient.\u201d\n\nGeno Smith, 50, was flinging his arms in an animated dance as the music of Prince played over a speaker outside. Smith stood in a long, fast-moving line that snaked around the restaurant parking lot. It was filled with people carrying backpacks, wearing eye patches, leaning on canes and flashing toothless grins.\n\nSmith said a nice lady holding out a cup of steaming hot chocolate had just walked up to him and asked, \u201cCocoa?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Chocolate is my stage name,\u201d said Smith, an unemployed professional comedian, as he cracked up while recalling his own joke. Despite his job predicament, Smith was in good spirits anticipating a meal at a restaurant he had never visited before.\n\nSmith was about to be lovingly greeted at the entrance by Lanie Maes, a woman of elflike stature dressed in a festive red sweater.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Maes warmly said hundreds of times Thursday while hugging men and women, many of whom are living on the streets.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver restaurant welcomes less fortunate with warm Christmas meal", "title": "Denver restaurant welcomes less fortunate with warm Christmas meal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/25/denver-restaurant-welcomes-less-fortunate-with-warm-christmas-meal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225__20141226_A4_CD25DINNERp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225__20141226_A4_CD25DINNERp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-25T14:40:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:20:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ca3\"", "article_summary": "Despite his job predicament, Smith was in good spirits anticipating a meal at a restaurant he had never visited before.\n\u201cWe can go to church on Christmas Day, or we can go to church on Christmas Day,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the unusual Denver ChopHouse & Brewery clientele surrounding him Thursday.\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Maes warmly said hundreds of times Thursday while hugging men and women, many of whom are living on the streets.\nThe University of Denver economics professor, his wife, Toni, their college son, Mark, and teenage daughter, Franci, were among 100 volunteers who spent their Christmas serving a holiday meal to Denver\u2019s homeless and needy.\n\u201cWe realize that for the vast majority of our guests today, this will be the only restaurant experience in the year,\u201d McDowell said."}
