Mike Lee (R-Utah) during an \"Exempt America from Obamacare\" rally, on Capitol Hill, September 10, 2013 in Washington, DC.\n\nUtah Senator Mike Lee is not preparing for a possible presidential campaign, headlining the Iowa GOP Reagan Dinner this Friday, or landing the cover of national magazines. He is not the face of the Defund Obamacare movement. He is not Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nBut Mike Lee is\u2014and Cruz is not\u2014the understated, policy-oriented leader behind the Defund Obamacare movement, according to several conservative leaders who spoke to TIME. He\u2019s also one of the biggest hammers driving the wedge in the national Republican party to establishment and moderate Republicans. And to supporters of the health care law, like Majority Leader Harry Reid, he\u2019s \u201cliving in a dreamland.\u201d Given Lee\u2019s influence on Defund Obamacare, and the resulting government shutdown, he is also a person whose national stature may soon rise to match his influence.\n\nThe story of the government shutdown began, for all practical purposes, in mid-Summer. \u201cThe big pivotal point was July 2,\u201d says Lee\u2019s spokemsan, Brian Phillips, when the Obama administration announced that it would not penalize businesses that do not provide health insurance in 2014. \u201cIt opened up a new door and perhaps a new front in the effort to stop Obamacare,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cWe wanted to jump on it.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Republican leadership had released statements hammering the President for delaying the employer mandate while leaving the individual mandate in place. But Lee took it one step further. On July 9, he released a statement laying out the strategy the House Republican leadership later adopted: fund everything but Obamacare in the bill that needs to pass by October 1 to keep the government open. He challenged congressional Democrats to shut it down, and then worked behind the scenes at the Republican conference lunches to garner support for defunding Obamacare. At the time, the press was largely focused on the turmoil in Egypt, Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s choice to not seek another term, and filibuster reform. Two days later, Cruz introduced a bill with 29 other Republican senators to fully defund the Affordable Care Act. But it was Lee who orchestrated the outside the beltway response that would bring Washington to its knees.\n\nOn July 17, three months before Sens. Mitch McConnell and Reid forged a deal to open the government and avert default, Lee welcomed the conservative leaders of national grassroots organizations into his office after-hours to discuss tying government funding to the Obamacare battles. Sens. Cruz, Mike Enzi, Jeff Flake, Jim Inhofe, Ron Johnson, Jim Risch, Marco Rubio, and Pat Toomey were in attendance, as well as representatives of Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks, and other conservative groups. The room was \u201cpacked,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, President of Tea Party Patriots. Lee spoke first, led the discussion, and asked for support.\n\n\u201cThat was the moment that brought everyone together,\u201d said L. Brent Bozell III, the founder of the Media Research Center and a participant in the meeting. Bozell said that every outside group agreed with the strategy, and only one senator openly questioned the shutdown or defund tactic. \u201cMike Lee is the intellectual powerhouse of this entire movement,\u201d added Bozell.\n\n\u201cIt was something we were all eager to participate in out of conviction to the cause and respect for the great leader that Mike is,\u201d said Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham, who also met with Lee in July.\n\nMartin realized that there were some Republicans who might be open to a last-minute compromise. \u201cOne reason I felt so compelled to say they had to stay strong and not back down is because Rubio was in the room,\u201d Martin told TIME. \u201cOur coordinators from around the entire country were so frustrated with the way that Rubio acted during the Gang of Eight process. I wanted to make sure all of the senators who were in there knew where we stood, and especially he knew where we stood.\u201d Rubio eventually voted against the Reid-McConnell deal reopening the government.\n\nWith the backing of grassroots conservatives, Lee announced on July 25 with 13 Republican senators that they would not support a continuing resolution that would fund further implementation or enforcement of Obamacare. On July 31, Heritage Action proclaimed a nine-city \u201cDefund Obamacare Tour\u201d featuring Needham, Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, and Cruz in Dallas. Despite the Republican leadership\u2019s opposition, Lee and Cruz convinced enough congressmen by the end of September to use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage against already sequester-weary Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in those two months made all the difference,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cIt was clear that at that point we had gone to our constituents, the American people, to the media, and had made the case over the last two months that this needed to be our stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would have happened but for that meeting,\u201d added Bozell.\n\nWhile Cruz stole the national spotlight, the most conservative wing of the GOP continues to sing Sen. Lee\u2019s praises. \u201cSenator Lee has been a tireless advocate for advancing the fight against Obamacare,\u201d said Enzi, a Wyoming Republican. \u201cLike many of us, he recognizes that the president\u2019s health care law is a raw deal for the country and that it must be repealed, defunded, or dismantled piece-by-piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my judgment there is no Senator in this body, Republican or Democrat, who is more principled, who is more dedicated, who is more fearless and willing to fight for the principles that make this nation great than is Senator Mike Lee,\u201d said Cruz during his infamous 21-hour speech a few days before the shutdown. \u201cI think over time you\u2019re going to see more Mike Lees and fewer John McCains in the Republican Party,\u201d Matt Kibbe, the President of FreedomWorks, told TIME. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a huge upgrade.\u201d\n\nBut Lee\u2019s judgement has also been called into question. After the 16-day partial government shutdown, at a cost up to $24 billion, Obamacare emerged unscathed. As a result, the strategy Lee orchestrated with Cruz and others has met a fierce backlash. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) told TIME last week that she never received an answer from Lee or any Defund Obamacare supporter about how the plan was supposed to accomplish its goal. \u201cThe fact that the exchanges opened with the government shut down demonstrates on its face that it was not going to succeed,\u201d said Ayotte.\n\nEven Sen. David Vitter (La.), who says he\u2019s \u201cgoing to look for every opportunity to stop, or scale back, or delay, or postpone or repeal Obamacare,\u201d told TIME he can\u2019t confidently say how successful the strategy was, or what the next step will be. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we accomplished anything regarding that goal,\u201d said Vitter, referring to actually defunding the health care act.\n\nOther establishment Republicans have grumbled that the idea was misguided from the start. \u201cA number of us were saying back in July that this strategy could not and would not work, and of course it didn\u2019t,\u201d said McConnell on Face the Nation. \u201cThere will not be another government shutdown. You can count on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything except create a big mess in Washington,\u201d said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) on Meet the Press. \u201cI\u2019m not so inclined to think it was the Tea Party as much as it was outside interest groups and a few individuals within our party who took advantage of that situation.\u201d\n\nAfter the third longest government shutdown in 37 years, the question that remains is what will happen to Lee and the Republican Party. A CNN poll released Monday reports that 54% of Americans believe that Republican control of the House is bad for the country, up 11 points from mid-December. The latest Utah poll shows a 10% drop in Lee\u2019s favorability, but the effects on the national GOP are likelier to be larger than those on Lee.\n\nUtah has a caucus and convention candidate nominating system that favors Lee. \u201cHis voter market is only the base of the base,\u201d says Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant who has advised several presidential campaigns. \u201cI think it could be helpful to him, but only in the Tea Party silo of the GOP that he already has some support for. In the wider electorate, it hurts him more than helps him. But since Utah is not a swing state, my guess is he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lee sees his efforts in a different light. \u201cIt\u2019s always worth it to do the right thing,\u201d Lee said on the Senate floor as Reid and McConnell put forward the deal which largely kept the status quo. \u201cSome say we shouldn\u2019t have fought because we couldn\u2019t win, but this country wasn\u2019t built by fighting when victory was absolutely certain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah Senator Mike Lee is\u00a0not preparing for a possible presidential campaign, headlining the Iowa GOP Reagan Dinner this Friday, or landing the cover of national magazines.
