For they shall inherit the earth.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Bible says. But until payback comes in the after life, that\u2019s not how it works in the here and now. Because of qualities that often breed arrogance \u2014 such as superior intelligence and exceptional talent \u2014 the arrogant are often in charge of the rest of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut every once in awhile, circumstances force them to acknowledge their insufferable demeanor \u2014 and that can be delicious.\n\nTake the recent case of Jonathan Gruber, the MIT professor, who attributed the passage of the Affordable Care Act to \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d His remarks, caught on video, caused a political firestorm as they fed into the narrative of Obamacare opponents that Americans were duped into health care legislation. Called to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last week, Gruber ate about as much humble pie as he is capable of consuming, telling lawmakers: \u201cI behaved badly and will have to live with that, but my own inexcusable arrogance is not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThat was followed by the saga of Benjamin Edelman, the Harvard Business School professor, who made a federal case out of a bill from a Chinese restaurant and the $4 discrepancy between what he paid for his food and the prices listed on the website. His underlying argument about the bill has merit. A website should tell a consumer the correct price for a service or product it is advertising. But how he expressed his displeasure \u2014 a series of insipid emails that pretentiously cited consumer law and demanded a $12 refund, or triple damages, from the owner of a family-run business \u2014 made him look, well, arrogant.\n\nEdelman quickly apologized, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that I was out of line. I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation.\u201d Perhaps he has truly learned something from the experience.\n\nNonetheless, humility is the thin line between confidence and arrogance, according to a much-cited quote attributed to an unknown wise person. Self-deprecating humor is one way around the arrogance rap, as demonstrated by President Obama during a recent TV gig, in which he took over for host Stephen Colbert. During the segment, the president joked of himself, \u201cThe guy is so arrogant, I\u2019ll bet he talks about himself in the third person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMinus the humor, crossing the line between confidence and arrogance is a dangerous place to be in the Internet age. When your contempt for others is so obvious, and it is captured in an email chain or YouTube video, there\u2019s an opportunity for those on the other side of your disdain to strike back.\n\nIn Gruber\u2019s case, he had to endure the likes of Republican Congressman Darrell Issa asking him, \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d In Edelman\u2019s case, the media has had a field day circulating the embarrassing email. There was a special karma in Edelman\u2019s discomfort since his research specialty is \u201cfixing the Internet.\u201d\n\nEdelman\u2019s Harvard affiliation added to the delight of bashers, but the Ivy League doesn\u2019t have a lock on arrogance. In a recent interview, Texas Gov. Rick Perry blamed his infamous \u201coops\u201d moment during the 2012 Republican primary on the arrogance that came with believing he could jump into a presidential campaign without proper preparation. Although in Perry\u2019s case, that acknowledgement may add up to more of a humble brag.\n\nYet if there\u2019s a line between confidence and arrogance, there\u2019s also a line between chuckling over the squirming of a Gruber or Edelman and reveling in it just a little too much.\n\nA healthy ego goes along with great accomplishment. As the famous philosopher John Lennon once said, \u201cIf being an egomaniac means I believe in what I do, and in my art and music, then in that respect you can call me that. I believe in what I do, and I\u2019ll say it.\u201d\n\nIf people like Gruber and Edelman think they are smarter than everyone else, it\u2019s because they are. Acting that way, however, has its consequences.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 Meet the Harvard professor behind the Chinese-food dispute\n\n\u2022 Joan Vennochi: \u2018Stupidity\u2019 comments create new problems for ACA\n\n\u2022 What happens if you sue a restaurant over $4?\n\n\u2022 Harvard professor apologizes over Chinese-food fight", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.739444320", "eomportal-id": 375755, "description": "Blessed are the meek.
