Estimates of the scope of the breach have increased since the initial reports on Friday, while the ability of the attackers to bypass state-of-the-art defensive software is frightening. Even so, some experts are saying the damage could have been contained if the government had taken better precautions to protect the pilfered data.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe damage estimate is reaching epic proportions. It now appears security clearance applications and background checks dating back 30 years were compromised.\n\n\u201cThis is deep. The data goes back to 1985,\u201d a U.S. official is quoted at Business Insider. \u201cThis means that they potentially have information about retirees, and they could know what they did after leaving government.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to information from OPM\u2019s computers, such as birthdates, Social Security numbers, and bank information, could help hackers test potential passwords to other sites, including those containing information about critical weapons systems,\u201d the official added.\n\nTwo months later, the public still isn\u2019t being given straight answers about how much data was stolen.\n\n\u201cThe Office of Personnel Management and the Interior Department have declined to publicly identify which database in the business center was targeted in the breach disclosed Thursday, one of the largest intrusions into federal employees\u2019 personal information,\u201d writes the Washington Post. \u201cBut experts in and out of government in technology and federal personnel systems say they strongly suspect that a central database hosted by the Interior Business Center containing all executive branch personnel information, called Enterprise Human Resources Integration, was targeted.\u201d\n\nIf that suspicion is correct, the hackers will have access to information on every affected employee\u2019s \u201ccareer in the government, from salary to benefits to training and certification,\u201d and the raiders may have further penetrated \u201cother federal data sources on employees, including sites containing former employees\u2019 retirement status and benefits.\u201d\n\nThe information taken from OPM could already be fueling further hacking attacks. Hewlett-Packard security expert Mark Bower explained to the Christian Science Monitor that data already taken by these thieves could be used to construct massive \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, i.e. sending email laced with malware to family, friends, and business associates of the four million already compromised, \u201cwith the aim of getting access to data about economic policy plans, military and defense data sets, or for committing intellectual property theft.\u201d\n\nThe Boston Herald reports senior counterintelligence official Dan Payne sent a videotaped message to federal employees on Friday, telling them to \u201cchange all their passwords, put fraud alerts on their credit reports and watch for attempts by foreign intelligence services to exploit them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of you may think that you are not of interest because you don\u2019t have access to classified information. You are mistaken,\u201d Payne said in the video.\n\nIf the attackers were agents of the Chinese government working for one of the PLA\u2019s huge cyber-commando operations, or (rather implausibly) a private operation coordinated enough to pull off a caper of this magnitude, they have already had six months to pick targets out of that massive database they stole.\n\nThe only thing that makes it plausible this might not have been a Chinese military operation is that the U.S. government\u2019s extremely expensive security system was penetrated with disturbing ease.\n\n\u201cThe breach was an embarrassing showing for the U.S. government\u2019s vaunted computer-defense system for civilian agencies \u2014 dubbed \u2018Einstein\u2019 \u2014 which is costing $376 million this year alone,\u201d the Boston Herald reports. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to detect unusual Internet traffic that might reflect hacking attempts or stolen data being transmitted outside the government.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Herald compared the performance of the system to \u201ca smoke alarm sounding after the house burned down.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Business reveals the Einstein-3 system was \u201cbehind schedule, the result of inter-agency fights over privacy, control and other matters, and only about half of the government was protected when the hackers raided OPM\u2019s databases last December.\u201d\n\nEven that protection is already outdated, as James Lewis, senior fellow in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained: \u201cEinstein 3 was state of the art two years ago. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not enough, and we know that because the commercial security industry is already moving away from that kind of defense.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the Obama White House did what it always does in moments of national crisis, and began pointing fingers of blame at everyone else, specifically blaming Congress for not signing President Obama\u2019s preferred cybersecurity legislation.\n\n\u201cThis Administration is notorious for not working with Congress, but they could at least read the news,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) responded in a statement. \u201cCongress has, in fact, passed cyber legislation, and the House has been leading on this issue for years.\u201d\n\nThe White House is also going to have a hard time blaming anyone else for OPM\u2019s failure to encrypt the data that was stolen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chinese Hackers Easily Defeated Secret US Government Security System", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Chinese Hackers Easily Defeated Secret US Government Security System", "title": "Chinese Hackers Easily Defeated Secret US Government Security System", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/AP546380141718.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-07T16:25:52-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/07/chinese-hackers-easily-defeated-secret-us-government-security-system/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chinese Hackers Easily Defeated Secret US Government Security System", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/AP546380141718.jpg", "title": "Chinese Hackers Easily Defeated Secret US Government Security System", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "China, data security, department of homeland security, first cyber war, hacking, office of personnel management,Big Government, Data, National Security,hacker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-07T14:56:42-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-07T16:25:52-07:00", "tag": "office of personnel management", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,Data"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb53e\"", "article_summary": "The only thing that makes it plausible this might not have been a Chinese military operation is that the U.S. government\u2019s extremely expensive security system was penetrated with disturbing ease.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe news about the massive data breach of the Office of Personnel Management, and other federal agencies, by Chinese hackers just keeps getting worse.\nIt now appears security clearance applications and background checks dating back 30 years were compromised.\nEven so, some experts are saying the damage could have been contained if the government had taken better precautions to protect the pilfered data.\nHewlett-Packard security expert Mark Bower explained to the Christian Science Monitor that data already taken by these thieves could be used to construct massive \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, i.e."}
