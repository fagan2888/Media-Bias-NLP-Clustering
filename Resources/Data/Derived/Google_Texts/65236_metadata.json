This time, it\u2019s over a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. The House passed the bill, but with a provision that defunds President Obama\u2019s so-called \u201camnesty\u201d program for undocumented immigrants.\n\nObama has said he won\u2019t sign the bill; neither side appears ready to budge. The possible result: a shutdown \u2014or slowdown, really\u2014at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWho wins and who loses in another shutdown? RedBlueAmerica columnists Joel Mathis and Ben Boychuk debate.\n\nJoel Mathis\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: In the event of a Homeland Security shutdown, there will be no Homeland Security shutdown.\n\nIt\u2019s true. Government never entirely turns out the lights\u2014\u201cessential\u201d employees are expected to stay on the job, even if they\u2019re unable to collect a paycheck for the duration. Well, in the Department of Homeland Security, there are precious few employees who aren\u2019t essential. We\u2019re going to let the borders go unguarded? The Coast Guard is going to stop protecting our shores? Airline traffic is going to halt so that security screeners can go home?\n\nNot a chance on earth.\n\nSo President Obama has nothing to lose by holding fast to a veto threat. And congressional Republicans don\u2019t sacrifice that much \u2014 they just irritate thousands of Americans whose job is to keep us safe, but those Americans are government employees, and Republicans don\u2019t like them much anyway. It\u2019s a recipe for perpetual deadlock.\n\nAt least it\u2019s a hilarious deadlock.\n\nWhy? Because when Democrats held the White House and Senate, Republicans had just enough members\u2014or, in some cases, a wise-enough command of procedure\u2014to prevent much of consequence from happening. America\u2019s immigration laws could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve been overhauled during those years, but the GOP had just one mission during that time: To keep President Obama from getting any political victories. To a remarkable extent, Republican succeeded.\n\nWell, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander, and now the shoe is on the goose\u2019s other foot. Pick your metaphor, but it\u2019s always funny when somebody finds out that what goes around comes around. It\u2019s frustrating when a determined minority keeps the majority from governing effectively, isn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat\u2019s that leave us with, then? Posturing and gridlock. You can\u2019t be too cynical for American politics. The shutdown that isn\u2019t a shutdown is just the latest proof.\n\nBen Boychuk\n\nThe obvious split between Congress and President Obama concerns a disagreement over immigration policy. But this isn\u2019t just another stupid partisan mud wrestling match. In reality, the \u201cshutdown\u201d stare down is really a disagreement over the U.S. Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t know it from the media coverage, such as it is. A CNN/ORC International poll this week found that 53 percent of U.S. adults would blame Republicans if Congress refuses to fund the Homeland Security department before the end of the month.\n\nSo what? Memories are short. Republicans in 2013 supposedly ensured their destruction in the 2014 midterms when they forced a shutdown over Obamacare. Somehow, the GOP managed to rout the Democrats anyway.\n\nForget the Beltway finger pointing and focus on the issue at hand: Congress makes the laws and the president enforces them.\n\nPresident Obama in 2012 and again last year invoked his \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d to exempt millions of people from deportation. Past presidents have acted similarly, usually in the midst of humanitarian crises, but never to the extent Obama has. This is clearly a case of executive overreach. The president has discretion, but he cannot ignore the law.\n\nA federal district court judge in Texas on Tuesday may have given Republicans an out when he temporarily blocked the president\u2019s executive action. But deferring to the courts does not resolve the underlying constitutional crisis. Congress is a coequal branch of government. It doesn\u2019t need a court\u2019s approval to assert its constitutional prerogatives.\n\nAt least a few Republicans understand this.\n\n\u201cThe president has acted unconstitutionally, and it is the president \u2014not Congress \u2014who must back down,\u201d Sen. Pete Sessions, R-Alabama, said Tuesday. \u201cWe cannot and must not establish the precedent that we will fund illegal actions on the hope that another branch of government will intervene and strike down that illegal action at some later point.\u201d\n\nExactly. Congress is not a parliament and the president is not a king. President Obama has long labored under the misapprehension that Congress exists to rubberstamp his agenda. Let a DHS shutdown remind him that it is not so.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1EufkaX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Congressional gridlock : Shoe is now on other goose\u2019s foot", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Congressional gridlock : Shoe is now on other goose\u2019s foot", "title": "Congress and gridlock", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/02/19/congress-gridlock/23697957/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congressional gridlock : Shoe is now on other goose\u2019s foot", "title": "Congress and gridlock", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b7044159fb8ca65b23fb3bd3201529e4f8cfaf0/c=154-0-1445-1291&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Homeland Security", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Homeland Security", "title": "Congress and gridlock", "author": "Joel Mathis and Ben Boychuk", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d8d9867de96f59e3ef38e4910c033924aac520e/c=316-0-1284-1291/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30914861561563005a82ae8852cbd03ad42f8418/c=154-0-1445-1291/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d5a8331c577f591c9b4183caf1129e0311df063/c=0-46-1600-1246/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc1a7c5feaab6c623aa742ddcad420b4fba5e8fa/c=0-196-1600-1096&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-02-19T17:06:33-05:00", "shorthed": "Congress and gridlock", "articleid": 23697957, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04747f7d33a5ec8914eaa27d73a58389357f30f6/c=0-196-1600-1096/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91e3fe30cf5bf8115436e24a881d2181cbb08e37/c=437-0-1163-1291/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/02/19/B9316314679Z.1_20150219170633_000_G2NA0KCRA.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebb1\"", "article_summary": "Joel MathisHere\u2019s the good news: In the event of a Homeland Security shutdown, there will be no Homeland Security shutdown.\nBen BoychukThe obvious split between Congress and President Obama concerns a disagreement over immigration policy.\nPresident Obama has long labored under the misapprehension that Congress exists to rubberstamp his agenda.\n\u201cThe president has acted unconstitutionally, and it is the president \u2014not Congress \u2014who must back down,\u201d Sen.
