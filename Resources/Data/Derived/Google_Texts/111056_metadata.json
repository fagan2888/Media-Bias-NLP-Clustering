Passed by a vote of 134-3, the bill \u2014 HB 1338 \u2014 explicitly states that \u201ca government entity shall not obtain the location information of an electronic device without a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nShould the proposed law be breached, the location data gathered would \u201cnot admissible in a civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding,\u201d rendering it useless to police. What\u2019s more, the bill even says that location data gathered without a warrant \u201cshall not be used in an affidavit of probable cause in an effort to obtain a search warrant.\u201d In theory, this means that the police would be barred from obtaining a search warrant of your apartment if they managed to learn you were at the scene of a crime from your cellphone\u2019s location data and they hadn\u2019t gotten a warrant to search your phone first.\n\nSeveral exemptions are carved out where the police can still gather that information without a court\u2019s approval. The scope of most are fairly limited: if the device is reported as stolen; if the owner gives express permission; or if the owner has put in a call to 911 or other emergency services. It does, however, still leave open the potential fo location tracking if \u201ca possible life-threatening situation exists\u201d \u2014 a distinction the bill does not elaborate upon.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage in the House means it will move on to the Senate, where it will have to be debated and voted upon before it can reach the desk of Gov. Jay Nixon (D). Two other bills currently under discussion in the Missouri legislature deal more with survellience concerns, particularly those that have emerged in the aftermath of revelations relating to the National Security Agency\u2019s use of domestic communications networks to track potential terrorists. These bills go much further than HB1338, with one calling for removal of Missouri\u2019s support for the NSA so long as their surveillance programs remain in place \u2014 a call mirrored in other states that could potentially have much further-reaching implications than supporters predict.\n\nMissouri is just one of several states working to change the way that government agencies can gather location-tracking data from cell phones. Two states\u2019 supreme courts \u2014 Massachusetts and New Jersey \u2014 have recently ruled that police have to obtain warrants before utilizing location information. Others like Maryland and Wisconsin currently have legislation pending along the same lines as Missouri\u2019s.\n\nThe ability of law enforcement to track civilians\u2019 locations without a warrant has become a major concern for privacy advocates in recent years. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 2011 sent out a call to hundreds of local law enforcement agencies, gathering information about how they use cellphone\u2019s location data. The result, they said, shows that though \u201ccell phone tracking is routine, few agencies consistently obtain warrants. Importantly, however, some agencies do obtain warrants, showing that law enforcement agencies can protect Americans\u2019 privacy while also meeting law enforcement needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Missouri is the latest state to see a local push against tracking cell phone locations without court approval.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Missouri is the latest state to see a local push against tracking cell phone locations without court approval.", "title": "Missouri Moves To Ban Use Of Cellphone Tracking Without Warrants", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/03/16/3410441/missouri-moves-to-ban-use-of-cellphone-tracking-without-warrants/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119724172.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Missouri is the latest state to see a local push against tracking cell phone locations without court approval.", "creator": "@HayesBrown", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119724172-321x214.jpg", "title": "Missouri Moves To Ban Use Of Cellphone Tracking Without Warrants", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119724172.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_119724172.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-16T12:51:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a31\"", "article_summary": "Importantly, however, some agencies do obtain warrants, showing that law enforcement agencies can protect Americans\u2019 privacy while also meeting law enforcement needs.\u201d\nJustice Missouri Moves To Ban Use Of Cellphone Tracking Without Warrants CREDIT: Shutterstock.comMissouri\u2019s state legislature took steps last Thursday to ban the use of cellphone tracking data in court absent a warrant, the latest state-level push to bring privacy laws in line with rapidly changing technology.\nThe result, they said, shows that though \u201ccell phone tracking is routine, few agencies consistently obtain warrants.\nTwo states\u2019 supreme courts \u2014 Massachusetts and New Jersey \u2014 have recently ruled that police have to obtain warrants before utilizing location information.\nIt does, however, still leave open the potential fo location tracking if \u201ca possible life-threatening situation exists\u201d \u2014 a distinction the bill does not elaborate upon."}
