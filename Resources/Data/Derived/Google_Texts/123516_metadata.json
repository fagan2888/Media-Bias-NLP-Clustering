Trump is not conservative. He has personally utilized crony capitalism. He vacillates wildly on foreign policy. He believes in big government with bigger taxes. Nearly as important, he says cringe-worthy things, from his knock on Senator John McCain\u2019s (R-AZ) war service to his spokesperson telling CNN with regard to would-be Muslim immigrants, \u201cSo what? They\u2019re Muslim.\u201d\n\nBy the same token, much of the fervent establishment opposition to Trump overlaps with establishment opposition to Cruz \u2014 even though he\u2019s the most conservative candidate in the field, doesn\u2019t dabble with \u2018politically correct\u2019 pieties, and probably boasts of the highest IQ in the Republican field.\n\nHerein lies the problem.\n\nThe establishment seems unwilling to throw over any of its candidates in favor of someone like Cruz, because they disagree with regard to policy and approach with Cruz. But then they complain that Donald Trump isn\u2019t conservative enough.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump wins by forcing himself to their right on issue after issue.\n\nAnd so they mourn.\n\nDenial and Isolation. It began with the entire Republican punditocracy pooh-poohing Trump\u2019s massive national polling lead. They said that he would inevitably falter, that at some point the Republican electorate would turn to a more \u201cserious\u201d candidate. Then, as Trump maintained his lead, they began questioning the polls. Kasich as well as Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) have in recent days questioned the veracity of the polls that put Trump well ahead. The \u201cTrump Will Fail\u201d self-assurance that characterized so many commentators has now given way to something else: the next stage of grief.\n\nAnger. To be fair, there were those who were angry with Republicans who backed Trump from the start. Now, they\u2019re apoplectic. From Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to Bush, the grumpy comparisons between Trump and Hitler have begun. Members of Republican media are now attacking others in Republican media who don\u2019t see Trump as the gravest threat to the Republican Party or the republic; they bash Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin for focusing in on the left and the media, rather than on stopping Trump. They can\u2019t understand why, with a smooth, handsome, sophisticated candidate like Rubio in the race, Trump continues to win admirers and dominate the media coverage.\n\nBargaining. A few Republican opponents of Trump have moved to this third stage of grief. They\u2019ve begun dealing with the baseline reality: stopping Trump will happen not by waiting for him to keel over, but by consolidating around an alternative candidate. Those Republicans who like Rubio, for example, will have to push Christie, Bush, and Kasich out of the race, and redirect their resources to Rubio. They still refuse the ultimate victorious defeat-Trump strategy: endorsing Cruz, who is most likely to take votes away from Trump, and who has been picking up the bleeding from the Carson campaign. Were the Republican establishment to bite their tongues and turn to Cruz, Trump would be done. But they won\u2019t. The bargaining hasn\u2019t gone that far.\n\nDepression. That means depression. Without a winning strategy against Trump, commentators are turning to Doomsday predictions. Like crazy people on street corners warning of the coming apocalypse, they preach inevitable defeat against Hillary Clinton and the destruction of the Republican Party should Trump win the nomination outright \u2013 and some even worry that Trump will win, and then destroy the world. They hope that this naysaying will somehow convince Republicans to turn aside from Trump. Instead, these hysterical fits simply prompt Trump supporters, who despise the Republican Party, into paroxysms of laughter: they\u2019d love nothing better than to take control of the Party away from those who preach doom and gloom after bringing us John McCain and Mitt Romney.\n\nAcceptance. Should Trump continue his winning streak, the establishment will eventually settle behind him. Forget the bloviation of John \u201cMy Father Was a Mailman\u201d Kasich \u2013 nobody cares about him anyhow. Standing on the other side of the election is Hillary Clinton, the right\u2019s worst nightmare for more than two decades. Truthfully, the establishment fears a Cruz candidacy more than a Trump candidacy \u2013 should Trump lose, they can blame the base, then say that Trump was a clownish representative of the Party anyway. They\u2019ll get behind him.\n\nThe same will not be true if the worst should happen: a brokered convention after which Trump is pushed out of the nomination. If that happens, Trump\u2019s supporters will see their man as the loser in a tug-of-war with the establishment, and they\u2019ll bolt with him, given that one of the reasons for their support of Trump is his rip on the establishment as corrupt and self-dealing.\n\nAnd so we are left with three possibilities: defeating Trump in the primaries; losing to Trump in the primaries; and a brokered convention preventing Trump from winning, after which the party collapses.\n\nThe establishment hopes for the first, prepares for the third, and has no plan whatsoever for the second.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News, Editor-in-Chief of DailyWire.com, and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
