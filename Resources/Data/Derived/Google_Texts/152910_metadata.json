Anschel knew the compact home, which sat on a corner lot in Minneapolis\u2019 Victory neighborhood, had expansion potential. Plus he could walk to work. \u201cIt was in excellent condition, with all the original materials,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd had a great south view for passive solar heat.\u201d\n\nOver the next three years, Anschel designed a kitchen addition and built a new second story, more than doubling the home\u2019s size. \u201cI wanted to take an old house, give it new life and make it big enough for a family of four,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd have it be healthy, energy-efficient \u2014 and have low utility bills.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Anschel put his firm\u2019s mission and building methods to the test. He spearheaded the development of the pioneering Minnesota GreenStar certification program, a set of green-building guidelines aimed at increasing durability, energy-efficiency and indoor air quality in new and remodeled homes. His Minneapolis bungalow became one of the six pilot homes evaluated before the program was launched.\n\n\u201cWe pulled a lot of the best practices from Otogawa-Anschel for the GreenStar program, and wanted to test some of them to make sure the program credits matched up with what we believed was good green building,\u201d he said. Today GreenStar is run by the GreenHome Institute and has expanded to seven states.\n\nBut as a new homeowner in 2003, Anschel was more focused on having a kitchen with more than one counter to make meals. The day after he moved in, he had a hole dug for a 110-square-foot bump-out off the side of the house. Anschel designed the new G-shaped peninsula-style kitchen to \u201cgive the cook good working space,\u201d he said. It features a remnant granite counter with a hand-polished wavy edge, a signature in many of Anschel\u2019s projects. Wide-plank walnut floors are combined with maple cabinets and a backsplash composed of reclaimed tile from North Prairie Tileworks.\n\nMichael Anschel\u2019s green-conscious kitchen addition on his home.\n\nFor the next remodeling phase, Anschel tore off the second floor and built a vaulted second story, clad in fiber-cement siding, which extends out over the kitchen. It houses a family room with a library and two bedrooms, including a master suite outfitted with skylights.\n\nThe suite boasts amenities that many homeowners want today, such as a walk-in closet, attached bathroom with a heated floor and oversized shower. Anschel splurged on a luxe Toto Neorest toilet that has a heated seat, which he discovered while living in Japan.\n\nIn the family room, French doors open to a sheltered low-maintenance composite deck to draw in the breezes. Outfitted with a hammock, it\u2019s a favorite napping spot.\n\nAnschel designed the layout of the second floor to be a hybrid of contemporary and traditional styles. \u201cThe high-vaulted ceilings and large master suite have a more contemporary flavor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe millwork and reclaimed materials keep it rooted in the old world.\u201d\n\nHe also updated and improved the main floor, including enclosing the front porch and installing new swing-in windows, but kept the original beadboard ceiling. \u201cAfter work, I sit on the front porch, have a glass of wine and read the mail,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Anschel\u2019s transformation, the four-bedroom home is now 1,500 square feet. It\u2019s also more energy-efficient and sustainable for the next generations of owners, thanks to green materials and products such as spray-foam insulation, high-efficiency furnace, dual-flush toilets and eucalyptus flooring. The new roof is made of durable, long-lasting steel. Low-VOC paints and finishes cover the surfaces for healthier indoor air. And a low-mow, eco-friendly yard includes native-plant rain gardens to filter stormwater.\n\nMany features of the Anschel home renovation were progressive years ago, but with a strong green building movement, they\u2019ve become mainstream today. \u201cA steel roof was unusual in 2006 \u2014 but you see it all over now,\u201d he said.\n\nAnschel is selling his pioneering bungalow because he\u2019s experienced some life changes and today is living with his family in south Minneapolis. \u201cI\u2019d like to find a buyer who will love it and take care of it,\u201d said Anschel. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place.\u201d\n\nRobin Voreis of Keller Williams Intregrity Lakes has the listing, 612-759-1878, www.robinvoreisrealestate.com.
