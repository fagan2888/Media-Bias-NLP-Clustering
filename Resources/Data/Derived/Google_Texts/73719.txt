Golden Fire-Rescue crews rescued a duck from a chimney Saturday night, proving they’re not quacks.

Firefighters responded to a call from a woman who said the plucky bird had taken up residence in her chimney, according to the department’s Facebook page.

The duck, who merely wanted a reprieve from the cold, almost got more than it bargained. Luckily she decided it was best to avoid using the fireplace.

It took crews several attempts to free the duck, who waddled away with a clean bill of health.

Firefighters bathed their new feathered friend in the homeowner’s kitchen sink and then sent him back out into the storm.
