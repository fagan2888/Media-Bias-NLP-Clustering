A new study by Rails-To-Trails Conservancy says nearly 823,000 people visit the heritage trail annually, with 65 percent using the trail year-round. Biking makes up 44 percent of the primary activity, according to the study, and walking 33 percent. The trail has an annual economic impact estimated at $8.3 million.\n\nLast year, more than 1,700 volunteers contributed more than 5,300 hours of service to Friends of the Riverfront at 50 Three Rivers Heritage Trail events, according to the organization.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
