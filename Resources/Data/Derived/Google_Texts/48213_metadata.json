As the leader of the Velvet Underground and a solo artist, he wrote some of the most iconic, weirdest and transcendent rock music we\u2019ll ever get to hear. He will be missed.\n\nHere are seven songs to mark the sad occasion. They are great songs, but they are far from his only great songs. Feel free to add your own favorites in the comments.\n\nRock & Roll\n\nThis song is basically the description of what hearing Lou Reed for the first time feels like, so it seems fitting to start any rumination on Reed\u2019s legacy here.\n\n\n\n\n\nI Found a Reason\n\nPeople often cite \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d as Reed\u2019s most romantic (read: wedding appropriate) song, but for me it\u2019s always been this one. It isn\u2019t nearly as effusive, but \u201cI Found a Reason\u201d captures something about love\u2019s optimistic and forward-looking nature that has always struck me as beautiful.\n\nThe slightly more uptempo demo version is also not to be missed.\n\nI\u2019m Waiting for the Man\n\nReed\u2019s perfectly rendered ode to one of New York City\u2019s most iconic pastimes: degeneratism.\n\nStreet Hassle\n\nLike \u201cConey Island Baby,\u201d there is no reason that this 11 minute sprawler should work, and yet it does. Dedicating this much time to a song about drugs and death (well-trod territory for Reed) might be a challenge for some listeners, but the song is worth it. And patience is rewarded in the penultimate verse with an uncredited spoken cameo by Bruce Springsteen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From \"Rock & Roll\" to \"Street Hassle,\" seven of Salon's favorite Velvet Underground and Lou Reed songs  VIDEO", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From \"Rock & Roll\" to \"Street Hassle,\" seven of Salon's favorite Velvet Underground and Lou Reed songs  VIDEO", "title": "Remembering Lou Reed: 7 of our favorite songs", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/27/remembering_lou_reed_7_of_our_favorite_songs/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/AP0007300445-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"Rock & Roll\" to \"Street Hassle,\" seven of Salon's favorite Velvet Underground and Lou Reed songs  VIDEO", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/AP0007300445-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Remembering Lou Reed: 7 of our favorite songs", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Remembering Lou Reed: 7 of our favorite songs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, lou reed, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8265\"", "article_summary": "They are great songs, but they are far from his only great songs.\nTopics: lou reed, Video, Life News, Entertainment News, NewsLou Reed died on Sunday at the age of 71.\nRock & RollThis song is basically the description of what hearing Lou Reed for the first time feels like, so it seems fitting to start any rumination on Reed\u2019s legacy here.\nDedicating this much time to a song about drugs and death (well-trod territory for Reed) might be a challenge for some listeners, but the song is worth it.\nI\u2019m Waiting for the ManReed\u2019s perfectly rendered ode to one of New York City\u2019s most iconic pastimes: degeneratism."}
