Open enrollment in the new health insurance exchanges may last until March, but White House allies know that a negative narrative can get established early if system failures pile up and people sour on the new programs.\n\nTheir challenge: to claim the law is working when every problem will be under a microscope.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that anything as significant as initiation of the enrollment period can experience anything but a number of glitches,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of the consumer group Families USA. He said he couldn\u2019t think of another health care program that was this complicated to launch \u2014 not the Medicare prescription drug program, and not even Medicare itself.\n\n\u201cI think that, to the extent that there will be a number of glitches inevitably, it\u2019s just important to keep some perspective about them,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nOther enthusiastic Obamacare supporters aren\u2019t expecting a polished product on the first day of open enrollment. That\u2019s why one of their biggest fears is that opinions on the health law could start hardening before the close of business on Oct. 1 \u2014 aided, of course, by opponents whose \u201cObamacare has failed\u201d press releases are already being written.\n\n( WATCH: Obamacare timeline)\n\nPollack said one way to win the narrative on Oct. 1 will be to shine a spotlight on the people who get insurance for the first time. He said his group is \u201cradically enlarging our story bank\u201d of people who are being helped by the law, and plans to hold a rally at the National Press Club on Oct. 1 to showcase the best stories.\n\nConnecticut exchange CEO Kevin Counihan, who helped launch the Massachusetts health exchange that became the model for Obamacare, said the most important metric for him on Oct. 1 will be the \u201cstability\u201d of the complex information technology infrastructure supporting Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nBut even if his state\u2019s IT runs smoothly, the interaction with the federally built data hub that exchanges will interact with could be \u201cclunky\u201d at first, he predicted.\n\n\u201cThe problems are going to get fixed and everyone needs to take a deep breath,\u201d said Counihan, who described himself as \u201cpretty confident\u201d that the Connecticut exchange\u2019s technology systems are ready to go on Oct. 1.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's health care conversion)\n\nIn fact, how problems are addressed on the first day could be a measurement of the law\u2019s success, some advocates argue.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that problem-solving is working smoothly is more important than having a problem-free first day,\u201d said one enrollment advocate who declined to be identified. \u201cCertainly there will be hiccups in the early going \u2014 the most important thing will be to quickly identify those issues, find ways to solve them and then share those solutions with others around the country so that the system as a whole works better and better as we move forward.\u201d\n\nGary Cohen, the Obama administration\u2019s exchange chief, last week braced Congress for what could be a bumpy rollout \u2014 and just hours later, The Wall Street Journal reported that software for the federally run exchanges set to launch in 34 states was miscalculating how much consumers would pay for health coverage.\n\nBut Cohen suggested negative opinions formed early in Obamacare\u2019s implementation won\u2019t last forever \u2014 citing the turbulent early days of the Medicare prescription drug program a few years ago.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obamacare: One blow after another)\n\n\u201cThe people who benefit from this law won\u2019t be talking about what happened Oct. 1 or Jan. 1,\u201d when coverage first kicks in, said Cohen, director of the federal Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, which is implementing the health care law.\n\nOf course, the administration wants to see as smooth a rollout as possible. To gauge that success, it\u2019s looking at internal benchmarks like the response time for the consumer call center and whether premiums are being processed correctly, Cohen told the House panel last week.\n\nAnd then there are the more obvious benchmarks, like how many people sign up. The administration is aiming for 7 million enrolled exchange customers by the end of March, and supporters aren\u2019t expecting a huge enrollment rush in the first few weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd to think that on the morning of Oct. 1, 25 million people without health insurance are going to be struck by lightning and know that they can jump online and get insurance,\u201d said Ethan Rome, executive director of Health Care for America Now. \u201cWith the exception of the first shopping day after Thanksgiving \u2014 and Election Day \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to judge anything by one day.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Rand Paul on Obamacare compromise: 'Maybe')\n\nCritics of the law have their own benchmarks for the first day of Obamacare enrollment.\n\nTom Miller of the American Enterprise Institute said the total failure of any state-run exchange to open on Oct. 1, however unlikely, would be the most obvious disaster.\n\nBut Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center had an even simpler metric: the amount of paper used by exchange officials to compensate for technological failures.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty strong expectation from their people on the industry side that it\u2019s going to be very, very bumpy, and a lot of paper processes are going to have to override a lot of the automated process,\u201d he said.\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum worries the administration could spin the stats on Oct. 1 to present a more favorable outcome.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: At Kentucky state fair, fear and confusion over Obamacare)\n\n\u201cThe people who are going to show up on Day One are by definition those with the strongest interest in the program,\u201d the former Congressional Budget Office director said. \u201cI have no idea how much get-out-the-vote effort the administration has mustered.\u201d\n\nHoltz-Eakin also suggested that even if the first day is a technological disaster, the public might never know.\n\n\u201cSuppose someone wakes up in Eugene, Ore., sits down at a terminal and tries to sign up and can\u2019t. They just close their laptop. We\u2019ll never see it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real question about how transparent state and federal officials will be about failures.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Allies say grades shouldn\u2019t be based on Day One.", "title": "How stakeholders will judge ACA", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/how-stakeholders-will-judge-obamacare-on-day-one-97257.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/24/130924_barack_obama_white_house_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Industry (2),Barack Obama (11328),Health Care (1562),Health Insurers (11),Health Exchanges,States (54),Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Allies say grades shouldn\u2019t be based on Day One.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f06\"", "article_summary": "When health exchange enrollment launches, every problem will be under a microscope.\nHe said he couldn\u2019t think of another health care program that was this complicated to launch \u2014 not the Medicare prescription drug program, and not even Medicare itself.\n| REUTERS How stakeholders will judge ACAObamacare allies couldn\u2019t be clearer: The Oct. 1 launch of major new health coverage programs is the dawn of a new era, the first day of school for a nation that needs a health care education.\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's health care conversion)In fact, how problems are addressed on the first day could be a measurement of the law\u2019s success, some advocates argue.\nOther enthusiastic Obamacare supporters aren\u2019t expecting a polished product on the first day of open enrollment."}
