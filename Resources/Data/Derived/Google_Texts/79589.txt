A 43-year-old man was arrested Monday in Ventura after struggling with an officer to get into his patrol car, police said.

An officer responded about 5:40 p.m. to a crash near East Main Street and Telephone Road. He was told by people in the area that Anthony Partida, of Ventura, was trying to fight people in their cars, police said.

The suspect later tried to open the passenger door of the patrol car while the officer was still inside, and when he couldn't open it, he reached through the window to open the door from the inside, police said. Partida continued trying to get into the patrol car despite the officer telling him to stop.

Eventually, the officer got out of his car and confronted the suspect, who then rushed the officer and wrapped his arms around him, police said. The officer tried to push Partida away, but the suspect used his forehead to hit the officer in the chin, officials said. The officer got Partida onto the ground, where the struggle continued, but he eventually was arrested, police said.

Partida told other officers at the scene that he tried to get into the officer's car because he "needed a ride and had places to go," police said in a news release.

The suspect was treated at Ventura County Medical Center for minor injuries and was later booked into jail on suspicion of battery on a police officer and violently resisting arrest, police said. The officer was treated at the scene for minor injuries.
