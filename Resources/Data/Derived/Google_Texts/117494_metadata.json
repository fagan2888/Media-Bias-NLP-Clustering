Smugglers are wealthy. They change tactics and use modern equipment that makes it more and more difficult to discover. We need new, modern equipment to combat drugs effectively,\u201d Gen. Ali Moayedi, Iran\u2019s anti-narcotics police chief, said during a recent tour of the border.\n\nNeighboring Afghanistan has all the makings of a narco-state and is the main source of drugs coming into Iran and headed to other markets in Europe and the United States.\n\nLast year, 209,000 hectares (806 square miles) of poppies were planted across Afghanistan, up 36 percent over the year before. They produced an estimated 5,500 metric tons (6,062 tons) of opium, according to the United Nations drug agency. By comparison, only a little over 7,000 hectares (27 square miles) of poppy field were eradicated.\n\nThe 2014 harvest is expected to match or even exceed last year\u2019s record. In coming years, opium will grab an even larger share of Afghanistan\u2019s already troubled economy, as money from U.S. military contracts and aid work dries up. The U.N. estimates that some 200,000 families in Afghanistan are involved in opium production already and that the country has some 1 million addicts.\n\nAs a share of Afghanistan\u2019s economy, opium looms large: The U.N. estimates the potential gross value of Afghan opiates last year was around $3 billion \u2014 equal to 15 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, we confiscated 573 tons of various kinds of narcotics from drug smugglers, showing a 14 percent increase compared to 2012,\u201d Ali Reza Jazini, a senior Iranian counter-narcotics official, told foreign diplomats as they visited Iran\u2019s border with Afghanistan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iran tries to block Afghanistan\u2019s opium boom", "title": "Iran tries to block Afghanistan\u2019s opium boom", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Iran tries to block Afghanistan\u2019s opium boom", "title": "Iran tries to block Afghanistan\u2019s opium boom", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/04/iran_tries_to_block_afghanistans_opium_boom/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-iran-narcotics.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iran tries to block Afghanistan\u2019s opium boom", "title": "Iran tries to block Afghanistan\u2019s opium boom", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-iran-narcotics.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ali Akbar Dareini", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f02\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsTAIBAD, Iran (AP) \u2014 In the face of Afghanistan\u2019s unprecedented boom in opium production, neighboring Iran is trying to baton down its border to slow down smuggling, building moats, walls and other large-scale projects.\nThey produced an estimated 5,500 metric tons (6,062 tons) of opium, according to the United Nations drug agency.\nIn coming years, opium will grab an even larger share of Afghanistan\u2019s already troubled economy, as money from U.S. military contracts and aid work dries up.\nAs a share of Afghanistan\u2019s economy, opium looms large: The U.N. estimates the potential gross value of Afghan opiates last year was around $3 billion \u2014 equal to 15 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\nThe U.N. estimates that some 200,000 families in Afghanistan are involved in opium production already and that the country has some 1 million addicts."}
