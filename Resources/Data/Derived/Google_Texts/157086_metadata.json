The liberal is in the minority on Fox News\u2019s punditry lineup, but she\u2019s carved out a niche that rankles some Democrats. (Bonnie Jo Mount/Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI was a Kool-Aid-drinking Democrat,\u201d Kirsten Powers recalls wryly.\n\nThat was in her 20s and early 30s, when she was an operator on the rise \u2014 first in the Clinton administration, when she handled media strategy for the U.S. trade representative, and later in New York City, where she threw herself into the state\u2019s electoral politics. Her self-identity was built around being a loyal team player, with all the pressures and camaraderie that came with it. She thrived in the game of us vs. them, viewed her ideological opponents as \u201cstupid and evil,\u201d she says, and woke up every morning determined to beat them.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t recall knowing a single conservative during those years.\n\nBut her career didn\u2019t kick into high gear until she took that identity \u2014 the bright-eyed, sharp-tongued, gamely combative liberal activist \u2014 to a place where her brand stood out in bold relief. For the past eight years, Powers has made her name by being a prominent liberal pundit on Fox News \u2014 albeit one with less-than-orthodox liberal views. She\u2019s on her own team now.\n\nAnd it can be a lonely place.\n\nAs the political world turns to the 2016 presidential race, Powers and other pundits move closer to the center of the media universe \u2014 primed to tell Americans what they should think about each candidate, each issue, each news blip of the day. Powers, 47, often finds herself tasked with presenting a dissenting view on Fox. But nearly as often as she stands with Democrats \u2014 challenging Bill O\u2019Reilly point by point when he blasts President Obama as weak on foreign policy, for instance \u2014 she takes her own party to task.\n\nIn a new book, Powers has harsh words for left-wing activists, whom she accuses of strategically shutting down political debate. A bestseller in e-book form with the hyperbolic title \u201cThe Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech,\u201d it has become a favorite of conservatives while drawing side-eye from her Democratic compatriots \u2014 among whom she counts several close friends.\n\nShe \u201chas been someone who is willing to take a contrarian view,\u201d says Jamal Simmons, a longtime buddy and former co-worker on the trade representative\u2019s staff. Powers and Simmons, who has been a commentator on CNN and MSNBC, don\u2019t talk politics much anymore.\n\nFor Powers\u2019s liberal friends, following her arguments can seem like tracing a winding river, marked by unexpected tributaries and confusing crosscurrents. She supports same-sex marriage but defends those who oppose marriage equality because of \u201ca sincere belief often grounded in a Christian worldview.\u201d She is a Christian herself, but she also chided small-business owners who, in the name of faith, balk at making wedding cakes or providing flowers for gay weddings. Jesus would bake the cake, she says. She opposes abortion rights but supported the Affordable Care Act. She would like immigrants who are in the country illegally to have amnesty. She opposed the Iraq war.\n\nSome liberal activists doubt her allegiance to progressive causes and call her a turncoat, while conservative commenters on her Facebook page love to tease her. One posted: \u201cYou\u2019ve lost that liberal feelin\u2019 . . . Whoa that liberal feelin\u2019.\u201d\n\nPowers describes the reaction to her commentary bluntly, the way she describes everything: \u201cI\u2019m perpetually confused. Just the fact that I\u2019m on Fox News means that somehow I\u2019m not a liberal? I can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s just ignorance or if there\u2019s something more nefarious about it. Wouldn\u2019t you determine whether I\u2019m a liberal based on what my views are?\u201d\n\nAn Alaska native, Powers grew up around frontier women who fished, hunted and rode snow machines just like the guys. She learned the art of debate around the family dinner table in Fairbanks, where her parents were professors and among the few liberals in town. They often discussed politics, and Powers was taught to defend her views \u2014 \u201ca necessary survival skill, as our family was surrounded by people who believed liberalism was the root of all evil,\u201d she wrote in her book.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Maryland, she settled in Washington and joined the Clinton administration. After a private-sector stint in the communications shop of AOL, she moved to New York to try her hand at political consulting.\n\nA friend encouraged her to do television. Powers, who disliked public speaking, was reluctant. But after her father died suddenly in 2004, she accepted TV bookings just to get herself out of the house.\n\nIt turned out that she was good at it. The top brass at Fox certainly thought so. Roger Ailes, the news channel\u2019s chairman and chief executive, called her into his office, she recalls, and asked, \u201cDo you want to do this full time?\u201d\n\nTwo unrelated things happened then that shifted her worldview. Working closely with the conservative pundits at Fox caused Powers to drop her belief that right-wing thinkers were anti-intellectual. And she started dating a man who was a Christian. Formerly an atheist, she began to go to church. An article she wrote about her conversion became Christianity Today magazine\u2019s most-read Web story in 2013, e-mailed all around in evangelical circles.\n\nPowers says she remains a political liberal, though she began to write about her faith more often and was one of the first pundits to focus on the case of Kermit Gosnell, the abortion provider convicted of first-degree murder. Powers opposes late-term abortions but says she is not focused on overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThese, then, are the questions that Powers finds herself fielding, from friends and viewers alike: How has this liberal absorbed the conservative influences that have come into her life? Have they changed her politics? Is she a closet conservative? Can she be both a liberal and a faithful Christian?\n\nShe has lost pals, on the left and right, who cannot countenance being associated with someone who disagrees with them on politics or policy. She tells her perplexed friends on both sides of the aisle: \u201cYou guys know you\u2019re just alike, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nKirsten Powers on \u201cThe O'Reilly Factor.\u201d (Fox News)\n\nKirsten Powers on Fox News. (Fox News)\n\nA typical week for Powers goes like this: On Monday, her USA Today column published. On Tuesday, she sparred with O\u2019Reilly. (She\u2019s a weekly guest on his show, where he will good-naturedly bark at her: \u201cOkay, Powers, tell me where I\u2019m wrong.\u201d) On Wednesday, she was a guest on another Fox show and took to the radio waves to promote her book. On Thursday and Friday, she was in New York for the taping of \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d a news-and-analysis chat fest patterned after \u201cThe View,\u201d where she is often the only liberal pundit sitting around the white sectional in Fox\u2019s ground-floor studio.\n\nOn a recent Friday, Powers was tucked between Charles Payne, the host of Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMaking Money with Charles Payne\u201d and Andrea Tantaros, a conservative political analyst. (Payne was serving as the panel\u2019s \u201c#OneLuckyGuy,\u201d a rotating spot reserved for a man on the otherwise female show.)\n\nFirst topic: Had Hillary Rodham Clinton been unfairly tarnished by e-mails sent to her by longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal touting his business partners?\n\nPowers, unsurprisingly, was the sole panelist arguing there wasn\u2019t enough proof to call this one a scandal yet.\n\n\u201cDo you want this sort of dark cloud over the White House?\u201d Payne bellowed at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove it.\u201d\n\nPowers jabbed back: \u201cOf course we need proof. Is it correlation or causation?\u201d\n\nShe is often the lone dissenting voice on the show. Yet on commercial breaks, she and her fellow panelists relaxed and nodded their heads to the pop music piped into the studio. Makeup artists breezed in to apply more powder to shiny foreheads. It was all very cordial.\n\nSwitching gears, the panel took up a new study that found that \u201cgood-looking men can get away with more.\u201d Everyone agreed this was not news. A co-host asked Powers whether the study was proof that \u201cwomen like bad boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou grow out of it,\u201d says Powers, who was divorced a couple of years ago after a brief marriage. She doesn\u2019t mention her ex-boyfriend, Anthony Weiner. Long after their romance transitioned into a friendship, Powers felt betrayed when he lied to the public \u2014 and to her personally \u2014 about a string of lewd text messages he sent to young women, and she published an essay calling for his resignation.\n\nInstead, Powers turned to Tantaros, who is also single. \u201cYou like bad boys?\u201d she asked. They laugh, and as a commercial starts, Tantaros gives Powers some of her almonds to munch on. Seeing this, you\u2019d never guess that the two women have been a fixture of the media blogosphere for their epic on-air fights, such as the time Tantaros faulted President Obama for inflaming racial tension in Ferguson, Mo., and Powers called Tantaros\u2019s thinking \u201coutrageous\u201d \u2014 both pointing angrily at each other, chopping the air to emphasize their conflicting viewpoints.\n\nAfter the show, Powers rushed to her black car, heading off to catch an Acela train back to Washington. On the ride, she sipped a green juice and explained that she and Tantaros \u201csee debating as an intellectual exercise and don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d\n\nFox has become famous, in some corners, for the kinds of debates that Powers specializes in, a liberal thinker pitted against a conservative panel or host, with the tensions allowed to rise to a dynamic moment of drama. It has been good for the network\u2019s ratings, according to media critics, but some liberal observers have qualms about Powers\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cYes, it is beneficial and good to have someone at the table to point out instances of conservative misinformation,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, executive vice president of Media Matters for America, the liberal watchdog that spends much of its energy jousting with Fox. But more often, he argued, \u201cshe is reinforcing\u201d the conservative views of Fox\u2019s other opinionators. (Powers, in turn, has accused Media Matters of trying to silence any journalists critical of Democrats.)\n\nSally Kohn, a liberal activist and former Fox contributor who is friendly with Powers, said she had a harder time dealing with the \u201csoul searching\u201d that comes for \u201cany liberal who goes into a conservative environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you doing more harm than good?\u201d Kohn asked. \u201cWe all sit around and ponder that, and it becomes a question especially when you are criticizing your own side. . . . There is a theatrics to all of this.\u201d\n\n\n\nPowers\u2019s camera-shy dog Eleanor \u2014 named after Eleanor Roosevelt \u2014 cozies up under her owner\u2019s feet at home. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just being honest,\u201d Powers says, trying again to explain her contradictions.\n\nIn a culture of rabid partisans, she likes to think she owns herself. In that way, she is like the roughly 25 percent of U.S. voters who harbor a balance of conservative and liberal beliefs, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nOn Monday through Friday, she may be in the arena at Fox, but she takes Saturdays as a kind of sabbath, avoiding work and trying to connect with friends. Those relationships have become more precious as she has lost friends who disagree with her. While Powers focused for four months on writing her book last year, she spent a lot of time solo.\n\n\u201cIt was extra awful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the loneliest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nShe began to turn over the idea of loneliness in her mind, in the same way that she wrestles with political questions before landing on her views.\n\nSoon, she was deep into research on loneliness. She read a paragraph in the Christian magazine Relevant that stuck with her: \u201cI love and am drawn to ambitious people. I\u2019m challenged by them. I\u2019m inspired by them. But being drawn to ambitious people can really lead to a lonely life. We\u2019re all off pursuing our dreams and passions and miss the deep connection we\u2019re created for.\u201d\n\nShe has an idea that her next book might be an apolitical take on modern loneliness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to do something that is not controversial,\u201d Powers says.\n\nShe seems to mean it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic activist found her voice when she strayed beyond party lines.
