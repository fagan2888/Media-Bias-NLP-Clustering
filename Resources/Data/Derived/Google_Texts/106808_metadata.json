The traditional clock-face watch on one side of the watchband is complemented by a 38mm Apple watch that sits opposite, resting against the inside of the wrist.\n\nReally.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s general consensus about the new device, or devices, was that the thing would be bulky, hard to use and would likely result in a badly scratched-up Apple watch if it were worn in even the most common everyday settings.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Next Invasion \u2013 The Pop Charts\n\nAs it turned out, though, the new timepiece wasn\u2019t the only one making headlines Monday. The British press had a field day with another wristwatch, this one worn by Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov at his wedding to former Olympic Ice Dancer Tatyana Navka last week.\n\nThe limited edition Richard Mille 52-01, featuring a golden skull face is worth something just shy of $620,000 \u2014 making it roughly 70 times as costly as the watch that had the Internet going slightly nuts.\n\nThe value of the watch was highlighted by Alexei Navalny, a well-known Putin opponent, who pointed out that the timepiece was worth four times what Peskov earns in a year via his government job. A press secretary in possession of such an object might just have some outside sources of income, Navalny suggested in a blog post.\n\n\u201cClearly there are some details of his life that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d Navalny wrote.\n\nFor his part, Peskov claimed that his watch had been a gift from his bride.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The new Nico Gerard Skyview Pinnacle seemed to be the ultimate in wristwear decadence.
