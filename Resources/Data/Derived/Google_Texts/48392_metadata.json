We were proud to be unsophisticated. We blushed. We looked forward to our honeymoons and the giving of ourselves to husbands who valued us and our unsophisticated ways. We were romantic and idealistic. If we made mistakes, we were ashamed of those mistakes. We strived for virtue, and tried to avoid vice.\n\nGood, decent, moral, modest women help to determine the morals of a country. Men are respected and respect in turn. Good, moral women engender good men and obedient, disciplined children.\n\nLove was mysterious and wonderful. Romance was everywhere. Today it is found only in the classics of a forgotten time. Diana Werner\n\nPriorities\n\nHoward Beach: I am still waiting for someone to tell me where Kayla Phillips got the money to buy a handbag for $2,500. I worked until I was 85 years old and never paid more than $20 for a handbag. Maybe she should have used the money for her two children. Jean Novak\n\nNew York kindness\n\nBrooklyn: On Nov. 14, I was waiting for a bus. I dropped my MetroCard, attempted to pick it up and fell down, hitting the back of my head on the cement. A man stopped his car and came over to me, asking if I was OK. At the same time, a lady with her son Anthony also stopped. They both managed to pick me up. Another lady came out of one of the houses and brought me a bottle of water. I would like to thank these people for their assistance. I was able to call my daughter, who came with her car. These people stayed with me the whole time. I will keep them in my prayers. Marie Kenniff\n\nDid she tip?\n\nLong Island City: I would like to thank Dawn from the East Village, who was very pregnant and told me not to hit potholes. Thanks for puking in my cab. I did clean up your slop. Next time, take the train. Remember: I didn\u2019t make you pregnant.\n\nSteve Chaddock\n\nNo comparison\n\nJamaica: To Voicer Josh Ruebner: I am neither a fan or foe of Israel, but you and your minions are a disgrace. You need not worry about people disparaging you or calling you names; you and your thugs do pretty well on your own. When Israel became a state, it turned a desert into a paradise, all the while fighting Arab hordes trying to finish the job Hitler aimed to do. In all the time since, tell me what the Palestinians have accomplished? Their greatest accomplishment is in the art of bomb-making, and their greatest pleasure is to lob those weapons into Israel, killing and maiming civilians. Pat Caporrino\n\nKnockout, who\u2019s there?\n\nStaten Island: The media has all but ignored the knockout game \u2014 a game that\u2019s racially based, with people of color assaulting a vulnerable white person. Why haven\u2019t the photos of these criminals been on page one of my newspaper so they can be brought to justice? Call it racial profiling if you will, but I am going to cross the street if I see any group of black teenagers coming towards me. I believe a sucker punch and a head fall into concrete would probably end my life. Carolyn Friedman\n\nWhite-on-black\n\nManhattan: To Voicer Teresa Boardman: Columbine. Sandy Hook. Simi Valley. Selma. Philadelphia, Miss. I too can go and on. And what color are those perps? Raymond McEaddy\n\nYou built that\n\nMohegan Lake, N.Y.: Voicer Felyce Marchica continues the nauseating narrative that the mainstream media and the progressive politicians ram down our collective throats on a daily basis. She adds a new twist to this fictitious account by saying that, if Jesus were alive today, He would say that it is wrong to take away from those less fortunate so the rich can get richer. Regardless of whether you are rich or even middle class, you make your money by earning it, and not by \u201ctaking it away from the less fortunate.\u201d Unbelievable! Freddy Sacco\n\nMoney on his mind\n\nLong Branch, N.J.: Jay Z, exactly who is supposed to buy your $875 cap, $995 T-shirt, $1,275 hoodie, $695 ski mask and $1,795 duffel bag? Oh!, I forgot about the dummies who buy your recordings. But surely, even they can\u2019t possibly be that stupid. Lenzy Kelley\n\nFrom where she sits . . .\n\nJersey City, N.J.: Some Native Americans call Columbus Day and Thanksgiving Day their Memorial Days. Just sayin\u2019. Willette Gould\n\nSay thanks\n\nBrooklyn: Voicer Lawrence Fiffer says he\u2019s never seen or come across any Hometown Heroes on his bus route. My answer to him: The reason you can\u2019t see any is probably because you\u2019re sneaking on the back of the bus. The drivers are up front. Anthony Styron\n\nFuzzy math\n\nMassapequa Park, L.I.: Thank you to the Daily News for dropping the comic strip \u201cGet Fuzzy\u201d; it was too \u201coff.\u201d \u201cWumo\u201d is much more mainstream. Raymond P. Moran\n\nYou\u2019re welcome\n\nForest Hills: Again, my thanks to the Daily News for the tickets to see \u201cFirst Date.\u201d We laughed throughout the whole show. It was so enjoyable. Arlene Farber\n\nTall tales\n\nManhattan: I think it\u2019s perfect that One World Trade Center (a building we all hate) has been officially deemed taller than the former Sears Tower in Chicago, just because it made a taller spire and the fake committee couldn\u2019t say no to New York City. Everything else under Bloomberg was faked, from test scores to crime stats to how clean and perfect he made the city. NYC is the world capital of dishonesty.\n\nNick Enzminger\n\nChucked\n\nBronx: Since the day the government shutdown ended, I have written to Sen. Charles Schumer three times about Obamacare \u2014 and \u201cChuck,\u201d as he prefers to be called, has replied with nothing more than \u201cthank you for your interest, I\u2019ll give the matter much thought and get back to you.\u201d Today, I sent him another email and told him that I wouldn\u2019t be voting for him again, but made sure to sign it, \u201cRespectfully yours,\u201d so there wouldn\u2019t be any hard feelings. Again, he thanked me for my interest, blah blah blah. I hope all politicians will one day realize that while voters love to be courted during the few weeks leading up to election day, they should not be taken for granted once elected. Jonathan Kleid\n\nObama vs. Bush\n\nBrooklyn: To compare the Iraq war with people losing their health insurance is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Instead of blaming Bush and the Republicans, the Democrats need to fix the mess they created with Obamacare. Teresa Pagani\n\nThe view in the mirror\n\nLindenhurst, L.I.: I think it\u2019s very odd that Barbara Walters still calls her show \u201cThe View.\u201d When Joe Scarborough was on the show, I didn\u2019t hear a single right-wing opinion. Ms. Walters, don\u2019t you get bored constantly listening to the sound of your own voice? Be honest, and rename your show \u201cThe Left View.\u201d Carol Viverito\n\nChrist-mas\n\nBrooklyn: This letter is in reference to the upcoming celebration of Christmas. It is a beautiful thing when people want to honor Jesus Christ. A question we should ask ourselves is: What would Jesus think of people celebrating his birth today? Did you know that his disciples never celebrated his birthday? This celebration has turned into an excuse for loose conduct, drunkenness, debauchery, and office parties that encourage employees to drink until they can\u2019t realize what fools they make of themselves. Yes, all this is in the name of Jesus Christ. Joseph Denis\n\nThe bad old days\n\nBrooklyn: OK, New Yorkers, make sure your helmets and bullet-proof jackets are ready. Starting in January, we will be living in the Wild, Wild West.
