Durham, an executive vice president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for the industry, told Congress that the consolidation could promote competition and benefit consumers, achieving economies of scale that reduce costs.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Durham said, insurers are trying to counter the \u201charmful impact of consolidation among hospitals and other health care providers\u201d and what he called \u201cmonopoly pricing\u201d by makers of some prescription drugs.\n\nHowever, Thomas L. Greaney, an expert on health and antitrust law at St. Louis University, said he was skeptical of the argument that insurers had to merge to counter the market power of hospitals and doctors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Greaney likened giant insurers and hospital systems to sumo wrestlers. \u201cExperience suggests that a showdown between the sumo wrestlers may well result in a handshake rather than an honest wrestling match,\u201d he testified.\n\nEven if a dominant insurer succeeds in bargaining successfully with providers, Mr. Greaney said, \u201cit has little incentive to pass along the savings to its policyholders.\u201d\n\nWitnesses from the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association harshly criticized the proposed mergers.\n\n\u201cThe Anthem-Cigna transaction threatens to reduce competition in at least 817 markets across the United States serving 45 million consumers,\u201d said Richard J. Pollack, the president of the hospital association.\n\nAnthem operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in a number of states, and Mr. Pollack said that Anthem\u2019s acquisition of Cigna could \u201cfurther entrench\u201d the dominant position of such Blue plans in many insurance markets.\n\nMr. Pollack assailed the proposed Aetna-Humana deal on other grounds, saying it would eliminate competition between the companies\u2019 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nMore than 30 percent of the 55 million Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in such private plans, attracted by the promise of extra benefits and lower costs.\n\nMr. Durham, the insurance industry representative, said that hospital mergers often led to substantial increases in hospital prices, and that those increases led to higher premiums.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, he said, when hospitals buy physician groups, the doctors tend to charge more.\n\nMr. Pollack challenged those arguments. \u201cThe annual growth in hospital prices has been low and declining,\u201d he said, and hospital clinics face competition from walk-in clinics at CVS, Walgreens and Walmart stores.\n\nDr. Barbara L. McAneny, a trustee of the American Medical Association, said that \u201cthe concentration of market power among a handful of nationwide insurers\u201d could interfere with doctors\u2019 ability to care for patients.\n\nThe mergers, she said, could threaten the \u201chealth and safety of American patients,\u201d and if the deals are consummated, \u201cthere is simply no going back.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department is reviewing the deals to see if they would violate the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which generally prohibits mergers and acquisitions if the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing Thursday, House members expressed keen interest in the mergers, but their views did not appear to have crystallized into support or opposition.\n\nThey did split along party lines on a related question: whether the Affordable Care Act was driving consolidation in the insurance and hospital industries.\n\nRepresentative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the 2010 law \u201cput in place a regulatory structure that stifled competition and instituted incentives for increased market consolidation.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, said: \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a reaction to, not a cause of, consolidation in the health care marketplace. Waves of consolidation among health care providers and insurers occurred long before the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Johnson said that competition among health plans in the new public insurance markets had held down premiums while increasing the number of choices available to consumers.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who was a federal health official from 2003 to 2007, said, \u201cIn the commercial market for private coverage, there\u2019s been a contraction in the number of carriers offering health plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly about 50 new health carriers have entered the commercial market since 2008,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said at the hearing. \u201cHalf of these are the struggling not-for-profit co-op plans that the Affordable Care Act subsidizes. Around 40 health plans have left the market over this same stretch of time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150910204448, "twitter": {"description": "A House subcommittee is
