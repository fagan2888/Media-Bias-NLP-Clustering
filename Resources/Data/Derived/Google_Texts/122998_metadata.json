Our job as leaders is to support that value-creating activity,\" Toussaint (pictured right) said during his presentation at the 2014 American College of Healthcare Executives Congress in Chicago last week.\n\nC-suite executives must limit strategies to advance quality and financial stewardship and deploy those initiatives by engaging in one-on-one dialogue with front-line workers who deal with the everyday business of the organization, said Toussaint, who won ACHE's 2014 Dean Conley Award for his article \"A Management, Leadership and Board Road Map to Transforming Care for Patients,\" published in Frontiers of Health Services Management.\n\nHe suggests organizations identify potential problems by attending daily huddles and rounding to observe the work and determine if the standard of quality is in place and where it may be defective. Healthcare leaders should always ask themselves three questions and reflect on them when determining quality standards and whether the organization is meeting them, he said.\n\nAre my staff and doctors treated with dignity and respect by everyone?\n\nDo my staff and docs have the training and encouragement to do work that gives their lives meaning?\n\nHave I recognized my staff and doctors for what they do?\n\nToussaint also talked about borrowing lean management principles from the Japanese Toyota Production System, which uses the scientific method to plan, design and improve the work delivered by the teams of people that will deliver measurably better value.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLean management boosts patient satisfaction to 95%\n\nReport: Staff engagement key to patient experience\n\nTop 5 traits of talented managers\n\n3 ways healthcare leaders can drive improvements", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senior\u00a0healthcare leaders\u00a0need to simplify their approach to\u00a0patient safety\u00a0and\u00a0quality measures, and give front-line workers the opportunity to provide the best care possibly by creating an environment that fosters open communication and team work, according to\u00a0John Toussaint, M.D., chief executive officer of\u00a0The", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Senior\u00a0healthcare leaders\u00a0need to simplify their approach to\u00a0patient safety\u00a0and\u00a0quality measures, and give front-line workers the opportunity to provide the best care possibly by creating an environment that fosters open communication and team work, according to\u00a0John Toussaint, M.D., chief executive officer of\u00a0The", "title": "ThedaCare Center CEO: Engage front-line hospital workers to boost patient safety, quality care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/thedacare-ceo-engage-front-line-hospital-workers-boost-patient-safety-quali/2014-04-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "ACHE Congress,Care Delivery,daily huddles,front-line workers,HR & Workforce Management,John Toussaint,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,quality measures,rounding,Thedacare", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d40\"", "article_summary": "Related Articles:Lean management boosts patient satisfaction to 95%Report: Staff engagement key to patient experienceTop 5 traits of talented managers3 ways healthcare leaders can drive improvements\nHealthcare leaders should always ask themselves three questions and reflect on them when determining quality standards and whether the organization is meeting them, he said.\nDo my staff and docs have the training and encouragement to do work that gives their lives meaning?\nSenior healthcare leaders need to simplify their approach to patient safety and quality measures, and give front-line workers the opportunity to provide the best care possibly by creating an environment that fosters open communication and team work, according to John Toussaint, M.D., chief executive officer of ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value.\nAre my staff and doctors treated with dignity and respect by everyone?"}
