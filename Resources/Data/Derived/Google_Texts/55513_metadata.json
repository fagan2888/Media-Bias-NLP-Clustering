(Photo: NICQUEL TERRY/STAFF PHOTOGRAPH)\n\nA man who was fatally shot while visiting relatives early Friday has been identified by county authorities as Rasheem Palmer, 37, of Red bank.\n\nPalmer was shot around midnight Friday near the entrance to the Country Club Apartments, according to Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office spokesman Charles Webster.\n\nPolice responded to a report of shots fired at 12:13 a.m. near the apartment complex and found Palmer's body lying on the ground, Webster said.\n\nPalmer was taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Webster said. He was pronounced dead at 2:47 a.m.\n\nWebster did not immediately release additional information about the shooting.\n\nFlorence Mayberry told the Asbury Park Press Friday that Palmer was her nephew. She said he was visiting relatives at the time of the incident.\n\nSeveral residents told the Asbury Park Press Friday morning they woke up around midnight to the sound of numerous gunshots.\n\n\"It sounded like fireworks,\" said Robert Coss, 15, a resident of Country Club Apartments. \"This morning I found out it wasn't fireworks and that someone was shot.\"\n\nRELATED: Red Bank man killed in Eatontown shooting\n\nSubsequent efforts to reach family members were unsuccessful.\n\nRed Bank natives who grew up with Palmer remember him as an encouraging friend and mentor who imparted his wisdom to the neighborhood kids.\n\nJasmere Rogers, 22, said Palmer would show up to his football games or show students support at other sporting events.\n\n\"You could always catch him at a football game or basketball game,\" Rogers said. \"He was a supporter of Red Bank in general. That's what I loved about him.\"\n\nRogers' favorite memory of Palmer is when the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers faced off at the Super Bowl in 2003. Rogers was 10 years old.\n\nPalmer walked into a local barbership asking if anyone wanted to wager on the game, Rogers recalled. Rogers said he liked the Bucaneers, so Palmer bet on the Raiders.\n\n\"He told me if I won then he would give me $20, but if he won then I would have to give him 50 push-ups,\" Rogers recalled. \"Sure enough, I won $20 from him after the Bucs stomped all over the Raiders.\"\n\nAnother Red Bank native, listed as Moore Tashama on Facebook, said she also grew up with Palmer.\n\n\"He was everything a friend or family member can ask for,\" she wrote.\n\nA makeshift memorial was set up Friday for Palmer on a utility pole near the apartment complex entrance. Pinned to the pole was a photo of a man with a woman and child.\n\nThe Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office and Eatontown police are investigating the death. Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Kevin Condon of the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office at 800-533-7443 or Detective Aaron Shaw of the Eatontown Police Department at 732-542-0100.\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
