But when it comes to same-sex marriage, the outspoken Republican presidential candidate says his views are now \u201cchanging.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, where he addressed a number of topics including abortion, the Affordable Care Act, ISIS, immigration and gay marriage.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to same-sex marriage, which the Supreme Court ruled to legalize nationwide Friday, Trump affirmed he holds a more conservative position on the issue, saying only \u201cI\u2019m [for] traditional marriage. It is changing rapidly.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina Slam Supreme Court's Same-Sex Marriage Ruling\n\nTapper then asked the real estate mogul what was traditional about being married three separate times.\n\n\u201cBut what do you say to a lesbian who\u2019s married, or a gay man who is married, who says, \u2018Donald Trump, what\u2019s traditional about being married three times?'\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t argue with the question, and said he now has a successful union with wife Melania.\n\n\u201cThey have a very good point,\u201d Trump told Tapper. \u201cI have a great marriage. I have a great wife now. My (first) two wives were very good. And I don\u2019t blame them, but I was working, maybe like you, 22 hours a day.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump Threatens to Sue Univision Over Nixed Miss USA Deal\n\nTrump went on to admit, \u201cI blame myself because my business was so powerful for me.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Trump also doubled down on his comments about undocumented immigrants from Mexico, which led Univision to nix airing the Miss USA pageant.\n\n\u201cI like Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I do business with the Mexican people, but you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they\u2019re bad. They\u2019re really bad,\u201d Trump told Tapper.\n\nAlso Read: NBC Distances Itself From Donald Trump: 'We Do Not Agree With His Positions on a Number of Issues'\n\n\u201cYou have people coming in, and I\u2019m not just saying Mexicans, I\u2019m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and I mean, they\u2019re coming into this country,\u201d he continued.\n\nOn Thursday, Univision elected to end its business relationship with the Miss Universe Organization due to part-owner Donald Trump\u2019s \u201crecent, insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAlso Read: 2016 Presidential Contenders: TheWrap's Essential Guide to Who's In And Where They Stand (Updating)\n\nThe Spanish language broadcaster also said it \u201cwill not be \u2026 working on any other projects tied to the Trump Organization.\u201d That includes no longer airing the July 12 Miss USA pageant as planned.\n\nWatch the video above of Trump on CNN.
