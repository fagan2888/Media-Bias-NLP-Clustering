But healthcare costs, and thus health insurance premiums, have climbed much faster than that for decades. As insurance costs rise in the coming years, more and more plans will cross the thresholds. By 2023, 82 percent of employers will have to pay the tax.\n\nThis flaw isn't the result of a faulty manufacturing process \u2014 it was deliberately built in from the beginning. One of the Affordable Care Act's chief architects, Jonathan Gruber, boasted that the Cadillac tax will essentially get \"rid of the [tax] exclusion for employer-sponsored plans.\"\n\nThe tax will also discourage employers from offering tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts \u2014 even though these consumer-controlled accounts are extremely popular with employees and have proven effective at reining in health costs.\n\nEmployers and employees alike can make pre-tax deposits into FSAs that consumers can use within a given year for routine healthcare expenses. HSAs work similarly \u2014 but consumers can roll over the money in their accounts from year to year.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sanders 'excited' to debate Trump Although the Trump campaign has yet to confirm, Sanders sounded confident it would happen.\n\nSince they are spending their own money, they're more likely to shop around for lower priced medical care. Such consumer discipline has been proven to rein in overall health spending.\n\nBut the Cadillac tax counts employer contributions to these accounts toward the high-cost thresholds. So an employer that offers an individual worker a $10,000 health insurance plan and contributes $2,000 to his or her FSA will face a 40 percent excise tax on the $1,200 beyond the $10,800 Cadillac tax threshold. As a result, employers may stop offering HSAs and FSAs altogether.\n\nLawmakers have delayed the start date of the tax from 2018 to 2020. President Obama has suggested that premium limits be indexed so that they reflect regional differences in insurance costs. House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, has slammed the tax as \"punitive,\" and others in Congress have proposed excluding HSA contributions when calculating whether a health plan is subject to the tax.\n\nBut legislative tune-ups like these won't stop the Cadillac tax from harming millions of middle-class families. It's time to dump this \"Cadillac\" in the junkyard.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the Affordable Care Act's chief vehicles for controlling healthcare spending is on a collision course with millions of middle-class Americans.
