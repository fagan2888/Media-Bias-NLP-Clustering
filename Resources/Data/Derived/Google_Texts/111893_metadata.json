He then comforted the young girl, showing her a movie and telling her that she would be returned to his mother.\n\nAt some point later that day, Sigg strangled the girl with his bare hands and later scattering her remains in Denver suburbs.\n\nJessica was missing for days as police collected evidence and conducted countless interviews in an all-out manhunt for the girl. Sigg was arrested Oct. 23 after he confessed to the killing to his mother.\n\nSigg also pleaded guilty to an attempted kidnapping at Ketner Lake in 2012.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Austin Sigg, who killed Jessica Ridgeway, moved to out-of-state prison", "title": "Austin Sigg, who killed Jessica Ridgeway, moved to out-of-state prison", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/22/austin-sigg-who-killed-jessica-ridgeway-moved-to-out-of-state-prison/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140622__siggp1.jpg", "height": 502}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140622__siggp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-22T10:30:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T04:58:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b9f\"", "article_summary": "Austin Sigg, the teenager who pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and murder of Jessica Ridgeway, has been moved to an out-of-state prison, the Colorado Department of Correction confirmed Sunday.\nAt some point later that day, Sigg strangled the girl with his bare hands and later scattering her remains in Denver suburbs.\nSigg, who was being held at a Denver intake center, was moved to an undisclosed location, said Adrienne Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the department.\nSigg also pleaded guilty to an attempted kidnapping at Ketner Lake in 2012.\nJessica was missing for days as police collected evidence and conducted countless interviews in an all-out manhunt for the girl."}
