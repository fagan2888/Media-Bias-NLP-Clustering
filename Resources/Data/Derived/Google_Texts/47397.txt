A new pet rescue in town is hoping to save some more lives in Texoma.



Emily's Legacy Rescue just adopted out their first pet and have more that need loving homes.



Kimber Hopkins started the rescue in honor of her dalmatian, Emily, who she lost 6 years ago. She says Emily's loving spirit inspired her to adopt more animals and start the rescue to make sure as many pets were saved as possible.



“Emily was just wonderful about loving other animals. I mean we could go for a walk and if a stray would follow us home because they saw Emily. She was just an amazing dog and we miss her terribly,” says Hopkins.
