WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A service to commemorate the fifth anniversary of a deadly earthquake in the New Zealand city of Christchurch turned ugly Monday when someone threw goop over the government minister responsible for quake recovery efforts.

Hundreds of people attended the botanical gardens service in New Zealand’s second-largest city to memorialize the magnitude-6.1 quake that killed 185 people on Feb 22, 2011.

As people chatted after the service ended, somebody tossed the unidentified goop from a plastic ice cream container over Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee, his spokesman confirmed.

Police said they arrested a 41-year-old man in connection with the incident and charged him with assault. Police said the man had left the service but was found a short time later.

Brownlee has proved a polarizing figure in the rebuilding of Christchurch. Many people frustrated at delays in collecting insurance or at the slow pace of the downtown reconstruction have blamed him.

Earlier in the day, Brownlee was heckled by a man during an outdoor radio interview: “You’ve done a bad job. A bad, bad job,” the man yelled after first shouting an insult. On air, Brownlee laughed off the incident.

Brownlee’s spokesman, Nick Bryant, said the lawmaker didn’t wish to comment on the incident at the service because it had become a legal matter.

It’s the second time this month that somebody has thrown something at a New Zealand lawmaker. On Feb. 6, a woman threw a pink toy penis at Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce to protest an international free trade deal.

Earlier during Monday’s memorial service, speakers made the point that while there had been big progress since the quake, there was much left to be done.
