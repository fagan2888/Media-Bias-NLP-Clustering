The story of this year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d hype has been one thing we didn\u2019t know we\u2019d always wanted until we saw it after another. We still have absolutely no idea what the BB-8 droid is, what it does or what role it plays in the story but people are already incorporating it into Halloween costumes. Characters we\u2019ve never met who have no known connection to the Skywalker/Solo clan have already inspired fans and shippers, much like fans in the 1970s fell in love with the bounty hunter Boba Fett on the strength of a cartoon short and an action figure. (They ended up cruelly disappointed, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nThis is all enough to make me cautiously optimistic that the \u201cmagic\u201d of \u201cStar Wars\u201d might be coming back. The key to the magic coming back is, of course, not getting the sinking feeling that we\u2019re just rehashing the former magic over and over, that we\u2019re not going to get the disastrous Anakin Skywalker backstory obsession of the prequels or the endless Mary Sueing/Gary Stuing of the Skywalker\u2013Solo kids from the old tie-in books.\n\nWhat gives me hope is the sense that \u2014 even if fan theories that Rey or Finn or Jason Isaacs\u2019 Poe Dameron have secret Skywalker blood bear out \u2014 these characters are being presented to us as unfamiliar and new. We\u2019re not doing what unimaginative fanfic writers do and filling in perceived blanks in George Lucas\u2019 original story or doing riffs on it, spinning our wheels in the rut that Lucasfilm\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d tie-in properties spent so much time in.\n\nThe biggest applause line in the new trailer is when we see the weathered, grizzled face of Harrison Ford telling our new young heroes, \u201cIt\u2019s true, all of it. The Dark Side, the Jedi, they\u2019re real.\u201d Han Solo is directly contradicting his memorable dismissal of \u201chokey religions and ancient weapons\u201d in the first \u201cStar Wars.\u201d He\u2019s gone from the brash young man who lives in the present to the wise old mentor who remembers legends from the past. Unlike the failed attempt to revive the \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d franchise with Ford still playing the action hero he used to be \u2014 unlike the many annoying attempts to bank on nostalgia for yesterday\u2019s action heroes \u2014 this movie has the courage to pass the torch, to make the old story a springboard for the new one.\n\nI keep telling my friends I\u2019m stoked that Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are back in this cast \u2014 and I\u2019m even more stoked that, much as I love these actors, none of them have yet had a leading role in the trailers. All the secrecy around the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d gives me hope \u2014 a new hope, you might say \u2014 that this franchise is lucrative and well-established enough that the filmmakers might be willing to take risks with it, that this movie won\u2019t be just a glorified cast reunion and cash grab.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s one particular risk I dearly hope they will take, and it\u2019s one that involves an actor from the first trilogy taking a pivotal role.\n\nI\u2019m on board with the people who hope that Kylo Ren, the creepy masked figure/Darth Vader wannabe who leads the \u201cFirst Order\u201d trying to restore the Empire played (in his Kylo Ren guise) by Adam Driver, either is Luke Skywalker in disguise or is acting on his behalf.\n\nIt\u2019s not just because Mark Hamill personally wanted to play a bad guy this time around, and it\u2019s not just because Mark Hamill has arguably had a much more successful and storied career playing bad guys than he has playing Luke Skywalker. (If you think I just mean the Joker, check out his work as Fire Lord Ozai or as half of Metalocalypse\u2019s Tribunal.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just because, if you still care about George Lucas\u2019 original vision, the \u201cDark Empire\u201c comic book was the Star Wars \u201csequel\u201d Lucas had the most direct involvement in and Luke\u2019s fall to the Dark Side is a key plot point in that story (along with Emperor Palpatine coming back in the form of a series of clones, which is a plot point I don\u2019t endorse Disney borrowing).\n\nIt\u2019s not even that it makes Luke\u2019s character more interesting. I\u2019ve pointed out in the past that \u201cStar Wars\u201d talks about being about internal moral struggle but doesn\u2019t really succeed as such; Luke struggles with negative emotions like being alternately afraid of and angry at his genocidal cyborg father, but he never actually does anything a normal person would call \u201cevil\u201d during the story.\n\nAll of these are good, interesting reasons to have a Dark Side Luke in the sequels. Having the Darth Vader arc only this time redeeming a character we actually did know and like as a good guy, so we can actually make the painful comparison between who he used to be and who he\u2019s become, so we can actually root for his redemption on a personal level \u2014 making the Vader redemption arc work on that level would be picking up the original trilogy\u2019s biggest dropped ball.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the biggest reason for doing it. In fact, if that were the main reason for doing it I\u2019d oppose it, because that would make the story be exactly what I don\u2019t want it to be, bringing back the original trilogy\u2019s main character and doing his story all over again instead of moving on to something new.\n\nI want Luke Skywalker to fall to the Dark Side for real because \u201cStar Wars\u201d is a story about rebellion \u2014 it\u2019s right in the name of the good guys, the Rebel Alliance or, in \u201cEpisode VII,\u201d the Resistance \u2014 and the most important lesson for wannabe rebels to learn is:\n\nToday\u2019s Rebels are tomorrow\u2019s Empire. Today\u2019s Empire were yesterday\u2019s Rebels.\n\nRebellion never fully stops. The day is always coming when you might find yourself convicted by conscience and have to turn traitor to your own cause. We\u2019ll never be free of rebellion, at least not until that mythical future where everything\u2019s perfect, which ain\u2019t coming anytime soon.\n\nThe prequels dealt with this theme, showing the \u201cgood guys\u201d building an army of stormtroopers and violently quashing insurrection and electing the future cackling dictator Palpatine into office as the galaxy\u2019s rightful ruler. But it didn\u2019t deal with it on a personal level. Leaving aside the failure to make a Shakespearean tragedy out of Anakin\u2019s fall to the Dark Side \u2014 as opposed to an impatient wait for this whiny teenager to fall into a lava pit and become a villain who was at least cool \u2014 no one else changes allegiances in the story. Palpatine was secretly a monster planning to seize totalitarian rule all along.\n\nThe Jedi are shown as misguided but not corrupted, and every single one of them except Anakin dies fighting for the good guys once Palpatine reveals his true nature. The indoctrinated clone troopers of the prequels don\u2019t have much moral agency at all, casually accepting an order to turn on and assassinate their Jedi commanding officers without even a second\u2019s hesitation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today's rebels are tomorrow's establishment \u2014 just ask the Tea Party.
