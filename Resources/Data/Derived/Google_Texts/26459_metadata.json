That will include putting shelters in every Edmond school.\n\n\u201cIt has eight inch thick concrete walls, eight inch thick concrete roof,\u201d Edmond Associate Superintendent, Bret Towne, said.\n\nTowne took News 9 through the new Heritage Elementary School off Sorghum Mill between Broadway and Bryant.\n\n\u201cThis school, when it\u2019s done, will have about 12 shelters,\u201d Towne said.\n\nStorm shelters inside schools has been the norm for Edmond since 1990. Still, more than half of the more than 23,000 students in the district don't have access to one.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re looking at is probably a four-year period, adding shelters to each school that doesn\u2019t have a shelter, or we\u2019re upgrading what\u2019s there,\u201d Towne said.\n\nThe district is already experiencing significant growth. According to district officials, an $80-million dollar bond package was already approved by Edmond voters last year for renovations and construction of two new campuses.\n\nOne of those is Heritage Elementary. The new school will join at least seven others in the district that already have shelters on campus.\n\n\u201cThey are significant structures,\u201d said Towne. \u201cThe main thing is it\u2019s going to be a space that we can use. It\u2019s not just going to be a shelter. It\u2019s going to be a classroom, a media center, a computer lab, a gym, those type of things.\u201d\n\nThere are already more than 7,800 students who have access to a storm shelter in Edmond.\n\nBond elections on the issues in Edmond are planned for February.\n\nMany other districts hope to add safe rooms through a bond election. Putnam City, Newkirk, Glencoe and Rush Springs are a few of the districts planning to add safe rooms to new or existing structures.\n\nThe ballots typically do not list specific projects, so check with your district to see if safe rooms are part of its bond proposal.\n\nThose will be on the ballot for the August 26 election.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Edmond school board members want storm shelters on every one of their campuses.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26236916/edmond-public-schools-wants-storm-shelters-at-every-school", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4436612_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Edmond school board members want storm shelters on every one of their campuses.", "title": "Edmond Public Schools Wants Storm Shelters At Every School"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4436612_G.jpg", "description": "Edmond school board members want storm shelters on every one of their campuses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Edmond Public Schools Wants Storm Shelters At Every School"}, "wnreadableurl": "edmond-public-schools-wants-storm-shelters-at-every-school", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/08/08", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,edmond, school, storm, Shelters, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,edmond, school, storm, Shelters, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b95\"", "article_summary": "Edmond school board members want storm shelters on every one of their campuses.\nPutnam City, Newkirk, Glencoe and Rush Springs are a few of the districts planning to add safe rooms to new or existing structures.\nThat will include putting shelters in every Edmond school.\n\u201cThis school, when it\u2019s done, will have about 12 shelters,\u201d Towne said.\nEdmond Associate Superintendent, Bret Towne, took News 9 through the new Heritage Elementary School off Sorghum Mill between Broadway and Bryant."}
