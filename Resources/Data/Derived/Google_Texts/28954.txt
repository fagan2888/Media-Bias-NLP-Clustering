Appearing on Fox News’ “Hannity” Wednesday, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz slammed Donald Trump’ gathering up of “establishment” endorsements, and offered a laundry list of positions Trump supported that many would see as antithetical to conservatism:

“Donald Trump enthusiastically supported the TARP bailout of big banks. I opposed it. He enthusiastically supported Barack Obama’s stimulus plan — he thought it should have been bigger. I think it was a disaster and a waste of money… he argued that Obamacare should be expanded to make it socialized medicine for everyone. Actually, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have basically the same healthcare plan.”

Independent Journal decided to fact-check Cruz’s allegations.

Trump on TARP:

In September 2008, when CNN’s Kiran Chetry asked if the bailout needed to pass, Trump said:

“Well, I think it would be better if it passed… Nobody really knows what impact it’s going to have. Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn’t. But certainly it is worth a shot… I think overall, it’s a probable positive.”

Trump did express skepticism that it might not work, and a desire to see the government buy good loans as well, but he still strongly favored TARP.

Speaking with Larry King on April 15, 2009, Trump said:

“I do agree with what they’re doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn’t matter, but you have to keep the banks going.”

Trump on the stimulus:

In February 2009, Trump spoke with Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren, and praised Obama’s stimulus package:

“Well, I have analyzed the bill as closely as it can be analyzed in this quick a period of time, but he’s really got a combination of both. He is doing the taxes, he is doing rebates, and he is also doing lots of public works… I think it goes quickly. It is easily done…but building infrastructure, building great projects, putting people to work in that sense is also very good, so I think you have a combination of both — plus he is doing a rebate system and I think that is good also.”

Trump on healthcare:

During a September interview with “60 Minutes,” Trump proposed a form of government-subsidized healthcare:

TRUMP: “Everybody’s got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, ‘No, no, the lower 25 percent that can’t afford private.’ But…” SCOTT PELLEY: “Universal Healthcare?” TRUMP: “I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now…” PELLEY: “Who pays for it?” TRUMP: “The government’s gonna pay for it. But we’re going to save so much money on the other side!”
