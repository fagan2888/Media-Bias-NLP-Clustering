Lindsey Graham as he heads into a crowded primary battle against a half dozen tea party activists determined to unseat him. In an interview and on the campaign trail, Graham spoke out on everything from compromise to his election to shirtless Putin, but we couldn\u2019t air it all, so here are our favorite seven quotes.\n\nON CONGRESS\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at 11% approval rating in Congress. Who are the 11%, and what the hell do they like?\u201d\n\nON VLADIMIR PUTIN\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one rule of thumb\u2014any world leader riding around on a horse without their shirt\u2019s got a problem. We can handle that guy.\u201d\n\nON VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Joe Biden for a very long time. He\u2019s the world\u2019s nicest man, and if you ever have a couple hours you have to go visit him and listen to what he has to say\u2026My answer to Putin is to have him meet with Biden\u2014we\u2019ll get Crimea back.\u201d\n\nON GEORGE W. BUSH\u2026\n\n\u201cSomebody that we don\u2019t talk much about that we should: George W. Bush. I miss him. I miss President Bush\u2019s stalwart leadership. He made some mistakes, but the one mistake George W. Bush never made is he understood the enemies of this nation. He understood that you have to fight them over there to keep them from coming here.\u201d\n\nON 2016\u2026\n\n\u201cThe nominee for president has to grow this party. We have got to expand this party. They\u2019ve got to show a willingness to embrace solutions to immigration that are not self-deportation. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in a nominee. Somebody who can lead.\u201d\n\nON JEB BUSH\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of good candidates. I think Jeb Bush would do well in South Carolina. I think he\u2019d do well in Florida. Everybody says we\u2019ve got Bush fatigue \u2013 I think everybody would judge him as an individual. He\u2019s very capable.\u201d\n\nON HEALTH CARE\u2026\n\n\u201c2014 is going to be a referendum on the size and the scope of the government, and the proxy will be the Affordable Care Act. All Republicans voted no, and all Democrats voted yes. The reason this thing has been delayed so many times, it just is so hard to implement, and I don\u2019t see it ever working the way it\u2019s been built. Having said that, what is the Republican Party\u2019s alternative? Do you know? I really don\u2019t either. I think my party needs to have an alternative.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Here are a handful of our favorite, must-read quotes from Sen.
