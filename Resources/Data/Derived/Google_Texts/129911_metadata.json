With his company, Bloomberg LP, having a major presence in London, there were ludicrous rumours he might run for mayor of London; in the US he\u2019s touted as a potential challenger for the 2016 Democratic nomination or as an independent. But there\u2019s no indication that, at 73, he\u2019s assembling the kind of data-crunching study he\u2019d require to examine the possibility.\n\nHe looked at it in 2008 before concluding that, while his mayoralty might play well in New York and internationally, the likelihood of US voters returning a diminutive, Jewish New York billionaire to the White House were slim. Still, as evidence mounts that big money in politics does little but drive down voter interest (and turnout), Bloomberg could in theory sidestep campaign finance issues by dipping into his $20bn-plus data services fortune.\n\nBloomberg remains, in effect, a billionaire knight errant. He\u2019s running Bloomberg LP with the former Economist editor John Micklethwait at his side, and Bloomberg Philanthropies with former sideman Dan Doctoroff. He\u2019s established a for-hire consultancy group to help struggling urban administration worldwide, launched a war on coal, a war on tobacco, and looks set to direct his energy and fortune toward curbing climate change by making the world\u2019s cities become more energy-efficient and livable.\n\nWhile the former Salomon Brothers trader spends more time at his home in London, it seems unlikely he\u2019ll abandon the Big Apple. \u201cThis is the city of dreamers,\u201d he has said. \u201cTime and again it\u2019s the place where the greatest dream of all, the American dream, has been tested and has triumphed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The three-times mayor will go down as a great reformist", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Edward Helmore", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The three-times mayor will go down as a great reformist", "title": "Michael Bloomberg: the billionaire knight errant who has transformed New York", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/14/michael-bloomberg-new-york-mayor-great-reformist", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434132499993/Michael-Bloomberg-with-Da-009.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=3b88579d27f45daa214c6114fb13d0c5", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jun/14/michael-bloomberg-new-york-mayor-great-reformist?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/14/michael-bloomberg-new-york-mayor-great-reformist", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jun/14/michael-bloomberg-new-york-mayor-great-reformist?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434132499993/Michael-Bloomberg-with-Da-009.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jun/14/michael-bloomberg-new-york-mayor-great-reformist?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Michael Bloomberg,New York,Mayoral elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-06-13T23:03:10.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edwardhelmore", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-06-13T23:03:10.000Z", "tag": "Michael Bloomberg,New York,Mayoral elections"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434132499993/Michael-Bloomberg-with-Da-009.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=e74e264cdd72eb3721a4304e263702dd", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Michael Bloomberg,New York,Mayoral elections"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s running Bloomberg LP with the former Economist editor John Micklethwait at his side, and Bloomberg Philanthropies with former sideman Dan Doctoroff.\nBloomberg remains, in effect, a billionaire knight errant.\nBut there\u2019s no indication that, at 73, he\u2019s assembling the kind of data-crunching study he\u2019d require to examine the possibility.\n\u201cTime and again it\u2019s the place where the greatest dream of all, the American dream, has been tested and has triumphed.\u201d\nWhile the former Salomon Brothers trader spends more time at his home in London, it seems unlikely he\u2019ll abandon the Big Apple."}
