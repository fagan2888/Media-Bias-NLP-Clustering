In the weeks before it cut rates, the central bank guided open market rates down. It hasn't done so this time.\n\n\"We now think Taiwan will extend the rate cut cycle into 2016 and that the (central bank) will act more aggressively next year,\" ANZ economists said in a recent note. They forecast no rate change for Thursday, but expect the discount rate to be lowered to 1.5 percent in two rate cut moves in the first half of 2016.\n\nWeak exports data in November issued earlier this month dented hopes for fourth quarter gross domestic product, which the government is forecasting to grow a mere 0.49 percent on-year.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd , the world's largest contract chipmaker, last week reported double-digit on-year and on-month declines in sales for November.\n\nThe Taiwan bourse is down close to 2 percent so far this quarter, after slumping 12 percent in the third quarter, while foreign investors have been net sellers of stocks in November and December so far.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade on Wednesday U.S. time, just hours before Taiwan makes its own decision.\n\nsmartphones, which are packed with Taiwanese parts, swings increasingly on global developments. \"Today's situation is different, as a slowing Chinese economy offsets the U.S.'s recovery and weighs on Taiwan's exports,\" according to a recent note by DBS economists, who are forecasting a 12.5 basis point cut Thursday.
