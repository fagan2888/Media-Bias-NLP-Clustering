Moore lasted just five minutes in his Wallabies captaincy debut before disaster struck and he ruptured his anterior cruciate and medial ligaments. Surgery will keep him out of action for at least eight months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is bad news for the Wallabies' World Cup preparations and even worse news for the Brumbies as they aim to win their last two games of the Super Rugby season to secure a spot in the play-offs.\n\nHolmes will join the Brumbies at training this week and compete with the club's only fit hooker \u2013 Josh Mann-Rea \u2013 for selection for the remainder of the year.\n\nFormer Force hooker Luke Holmes has been called up to the Brumbies' squad to replace Moore.

It will take [us] a step backwards but we will rely on the team rallying around and getting performances out.\"\n\nMoore will on Monday meet with respected surgeon Peter Myers, who has repaired the busted knees of David Pocock and Quade Cooper. Moore played all 15 Wallabies Tests last year but his injury will put a big dent in Australia's World Cup preparations less than a week after coach Ewen McKenzie named Moore as the team's new skipper.\n\nHis Brumbies back-up, Siliva Siliva, is also out for the rest of the year with knee and ankle problems.\n\nMann-Rea was preparing to quit rugby last year and return to work in the coalmines before signing a one-year deal to stay with the Brumbies. Holmes played for the Waratahs last year and Fisher watched the 30-year-old journeyman in Sydney club rugby on Saturday. Former Brumbies hooker Anthony Hegarty is back in Canberra, but it is understood his French club Grenoble has said no to a Super Rugby cameo.\n\nThe Brumbies play the Waratahs on June 28 before finishing the regular season against the Western Force on July 11. They need to win both games to be any chance of clinching Australia's guaranteed finals berth and one loss could ruin their play-off hopes.\n\nCarter could be fit for the clash against the Force and the Brumbies will turn to Leon Power in his absence, while Jack Whetton and Australian under-20s second-rower Tom Staniforth will likely compete for a bench spot.\n\n\"It is really disappointing for both of them ... We're still hoping 'Carts' will be back in the next four to six weeks but without Stephen, particularly, it's going to be difficult for us,\" Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham said.\n\n\"We have Josh Mann-Rea and he's a really good, dogged player, so he'll step up now and we're confident he can do the job for us. It is not ideal but, as a team, we've been through a fair bit together over the last three years, so I am sure we can cope with this.\"\n\n\u2013 with Georgina Robinson", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brumbies, Union News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The Brumbies say Stephen Moore is irreplaceable, but director of rugby Laurie Fisher says the club will fight to save its Super Rugby title ambitions despite a cruel double injury blow in the Wallabies' Test on Saturday night.", "title": "Test injuries to Stephen Moore and Sam Carter turn into Brumbies' pain", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/test-injuries-to-stephen-moore-and-sam-carter-turn-into-brumbies-pain-20140608-zs125.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/9/r/1/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zs125.png/1402212843393.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/9/r/1/7/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zs125.png/1402212843393.jpg"}, "title": "Test injuries to Stephen Moore and Sam Carter turn into Brumbies' pain", "description": "The Brumbies say Stephen Moore is irreplaceable, but director of rugby Laurie Fisher says the club will fight to save its Super Rugby title ambitions despite a cruel double injury blow in the Wallabies' Test on Saturday night.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Brumbies say Stephen Moore is irreplaceable, but director of rugby Laurie Fisher says the club will fight to save its Super Rugby title ambitions despite a ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a96\"", "article_summary": "Injured Wallabies skipper Stephen Moore has been ruled out for the rest of the season, testing the ACT Brumbies' depth.\n\"You're not going to replace like with like for Stephen Moore, a guy who's played 120-odd Super Rugby games and 92 Tests for Australia.\nThe Brumbies say Australian skipper Stephen Moore is irreplaceable, but the club will call in reinforcements to save their Super Rugby season following a double injury blow in the Wallabies' Test on Saturday night.\nFormer Brumbies hooker Anthony Hegarty is back in Canberra, but it is understood his French club Grenoble has said no to a Super Rugby cameo.\nThe Brumbies play the Waratahs on June 28 before finishing the regular season against the Western Force on July 11."}
