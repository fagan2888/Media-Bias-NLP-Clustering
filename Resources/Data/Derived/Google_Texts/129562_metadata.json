Behavior like this is why Dish has a long history of depriving customers of the programing they have paid for.\u201d\n\nThe dispute affects stations in 18 markets and Dish blamed the impasse on negotiations over the CBS Sports Network. CBS-owned Showtime remains available to Dish subscribers.\n\nIn a statement that came more than an hour after CBS went off its system, Dish said: \u201cWe are disappointed that CBS has chosen to black out their local channels, but remain optimistic that the channels will return quickly as both sides are continuing to work tonight to finalize an agreement.\u201d\n\nCBS says it is seeking \u201cappropriate compensation for the most-watched television network with the most popular content in the world, as well as terms that reflect the developing digital marketplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can reach an agreement very soon so we can all get back to the business of providing the best entertainment, news and sports to the Dish customers we both serve,\u201d CBS said.\n\nOver the weekend, Dish Network subscribers will be missing the SEC championship game in college football on Saturday and NFL football on Sunday. For weeks, CBS has been running ads warning Dish subscribers they could be losing CBS programming.\n\nCBS and other broadcasters have been ratcheting up the fees they collect from cable operators and satellite distributors via retransmission consent. CBS recently told analysts that it expected to generate more than $2 billion a year in retrans fees from distributors and affiliates by 2020. It had previously estimated that it would have $1 billion in retrans fees by 2017, but expected to exceed that figure.\n\nLast year CBS was off Time Warner Cable for a month just before the start of the NFL season. After an agreement was reached on terms that favored the broadcaster, Time Warner Cable revealed that it lost more than 306,000 subscribers, resulting in a major financial hit.\n\nDish Network has been in the middle of several contentious carriage negotiations with programmers.\n\nLast month, Dish and Turner Broadcasting reached an extension of their carriage agreement that restored several Turner networks, including CNN and Cartoon Network to Dish customers. The network had been off the air for about a month.\n\nThe extension also included Turner\u2019s biggest channels, TNT and TBS, and is expect to last until just before those networks will air the NBA All Star Game, the NCAA basketball tournament and the NBA playoffs.\n\nDish Networks deals with several regional sports networks run by Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal unit also expired. Those networks continue to appear under a short-term extension.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.broadcastingcable.com/sites/default/files/public/NCIS_0.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=561751453", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "For weeks, CBS has been running ads warning Dish subscribers they could be losing CBS programming.\nCBS said it has taken its programming off Dish Network effective at 7 p.m.\nOver the weekend, Dish Network subscribers will be missing the SEC championship game in college football on Saturday and NFL football on Sunday.\nDish Network has been in the middle of several contentious carriage negotiations with programmers.\n\u201cCBS has been negotiating a carriage agreement with Dish for six months and has already granted two extensions,\u201d CBS said in a statement."}
