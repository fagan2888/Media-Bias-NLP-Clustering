The third and fourth runs are Friday.\n\nShe is 0.69 of a second behind pacesetter Elizabeth Yarnold of Great Britain and 0.25 behind teammate Noelle Pikus-Pace, who is in second. They may be tough for Uhlaender to catch, but she\u2019s only 0.14 behind the third-place slider, Elena Nikitina of Russia.\n\nFeisty as ever, Uhlaender pretended to walk away in anger Thursday after she was asked if she could make up the 0.14 margin for the bronze medal. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to do my thing, and hopefully I can put two runs together.\u201d\n\nUhlaender finished sixth in the 2006 Turin Olympics and 11th in the 2010 Vancouver Games. She won a gold medal at the 2012 world championships and is a two-time World Cup season champion.\n\nShe slid the bottom of the course well on her first run Thursday but made mistakes at the top. She slid the top well on her second run but made mistakes on the bottom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got to put them together,\u201d she said.\n\nYarnold and Pikus-Pace have been the women to beat on the World Cup circuit this season. Yarnold is exceptional in the 20-meter sprint before the riding begins, and her first run Thursday broke the track record with a top speed of 78.8 mph.\n\n\u201cTo see Lizzie have those starts, man, it\u2019s going to really tough to catch her,\u201d Uhlaender said. \u201cAnything\u2019s possible, it just depends on how she\u2019s going to handle the pressure overnight, how hard she went today, if she\u2019s got anything left tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to be better tomorrow than I was today, but I don\u2019t want to jinx myself.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Katie Uhlaender, teammate in hunt for medals midway through skeleton", "title": "Katie Uhlaender, teammate in hunt for medals midway through skeleton", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/12/katie-uhlaender-teammate-in-hunt-for-medals-midway-through-skeleton/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213__skeleton_thurs_cd_10p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213__skeleton_thurs_cd_10p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T06:20:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:42:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAnything\u2019s possible, it just depends on how she\u2019s going to handle the pressure overnight, how hard she went today, if she\u2019s got anything left tomorrow.\nShe slid the top well on her second run but made mistakes on the bottom.\nThey may be tough for Uhlaender to catch, but she\u2019s only 0.14 behind the third-place slider, Elena Nikitina of Russia.\nShe is 0.69 of a second behind pacesetter Elizabeth Yarnold of Great Britain and 0.25 behind teammate Noelle Pikus-Pace, who is in second.\n\u201cTo see Lizzie have those starts, man, it\u2019s going to really tough to catch her,\u201d Uhlaender said."}
