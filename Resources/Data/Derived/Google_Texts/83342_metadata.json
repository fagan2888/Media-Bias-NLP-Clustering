I know we will prevail.\u201d\n\nFast Facts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\nOf all racial and ethnic groups, Black and African Americans bear the biggest brunt of the HIV & AIDS epidemic.\n\nIf current trends continue uninterrupted, half of today\u2019s young, Black and gay and bisexual men will be living with HIV by the age of 35.\n\nWhen compared to other transgender women, Black transgender women have the highest percentage of new HIV-positive test results.\n\nPrevention Challenges:\n\nHigh Prevalence Rates: The comparatively large percentage of Black and African Americans living with HIV means that, as a group, we have a much greater chance of coming into contact with HIV, whether knowingly or not.\n\nSocioeconomic Factors: Black and African Americans are more likely to be impoverished, which can mean limited access to quality and affordable healthcare and healthcare insurance, housing instability and high unemployment.\n\nStigma and Discrimination: Many Black and African Americans delay getting tested or treated for HIV out of fear of stigma and discrimination.\n\nWays to Learn More and Get Involved:\n\nHRC is committed to working with our allies, partners, members, and supporters to end the HIV epidemic and the stigma surrounding HIV.
