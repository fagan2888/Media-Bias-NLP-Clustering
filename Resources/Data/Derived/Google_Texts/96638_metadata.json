The election itself triggered two lawsuits \u2014 one challenging the ballot-counting process and the other failing in its attempt this week to get a judge to halt the vote counting.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Castle Rock voters say authority to restrict firearms rests with them", "title": "Castle Rock voters say authority to restrict firearms rests with them", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/28/castle-rock-voters-say-authority-to-restrict-firearms-rests-with-them/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822__opencarry2p1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822__opencarry2p1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-28T15:43:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:48:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb92\"", "article_summary": "Referendum B, which asked whether future firearms restrictions in Castle Rock should be decided by voters, passed easily \u2014 78 percent to 28 percent (6,610 to 2,679).\nThe final results of Castle Rock\u2019s Aug. 19 special election were announced Thursday afternoon, after 10 days of counting ballots.\nCastle Rock voters have taken away the town manager\u2019s power to restrict the open carry of firearms in public buildings and parks, while insisting that any future decisions on gun restrictions in town of 50,000 go to a vote of the people.\nTown attorney Bob Slentz said that if the vote totals are certified, people would be able to visibly carry firearms in public spaces, with the exception of schools and courts.\nReferendum A, which asked whether the town manager should lose the authority to ban the open carry of firearms in public buildings and parks, squeaked by \u2014 50.8 percent to 49.2 percent (4,737 votes to 4,586)."}
