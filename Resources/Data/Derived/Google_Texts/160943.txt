When the FAA registration website goes live next Monday, current owners will have two months to register.

A whole lot of Americans are hoping they'll find a drone under their Christmas trees next week. But that new toy now comes with new rules from the federal government.

When the FAA registration website goes live next Monday, current owners will have two months to register. Newly purchases devices will have to be registered before they can be flown.

Former FAA assistant administrator Scott Brenner believes the registration program is necessary.

"I think the FAA was struggling with how do we educate new users. And by creating this registry, now we have a direct link to every user which will allow us to do a tremendous amount of education," said Scott Brenner, Former Assistant Administrator, FAA.

The FAA hopes the education will prevent more close calls in the air. A new report identified 158 incidents in the last two years where a drone cane within 200 feet of another aircraft.

So far, there has never been a confirmed collision between a drone and another aircraft.

The new registration system will require drone owners to give their name, mailing address, and email, and pay a $5 fee. However, the FAA is waiving the fee for the first 30 days.

All operators will be given an I.D. number to display on their drone.
