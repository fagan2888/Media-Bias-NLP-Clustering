Pat McCrory made a special stop at Camp Lejeune on Thursday where he promised our service men and women that they will be taken care of after life in the military.\n\nMcCrory says through programs like NC Works and the North Carolina Military Pipeline, his goal is to get veterans into good jobs after their service. The governor said military members are hardworking and dedicated, and that many have skill sets beneficial to the workforce.\n\nStaff Sergeant Alton Walden said he has a job lined up after he gets out of the Marine Corps thanks to programs like this.\n\n\"The community is representing the governor very well. I believe that they are showing they appreciate what we do, that were not just laying down our lives for anything,\" says Walden. \"Of course that's what we do, however they're compensating us by making sure we have jobs when we get out.\"\n\nNC Works has been bridging the gap between veterans and jobs for years, but the North Carolina Military Pipeline is now also accessible to all military veterans, regardless of time served.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS STORY:\n\nRepublican governor, Pat McCrory, is heading east Thursday and bringing some good news for veterans with him.\n\nThe Governor will be making a veterans employment initiative announcement around 2 p.m. Thursday during his visit to Camp Lejeune.\n\n\"Veterans are a real selling point for businesses in North Carolina, and I want to make it easier to connect veterans to businesses who are looking for hard-working and intelligent men and women,\" said McCrory.\n\nWe will let you know what we learn about the initiative and how local veterans can take advantage of it once the announcement is made.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
