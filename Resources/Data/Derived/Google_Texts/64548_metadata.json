They were accused of using insider information to win $54 million worth of inflated contracts to supply Afghan troops.\n\nLustyik, 52, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he promised to \u201cblow the doors off\u201d the investigation in exchange for a share in the multimillion-dollar business.\n\nLustyik tried to shield the company\u2019s chief, Michael Taylor, by creating a dossier of staged interviews with former government agents and prosecutors, according to court documents, and told a Utah FBI agent that Taylor had helped in the capture of a significant terrorist.\n\n\u201cI will not stop in my attempt to sway this your way,\u201d he told Taylor in an email, saying he would \u201ccrush\u201d the Utah case agent, documents state.\n\nUtah authorities started investigating after an associate of Taylor\u2019s made a series of cash withdrawals from a St. George credit union just under the federal reporting limit of $10,000.\n\nIn exchange for $200,000 in cash and money purportedly for his child\u2019s medical expenses, Lustyik also tried to contact witnesses in the investigation, records say. He appeared convinced his lifetime in law enforcement was about to pay off in 2012 when he offered $1 million to a friend as a gift, court records state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made us all stinking rich!!!\u201d Lustyik wrote the friend, according to an email intercepted by the government. \u201cFor 30 years I\u2019ve sacrificed to get to this point.\u201d\n\nLustyik has pleaded not guilty to fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. His attorney did not return messages seeking comment Friday, but the defense has said snippets of emails don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nA childhood friend, Johannes Thaler, is charged with acting as a messenger between Lustyik and Taylor. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTaylor and two former soldiers pleaded guilty in the scheme last year.\n\nLustyik, who retired in 2012 from his post in White Plains, New York, is also facing charges in New York alleging that he and Thaler sold confidential information to someone who wanted to harm a prominent citizen of Bangladesh. Both men have pleaded not guilty in that case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A former FBI agent is slated to go on trial in Salt Lake City on Monday accused of trying to thwart an investigation into military contract fraud by making a suspect look like a valuable counterintelligence source.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A former FBI agent is slated to go on trial in Salt Lake City on Monday accused of trying to thwart an investigation into military contract fraud by making a suspect look like a valuable counterintelligence source.", "title": "Ex-FBI agent goes on trial for interference", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/28/ex-fbi-agent-headed-to-trial-in-afghan-scheme/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/28/55de3f542c35fd26600f6a70670021c7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/28/55de3f542c35fd26600f6a70670021c7.jpg", "description": "A former FBI agent is slated to go on trial in Salt Lake City on Monday accused of trying to thwart an investigation into military contract fraud by making a suspect look like a valuable counterintell", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ex-FBI agent goes on trial for interference"}, "Author": "LINDSAY WHITEHURST", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceae3\"", "article_summary": "Federal prosecutors say retired agent Robert Lustyik Jr. agreed to derail a Utah-based investigation into a company started by former soldiers.\nTaylor and two former soldiers pleaded guilty in the scheme last year.\n\u201cFor 30 years I\u2019ve sacrificed to get to this point.\u201dLustyik has pleaded not guilty to fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges.\n\u201cI will not stop in my attempt to sway this your way,\u201d he told Taylor in an email, saying he would \u201ccrush\u201d the Utah case agent, documents state.\nThey were accused of using insider information to win $54 million worth of inflated contracts to supply Afghan troops."}
