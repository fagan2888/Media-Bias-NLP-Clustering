He fled to Pittsburgh and now, his parents are here as well.\n\nIt was a reunion more than two decades in the making. For the first time in 23 years, Alkhuzai hugged his father and cried with this mother. He was overwhelmed with joy, love, heartache, Sunday evening, at Pittsburgh International Airport, as he saw them for the first time since he left Iraq.\n\n\"Honest to god, like the truth, I don't have no words in the dictionary to explain how happy I am,\" Alkhuzai said.\n\nIn Iraq, he was tortured under Saddam Hussein's rule, he says, beaten, stabbed, and starved in prison.\n\nAlkhuzai fled to the United States in 1994 and 10 years later, he made national headlines when a federal court awarded him $88 million after he sued Saddam and his two sons.\n\nIt was a turning point in Alkhuzai's life, but he says the happiness he felt then doesn't compare to today.\n\n\"Right now I feel life is complete. Especially my city of Pittsburgh. I feel like it's my hometown because my mom and my dad they are with me,\" he said.\n\nIt's a day his wife wasn't sure she'd ever see.\n\n\"It just means everything that his dream came true for him. This meant everything for him,\" said Christine Alkhuzai.\n\nNow this reunited family looks forward to building a life together in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Just spending time with them and seeing my husband reunite. Just starting a new chapter in his life,\" she said.\n\nAlkhuzai's parents will be staying here in the U.S. for good. His wife says Congressman Mike Doyle helped get them here after Alkhuzai's three brothers were also killed in Iraq.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 23:03:27 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Courtney Fischer", "og": {"site_name": "WTAE", "description": "An Iraqi refugee who sued Saddam Hussein in Pittsburgh federal court 10 years ago and won, was reunited with his parents after 23 years apart.", "title": "Iraqi refugee welcomes parents to Pittsburgh", "url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/iraqi-refugee-welcomes-parents-to-pittsburgh/29894778", "image": "http://www.wtae.com/image/view/-/29894846/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/3gx34fz/-/IRAQIREUNION-PNG.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/iraqi-refugee-welcomes-parents-to-pittsburgh/29894778", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wtae://content/article/29894778", "iphone": "wtae://content/article/29894778", "googleplay": "wtae://content/article/29894778"}, "name": {"ipad": "wtae", "iphone": "wtae", "googleplay": "wtae"}, "id": {"ipad": 506053781, "iphone": 506053781, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}}, "site": "@WTAE", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wtae://content/article/29894778", "app_name": "wtae", "package": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}, "ios": {"url": "wtae://content/article/29894778", "app_store_id": 506053781, "app_name": "wtae"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 103664079013}, "keywords": "Iraqi, Refugee, Iraq, Homecoming, Reunion, Saddam Hussein, Lawsuit, Sue", "google-site-verification": "yDb1_gOPiN1BUVxthVho7DtUbsFNoHF1JMM4A1Pldk8", "news_keywords": "Iraqi, Refugee, Iraq, Homecoming, Reunion, Saddam Hussein, Lawsuit, Sue", "description": "An Iraqi refugee who sued Saddam Hussein in Pittsburgh federal court 10 years ago and won, was reunited with his parents after 23 years apart."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca140\"", "article_summary": "He fled to Pittsburgh and now, his parents are here as well.\n\"Right now I feel life is complete.\nAbdullah Alkhuzai was tortured by Saddam Hussein and his henchmen back in the early '90s.\nIn Iraq, he was tortured under Saddam Hussein's rule, he says, beaten, stabbed, and starved in prison.\nHe was overwhelmed with joy, love, heartache, Sunday evening, at Pittsburgh International Airport, as he saw them for the first time since he left Iraq."}
