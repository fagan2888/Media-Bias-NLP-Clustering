His wife, Amanda, 33, was arrested the day before Ryan, and faces a felony count of heroin possession.\n\nPalmer and her loved ones are among families throughout the state grappling with an opioid crisis Gov. Maggie Hassan has called an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\nKeene\u2019s police and fire departments have responded to 199 overdoses in all since 2013. In the past two years, 17 people have died in the city from drug overdoses.\n\nPalmer said she doesn\u2019t know exactly when her son started using heroin, but first became aware of his addiction about two years ago. Though she tried to reach out to him, she said, he didn\u2019t seem to want the help.\n\n\u201cThey shut you down,\u201d she said of addicts. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they shut you down because they love you or if they shut you down because now you know and you want to help them and they\u2019re not ready to be helped.\u201d\n\nEfforts by The Sentinel to reach Ryan and Amanda Williams in jail were unsuccessful by the time the paper went to press today. The couple last lived in Swanzey.\n\nRyan Williams is being held at the Cheshire County jail without bail and is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Concord on Aug. 24. Amanda is also at the county jail, where she\u2019ll stay until she finds a place to live while undergoing drug treatment and counseling through Cheshire County\u2019s Alternative Sentencing Program and Mental Health Court.\n\nAmong the reasons the Williams\u2019 case resonated locally is because of the media attention and community support their son Oliver, now 4, gained as a baby as he struggled with a rare blood condition.\n\nCalled Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, the disorder prevents patients\u2019 blood from clotting and leaves them vulnerable to blood disease. The community rallied behind the young family, and Oliver received a bone marrow transplant in 2011. Oliver is safe with family, according to Palmer.\n\n\u201cOur family never took for granted what was done in this community,\u201d she said.\n\nPalmer said her focus now is on taking care of her family as they navigate the waters through addiction, treatment and the court system.\n\nWhile the legal consequences of substance abuse are often very public, less visible are the struggles families face behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pain that runs deep for a lot of people,\u201d Palmer said.\n\nThe pain comes from not knowing if someone you love is going to get hurt, and not being able to help, Palmer explained. She searched for a solution to her son\u2019s addiction for a while, attending support groups in the area, but continually came up empty-handed.\n\n\u201cI was the mom who wanted to fix it and they wanted to teach me I couldn\u2019t fix it,\u201d Palmer said.\n\n\u201cAnd they were right, I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d\n\nAn increasing problem\n\nAbout 3 percent of New Hampshire residents who took part in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health between 2010 and 2011 said they\u2019d used heroin at least once in their lifetime. This statistic was included in the June 2014 Collective Action Issue Brief by the N.H. Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Services, N.H. Center for Excellence and the N.H. Charitable Foundation.\n\nNationally, the average age people start using heroin is 23, according to the brief.\n\n\u201cThe kids are younger, they get addicted faster because the heroin is strong and it\u2019s cheaper and more readily available,\u201d said Amelie Gooding, director of Phoenix House in Keene.\n\nPhoenix House is a nonprofit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization with programs in 10 states. There are four in New Hampshire: one in Keene and Northfield, and two in Dublin.\n\nMore people are coming to the Keene Phoenix House to get treatment for heroin, according to Gooding. In 2011, 32 percent of the 189 admissions were for heroin addiction, she said. In 2014, this number increased to 58 percent of the 489 admissions.\n\nThough part of the reason for the increase in admissions was due to more widespread access to health care from the Affordable Care Act, these numbers are still indicative of an increase in heroin use, Gooding said.\n\nAnd as more people use heroin, more people are dying.\n\nThis past spring, the state medical examiner announced that 321 drug-related deaths occurred in New Hampshire in 2014. Of these, 97 were caused by heroin \u2014 either alone or in combination with other drugs. Another 143 deaths involved the potent opioid painkiller fentanyl, either by itself or combined with other drugs.\n\nBased on these numbers, the medical examiner\u2019s report said deaths from heroin had become more common in New Hampshire than deaths from traffic accidents.\n\nHow can a family help?\n\nWhile these statistics are a clear indication of the epidemic at hand, how families and friends can help their loved ones isn\u2019t always as obvious.\n\nFamilies are key to a successful recovery, according to Gooding.\n\n\u201cWhen (health care workers are) long gone ... families will always be around,\u201d she said.\n\nFamilies may also be directly involved in medical treatment, due in part to wider accessibility of overdose reversal medication.\n\nNarcan, a brand name for naloxone, used to be available only in hospital emergency departments. First responders now keep the medicine with them in case it needs to be administered in the field.\n\nOn June 2, Hassan signed into law a bill that allows doctors to prescribe Narcan to people who either have friends or family members at risk of overdosing, or are at risk themselves.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that family members never had to think about before,\u201d Gooding said.\n\nThe emotional distress of helping a loved one through addiction and into recovery is incomprehensible, according to Polly Morris. She works as a coordinator for Monadnock Voices for Prevention, a regional network that works to reduce substance abuse in communities.\n\n\u201cIt goes past the point of worrying,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nPalmer, for example, worries about whether she\u2019s somehow responsible for her son\u2019s addiction.\n\n\u201cYou question what you did. \u2018What did I do, what did I do wrong?\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nFor this reason, Morris said families must find a way to deal with the stresses of the situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that they have a community that you\u2019re welcome in, supported in and can still be yourself,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Monadnock Region hosts a variety of addiction support groups on any given night of the week. Nar-Anon in Keene, for example, meets every Thursday in the basement of St. James Episcopal Church on West Street.\n\nMembers of the group \u2014 for family members of people struggling, or in recovery from, substance abuse problems \u2014 agreed to speak with The Sentinel on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to explain,\u201d said a woman whose son was just over four years into his recovery from substance abuse. \u201cEveryone that comes to this meeting knows exactly what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing here helps us to become strong and more educated on the subject.\u201d\n\nThe group shows the strength that can come from shared experiences, said Sue Avery, who runs the Keene and Brattleboro chapters of the support group.\n\n\u201cWe have a common thread, we all have a family disease,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA lot of hope in this room comes from the support ... that we give each other.\u201d\n\nMorris said her advice for people as they try to help loved ones through addiction is similar to that given in the event of an airplane crash: Put the mask on yourself, flight attendants say, before assisting anyone else.\n\n\u201cYou have to take care of yourself before you start taking care of others,\u201d she said.\n\nOvercoming a stigma\n\nFor Palmer and others whose loved ones suffer from substance abuse problems, a major challenge can be overcoming the stigma thrown not just at their loved ones, but also at themselves.\n\nBecause of this, Morris said, parents are often scared to talk about their child as an addict, even if the signs of drug abuse are clear.\n\nPart of the reason for the stigma comes from the lack of education around the subject, she said.\n\nTreatment facilities are doing their part to help raise awareness on how to work with a loved one in recovery.\n\nAt Phoenix House, for example, Gooding said a patient\u2019s family members are not allowed to visit until they attend an hour-long seminar to learn about the Phoenix House programs.\n\n\u201cWe really want to capture the family, and make sure they hear about treatment and recovery,\u201d Gooding said.\n\nBut even armed with this information, the process can be difficult.\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate balance between tough love and compassion, according to Morris; while you don\u2019t want to cut off someone with a dependency issue completely, she said, you can\u2019t let them take advantage of you, either.\n\n\u201cIt might take more than once\u201d for a person to enter into recovery, Morris said.\n\n\u201cJust keep going, don\u2019t give up on your person.\u201d\n\nBecause as hard as situations like this may be, Palmer said, she will never stop caring about her son.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s caught; I am, and that nobody was hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cNo police officers were hurt, my son wasn\u2019t hurt, no one innocent got hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m his mom, and I\u2019m wondering just how lonely he is right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "The mug shot of her son is not the image Doreen Palmer sees when she closes her eyes.", "title": "A deep pain: families torn apart by drugs", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/a-deep-pain-families-torn-apart-by-drugs/article_dcb4d04d-53e3-55a4-a844-1b320a76ef2e.html", "image": {"width": 664, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/d0/5d05af42-4823-5bad-b858-c416820f7c18/55cc9a7f41980.image.jpg?resize=664%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local,featured,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local,featured,top_story", "description": "The mug shot of her son is not the image Doreen Palmer sees when she closes her eyes."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9a2\"", "article_summary": "In 2011, 32 percent of the 189 admissions were for heroin addiction, she said.\n\u201cWe really want to capture the family, and make sure they hear about treatment and recovery,\u201d Gooding said.\nMore people are coming to the Keene Phoenix House to get treatment for heroin, according to Gooding.\nNar-Anon in Keene, for example, meets every Thursday in the basement of St. James Episcopal Church on West Street.\nPalmer said she doesn\u2019t know exactly when her son started using heroin, but first became aware of his addiction about two years ago."}
