CMS told the committee after the hearing that it got back $285 million in grants out of $5.5 billion given to all the states for the planning and establishment of a state-based exchange.\n\nThe House committee believed that the $200 million figure was just from the 17 states that set up their own exchanges. They also thought that the money was from unspent or improperly spent funds, since Slavitt referred to efforts to get back misspent funds right before announcing the $200 million figure.\n\n\"Because Mr. Slavitt made his remarks in the context of recouping misspent funds from the 17 [state-based exchanges], it was widely assumed \u2014 and reported in the media \u2014 that the $200 million figure represented funds recouped because CMS found [state-based exchanges] spent them improperly,\" the report said.\n\nThe committee charged that only $21.5 million was acquired from those 17 exchanges.\n\n\"Additionally, that $21.5 million was not actually 'recouped.' Rather the funds were de-obligated because the grant had expired or the funds were no longer needed,\" the committee said.\n\nThe GOP-led committee charges Slavitt with providing testimony based on \"estimates and conjecture, not facts.\"\n\nBut the administration stands by the testimony and its accuracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A House committee says a high-ranking Obama official misled lawmakers over the amount of Obamacare grants returned to taxpayers.\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a new report Tuesday that charged Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with misleading lawmakers during a December hearing over a question on grants extended to state-run Obamacare exchanges.
