Sam Brownback have struggled to balance the state budget in recent years due to sharp drops in revenue, caused in part by income tax cuts approved in 2012. Last year, they were forced to approve large sales and tobacco tax increases to avert a $400 million budget shortfall. They start this year\u2019s session facing a projected $190 million deficit in the fiscal 2017 budget, which they must approve before adjourning.\n\nOutlining the savings report Tuesday to members of the House Appropriations Committee, Melissa Glynn, a managing director of the firm, acknowledged that some recommendations would be easier to implement than others. But on the whole, she said, \u201cwe think these are very possible recommendations.\u201d\n\nHowever, one immediately sparked controversy.\n\nThe report says the state could save nearly $124 million over five years by limiting state workers to one health insurance option, a high-deductible plan that would require employees to cover a significant portion of their medical costs with money from a health savings account to which both they and the state would contribute.\n\nRep. Mark Kahrs, a Wichita Republican, said that while he\u2019s not ready to endorse the recommendation, it\u2019s worth discussing.\n\n\u201cHigh-deductible plans are fairly normative in the private sector, so I think it\u2019s a fair conversation to have,\u201d Kahrs said, adding that he wants to discuss how such a change in policy might affect the state\u2019s ability to attract and retain good employees before taking a position on it.\n\nRep. Jerry Henry of Atchison, the top Democrat on the committee, opposed the change, contending it would penalize state workers and make it harder for the state to recruit and retain them.\n\nHenry said the change \u201csqueezes state employees \u2026 who haven\u2019t had a raise in six or seven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to lose purchasing power by going to this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report also recommends that the state no longer allow retirees who are not yet 65 to continue their state health coverage until they become eligible for Medicare. Moving them into bridge plans offered in the insurance marketplace created by the federal Affordable Care Act would save the state an estimated $12 million to $15 million a year through 2021, the report says.\n\nNew health plan for school districts\n\nAnother recommendation focuses on reducing the cost of providing health insurance to the nearly 70,000 full-time employees of Kansas school districts.\n\nCurrently, the state\u2019s 286 districts have the option of participating in the state employee health plan, but few do. The report says creating a new \u201cconsolidated\u201d state plan for school employees could save up to $80 million a year. The new plan would be separate from the state employee plan but would share administrative costs.\n\nReducing Medicaid error rates\n\nSeveral of the 260 pages in the consultant\u2019s report are devoted to addressing two problem areas in the state\u2019s privatized Medicaid program, known as KanCare.\n\nAccording to the report, Kansas has among the highest payment and eligibility error rates in the nation. Its payment error rate is 17.9 percent, almost 50 percent higher than the next highest state. Its eligibility error rate of 12.8 percent is nearly four times the national average of 3.3 percent.\n\nThe report says the eligibility error rate \u201cis the most concerning\u201d because it means the state is paying the private insurance companies that run KanCare to cover people who aren\u2019t eligible for the program.\n\nA recent decision by Brownback to transfer the main responsibility for determining KanCare eligibility from the Department for Children and Families to the Department of Health and Environment and stepped-up efforts to implement a new enrollment system that has been delayed for years and plagued by cost overruns are \u201cimportant steps\u201d toward addressing the problems, the report says.\n\nBut they\u2019re not enough. The consultants recommend \u201coutsourcing all eligibility functions\u201d to a private company.\n\nReducing the eligibility error rate to the national average would save the state an estimated $60 million a year, according to the consultants.\n\nSaving on KanCare births\n\nThe state could achieve up to $6.5 million a year in KanCare savings by focusing on several childbirth policies, according to the report.\n\nEnsuring that babies aren\u2019t delivered prior to 39 weeks gestation unless it\u2019s medically necessary would reduce the number of low birth weight babies and expensive stays in neonatal inventive care units. And encouraging pregnant women enrolled in KanCare to deliver in birthing centers staffed by certified nurse midwives instead of hospitals could save more than $3,400 per birth, according to the report.\n\nThat\u2019s easier said than done. Increasing the use of birth centers would require changing state licensing laws to allow nurse midwives to practice independently. Currently, they must have a signed collaborative agreement with a sponsoring physician.\n\n\u201cKansas should define the role of CNMs (certified nurse midwives) and protect public safety by defining the scope of midwifery while recognizing and enabling full practice authority for CNMs,\u201d the report says.\n\nBackers of a bill granting midwives full practice authority hope the consultant\u2019s report improves its chances of passing. But fears that any health bill could lead to a floor debate on Medicaid expansion could limit the bill\u2019s chances of getting out of the House or Senate health committees.\n\nRep. Dan Hawkins, the Wichita Republican who chairs the House Health and Human Services Committee, said he supports the bill but isn\u2019t sure whether the consultant\u2019s recommendations will boost its chances.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A tentative plan to save Kansas government more than $2 billion over five years relies heavily on proposed changes to the state employee health plan and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/kansas-efficiency-report-recommends-single-health-insurance-plan-state-employees", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201601/glynn_efficiency_consultant.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A tentative plan to save Kansas government more than $2 billion over five years relies heavily on proposed changes to the state employee health plan and", "title": "Kansas Efficiency Report Recommends Single Health Insurance Plan For State Employees"}, "story_id": 462828824, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KHIorg"}, "author": "Jim McLean", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas Efficiency Report Recommends Single Health Insurance Plan For State Employees"}, "nid": 84306, "datePublished": "2016-01-12", "keywords": "Kansas budget, KanCare, Medicaid, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 1073, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42bb\"", "article_summary": "New health plan for school districtsAnother recommendation focuses on reducing the cost of providing health insurance to the nearly 70,000 full-time employees of Kansas school districts.\nA tentative plan to save Kansas government more than $2 billion over five years relies heavily on proposed changes to the state employee health plan and Medicaid.\nCurrently, the state\u2019s 286 districts have the option of participating in the state employee health plan, but few do.\nThe report says creating a new \u201cconsolidated\u201d state plan for school employees could save up to $80 million a year.\nThe report also recommends that the state no longer allow retirees who are not yet 65 to continue their state health coverage until they become eligible for Medicare."}
