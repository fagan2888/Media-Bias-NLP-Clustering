Her life depends on it.\n\nShe gave birth to her first child Sept. 2 after undergoing a series of rigorous steroid treatments, surgeries and a plasma exchange that saved her life. She pays $325 a month for an individual insurance plan \u2013 a drop in the bucket compared with the cost of her plasma protein replacement therapy, which runs $40,000 a pop. She undergoes treatment every five weeks.\n\nBut now, with the Affordable Care Act in full swing, Johnson\u2019s insurance is under threat.\n\nRecently, the story explains, Johnson\u2019s insurer sent her a letter saying that because her policy \u201cdoes not comply with Obamacare\u201d it will be cancelled Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nIn a video talking about her experience, Johnson claims that when she started \u201ctrying to shop around, the rates went from $1,000 to $1,800 a month for not even close to the coverage that my previous insurance had offered me.\u201d\n\nJohnson also told the reporter that her husband\u2019s employer covered him as well as her son, but that if she tried to join his plan, his $325 premium would triple.\n\nFamiliar \u2018horror story\u2019\n\nJohnson\u2019s charge that Obamacare has ruined her perfectly good health coverage and stands to drive her premiums through the roof is far from unique. These are the complaints that have shown up, again and again, in recent media reports about the impact of the ACA.\n\nBut when \u201cvictims\u201d step forward, reporters need to investigate these claims. If newspaper editors and television producers are willing to put them in the media spotlight \u2013 in front of a huge local or even national audience \u2013 they also have a duty to give their readers and viewers the facts they need so that they can judge the validity of the allegations.\n\nHave the people profiled in these stories actually checked prices in the exchanges? Do they know whether they would qualify for government subsidies that could help cover their premiums? How many didn\u2019t even try to find out because they just don\u2019t like the ACA? Who are these people who are willing to identify themselves as casualties of the \u201ctrainwreck\u201d called Obamacare?\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, are reporters fact checking these stories? How many are just writing down whatever their sources tell them?\n\nWith those questions in mind, I decided to do a little fact checking myself.\n\nOver $1,000/month to insure 26-year-old\n\nAccording to the Star-Telegram, Johnson \u201chad been unable to access the federal health exchange website, which has been hampered by technical problems.\u201d Fair enough; in October many people ran into glitches on HealthCare.gov. But this also told me that, in fact, she had no idea how much an exchange policy would cost.\n\nMeanwhile, she insisted that when she \u201ctried researching and comparing rates with other insurance companies\u201d outside the exchanges she discovered that a plan comparable to the cancelled policy would cost \u201cover $1,000\u201d and \u201cthat was just a quote. I was told I should expect that cost to go up.\u201d\n\nThat was when I realized that there was something very wrong with her story. The facts just didn\u2019t add up.\n\nAnyone who knows anything about Obamacare would realize that under the ACA, no 26-year-old would be asked to pay $12,000 a year \u2013 even if she had MS. Obamacare does not let insurers charge more because a customer suffers from a pre-existing condition. This rule applies to all new policies, whether they are sold inside or outside the exchanges.\n\nAnd Johnson is just 26. In the exchanges, 20-somethings pay far less than older Americans. I was certain that that she could get a much better deal. It didn\u2019t take me long to find one.\n\nUsing HealthCare.gov, I plugged in Johnson\u2019s age, and the county where she lives. Since she suffers from MS, I realized that she would want a Gold plan rather than a less expensive Bronze or Silver plan. Within ten minutes, I found ten Gold plans with premiums ranging from $260 to $379 a month \u2013 including a Blue Choice Gold PPO for $332.\n\nThat was just $7 more than Johnson had been paying for the plan that has been cancelled. The deductible is low ($1,500) and limits her annual total out-of-pocket spending to $3,500.\n\nHer co-pay when visiting a specialist would be $60. Co-pays for medications would range from $35 to $150 for a \u201cspecialty prescription.\u201d (These co-pays are not \u201cafter the deductible. She would owe just $60 when seeing a specialist, even though she had not yet paid down the deductible.)\n\nNo fact checking\n\nI was puzzled: Why had no one at the Star-Telegram checked HealthCare.gov? When the November 26 article was published, the website was working smoothly. (As of November 30, over 17,000 Texans had enrolled in the marketplace, more than in any other state except California, New York, Florida and Washington.)\n\nWithout fact checking, the paper published the article, and Johnson\u2019s tale went viral, turning up everywhere from Sean Hannity\u2019s show, to House speaker John Boehner\u2019s website. Boehner also tweeted the story. Anyone who read the story would be led to believe that under Obamacare, a 20-Something might have to fork over $1,000 a month for coverage.\n\nIf you wanted to discourage young Americans from enrolling, this story would do the trick.\n\nWho is Whitney Johnson?\n\nWhen a reporter isn\u2019t familiar with a source, he normally does a background check to make sure the source doesn\u2019t have an axe to grind.\n\nWhen I Googled Whitney Johnson, a letter that she had written to a pro-life organization called Concerned Women for America \u2013 asking for help \u2013 popped up. The letter immediately explained why she might be willing, even eager, to believe that Obamacare would triple her premiums:\n\n\u201cI am one of many who have been lied to over and over again by our president,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cI am one of many other fellow countrymen who have preexisting conditions \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore you tune me out and accuse me of being a radical conservative, understand that I\u2019m neither a democrat nor republican; I\u2019m an American. An American that wants to see our country restored to its original intent. A country for the people, by the people. A country that once again can stand up and say, \u2018In God we trust!\u2019 \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe as a nation need to stand with the likes of Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Mike Lee who are committed to stopping ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nThe letter continues in this vein for some eight paragraphs. She ends by quoting Norman Thomas:\n\n\u201cThe American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under the name of \u2018liberalism\u2019 they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.\u201d\n\nWhitney Johnson may not be a Republican or a Democrat, but her letter makes it clear that she is far from apolitical. She was channeling Ronald Reagan. With a little more Googling, I found her Facebook page, which revealed that she is a member of the Parker County Tea Party Facebook Group and that she has attended its meetings. (Her mother, Dawn King, was one of two founding members when the Parker County Tea Party was formed in 2009.)\n\nAt that point, I wondered: Who are the other three people profiled in the article?\n\nDetermined to boycott Obamacare\n\nI began with Shari Lusk. The 57-year-old retired school teacher from Lubbock, Texas, was candid in her Star-Telegram interview, confiding that she was \u201cenraged\u201d when she found out that her premiums would rise under a new policy that complies with the Affordable Care Act. She didn\u2019t attempt to find coverage through the exchange because she didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Obamacare:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any kind of subsidy,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the government giving me money that takes away from a fellow citizen when I can pay for it. And I don\u2019t want my personal information out there for anybody to have ahold of.\u201d\n\nSo Lusk looked outside the exchange and bought a $420 policy \u2013 $60 more than she had been paying \u2013 with a deductible that is $1,000 higher.\n\nWhen I Googled Lusk, I discovered that she is no stranger to publicity. A year ago, she was interviewed on television, describing how she drove 16 hours, alone, to Nashville in order to attend a Tea Party convention. When asked by a reporter why she made the pilgrimage, she replied, \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s time for the people who love this country and are conservative to step up to the plate, to speak up and to change some things that are going on in Washington.\u201d\n\nObamacare is not the reason Lusk is paying more for insurance. Her own politics determined her decision to boycott the exchange. That is her right. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Could she have gotten a better deal on the exchange?\n\nHealthCare.gov reveals that a 57-year-old living in Lubbock could pick up a Bronze policy for $320 \u2013 $100 less than the plan Lusk bought. Alternatively, since she is 57, she might be better off with a Gold plan that comes with a zero deductible. The premium is $583, but co-pays are low ($30 when seeing a primary care doc; $60 when visiting a specialist).\n\nFinally, since Lusk is a 57-year-old single retiree, very likely she earns less than $45,000, and would qualify for a government subsidy, slashing the premium.\n\nThe Star-Telegram describes Lusk as one of Obamacare\u2019s \u201closers.\u201d In fact, Lusk could have been one of Obamacare\u2019s \u201cwinners.\u201d She just didn\u2019t want to benefit from the ACA. This is her choice. But it doesn\u2019t make her a \u201cvictim\u201d of reform.\n\nResistance to \u2018central planning\u2019\n\nThe paper\u2019s third source, Robert Kesceg, told the Star-Telegram that under Obamacare, his deductible had doubled \u2013 from $10,000 to $20,000. But, like Johnson and Lusk, he had never actually checked exchange prices. So I did it for him.\n\nIn his exchange, the deductible for a family ranges from $0 to $12,700 \u2013 the maximum allowed under the law. Under the ACA, a family\u2019s out-of-pocket spending, including co-pays and deductibles, is capped at $12,700 ($6,350 for individuals) \u2013 both inside and outside the exchange. This is true nationwide. There are no policies with $20,000 deductibles.\n\nA highly successful money-manager who Money Magazine named to its 1988 list of All-Pro Stocker Brokers,\u201d the 61-year-old Kesceg should have had no problem finding a better deal on the exchange \u2013 if he wanted to. But it turns out Kesceg is an active member of the Lone Star Tea Party.\n\n\n\nIn a telephone conversation, Kesceg told me that he views Obamacare as \u201ccentral planning\u201d by the government. \u201cI am going to make my own decisions,\u201d he declared, \u201cand choose what insurance I want. No one is going to tell me what to do.\u201d\n\nKesceg also made it clear that he is strongly opposed to both Social Security and Medicare. He confided that when his own father was on Medicare, he was distressed to see him \u201cwasting taxpayer dollars as he went from doctor to doctor.\u201d\n\nUnfinished search\n\nUnlike the first three, the newspaper\u2019s fourth source, Wayne Hoelscher, actually tried to shop in his exchange and in doing so, he learned that he was eligible for a premium tax credit.\n\nIn his interview with the Star-Telegram, Hoelscher \u2013 who is in his early 60s \u2013 explained that he went to the federal HealthCare.gov site to try to establish an account, but ran into the infamous glitches. Ultimately, he called an 800 number for the exchange, and \u201cafter he provided personal information about himself and his wife, he was told that a packet would arrive in the mail in up to 14 days.\u201d So far, so good.\n\nBut, \u201cmore than two weeks later, he still hadn\u2019t received anything in the mail,\u201d the Star-Telegram reports. \u201cConcerned that his family would be without insurance\u201d on November 20, \u201che submitted an application for a policy outside the federal exchange.\u201d\n\nWithout further comment, the reporter adds, \u201cHe would have qualified for a $900 subsidy on the exchange.\u201d\n\nI was dumbfounded. Why would he walk away from $900? He had another four weeks to enroll. Why not call the 800 number again?\n\nGoogling Hoelscher\u2019s name, I found no evidence that he belongs to the Tea Party, or is opposed to Obamacare as a matter of principle. (His phone was disconnected, so I couldn\u2019t reach him.)\n\nMy best guess is that he was discouraged by everything he had read or heard in stories like the one that ran in the Fort Worth paper.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nHow did so many TeaParty sources wind up in the Star-Telegram piece? Why didn\u2019t anyone at this major daily newspaper check the facts? Why didn\u2019t the reporter check her sources\u2019 claims against numbers on HealthCare.gov? Why didn\u2019t her editor flag unbelievable claims: that under the ACA, a 26-year-old might have to pay $1,000 a month \u2013 or that a couple\u2019s deductible could rise to $20,000?\n\nAfter many calls, I reached the reporter who wrote the story, spoke with two editors at the daily and interviewed Johnson.
