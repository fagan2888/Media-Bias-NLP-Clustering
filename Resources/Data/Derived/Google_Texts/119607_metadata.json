He\u2019d helped his five older siblings pack their bags and move out of their home in Duluth.\n\nIt never occurred to him \u2014 or his parents \u2014 that Billy, a lanky sports fan who has an intellectual disability, would follow in their footsteps.\n\nBut this fall, the 20-year-old moved his collection of Minnesota Twins pennants and his stuffed Mickey Mouse into a dorm at Bethel University.\n\nBilly didn\u2019t cry when it was time to say goodbye, but his mother did.\n\n\u201cWhen you take a kid to college, it\u2019s always emotional, but when it\u2019s a kid you never dreamed would be here, it\u2019s doubly so,\u201d said Beth Hillman. \u201cWill he remember to shave regularly? He\u2019s not very verbal; will he ask for help? I\u2019m used to being in control. It\u2019s a huge letting go.\u201d\n\nHillman, who has cognitive impairment related to his premature birth, was one of a dozen students who marked a personal milestone \u2014 and broke a barrier in higher education in Minnesota. As they carried their boxes and suitcases into the residence hall and posed for photos in their Bethel shirts, they became the first class of students with intellectual disabilities at the Christian college in Arden Hills.\n\n\u201cI like college. I knew I would.\u201d Maggie Erickson, 24, of St. Paul and one of 12 students in Bethel University\u2019s inclusive learning program\n\nWhile there are several programs in private institutions and community colleges, Bethel is the only accredited four-year college in Minnesota to offer a residential program for students such as Billy. The 12 Bethel University Inclusive Learning and Development (BUILD) students will earn two-year certificates rather than four-year degrees. Other than that, their experience mirrors that of the students they share the campus with: They live in dorms, eat at dining halls, go to class, join clubs and hang out with friends.\n\nAnd it\u2019s expected that, like other Bethel students, they\u2019ll leave college prepared for better, more satisfying work, and with skills to take charge of their lives.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, they\u2019re calling the shots, not their parents,\u201d said Dawn Allen, the director of the BUILD program. \u201cEducation has been done to them in the past. This changes that.\u201d\n\nThe BUILD students choose their own area of specialty: business, the arts, education and human services or ministry. They talk about finding careers that connect with their talents.\n\n\u201cI want to work in an office. Data entry,\u201d said Maggie Erickson, 24, of St. Paul. \u201cI can type anything.\u201d\n\nPart of the community\n\nErickson spent the summer counting the days till move-in on her Facebook page. After arriving on campus, she developed a reputation for friendliness and flash; on a recent day she greeted many of the students she passed as she strolled across campus, clad in cowboy boots and jeans clasped with a rhinestone belt, a zebra-print backpack slung over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI like college,\u201d she said, her retainer flashing as she grinned. \u201cI knew I would.\u201d\n\nShe also likes her new roommate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a lot alike. We both like shopping, we both like Taylor Swift and we both have boyfriends,\u201d she explained.\n\nErickson and her roommate, who both have Down syndrome, live in a six-person suite in Lissner Hall, Bethel\u2019s newest dormitory. Two of their suitemates are fellow BUILD students and the other two are \u201chousing mentors\u201d \u2014 upper-class Bethel students who are in a paid supervisory role similar to that of an RA.\n\nOnly a dozen of the 288 students in their dorm are in the BUILD program, which is by design.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re part of the larger community and they\u2019re building natural friendships,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming part of a group of friends who do things together.\u201d\n\nSuch integration is nothing new for today\u2019s students, who came of age in a more progressive era for people with intellectual disabilities. But until recently, that integration often hasn\u2019t included college.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed starting with early intervention, then mainstream classrooms and activities from Day 1,\u201d said Catherine Erickson, Maggie\u2019s mother. \u201cSchool lasts till they\u2019re 21, but then it kind of fizzles. They get functional skills, but there\u2019s been no lifelong learning, which is important for everyone. That\u2019s why this is a godsend.\u201d\n\nAs the school year begins, BUILD students are taking classes designed for their learning needs, but starting next semester they will also audit courses available to all Bethel students. They\u2019ll also start internships that begin on campus this semester, but move off campus next year.\n\nBethel University Inclusive Learning and Development (BUILD) student Sam Kohs, 22, of Forest Lake played with a yo-yo he had just received in the mail from his father.\n\nRoommates Billy Hillman and Sam Kohs are both interning with Bethel\u2019s hockey team.\n\n\u201cI love the sports and the outdoors,\u201d said Kohs, 22, of Forest Lake. \u201cI think I could work in a sporting goods store that sells fishing and camping stuff.\u201d\n\nA building movement\n\nThe idea for the BUILD program came from Julie White, a 1976 Bethel alumna and member of the university\u2019s board of trustees. White wanted her daughter Emily, who has Down syndrome, to have the college experience. White searched the country for residential programs before finding one at National Louis University in Skokie, Ill. Emily, now 29, finished college, works in a bridal salon and lives on her own.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important job that she earned,\u201d said White. \u201cSomeone other than the family has seen her gifts. That\u2019s the real magic.\u201d\n\nWhite approached Bethel\u2019s leadership team and fellow board members to urge them to open their doors to intellectually disabled students.\n\n\u201cEveryone embraced it quickly because it felt aligned with Bethel\u2019s mission,\u201d said White.\n\nOn move-in day, White met with parents to give them a pep talk.\n\n\u201cI was where you are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re between pure joy and pure terror, right? You\u2019ve poured so much of your time, energy and prayers into your student. They all got an extra dose of parenting. We\u2019ve been their advocates, but independence is all about self-advocacy. This is where they\u2019ll learn that.\u201d\n\nSeated in the audience was Jordan Kohs, a sophomore at St. Catherine University in St. Paul and the sister of Sam Kohs.\n\n\u201cI want my brother to have the same opportunities and experiences that I\u2019m having,\u201d she said, \u201cto move away from home, make friends and find his passion, to live his own life.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade, there has been growing momentum on a national scale to make higher education more inclusive for students with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Department of Education began funding demonstration projects at 244 colleges nationwide that developed postsecondary programs.\n\nA Boston-based coordinating center is tracking the effort. Meg Grigal is co-director of Think College, the organization charged with developing and expanding higher-ed options.\n\n\u201cWe have a history of lowballing our expectations for these young people,\u201d said Grigal. \u201cWe want to put them on the path to finding meaningful work and change the cycle of dependency. It will be better for them and better for the economy.\u201d\n\nA college certificate demonstrates that a student has commitment and follow-through, she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll leave college with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and credentials that will be recognized by employers and show they\u2019re ready to work,\u201d she said. \u201cMore of them will get out of low-wage sheltered workshops and be prepared for competitive employment. They\u2019ll be ready for an integrated workplace, working with people without disabilities.\u201d\n\nFreedom and responsibility\n\nWhen the BUILD students arrived on campus, they got iPads for homework, scheduling classes and extracurricular activities. The iPads also have twice-daily basic checklists to remind them about personal care. (A morning to-do list may include dressing, showering, tooth brushing and applying deodorant.)\n\nThe students haven\u2019t been allowed to spend a night away from campus yet, a practice designed to help them \u2014 and their families \u2014 settle into their new living situation.\n\nThat\u2019s been a challenge, and not just for the students. Some parents have contacted director Allen, worried about everything from cellphone use to sleep patterns.\n\n\u201cI think my mom misses me more than I miss her,\u201d Erickson said.\n\nKohs admitted he\u2019d been \u201ca little homesick. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I wish I was home,\u201d he said. \u201cI FaceTime my parents when I miss them.\u201d\n\nBut technology only goes so far; several families visited the campus, some even brought the family dog so the student could have a cuddle.\n\nThe students\u2019 ability to take care of themselves was a factor in the complex admission process Bethel devised.\n\nThere were no test scores or essays, although the students were required to have a high school diploma or an equivalent. Instead, the application focused on an extensive questionnaire, letters of recommendation and in-person interviews.\n\nSix weeks into the semester, Allen said the students are embracing their new autonomy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing what happens when students are given an opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is life-changing stuff.\u201d\n\nShe has noticed students taking on tasks their parents had managed. For example, one parent planned to take her daughter to the doctor for a flu shot. Allen had the student schedule her own shot with the nurse on campus instead.\n\n\u201cWe also see them needing fewer prompts with their responsibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of our students at first needed to be reminded to move his laundry from the washer to the dryer. Now he\u2019s doing it. That\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the BUILD students are no different from any new arrival on campus, said Allen. They all have to adjust to the freedom \u2014and the responsibility \u2014 that comes with leaving home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still learning my way around, but I\u2019m less nervous about getting lost now,\u201d Kohs said. \u201cI\u2019m having a fun college experience.\u201d\n\nKevyn Burger is a Minneapolis-based freelance writer and newscaster at \u00adBringMeTheNews.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Students with intellectual disabilities are attending college \u2013 and living in the dorms \u2013 in the first program of its kind in Minnesota.", "title": "Minnesotans with intellectual disabilities are new kids on campus", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-with-intellectual-disabilities-are-new-kids-on-campus/330411671/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144380101026185.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144380101026185.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Students with intellectual disabilities are attending college \u2013 and living in the dorms \u2013 in the first program of its kind in Minnesota.", "title": "Minnesotans with intellectual disabilities are new kids on campus", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-with-intellectual-disabilities-are-new-kids-on-campus/330411671/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144380101026185.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144380101026185.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Students with intellectual disabilities are attending college \u2013 and living in the dorms \u2013 in the first program of its kind in Minnesota."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22a7\"", "article_summary": "Gallery: BUILD students Maggie Erickson left and Abigail Cushing attended worship service with other college students at Bethel University.\nThis changes that.\u201dThe BUILD students choose their own area of specialty: business, the arts, education and human services or ministry.\nBut this fall, the 20-year-old moved his collection of Minnesota Twins pennants and his stuffed Mickey Mouse into a dorm at Bethel University.\nThat\u2019s progress.\u201dIn many ways, the BUILD students are no different from any new arrival on campus, said Allen.\nThe 12 Bethel University Inclusive Learning and Development (BUILD) students will earn two-year certificates rather than four-year degrees."}
