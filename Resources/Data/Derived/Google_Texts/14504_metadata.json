Two nurseries are challenging the award for the Southwest Region of Florida, and a third is challenging the award in the northeast region.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health initially wanted to award licenses to grow low-THC medical marijuana with a lottery.\n\nA judge decided a random award didn\u2019t meet the law\u2019s requirement, so the Florida Department of Health created a rule-making group to decide how the state will judge applications.\n\nOut of the five licenses granted by the state last month, four of them were awarded to nurseries that had owners on that committee. That made TropiFlora call foul in a lawsuit filed this week (download the lawsuit here). And they argue that all the awards should be invalidated by a judge.\n\nMore lawsuits are possible. Check here for a primer on all forms of medical marijuana in Florida.\n\n-- Reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
