The boy, with blond hair and dark brown eyes, is now being treated in a hospital for infection in his lungs.\n\nPattaramon said she met the Australian couple once when the babies were born and knew only that they lived in Western Australia state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt angry at them or hated them. I\u2019m always willing to forgive them,\u201d Pattaramon told The Associated Press. \u201cI want to see that they love the baby girl as much as my family loves Gammy. I want her to be well taken care of.\u201d\n\nPattaramon was promised 300,000 baht ($9,300) by a surrogacy agency in Bangkok, Thailand\u2019s capital, to be a surrogate for the Australian couple, but she has not been fully paid since the children were born last December.\n\nShe said the agency knew about Gammy\u2019s condition four to five months after she became pregnant but did not tell her. It wasn\u2019t until the seventh month of her pregnancy when the doctors and the agency told her that one of the twin babies had Down syndrome and suggested that she have an abortion just for him.\n\nPattaramon recalled strongly rejecting the idea, believing that having the abortion would be sinful. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Are you still humans?\u2019 I really wanted to know,\u201d she said Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thai surrogate mom not upset with Australia couple", "title": "Thai surrogate mom not upset with Australia couple", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thai surrogate mom not upset with Australia couple", "title": "Thai surrogate mom not upset with Australia couple", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/thai_surrogate_mom_not_upset_with_australia_couple/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/thailand-australia-surrogacy.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thai surrogate mom not upset with Australia couple", "title": "Thai surrogate mom not upset with Australia couple", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/thailand-australia-surrogacy.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Papitchaya Boonngok and Thanyarat Doksone", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Pattaramon said she met the Australian couple once when the babies were born and knew only that they lived in Western Australia state.\nThe boy, with blond hair and dark brown eyes, is now being treated in a hospital for infection in his lungs.\nShe said the agency knew about Gammy\u2019s condition four to five months after she became pregnant but did not tell her.\nPattaramon Chanbua, a 21-year-old food vendor in Thailand\u2019s seaside town of Sri Racha, has had to take a break from her job to take care of her 7-month-old surrogate baby, named \u201cGammy,\u201d who also has a congenital heart condition.\n\u201cI want to see that they love the baby girl as much as my family loves Gammy."}
