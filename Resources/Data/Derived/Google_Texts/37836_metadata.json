King and Jessica H. Janicek.\n\nOriginal item posted at 12:12 p.m.: John Peter Smith hospital announced Sunday that they will follow a court order and discontinue life support for pregnant, brain-dead Marlise Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nOn Friday, state District Judge R.H. Wallace sided with Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s family. Her family argued that she was improperly kept on life support against the will of her husband. The judge gave the hospital until Monday at 5 p.m. to decide whether it would appeal.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday, the hospital said they won\u2019t appeal the judge\u2019s ruling:\n\n\u201cThe past eight weeks have been difficult for the Munoz family, the caregivers and the entire Tarrant County community, which found itself involved in a sad situation,\u201d the statement says. \u201cJPS Health Network has followed what we believed were the demands of a state statute. From the onset, JPS has said its role was not to make nor contest law but to follow it. On Friday, a state district judge ordered the removal of life-sustaining treatment from Marlise Munoz. The hospital will follow the court order.\u201d\n\nThe statement does not say when the Fort Worth hospital will remove life support. A hospital spokeswoman, J.R. Labbe, declined to comment and referred further questions to the woman\u2019s husband, Erick Mu\u00f1oz, or the family\u2019s attorneys.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nIf ruling doesn\u2019t end Mu\u00f1oz case, fetal viability could be relevant\n\nJudge grants Tarrant man\u2019s request to take pregnant wife off life support\n\nOn abortion: Reproductive freedom trumps human life; In the beginning was the mother", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAxL2pwcy1ob3NwaXRhbC1zYXlzLXRoZXktd2lsbC1mb2xsb3ctY291cnQtb3JkZXItaW4tbXVub3otY2FzZS1kaXNjb250aW51ZS1saWZlLXN1cHBvcnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Melissa Repko", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 12:54 p.m.: Attorneys for the\u00a0Mu\u00f1oz family said in a statement that Marlise\u00a0Mu\u00f1oz was withdrawn from life support about 11:30 a.m. Sunday. \"The Munoz and Machado\u00a0families will now proceed\u2026", "title": "Update: Fort Worth hospital has discontinued life support for pregnant, brain-dead woman", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/01/jps-hospital-says-they-will-follow-court-order-in-munoz-case-discontinue-life-support.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-01-26T17:42:54Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd627\"", "article_summary": "The hospital will follow the court order.\u201dThe statement does not say when the Fort Worth hospital will remove life support.\nUpdate at 12:54 p.m.: Attorneys for the Mu\u00f1oz family said in a statement that Marlise Mu\u00f1oz was withdrawn from life support about 11:30 a.m. Sunday.\nOriginal item posted at 12:12 p.m.: John Peter Smith hospital announced Sunday that they will follow a court order and discontinue life support for pregnant, brain-dead Marlise Mu\u00f1oz.\nHer family argued that she was improperly kept on life support against the will of her husband.\nOn Friday, a state district judge ordered the removal of life-sustaining treatment from Marlise Munoz."}
