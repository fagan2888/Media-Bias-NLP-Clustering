PAUL \u2014 Semyon Varlamov will be in net for the Avalanche Saturday night against the Minnesota Wild at the Xcel Energy Center, and Colorado will go with the same lineup as in the Thursday win at Madison Square Garden. That means the healthy scratches will be winger Andreas Martinsen and defenseman Zach Redmond.\n\nAfter the morning skate, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy noted that Varlamov \u201cplayed really well last game in New York, and he had some good games here as well.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche hadn\u2019t practiced Friday. The morning skate at the arena took place amid jammed conditions in the area because of an ice fishing show at the adjacent RiverCentre convention center.\n\nThe Wild (13-7-4) and Avalanche (11-14-1) are playing back-to-back games, with the second on Monday night at the Pepsi Center. They are not riding trains together between games, but it has a barn-and-barn feel.\n\n\u201cWhat I like is that it\u2019s an opportunity to get closer to them in the standings,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019re good games and I think it\u2019s healthy for hockey. It builds up and I think teams enjoy those games.\u201d\n\nColorado also is playing five of its next six against Central Division opponents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a make-or-break, but this is an important moment in our season,\u201d said Roy. \u201cThere are different times in the season where you really want to win some hockey games and I think this one\u2019s going to be an important one for us.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: frei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov will be in net in Avs\u2019 first of back-to-back games against Wild", "title": "Semyon Varlamov will be in net in Avs\u2019 first of back-to-back games against Wild", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/semyon-varlamov-will-be-in-net-in-avs-first-of-back-to-back-games-against-wild/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__843c11b165c38a36890f6a706700123dp1-1.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__843c11b165c38a36890f6a706700123dp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T12:14:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:10:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Wild (13-7-4) and Avalanche (11-14-1) are playing back-to-back games, with the second on Monday night at the Pepsi Center.\nAfter the morning skate, Avalanche coach Patrick Roy noted that Varlamov \u201cplayed really well last game in New York, and he had some good games here as well.\u201dThe Avalanche hadn\u2019t practiced Friday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a make-or-break, but this is an important moment in our season,\u201d said Roy.\n\u201cAt the same time, they\u2019re good games and I think it\u2019s healthy for hockey.\n\u201cWhat I like is that it\u2019s an opportunity to get closer to them in the standings,\u201d Roy said."}
