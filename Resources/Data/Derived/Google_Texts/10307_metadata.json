The D.C. skyline, once dominated by monuments, is now dotted with cranes building some $5.5 billion in new development. Census figures show that four of the five wealthiest counties in the country are in Washington suburbs.\n\nRelated: Lobbyists Take a Financial Hit With Do-Nothing Congress\n\n\n\nBig-name former lawmakers, including Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Democratic Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and senators John Breaux (D-LA) and Don Nickles (R-OK), made millions after spinning through the revolving doors between Congress and lobbying and policy law firms.\n\nThe actual size of the industry is, however, a cause of disagreement. On the face of it, the lobbying business grew rapidly over the past decade \u2013 with overall spending hitting a record $3.55 billion in 2010 \u2013 before tapering off to $2.38 billion annually during the past three years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan watchdog. With the economy in the grips of the recession and partisan gridlock sorely limiting passage of legislation on Capitol Hill, the number of registered lobbyists shrank from 12,966 to 11,935 in that period.\n\nOr so it seemed.\n\nOn paper, the influence-peddling business was drying up, wrote The Nation\u2019s Lee Fang \u2013 yet lobbying money has been flooding Washington like never before.\n\nLobbying isn\u2019t dying, according to Fang; it\u2019s simply going underground. He quotes prominent experts to make that case.\n\nThe problem, according to American University professor James Thurber who has studied congressional lobbying for more than 30 years, is that \u201cmost of what is going on in Washington is not covered\u201d by the lobbyist-registration system. There are so many loopholes \u2013 and the law is so weakly enforced \u2013 that former lawmakers, their staffs and other government professionals have scores of ways to influence the work of Congress and the administration without formally registering as lobbyists or disclosing their spending activities.\n\nRelated: Energy Lobby Fired Up About 2014 Elections\n\nThurber, who is currently advising the American Bar Association\u2019s lobbying-reform task force, estimates that the industry brings in more than $9 billion a year \u2013 or nearly three times as much as official reports, and that the true number of working lobbyists is closer to 100,000 than the roughly 12,000 reported.\n\n\u201cA loophole-ridden law, poor enforcement, the development of increasingly sophisticated strategies that enlist third-party validators and create faux-grassroots campaigns, along with an Obama administration executive order that gave many in the profession a disincentive to register \u2013 all of these forces have combined to produce a near-total collapse of the system that was designed to keep tabs on federal lobbying,\u201d Fang says in The Nation.\n\nOther experts, including assistant professor Timothy M. LaPiera of James Madison University and Lee Drutman, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation, say that at least twice as much money is being spent on lobbying as is officially reported \u2013 but they view Thurber\u2019s estimate of more than $9 billion as inflated. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is outlandish, but it is informed speculation,\u201d LaPiera said Monday. He estimates that \u201cthe industry itself is twice the size of what is publicly reported.\u201d\n\nRelated: Big Oil Sits Out Lobbying on Iran As Congress Stands Firm\n\nA highly regarded American political scholar, Thurber cautioned that the reporting on his estimates should be taken skeptically. That\u2019s because he used such a broad, all-encompassing definition of lobbying that it could include virtually any law firm, lobby shop, contractor, think tank, political action group, advertising firm or other enterprise that in any way seeks to influence Congress or federal government regulators \u2013 from anywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cI kept saying that I was talking about the advocacy industry generally, with all its important activities, not lobbyists in the traditional definition of, you know, going up and talking to members of Congress and staff or people in the executive branch,\u201d Thurber said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m an outlier in terms of defining \u2026. If you\u2019re paid and trying to influence public policy, we should know about it. We should have transparency.\u201d\n\nA related issue, Thurber said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a huge advertising industry doing paid advertising \u2013 print, electronic, social media. We\u2019ve got earned-media activities. We\u2019ve got issue think tanks, and I don\u2019t mean Brookings. I mean places like Cato and Heritage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got law firms with a lot of people who are not registering,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t meet the standards of the Lobbying Disclosure Act definition. We\u2019ve got people that are running big coalitions that are not registered . . . and we\u2019ve got support staff for all those activities. We\u2019ve got survey research people that between candidate campaigns are doing issue campaigns. Most firms have that as another dimension of their life. Then we have the grass roots organizations that are permanent, in many cases, and do not need to register because they are not affiliated with a registered lobbying activity.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s not only the people here in Washington, but there are organizations on Madison Avenue, organizations out of Chicago, the AMA, organizations out of LA, that are trying to influence federal public policy not only on the Hill \u2013 that\u2019s what most people think about \u2013 but also in the executive branch. And I think people who are selling airplanes \u2013 Boeing Aircraft \u2013 to the Defense Department are trying to influence public policy with huge amounts of money.\u201d Then there is strategizing, he said, \u201cwhere senior staff or members of Congress can leave and become strategists, not lobbyists. But it\u2019s lobbying in my opinion.\u201d\n\nSo when the government and watchdog groups say there are only 12,500 or so registered federal lobbyists, Thurber said, \u201cYou\u2019re not at all getting close to the influence industry in Washington. When you add the support staff for all of it, it adds up to at least 100,000\u201d people.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Washington lobbying was a true growth industry in recent decades before it tapered off during the recession and amid partisan gridlock in Congress.
