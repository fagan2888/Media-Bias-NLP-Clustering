GUATEMALA CITY (AP) â€” A suspected Zetas leader in Guatemala who is wanted in the United States was arrested following a firefight in the eastern part of the Central American country, a senior official said Friday.

Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla said that Jairo Orellana Morales was captured in Zacapa province after a shootout with federal forces that killed a police officer and two others.

Lopez Bonilla said Orellana Morales was arrested Thursday along with seven of his accomplices.

After his arrest, Orellana Morales was flown to Guatemala City where he was shown to the press wearing only pants. His face was bruised.
