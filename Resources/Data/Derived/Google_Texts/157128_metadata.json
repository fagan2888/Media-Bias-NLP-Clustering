Even the occasional glances eastward seldom got beyond the Gallipoli campaign, and even these accounts stressed the role of Australian and New Zealander troops, not the Middle Eastern armies.\n\nNow comes an absolutely magnificent account of the war from the viewpoint of the Ottoman Empire, which sided with Germany during the conflict and suffered a crushing defeat that turned much of the Middle East into British and French colonial satraps. Eugene Rogan, a British scholar now teaching at Oxford, lived in the Middle East for years. Importantly, he had the linguistic ability to do research in Turkish and other archives seldom visited by Western historians.\n\nHis account is geopolitical and military writing at its best \u2014 taut, anecdotal and extraordinarily researched. A tangled story, to be sure, one that both commands and rewards the reader\u2019s attention.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was in dire straits at the turn of the century, torn by internal dissent and outside threats; indeed, it had become known as \u201cthe sick man of Europe.\u201d The primary fear was encroachment by Czarist Russia, which longed for access from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. For defense, the Turks scraped together enough money \u2014 including pocket change donated by schoolkids \u2014 to have a British shipyard construct two Dreadnaught-class battleships. When war erupted in 1914, the British simply confiscated the vessels from their slips and flagged them for the Royal Navy. Coupled with long-standing grievances, such was enough to cause the Turks to side with the Germans.\n\nBritain and other Entente nations considered war with the Ottomans as a sideshow to the main fighting on the continent. Predictably, the Ottomans lost three early, bloody battles on the fringes of their empire.\n\nThe Ottomans also made a serious miscalculation about the estimated 240 million Muslims living in colonies of the British and French (notably India, North Africa and Egypt). These persons shrugged off Ottoman calls (leavened with German propaganda) for a jihad against their colonial overlords. To be sure, there were a handful of defections, but Indian troops did much of the fighting in the theater.\n\nThings began to go desperately wrong for the Entente in the theater when Winston Churchill, First Lord of the British Admiralty, conceived of a scheme to seize Istanbul with a naval bombardment, thus foiling any attempt by the Germans to cut British sea links to India. Churchill\u2019s naval attack failed, whereupon the British ground commander, Gen. Horatio Herbert Kitchener, flooded the Gallipoli peninsula with scores of thousands of ground troops. He failed, and miserably so. The battle scenes described by Mr. Rogan \u2014 with mounds of bodies rotting unattended \u2014 are the most grisly 29 pages I have encountered in half a century of reading about warfare. (Contrary to conventional history, Mr. Rogan faults Kitchener, not Churchill, for the disaster.)\n\nYet worse was to come for the British. A sizable army was surrounded by Turks when trying to seize Rut, a town 100 miles below Baghdad in what is now Iraq. Rations were down to five ounces per person a day (less for Indian troops, who would not eat horse meat). Thirteen thousand British troops were captured, including five generals \u2014 \u201cthe British army\u2019s worst surrender ever,\u201d writes Mr. Rogan. \u201cTrees were dangling with corpses\u201d of native troops who had fought with the British.\n\nConcurrently, the Turks rid themselves of an ethnic population that they had long viewed with disdain: the Armenians. Racial hatred combined with wartime hysteria led the Turks to charge (falsely) the Armenians with siding with the Entente. A secret oral order was issued: \u201cExterminate all Armenian males 12 years of age or older.\u201d Areas were to be \u201crepopulated\u201d so as not to contain more than 10 percent Armenians. The displaced were marched off into the desert in what an American diplomat reported as \u201cthe most thoroughly organized and effective massacre this country has ever seen.\u201d The estimated death far exceeded a million.\n\n(A postwar Turkish tribunal \u2014 one torn by internal politics \u2014 passed death sentences on 18 persons for their role in the massacres; only three lower-ranked officials went to the gallows. Armenian exiles struck back with \u201cOperation Nemesis,\u201d the assassination of five of the convicted principals.)\n\nBut the Ottoman successes, spectacular as they might be, were offset by deep tribal and religious divisions. British intelligence operatives \u2014 with more promises than sincerity \u2014 persuaded the large Arabic population stretching from Arabia to Iraq to break with the Ottoman-German alliance in return for postwar independence under Hashemite rule. This sorry saga is well-known: Syria (and Lebanon), rather than becoming independent, were handed to the French. The stretch of territory then known as Palestine-Transjordan went to the British. The enclave of Palestine was to become divided into Jewish and Arab states. Egypt remained under British rule.\n\nSome of the blame must be assigned to President Woodrow Wilson, whose \u201cFourteen Points\u201d program for peace guaranteed self-determination for such states. The American president yielded on every point at the Versailles peace conference. Mr. Rogan concludes (and I must agree) that \u201coutlandish agreements were concluded solely to advance Britain\u2019s and France\u2019s imperial expansion.\u201d\n\nBut were these broken agreements the reason for the seemingly incessant turmoil in the Middle East? As Mr. Rogan makes plain, the region has been a cauldron of political and religious hatreds for centuries, and one could conclude that the outcome of the Great War simply extended an existing situation.\n\nThe war in the Middle East was no \u201csideshow,\u201d but a tragedy that was every bit as costly and bitter as the fighting on the Western Front.\n\n\u2022 Washington writer Joseph Goulden is the author of 18 nonfiction books.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For obvious reasons, most English-language books published on the Great War of 1914-1918 are Eurocentric, focused on the grinding trench warfare of the Western Front.
