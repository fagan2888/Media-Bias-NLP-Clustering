Liam Dwyer always knew that despite losing much of his left leg in combat he could win races if he got the chance.\n\nThat came Saturday when Dwyer teamed with Tom Long to win the IMSA Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge event at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cSaying I\u2019m excited is a major understatement,\u201d Dwyer told The Associated Press by phone shortly after the victory. \u201cI am ecstatic about this.\u201d\n\nDwyer drove the first 22 laps and was 25th in the 32-car field before turning the No. 27 Mazda MX-5 over to Long for the rest of the way. Long took the lead for good five laps from the end and went on to a nearly 20-second victory.\n\nDwyer served with the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was injured in Iraq in 2007 when he took shrapnel on the left side of his body while a turret gunner of a Humvee that was hit by a roadside bomb. Dwyer recovered and returned to civilian life when a major he had worked with asked him to join a special team headed to Afghanistan. Dwyer re-enlisted and was searching a compound in Sangin Province when he stepped on an explosive that sheared off his left leg above the knee.\n\nThe blast also damaged his right leg and right arm, to the point where Dwyer says he has little feeling in that hand.\n\nDwyer, like other military personnel with catastrophic injuries, called May 22, 2011, his \u201cAlive Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know exactly what it means to myself and my fellow service member,\u201d he said. Four other Marines were injured in that explosion.\n\nThe 32-year-old Dwyer returned home for rehabilitation. He was fitted with a prosthesis for the leg and soon after began to think about fulfilling his need for speed. He began racing vintage sports cars and was encouraged by friends and family members to market his skills to other circuits.\n\nDwyer reached the attention of Freedom Autosport and Long came to watch his test run at Mazda Laguna Seca Raceway this past January. Long was impressed with Dwyer\u2019s steadiness and savvy on the track and gave him a positive review.\n\nFreedom Autosport brought Dwyer into the fold and he\u2019ll run select rounds on the IMSA Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge series this year. His next scheduled event is Aug. 23 at Virginia International Raceway in Alton, Virginia.\n\nThe only thing Dwyer needs to race is a bracket and Velcro strip that allows him to keep contact with the clutch pedal. That, Dwyer says, allows Long or another driver to quickly take over when necessary.\n\nDwyer understands his backstory and military history are part of his appeal. He has no illusions, though, that he\u2019ll stay around long without top-notch driving skills. \u201cThere\u2019s always someone younger, faster, who\u2019s ready to move in,\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way racing goes.\u201d\n\nLong believes Dwyer has the makeup to excel.\n\n\u201cI was immediately impressed, not only with his attitude but his balance in the car,\u201d Long said. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious fit.\u201d\n\nDwyer grew up in Waterbury, Connecticut, about 40 miles from Lime Rock. And that his victory came on Memorial Day weekend with those who served front and center made it a perfect time.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how awesome this feels right now,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Marine Staff Sgt.
