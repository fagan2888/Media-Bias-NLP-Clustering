Ever since the U.S. Government first indicated on December 17, 2014 that North Korea was \u201ccentrally involved\u201d in the cyber-attack on Sony, I\u2019ve had this unshakeable feeling that there was more to it than met the eye. Even after the NSA recently renewed their accusations, claiming to have implanted software inside North Korea\u2019s internet in 2010 which allowed them to spy on the isolated nation\u2019s online activity, there are plenty of reasons to have doubt.\n\nMy doubts echoed those of leading cyber-security experts such as DEFCON organizer Marc Rogers, Wired Magazine security journalist Kim Zetter, Kurt Stammberger of cyber-security firm Norse, as well as ex-hacker and LulzSec founder, Sabu (his real name is Hector Xavier Monsegur). Kim Zetter called the government\u2019s evidence against North Korea \u201cflimsy.\u201d Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times called it \u201ccircumstantial.\u201d The government wouldn\u2019t tell us how they knew it was North Korea, only that they knew and that we should believe them.\n\nBesides the lack of convincing evidence from our government, there were technical reasons to have doubts about North Korea. Parts of the comments in the malware code were in Korean, but not specifically the North Korean dialect. The software used in the attack is called Wiper, not a particularly Korean-sounding name. There were IP addresses, server names, and passwords hard-coded into the software, suggesting that the hackers had extensive knowledge of Sony\u2019s network before the attack began, and giving rise to the \u201cinside job\u201d theory. Many experts also have doubts that a state-sponsored attack would have been staged under such a catchy moniker as the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d or \u201cGOP.\u201d On top of that, North Korea\u2019s internet connection via China is so slow, it could not have downloaded the 100 terabytes (that\u2019s about 30 million songs or 2.5 million music videos) of information stolen without anyone noticing, if at all.\n\nOn January 15, a new voice emerged among the dissenters. John McAfee, anti-virus pioneer and founder of anti-virus software company, McAfee Associates, told IBTimes UK a different story. He claims to be in contact with the hackers behind the attack, and he insists the U.S. government is \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can guarantee they are wrong. It has to do with a group of hackers \u2013 I will not name them \u2013 who are civil libertarians and who hate the confinement the restrictions the music industry and the movie industry has placed on art and so they are behind it.\u201d\n\nWell John, who is it then?\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to name them \u2013 that would make me a nark,\u2019 McAfee adds.\n\nLet us not forget, however, that McAfee is generally known to be somewhat off the deep end. He may have founded one of the world\u2019s leading anti-virus software companies, but he also claims to keep no less than 10 guns with him at any given time as he travels the world running from drug cartels, murder accusations, and the government of Belize. That being said, it\u2019s hard to dismiss the voice of someone who has had a unique relationship with the hacking community for three decades.\n\n\u201cI founded McAfee Associates and they [hackers] were my enemies for years as were all other hacking groups, but over the years I began to respect their values at least, I had talks with many of them on the phone. I know many people within Anonymous, I was the keynote speaker at Defcon in Las Vegas and got a standing ovation. I\u2019m not saying that their methods have my approval but I am saying is that the reason they do the things that they do is valid.\u201d\n\nSo now we have both sides claiming to know who did it, but nobody will tell us how. So close, yet so far away.\n\nRead Techvoice for interesting posts on technology, science and more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I have had my doubts from the very beginning.
