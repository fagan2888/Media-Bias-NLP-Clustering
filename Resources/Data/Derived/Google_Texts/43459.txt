Chances are, you’ve never heard of Brian Hull, but that doesn’t make his latest YouTube video any less incredible. In it, he covers the Academy Award winning song “Let It Go” from Disney’s Frozen by using the voices of 21 different classic Disney characters.

The video has gone viral, and at the time of writing this, had more than 800,000 views.

The performance is mind-blowing. He goes from Captain Barbossa and Jack Sparrow, both from Pirates of the Caribbean movies, to Scar from The Lion King, to Roz and Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc.

And it only gets better from there.

Hull isn’t tied down to the modern Disney classics, either. He brings characters back to life that haven’t been popular in the Disney movie franchise in decades, like the conniving snake, Kaa, from The Jungle Book and Sebastian, the singing Jamaican crab-friend of Ariel’s from The Little Mermaid.

Plus, Hull throws in fun asides — like Winnie the Pooh’s nervousness before his singing part — that are totally in line with the characters he’s voicing.

Hull does all 21 character voices — flawlessly — in a video only that’s only 3:42 long, with no cuts or edits! So relive your childhood with this modern-classic song made classic-classic with the voices you grew up with.
