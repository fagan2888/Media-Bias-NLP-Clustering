Wichita Police are investigating an alleged kidnapping.

A woman contacted 911 early Sunday morning to report that she had been kidnapped Thursday evening from a northeast Wichita parking lot. The woman tells police that a man approached her in parking lot of the Walmart and 29th St. N. and Rock Road. Armed with a knife, the man then forced her to drive to an unknown motel on S. Broadway.

Sgt. Ed Brower says that the woman reported the suspect then forced her to smoke meth for several hours. She was eventually released, but it's unclear how long she was held.

The suspect is described as hispanic, around 5'6" tall and weighing around 180 pounds. He has dark, buzz cut hair and was covered in tattoos.

Police are still investigating.
