They could be formally charged as early as Tuesday, Longmont Police Cmdr. Jeff Satur said Monday\n\nThe high bail \u201cclearly reflects the seriousness of the crime,\u201d Satur said.\n\nThe assault took place inside the apartment of the 34-year-old victim\u2019s ex-wife. She drove him to Longmont United Hospital for help after the confrontation in the 1300 block of Sumner Street. The victim had accused the two men of vandalizing his car.\n\nSatur says the three men knew each other before the alleged assault, and the two suspects were friends of the victim\u2019s ex-wife.\n\nBoth men have extensive arrest histories, including several arrests the past few weeks.\n\nHoffmeyer was arrested by Longmont police on July 19 on charges of first-degree assault with a deadly weapon, violation of a protection order, harassment and violation of bond conditions. He was free on bond at the time after a June 29 arrest in which he was charged with domestic violence in Longmont. Hoffmeyer has Oct. 6 court dates in both cases.\n\nOn Aug. 12 Kramer was arrested by Johnstown police on a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance. Released on $5,000 bond, he failed to show up for his first court appearance on Aug. 19, court records show. The courts imposed a protection order as a condition of his release, but public records do not indicate the circumstances or name who was be protected.\n\nKramer also was arrested by Longmont police on May 27 on a misdemeanor assault charge and pleaded guilty on June 9. He has an Oct. 7 sentencing date, according to court records. He also was sentenced to 180 days in jail in 2011 on controlled substance charges in Erie.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Longmont men held on $500,000 bond in assault and stabbing Friday", "title": "Longmont men held on $500,000 bond in assault and stabbing Friday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/01/longmont-men-held-on-500000-bond-in-assault-and-stabbing-friday/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01T16:51:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-01T16:51:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2172\"", "article_summary": "Bail has been set at $500,000 each for the two Longmont men accused in a Friday night beating and stabbing in Longmont.\nReleased on $5,000 bond, he failed to show up for his first court appearance on Aug. 19, court records show.\nHe has an Oct. 7 sentencing date, according to court records.\nKramer also was arrested by Longmont police on May 27 on a misdemeanor assault charge and pleaded guilty on June 9.\nJames Michael Kramer and Bradley Keith Hofmeyer, both 30, are being held in the investigation of second-degree attempted murder and first-degree assault."}
