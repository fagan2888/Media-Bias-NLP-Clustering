They argue the moves have violated the Constitution by usurping the Congress' power to create laws. Most vehemently, Republicans object to Obama's executive actions providing deportation relief to undocumented immigrants. Trump would undo those with an executive order as well.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, GOP nominee Mitt Romney said he, too, would use executive orders, noting he would grant all 50 states Obamacare waivers because \"an outright repeal would take time.\"\n\nLast week, Trump promised to issue an executive order requiring those who kill police officers to get the death penalty -- a legally dubious move. Two days later, at a rally in Aiken, South Carolina, the businessman blasted the president for issuing executive orders and not working with Congress.\n\n\"Usually you had to get Congress, you had to talk the senators into it, you had to talk your congressman into it, you had to deal with all the people,\" he said, according to The Washington Post. \"You have your three branches, and you talk to them, and you get something passed -- and there's compromise, and sometimes we don't like to compromise.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I walk in, sign, I don\u2019t have to go through Congress.\"", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-12-17 16:39:43 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "\"I walk in, sign, I don\u2019t have to go through Congress.\"", "title": "Trump Repeats Vows To Revoke Obama's Executive Orders", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-executive-orders_us_5671c88ee4b0688701dbfb29", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5671d3821f0000dd00e9bfb1.jpeg?cache=4z44oultjk", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I walk in, sign, I don\u2019t have to go through Congress.\"", "creator": "@igorbobic", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5671d3821f0000dd00e9bfb1.jpeg?cache=4z44oultjk", "height": 1000}, "title": "Trump Repeats Vows To Revoke Obama's Executive Orders", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-16 16:39:43 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5671c88ee4b0688701dbfb29", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Donald Trump,donald trump 2016,2016 election,Obamacare,Barack Obama    ,Mitt Romney,Elections 2016", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Donald Trump,donald trump 2016,2016 election,Obamacare,Barack Obama    ,Mitt Romney,Elections 2016", "published_time": "2015-12-16 16:39:43 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-12-16 16:39:43 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/igor.bobic"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump said Wednesday he would undo President Barack Obama's executive orders on his first day in office.\n\"The good thing about an executive order -- I walk in, sign, I don\u2019t have to go through Congress,\" Trump said at a large rally in Mesa, Arizona.\nLast week, Trump promised to issue an executive order requiring those who kill police officers to get the death penalty -- a legally dubious move.\nTrump would undo those with an executive order as well.\nTwo days later, at a rally in Aiken, South Carolina, the businessman blasted the president for issuing executive orders and not working with Congress."}
