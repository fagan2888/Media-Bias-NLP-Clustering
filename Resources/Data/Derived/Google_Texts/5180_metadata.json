Exports to Russia are in the range of 11% to 20% of all exports from the Baltic countries. The bank forecasts around 3% growth in both Latvia and Lithuania this year, and somewhat lower in Estonia.\n\nThe biggest risk to the Baltic economies is their reliance on gas exports from Russia, Mr. Kazaks said.\n\n\u201cOverall, this is the major potential problem issue. If there is an escalation in the conflict and Russia starts to introduce supply interruptions for natural gas, it will of course affect the Baltic states,\u201d Mr. Kazaks said. Such a development would lead to a spike in energy costs, further devalue the Russian ruble and reduce exports to Russia, he said.\n\nEfforts are underway to cut the dependency, including construction of a new energy terminal in Lithuania and plans to link the Baltic states\u2019 supply to Poland.\n\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have recently adopted the euro and Lithuania is also on track toward adopting the common currency.\n\n\u201cThe euro, politically also given the Russian situation, is good for the Baltics,\u201d Mr. Kazaks said. Being in the euro zone has helped bring stability and reduced risk for the small open Baltic economies, but it won\u2019t solve all problems and measures to increase productivity and boost the education system are needed, he said.\n\nBut unlike Sweden, which has chosen to stay out of the euro zone, the Baltic countries really didn\u2019t have an option but to adopt the currency. \u201cFor us, it was a decision of whether to float [the currency] or join the euro, and given that we had never defaulted on the currency, that would have been a very risky endeavor,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Anna Molin at anna.molin@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Baltic states have so far been relatively unharmed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis but an increase in the conflict could lead to bigger problems, especially on the energy side, Swedbank says.", "title": "Baltic States Fear Fallout From Russia-Ukraine Crisis", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/11/baltic-states-fear-fallout-from-russia-ukraine-crisis/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Baltic States Fear Fallout From Russia-Ukraine Crisis", "description": "The Baltic states have so far been relatively unharmed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis but an increase in the conflict could lead to bigger problems, especially on the energy side, Swedbank says.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Anna Molin", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "The Baltic states have so far been relatively unharmed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis but an increase in the conflict could lead to bigger problems, especially on the energy side, Swedbank says.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-11T13:37:33-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/11/baltic-states-fear-fallout-from-russia-ukraine-crisis/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-771", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Baltic states have so far been relatively unharmed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis but an increase in the conflict could lead to bigger problems, especially on the energy side, Swedbank says.", "title": "Baltic States Fear Fallout From Russia-Ukraine Crisis", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/11/baltic-states-fear-fallout-from-russia-ukraine-crisis/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-771", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-11T13:37:59-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The biggest risk to the Baltic economies is their reliance on gas exports from Russia, Mr. Kazaks said.\nIf there is an escalation in the conflict and Russia starts to introduce supply interruptions for natural gas, it will of course affect the Baltic states,\u201d Mr. Kazaks said.\nRussia\u2019s slowdown is likely to drag growth in the Baltic countries down by 0.5-1 percentage points this year, Mr. Kazaks said.\nEfforts are underway to cut the dependency, including construction of a new energy terminal in Lithuania and plans to link the Baltic states\u2019 supply to Poland.\nExports to Russia are in the range of 11% to 20% of all exports from the Baltic countries."}
