Last year, she won an Emmy for the role, even though the character isn\u2019t exactly a role model:\n\nChristy (Anna Faris): \u201cMom, I\u2019ve watched you lick cocaine crumbs out of a shag carpet.\u201d\n\nBonnie (Allison Janney): \u201cIt\u2019s not a sin to be thrifty, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody ever comes up and says, \u2018I wish Bonnie was my mother,'\u201d Janney told Knighton. \u201cNot the greatest mom. Probably the anti-mom.\u201d\n\nBonnie can be crass and selfish. She struggles with her relationships and her sobriety.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very human,\u201d said Janney. \u201cShe\u2019s very flawed. She\u2019s very unapologetic.\u201d\n\nAnd very funny.\n\nChristy: \u201cWhile other mothers were cooking dinner, you were cooking meth.\u201d\n\nBonnie: \u201cOtherwise known as working.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom\u201d is a sitcom, after all, and Bonnie\u2019s anti-mom status is played for laughs.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no June Cleaver, let\u2019s just say that,\u201d Janney noted.\n\nMore than 50 years after \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d went off the air, June Cleaver is still held up as the iconic sitcom mom.\n\n\u201cThese kind of very chipper, very loving, never distracted, most of them didn\u2019t work outside the home, just these very cheerful, apron-wearing moms,\u201d said Mary McNamara, the Pultizer Prize-winning TV critic for the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThose were the moms from the \u201950s. So was it reflective of the times? No. Women\u2019s lives have always been incredibly diverse. Women have always worked. And the woman who was able to just sort of hang out in pearls and heels waiting for her husband to come home, that was a rarity in reality.\u201d\n\nBut reality wasn\u2019t really the goal back then. This was the same era that brought us \u201cMy Mother the Car.\u201d\n\nEventually, TV began to allow for more complicated family dynamics. \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d featured a blended family.\n\nOscar-winning actress Shirley Jones turned down \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d: \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to be the mom taking the roast out of the oven.\u201d\n\nInstead, Jones became the widowed, working mom on \u201cThe Partridge Family.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery other show had a little family staying home, raising their kids, going to school, coming home from school, doing their homework. And this was a whole new look at family. I thought it was something that should be seen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was not known as the perfect mother, \u2019cause I was a working mother and singing in the band and everything,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut every mother on television then was the perfect mother. All the series, a perfect family.\u201d\n\nIn the late \u201970s and \u201980s, TV moms were beginning to look more diverse \u2014 from divorced moms \u201cKate & Allie\u201d to working mom Clair Huxtable.\n\nKngihton asked, \u201cDo you think that there was a specific show or character that was a turning point in the way that moms were portrayed on TV?\u201d\n\nMcNamara said, \u201cWell, I think you would have to look at \u2018Roseanne.\u2019 That was a huge deal. She was angry. She was not beautiful. Her house was a mess. She didn\u2019t take any crap.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2018Roseanne\u2019 was a real revelation, because as we got to know her, there was wisdom there, and there was love there. And I think a lot of Americans really connected with her. Because that was more like their mom or their family or their house than what they had been seeing previously.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne\u201d laid the groundwork for some of today\u2019s characters, like Clare Dunphy on \u201cModern Family,\u201d and Frankie Heck on \u201cThe Middle\u201d \u2014 frazzled moms who make mistakes and are just trying to keep it all together.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Marge Simpson. She\u2019s been the glue holding the Simpson family together for 28 years.\n\nIn many ways, Marge is a throwback to the \u201960s. She vacuums in pearls!\n\nOf course, \u201cMad Men\u201d\u2018s Betty Draper lives in the 1960s, but she\u2019s certainly not like the TV moms of the era. Betty could be mean, petty and selfish (just like some REAL mothers).\n\n\u201cProbably the biggest change is that we\u2019re allowed to see more broken women on television,\u201d said McNamara. \u201cWe went through an era where we had a lot of anti-heroes, broken men. And we still felt very ambivalent about women in similar situations, because women still had to be likable.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much likable about \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d\u2018 power-hungry Cerci Lannister. \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d is an addict whose kids get taken away from her.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect women to be angry or violent or alcoholic, even though real women are often all of these things,\u201d said McNamara. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t mean that they are irredeemable people or characters.\u201d\n\nCharacters like \u201cEmpire\u201d\u2018s Cookie Lyon, and \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d\u2018s Skyler White. From the lesbian moms on \u201cThe Fosters,\u201d to reluctant mom Carrie Mathieson on \u201cHomeland,\u201d the moms on screen today reflect a much wider range of experiences.\n\nSure, you might not want some of these moms to watch YOUR kids, but you can watch them deal with their own in a way that\u2019s no longer so black-and-white.\n\n\u201cWomen must have felt really bad that they weren\u2019t June Cleaver,\u201d laughed Janney. \u201cLike, \u2018Oh my God, June, I don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Like, she must have made every mother feel terrible.\n\n\u201cI think I make moms feel great!\u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CBS) - On the sitcom \"Mom,\" Allison Janney plays Bonnie Plunkett, a recovering addict trying to reconnect with her daughter.
