But pols, and all of us, increasingly view the F-word as acceptable, a new poll finds. | Brian Jackson / Sun-Times file photo\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 I often use the F-word.\n\nNever on TV.\n\nJust muttered when I\u2019m around people.\n\nI love how those consonants work together \u2014 the forceful F, the kickass K. The combination is comforting. I find it absolutely therapeutic to use that word.\n\nI remember the very first time I said it. I was a clueless little kid, riding my Schwinn bike with the thick tires on the 5000 block of North Bernard Street, just about to go over the footbridge crossing the North Branch of the Chicago River.\n\nI was bike riding with Freddy Orelove, my pal. I lived on the second floor of a two-flat at 5300 N. Christiana Ave. He was around the corner in a two-flat on Kimball Avenue. We always hung out together.\n\nI called out \u201cF-U\u201d to Freddy. Though we were the same age, Freddy must have known more than I did. His astonished looked stayed with me. I thought I was saying something like: \u201cAren\u2019t we having a good time.\u201d Clearly, I was wrong. Freddy never explained.\n\nLater, I would learn the true meaning of the F-word. And while it wasn\u2019t what I thought I was saying to Freddy, the word had worked out just dandy.\n\nUsually, I wouldn\u2019t be so open about this. But WTF, the nation is changing, according to a poll released Friday.\n\nIn June 2004, when then-Vice President Dick Cheney told Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to \u201cF- yourself,\u201d it was big news.\n\nIn March 2010, an open microphone picked up Vice President Joe Biden telling President Barack Obama at the signing of his landmark Affordable Care Act, \u201cThis is a big F-ing deal.\u201d That, too, was news.\n\nI sensed there was more tolerance for the F-word when the headline on the front page of the April 7 New York Daily News, aimed at Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz after a Bronx visit, blared, \u201cTAKE THE F U TRAIN, TED!\u201d\n\nNow, there\u2019s data to show that indeed, the use of the F-word is up. That\u2019s according to a new poll about rudeness in this 2016 political season by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. NORC, at the University of Chicago, has been doing independent research since its founding in 1941.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,004 adults was conducted March 17-21 and claims a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Interviews were conducted online and through calls to cell phones and landlines.\n\nAmong the survey\u2019s findings is that this year\u2019s Republican presidential campaign is seen as \u201crude and disrespectful\u201d by 78 percent of those polled \u2014 with Democrats and Republicans finding something here on which they can agree. And, no, Donald Trump was not mentioned in the poll.\n\nOnly 41 percent had the same view about the Democratic campaign \u2014 and, on this, there was more of a split along partisan lines.\n\nThe survey asked about what behaviors are unacceptable. When asked about \u201cusing the F-word in conversation,\u201d 25 percent said it was acceptable.\n\nAnd we aren\u2019t talking just OK.\n\n\u201cA quarter of the public admits to daily use,\u201d the survey concluded, up from 15 percent in an AP/Ipsos poll conducted 10 years ago.\n\nMore men than women admit to using the word. Forty percent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 said it is acceptable to use the F-word in conversation, compared to just 9 percent of folks 60 years and older.\n\nMy childhood friend Freddy is now Fred P. Orelove, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, Special Education & Disability Policy, at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nWhen I called Freddy on Friday afternoon, he told me he had no recollection of that F.U. bike ride that has stayed with me all these years. But he said he wouldn\u2019t dispute my account.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The use of the F-word is up in politics and among us all, a new poll shows \u2014 but you probably already knew that.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "The use of the F-word is up in politics and among us all, a new poll shows \u2014 but you probably already knew that.", "title": "Sweet: Use of the F-word is up, poll shows \u2014 but you knew that", "url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sweet-use-of-the-f-word-is-up-poll-shows-but-you-knew-that/", "image": "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/eocheney-cst-051614_8_46320753.jpg?w=400&h=400&crop=1", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "description": "The use of the F-word is up in politics and among us all, a new poll shows \u2014 but you probably already knew that.", "title": "Sweet: Use of the F-word is up, poll shows \u2014 but you knew that", "url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sweet-use-of-the-f-word-is-up-poll-shows-but-you-knew-that/", "image": "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/eocheney-cst-051614_8_46320753.jpg?w=1024&h=630&crop=1", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Sweet: Use of the F-word is up, poll shows \u2014 but you knew thatWhen then-Vice President Dick Cheney told Sen.
