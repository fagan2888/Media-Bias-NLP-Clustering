Federal authorities haven’t publicly accused taxpayer supported Broward Health of submitting bogus claims to Medicare and Medicaid, but the health system still has racked up a $10.2 million tab for legal advice, the Florida Bulldog reports.

The Washington, D.C. law firm Arent Fox was hired after documents relating to Broward Health’s contracts were subpoenaed by the U.S. Department of Health. As the Bulldog reports, not much is known about the probe, other than it’s related to a whistleblower lawsuit filed against North Broward Hospital District over allegations of the federal False Claims Act.

As for the legal bills, a review of public records shows the firm was paid $420- to $550- per hour for attorneys, and Broward Health picked up other expenses, from plane tickets to taxis rides and a bag of M&Ms for attorneys, according to the Bulldog.
