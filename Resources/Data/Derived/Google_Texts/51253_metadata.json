Contracts for services -- as opposed to products -- made up 35 percent of the contracts and 65 percent of their total value.\n\n\n\nNumber and value of awards. Chart courtesy GovTribe\n\nIn addition to the October and September spending sprees, GovTribe reported a busy July driven by some pricey awards as well as a greater number of awards in general.\n\n\u201cNot a good year for govie wonks to take a mid-summer vacation,\u201d GovTribe noted.\n\n\n\nSeasonal awards. Chart courtesy GovTribe\n\nMarch was busier than usual because the Air Force awarded its $5.79 billion NETCENTS-2 indefinite-quantity contract for information technology services, more than three years after the procurement\u2019s first documents were posted.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services that same month spent more than $6 billion on vaccine contracts.\n\nThe Navy, Army and Air Force were the top spenders on public contracts in fiscal 2014, with HHS topping the list of nondefense spenders, in part due to Affordable Care Act buys.\n\n\n\nAwards by agency. Chart courtesy GovTribe\n\nA $4.57 billion sole-source contract to Bell-Boeing and a $3.64 billion sole-source award to Northrop Grumman helped the Navy top the list of spenders. The Army let a $7.2 billion contract for Global Intelligence Support Services, and the Air Force\u2019s chief driver was the NETCENTS-2 award.\n\nIn addition to vaccines, HHS spent $7 billion on Obamacare-related payment-service delivery models. The Department of Veterans Affairs spent $3.8 billion on large quantities of a chemotherapy drug, GovTribe said.\n\nThe company said its analysis was only as accurate as the public data it was based on, which includes data from FBO.gov, GAO.gov, USASpending.gov and the System for Award Management. Dollar amounts reflect the total value of the contracts that were completed and disclosed in fiscal 2014 and may be understated since award values were not available for all contracts.\n\n\u201cTotal obligated dollars this year likely will be closer to $400 billion, once all accounted,\u201d the analysis author Marc Vogtman said.\n\nFor more information on the analysis and for a run-down of which contractors the government buys from most and which are most successful in their protests, see the original from GovTribe, a small, Arlington, Va.-based company that aims to make federal contracting information more accessible, sometimes for free and sometimes for a price.\n\n(Image via Andy Dean Photography/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Rebecca Carroll", "description": "And those were just the contracts we know about.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "And those were just the contracts we know about.", "title": "How the Government Spent $103 Billion in Just 2 Months", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2014/10/how-government-spent-103-billion-just-2-months/97151/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/10/22/102214spendingNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nextgov", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/10/22/102214spendingNG/open-graph.jpg", "description": "And those were just the contracts we know about.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How the Government Spent $103 Billion in Just 2 Months"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-22T21:05:17Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/10/22/102214spendingNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "How the Government Spent $103 Billion in Just 2 Months", "keywords": "contracting, big data, govtribe", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/10/22/102214spendingNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "contracting,channel-nextgov->-cio-briefing,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "And those were just the contracts we know about."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c07\"", "article_summary": "Awards in these two months alone had a value of $103 billion, or 38 percent of all publicly disclosed fiscal 2014 contracts, the GovTribe analysis found.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services that same month spent more than $6 billion on vaccine contracts.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs spent $3.8 billion on large quantities of a chemotherapy drug, GovTribe said.\nIn addition to vaccines, HHS spent $7 billion on Obamacare-related payment-service delivery models.\nChart courtesy GovTribeA $4.57 billion sole-source contract to Bell-Boeing and a $3.64 billion sole-source award to Northrop Grumman helped the Navy top the list of spenders."}
