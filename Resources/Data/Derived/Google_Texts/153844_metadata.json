Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pledged to strong arm President Obama into adopting a host of Republican policy priorities, from repealing the Affordable Care Act to undoing environmental regulations, should Republicans take back the senate in November. In the process, the Kentucky senator appeared to undermine his pledge to avoid future government shutdowns.\n\nIn an interview with Politico published on Wednesday, McConnell laid out a plan of attaching policy riders to must-pass spending measures and forcing Obama into a standoff: sign off on the bill or close down the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pass spending bills, and they\u2019re going to have a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy,\u201d McConnell told the publication. Obama, McConnell added, \u201cneeds to be challenged, and the best way to do that is through the funding process. He would have to make a decision on a given bill, whether there\u2019s more in it that he likes than dislikes.\u201d\n\nBut the remarks appear to contradict a guarantee McConnell delivered in October, in the aftermath of the 16-day-government shutdown led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Throughout that period, McConnell blamed Democrats for shutting down the government by refusing to delay parts of Obamacare and urged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to find a workable compromise. But after the two parties came to a deal \u2014 that excluded any major changes to the health care law \u2014 McConnell appeared on CBS\u2019 Face The Nation and promised to keep the government open.\n\n\u201c[T]here will not be another government shutdown. You can count on that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a two-week paid vacation for federal employees is conservative policy. A number of us were saying back in July that this strategy could not and would not work, and of course it didn\u2019t,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nPolitico reports that Republicans have also \u201cdiscussed using the procedural tool known as budget \u201creconciliation\u201d to make it easier to pass legislation by avoiding filibusters,\u201d though McConnell himself would not commit to the controversial tactic.\n\nUnder the rule, the Senate can pass budget-related changes with a simple majority vote \u2014 eschewing the 60-vote threshold the body usually requires to advance and pass legislation. Throughout the health care reform debate of 2009 and 2010, Democrats relied on reconciliation to pass a series of changes to Obamacare and Republicans blasted the opposing party for skirting Senate rules to \u201cram through\u201d unpopular legislation. McConnell himself described Democrats as \u201carrogant\u201d for pursuing the tactic.\n\nSince winning back the House in 2011, Republicans have repeatedly tried to attach measures repealing Obamacare, demanding the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, or blocking funding for limiting carbon dioxide emissions to important spending bills. Some in the party have also floated using the reconciliation process to undermine the health care law. Speaking to Politico on his campaign bus, McConnell hinted that the he will ramp up use of these tactics should Republicans prevail in the 2014 elections. \u201cThat\u2019s something [Obama] won\u2019t like, but that will be done. I guarantee it,\u201d McConnell said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Is McConnell re-embracing the government shutdown?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Is McConnell re-embracing the government shutdown?", "title": "After Promising The End Of Government Shutdowns, Mitch McConnell Threatens Another Government Shutdown", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/08/20/3473646/mitch-mcconnell-threatens-another-government-shutdown/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mitch_McConnell_tpftd-e1378906047901.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is McConnell re-embracing the government shutdown?", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mitch_McConnell_tpftd-e1378906047901-321x214.jpg", "title": "After Promising The End Of Government Shutdowns, Mitch McConnell Threatens Another Government Shutdown", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mitch_McConnell_tpftd-e1378906047901.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mitch_McConnell_tpftd-e1378906047901.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-20T12:15:33+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Politics After Promising The End Of Government Shutdowns, Mitch McConnell Threatens Another Government Shutdown CREDIT: Alex Wong/Getty Images Sen.
