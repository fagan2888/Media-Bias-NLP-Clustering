The first report in the series was released January 19, and the second on January 26. All reports are available on the NCD website.\n\nIn the third and final installment in the series, the \"Monitoring and Enforcing\" report, NCD examines key legal safeguards in ACA implementation regulations that can help people with disabilities secure essential care and supports. The report also outlines legal duties; identifies the parties responsible for fulfilling those duties; and in some instances, explores potential avenues for redress where applicable.\n\n\"By identifying issues for monitoring by the disability community nationally and in individual states, our goal is to ensure that Americans with disabilities fully share in ACA's promised benefits while avoiding potential risks ACA poses, \"said Clyde Terry, NCD Chair. \"We saw a need to provide people with disabilities, their families, and advocates with a road map to identify areas or issues that warrant additional attention as ACA implementation goes forward.\"\n\nNCD appreciates the assistance of the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, who worked collaboratively with NCD in preparing this series of reports.\n\n\"Monitoring and Enforcing the Affordable Care Act for People with Disabilities\" and the other reports in the ACA series are all available on NCD's website.
