Citizen displeasure resulted in the hospital\u2019s agreeing try to work with Bon Secours St. Francis Health System and the Greenville County Council to seek a more inclusive, cost-effective arrangement.\n\nNow, just a few weeks later, GHS proposes another, even more extreme, scheme to change the way the hospital\u2019s Board of Directors (BOD) is appointed and approved. It\u2019s not only an audacious overreach, it\u2019s almost certainly illegal!\n\nUnder their plan, the Board purports to achieve \u201cindependence\u201d by eliminating the requirement for legislative approval of its members. If they succeed, the Board would become self-appointing and self-perpetuating. It would also become self-empowered to sell, lease or transfer hospital assets to any entity it chooses, without legislative oversight.\n\nAt present, South Carolina Act 432 provides \u201ccitizen\u201d oversight of the hospital system by requiring the Greenville County Legislative Delegation to vet and approve members of the GHS Board. That\u2019s because taxpayer dollars paid for all the physical assets of the hospital system.\n\nTherefore, the Board are de facto \u201ctrustees\u201d of those assets.\n\nAccording to one House Representative, \u201cAct 432 does not give the GHS Board authority to change its purpose or transfer any Board duty or asset. Furthermore, recent successful FTC actions against hospital consolidations in Chicago \u2013 GHS CEO Michael Riordan\u2019s former workplace \u2013 Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, provide ample evidence that the entire proposal is, indeed, against current state and federal law.\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s a deliberate end-run around the County\u2019s Legislative Delegation toward the goal of acquiring absolute authority over any decisions to sell, lease, or transfer hospital assets.\n\nIts aggressive implementation timeline will preclude the Legislature from intervening in the process.\n\nIn addition, GHS included several other, less-obvious, objectives in this proposal. First, it wants to create a healthcare monopoly within Greenville County by increasing its patient population nearly ten-fold. Next, it wants to continue to expand its presence beyond the geographical boundaries of the county \u2013 a proposal the voters rejected by a 4 to 1 margin in 1996!\n\nNevertheless, according to its administrators, \u201cthe hospital has to have a multi-regional presence\u201d to succeed. The hospital simply has \u201c\u2026 too many resources to limit its service area to Greenville County alone.\u201d Finally, \u201cif GHS does not \u2018transform itself,\u2019 another, even-larger, hospital network will \u2018transform it.\u2019 Translation: hospital executives and Board members will lose their jobs, and the hospital will lose its identity!\n\nApart from the legal challenges, there are several practical reasons why an \u201cindependent\u201d hospital board is not in the best interests of anyone seeking medical care in Greenville County.\n\nHere are just a few:\n\nOversight promotes accountability. Removing legislative oversight eliminates a major safeguard against cronyism and corruption. If the current system is changed, the hospital\u2019s board will no longer be accountable to the public. Instead, it will be free to disregard the public\u2019s interest and focus solely on the interests of the hospital and its leadership; e.g., the CEO\u2019s current compensation package that exceeds $1.3 million!\n\nNew members of the board will likely be sycophants of the current members, not independent, critical thinkers willing to challenge proposals from hospital management.\n\nConsolidation limits patient choices and treatment options. Ample evidence already exists that \u201cchoice\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d both suffer when healthcare is concentrated into a single, mega-provider. Obamacare and its emphasis on \u201cper population\u201d reimbursements will cause this trend to increase.\n\nHospital mergers increase patient costs. Look no further than data from the American Hospital Association. Since 2008, mergers increased patient costs by 30%!\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal does nothing for anyone except GHS\u2019 administrators and the hospital\u2019s Board. By removing legislative oversight, it will likely harm patients and result in taxpayer assets being liquidated without compensation.\n\nRon Tamaccio is retired and lives in Greenville with his wife, Patricia.\n\nWANNA SOUND OFF?
