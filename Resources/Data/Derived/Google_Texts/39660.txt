On Tuesday’s edition of the Chad Hasty Show on KFYO, Norma Ritz-Johnson of the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce and Mark Hobgood with FirstCare Health Plans spoke with Chad about their organization’s recent efforts in readjusting their award-winning and nationally recognized chamber-employer health care plans to meet Affordable Care Act (ACA) compliance requirements.

The original Chamber plan was developed in 2006 to assist employers in meeting the health care plan needs for employees in an affordable way. With the ACA coming into effect, the plans had to be adjusted to meet the new legislation’s requirements.

Ritz-Johnson and Hobgood provided on overview of their nine different health plans available to Lubbock Chamber of Commerce members, with deductibles ranging from zero up to $6,300, providing plenty of options for life, health and dental insurance.

Open enrollment runs from October 01 through November 14, 2014. For more information, contact the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce at 806-761-7000.
