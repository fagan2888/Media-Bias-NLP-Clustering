Anthem\u2019s expansion Monday to its patients enrolled in Eastern Maine Health System\u2019s Beacon Health in Bangor adds 40,000 Mainers to the company\u2019s \u201caccountable care organization\u201d payment reform system. Anthem\u2019s new reimbursement model is now available to 75 percent of primary care doctors in Maine.\n\nCorcoran and Stein said they expect similar payment reforms will sweep the country within the next few years.\n\nIn Colorado, where Anthem\u2019s system, called \u201cenhanced personal care,\u201d has been fully implemented for more than a year, avoidable emergency room admissions have declined 15 percent, and hospital readmissions have been reduced 18 percent for Anthem customers, insurance officials said.\n\n\u201cIt cuts down on the number of people going to the emergency room at 3 p.m. with an earache,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Holmstrom, Anthem\u2019s medical director in Maine.\n\nUnder the system, patients with chronic diseases \u2013 such as asthma, common heart conditions or diabetes \u2013 are assigned \u201ccare teams\u201d that include doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses and other medical professionals.\n\nDr. Phyllidia Ku-Ruth, a family physician at InterMed in Portland, said the Anthem changes align with what InterMed\u2019s network of primary care doctors has been working on for the past decade.\n\n\u201cSometimes when the patient is not in front of you, they need something. Now, we\u2019re delivering that to them,\u201d Ku-Ruth said. \u201cThat\u2019s the essence of what preventive, accountable care is.\u201d\n\nKu-Ruth said the problem has been that 10 years ago, insurance companies were not reimbursing for those services, which are often phone consultations with patients. InterMed built a database of patients with chronic conditions, and the \u201ccare team\u201d can check up on them to monitor their conditions and make sure they\u2019re taking medications and practicing preventive care.\n\n\u201cWe can look at the database registry and see, \u2018Oh, Mrs. Smith is a diabetic and she needs her eye exam, or Mr. Jones needs to have his feet checked,\u201d Ku-Ruth said. She said the registry is also helpful when patients are transitioning to home after a trip to the hospital, because many are confused about what to do and what medications to take. Making the transition to home easier helps reduce hospital readmissions, she said.\n\nHolmstrom said the system more efficiently uses the doctor\u2019s time by assigning physician assistants, nurses and others to preventive care while saving the more difficult cases for the doctor.\n\n\u201cIt allows the doctor to see sick people when they need to be seen,\u201d Holmstrom said. \u201cIt expands the capabilities of the doctor.\u201d\n\nBy reimbursing for outcomes instead of volume, the doctor\u2019s office can see patients for longer and not have to be concerned about meeting patient quotas to maintain the financial viability of the practice, Holmstrom said.\n\n\u201cIt gets us off the hamster-wheel system of care,\u201d he said.\n\nCorcoran said Anthem\u2019s payment reform was already in the works before the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, although the ACA encourages such reforms.\n\nStein said that although the ACA did not instigate many of the payment reforms, the law encourages such changes by prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions and charging sick people higher premiums.\n\nInstead of companies having a financial incentive to have only healthy people in their insurance pools \u2013 as was the case before passage of the ACA \u2013 they now have incentives to keep the patient population as healthy as possible, he said.\n\n\u201cIt changes the motives of the insurance companies. They have different goals,\u201d Stein said. \u201cThe ACA has accelerated payment reform and shined a spotlight on the problem.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated at 5:15 p.m., Nov. 11. to correct the state were the \u201cenhanced personal care,\u201d system has been fully implemented.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anthem expands to Bangor a payment system adopted by others that encourages preventive measures, team caregiving and efficiency.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Anthem expands to Bangor a payment system adopted by others that encourages preventive measures, team caregiving and efficiency.", "title": "Insurer reform on doctor reimbursements benefits patient care - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/anthem.jpg", "height": 534}, "updated_time": "2014-11-11T17:14:05-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/11/insurer-reform-on-doctor-reimbursements-benefits-patient-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anthem expands to Bangor a payment system adopted by others that encourages preventive measures, team caregiving and efficiency.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/anthem.jpg", "title": "Insurer reform on doctor reimbursements benefits patient care - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2014-11-11T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-11T17:14:05-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd364\"", "article_summary": "Anthem\u2019s new reimbursement model is now available to 75 percent of primary care doctors in Maine.\nInstead of reimbursing based on volume of patient visits and procedures, insurance companies are reimbursing more for patient outcomes, such as avoiding unnecessary emergency room trips.\nStein said that should result in lower costs for everyone \u2013 patients, doctors and insurance companies.\n\u201cIt changes the motives of the insurance companies.\nDr. Phyllidia Ku-Ruth, a family physician at InterMed in Portland, said the Anthem changes align with what InterMed\u2019s network of primary care doctors has been working on for the past decade."}
