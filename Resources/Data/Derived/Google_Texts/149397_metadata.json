It added one more, for a total of eight, when the new Boston Braves took the same name as the major league baseball team with whom they shared a stadium, Braves Field. Because baseball was far more popular than professional football in the 1930s, NFL owners were not bashful about laying claim to a bit of the brand loyalty already enjoyed by baseball franchises. Other teams in the league that year included: the New York Giants, who played in the Polo Grounds, home of the baseball Giants; the Brooklyn Dodgers, who shared Ebbets Field with their baseball counterpart; and the Chicago Bears, who played in Wrigley Field, where the Cubs played baseball and, after a fashion, still do.\n\nWhen, before the 1933 season, the football Braves relocated one mile east to Fenway Park, the owners changed the name to the Boston Redskins, encouraging Red Sox fans to make a connection to Fenway\u2019s more famous occupant while obviating changes to the logo and uniforms. According to some accounts, the name was also an attempt to wring a marketing advantage from the fact that the coach, Lone Star Dietz, was part Sioux, or at least claimed to be.\n\nThe franchise remained the Redskins after relocating to Washington, D.C., in 1937, but the future use of that name is doubtful. Denunciations of it as an insult to American Indians reached a point during the 2013 football season that an interviewer asked President Obama for his position on the controversy. He replied, cautiously, that an owner should \u201cthink about changing\u201d a team name if it \u201cwas offending a sizeable group of people.\u201d\n\nOf more importance to conservatives, columnist Charles Krauthammer also endorsed dropping \u201cRedskins\u201d\u2014not as a matter of \u201chigh principle,\u201d but in order to adapt to \u201ca change in linguistic nuance.\u201d \u201cSimple decency,\u201d he wrote, recommends discarding a term that has become an affront, even if it was used without a second thought or malicious intent 80 years ago. A few days before Krauthammer\u2019s column appeared, on NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d the highest-rated TV show throughout the football season, studio host Bob Costas called for Washington to pick a different team name. \u201c\u2018Redskins\u2019 can\u2019t possibly honor a heritage or a noble character trait,\u201d he said, \u201cnor can it possibly be considered a neutral term.\u201d Rather, it\u2019s \u201can insult\u201d and \u201ca slur.\u201d\n\nThe New Republic and Slate are among several journals that no longer use the name in their articles. Few football fans rely heavily on either publication, of course, but many of them read Gregg Easterbrook\u2019s Tuesday Morning Quarterback column on ESPN.com. By calling the team either the \u201cWashington R*dsk*ns\u201d or \u201cPotomac Drainage Basin Indigenous Persons,\u201d Easterbrook both observes and spoofs the growing de facto ban on \u201cRedskins.\u201d\n\nSadly, the republic faces challenges more dire than naming a sports team. This slight question, however, entails weightier ones about comity\u2014how a diverse nation coheres; discourse\u2014how Americans address one another; and power\u2014not only how we make decisions, but how we decide what needs to be decided, and who will do the deciding.\n\nThe Right Side of History Krauthammer, Costas, and many other \u201cRedskins\u201d critics contend that because sensibilities change, terminology must follow. That seems undeniable as an abstract proposition, but doesn\u2019t settle the question of whether calling a professional team the Redskins in 2014 is intolerable, either to Americans in general or American Indians in particular. \u201cIndian\u201d was itself a suspect word for many years, and was giving way to \u201cNative American\u201d around the time \u201cNegro\u201d was supplanted by \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfro-American,\u201d which was abandoned in favor of \u201cAfrican American.\u201d The tide receded, however. Of the 14 \u201cNational Tribal Organizations\u201d listed on the federal government\u2019s website, only two use \u201cNative American\u201d in their names, while 10\u2014including the most important, the National Congress of American Indians\u2014use some form of \u201cIndian.\u201d Apparently, a word can grow more offensive with the passage of time, but also less offensive with the passage of additional time.\n\nThat \u201cRedskins\u201d is an intolerable relic from the hate-filled past, though asserted often and strenuously, is not easily demonstrated. For one thing, the term\u2019s origins are neither inherently nor manifestly derogatory. Smithsonian Institution anthropologist Ives Goddard has traced its emergence to the 18th century, when French and English settlers and explorers, and later Americans, adapted it from Indians, who developed \u201cred men\u201d and \u201credskins\u201d to differentiate themselves from the Europeans who had come to North America.\n\nFor another, it\u2019s far from clear that a sizeable group of people is offended by the name. A 2004 Annenberg poll asked 768 self-identified American Indians, \u201cAs a Native American, do you find [\u201cWashington Redskins\u201d] offensive or doesn\u2019t it bother you?\u201d The results were 9% and 90%, respectively. More recently, an Associated Press poll in 2013 found that 11% of all Americans thought the team needed a different name, compared to 79% opposed to changing it. The demographic subsets of the polling sample yielded no data about American Indians\u2019 views, but did record that only 18% of \u201cnonwhite football fans\u201d favored getting rid of \u201cRedskins.\u201d\n\nCritics of the name who acknowledge the complexities about how it emerged in the past and is regarded in the present make a more cautious argument than those who declare the name tantamount to calling a team, say, the \u201cWashington Darkies.\u201d In announcing Slate\u2019s policy of refusing to use the official name of the D.C. football team, editor David Plotz described it as an embarrassing anachronism in an age when \u201cwe no longer talk about groups based on their physical traits.\u201d (Be that as it may, Slate still refers to Americans who trace their ancestry to Africa as \u201cblacks,\u201d and those descended from Europeans as \u201cwhites.\u201d) Thus, \u201cwhile the name Redskins is only a bit offensive, it\u2019s extremely tacky and dated\u2014like an old aunt who still talks about \u2018colored people\u2019 or limps her wrist to suggest someone\u2019s gay.\u201d (But, as Jonah Goldberg reminded us, this daft old woman could be a donor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.)\n\nSuch arguments, then, are based less on the location than the direction of the public\u2019s opinions and sensibilities. The New Yorker\u2019s Ian Crouch endorsed the views of one A.P. poll respondent: \u201cMuch farther down the road, we\u2019re going to look back on this and say, \u2018Are you serious? Did they really call them the Washington Redskins?\u2019 It\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d Stipulating the constant evolution of moral standards makes it possible to exonerate people who tolerated a problematic team name in the past. Bob Costas, for example, had given no indication that \u201cRedskins\u201d was an insult and a slur in his 39 years as a sports broadcaster up until 2013. Prior to former owner Jack Kent Cooke\u2019s death in 1997, guests who watched home games with him in the owner\u2019s box included Al Gore, George McGovern, Earl Warren, Tip O\u2019Neill, and Eugene McCarthy, none of whom was criticized for endorsing a racist pageant by their attendance. (The fact that standards evolve does not, however, compel such exonerations. People or categories of people liberals don\u2019t like, such as Christian fundamentalists or whites insufficiently committed to racial equality, are still condemned for failing to anticipate or embrace the emerging moral strictures.)\n\nThose who now want the Washington Redskins to be called something newer and nicer are, it follows, \u201con the right side of history,\u201d a polemic wielded with increasing frequency. Last year the National Journal offered a partial list of the many political positions President Obama has declared to be on the right side of history, including support for the Arab spring protestors, Obamacare, and immigration reform. Some of his admirers have urged Obama to stay on the right side of history by preventing construction of the Keystone oil pipeline. Others applauded him for finally getting on the right side of history when, in May 2012, he declared himself a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nThe \u201cright side of history\u201d is a recent addition to the lexicon, but the idea behind it is quite old. We, in the second decade of the 21st century, may say that the cause of the future has by now acquired a substantial legacy from a past stretching back to the late 19th century. Those who read the CRB and, in particular, the work of its editor Charles Kesler, are well aware that since Progressivism appeared on the American scene, its -ism has been that a better future beckons, but is not simply destined. To realize it we\u2019ll need visionary leaders who advocate and facilitate progress. They see clearly what most see dimly: how the future will be better than the present, and what we must do to progress from where we are to where we need to go.\n\nIn The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis identified the central contradiction of invoking tomorrow\u2019s standards to settle today\u2019s controversies. Screwtape, an upper-management devil sending advisory memoranda to an apprentice, counsels:\n\n[God] wants men, so far as I can see, to ask very simple questions; is it righteous? is it prudent? is it possible? Now if we can keep men asking, \u201cIs it in accordance with the general movement of our time? Is it progressive or reactionary? Is it the way that History is going?\u201d they will neglect the relevant questions. And the questions they do ask are, of course, unanswerable; for they do not know the future, and what the future will be depends very largely on just those choices which they now invoke the future to help them to make.\n\nAs journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty recently contended, \u201cthe most bullying argument in politics\u201d is to denounce people with whom you disagree for being on the wrong side of history. \u201cIf your cause is just and good, argue that it is just and good, not just inevitable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly insufferable that American liberals, otherwise boastful about their membership in the \u201creality-based community,\u201d are so facile about resorting to metaphysical mumbo-jumbo when appointing themselves oracles of the Zeitgeist. Upon inspection, \u201cX is on the right side of history\u201d turns out to be a lazy, hectoring way to declare, \u201cX is a good idea,\u201d by those evading any responsibility to prove it so. Similarly, many brandish another well-worn rhetorical club, as when a sportswriter charges that current Redskins owner Dan Snyder refuses to rename his team because he just doesn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d That huffy formulation conveniently blames someone else\u2019s refusal to see things your way on his cognitive or moral deficiencies, rather than on your forensic ones.\n\nBending Toward Justice Things do change, of course. history, society,\u2026life are all dynamic, not static. The quotidian work of politics, in particular, is more concerned with accommodating and channeling the transient than with realizing eternal Platonic forms. \u201cA majority,\u201d Abraham Lincoln said in his First Inaugural, \u201cheld in restraint by constitutional checks, and limitations, and always changing easily, with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the opinion polls showing a large majority untroubled by \u201cWashington Redskins,\u201d there clearly has been a deliberate change away from cartoonish, disrespectful references to Indians by sports teams. In 1986, the Atlanta Braves baseball team (formerly the Boston franchise, relocated by way of Milwaukee) got rid of \u201cChief Noc-a-Homa,\u201d a mascot who would emerge from a teepee beyond the left field fence to perform a \u201cwar dance\u201d after every Braves home run. Some major college athletic programs have renamed their teams: the Stanford Indians became the Cardinal; Marquette\u2019s Warriors are now the Golden Eagles; and the St. John\u2019s Redmen the Red Storm. The Redskins retain their team name and fight song, \u201cHail to the Redskins,\u201d but have changed the words. Fans no longer sing, \u201cScalp \u2019em, swamp \u2019em\u2014we will take \u2019em big score / Read \u2019em, weep \u2019em, touchdown!\u2014we want heap more!\u201d\n\nIt would be astonishing if anyone started a campaign to bring back Chief Noc-a-Homa, or to restore the Redskins fight song\u2019s original lyrics, much less for such an effort to succeed. History may close no questions, but some are exceedingly unlikely to be reopened. It\u2019s an unwarranted leap, however, from these developments to the judgment by Marc Tracy, a New Republic writer, that polls showing only a small portion of the population shares his outrage at \u201cWashington Redskins\u201d are irrelevant. He claims it doesn\u2019t matter how few people oppose the name because it is \u201cobjectively offensive,\u201d a judgment not obviously true or even coherent, since taking offense would seem to be highly subjective. The suspicion that Tracy thinks it sufficient to demand that sensibilities like his should prevail because that\u2019s what he really, really wants is supported by his catalog of other athletic teams with Indian names or logos he finds objectionable. That the University of Utah has official permission of the Ute Nations to call its teams the Utes, for example, does not banish Tracy\u2019s doubts about the seemliness of the athletic program\u2019s logo, which shows two feathers attached to the letter U. He considers the arrowhead in the San Diego State Aztec\u2019s logo even more shameful.\n\nBeing on the right side of history is about timing\u2014but not just about timing. There\u2019s more to it, that is, than getting where the crowd is headed a little before the crowd arrives, the key to making money in equities or real estate. The right side, for progressives, is the side they deem right, not just the thing that happens next. The causes that deserve to win are destined to prevail because, as Martin Luther King said in 1965, the \u201carc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.\u201d\n\nThat famous declaration, like others made in sermons, neither lends itself to nor profits from scrutiny. For one thing, it\u2019s unfalsifiable\u2014an assertion that something will eventually come to pass can always be defended on the grounds that it hasn\u2019t come true yet. For another, what justice means and requires is the subject of an old, profound debate, not a standard that settles political problems the way the definition of an isosceles triangle settles geometry problems. King\u2019s heavy reliance on the concept of the \u201cbeloved community\u201d argues that he relied on an understanding of justice for which the descriptor \u201cexpansive\u201d is much too narrow. \u201cFor Dr. King, The Beloved Community was not a lofty utopian goal,\u201d the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent Social Change states, before describing it in lofty utopian terms as \u201ca global vision, in which all people can share in the wealth of the earth.\u201d In this vision, \u201cpoverty, hunger and homelessness will not be tolerated,\u201d \u201call forms of discrimination, bigotry and prejudice will be replaced by an all-inclusive spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood,\u201d and \u201cinternational disputes will be resolved by peaceful conflict-resolution and reconciliation of adversaries, instead of military power.\u201d\n\nIdentity Politics That vision, suffice to say, doesn\u2019t rule out very much, either in terms of grievances or the measures needed to rectify them. Since King\u2019s death 46 years ago, it has ruled in more and more. According to the Hoover Institution\u2019s Tod Lindberg, the historical tide demanding ever greater equality\u2014the subject of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America\u2014at first rendered political differences untenable, resulting in government by consent of the governed, expressed though universal suffrage. It then found economic disparities unacceptable, which led to efforts to reduce them with proletarian revolution, socialism, and welfare states. It now finds social differences among various groups intolerable. In order to \u201cbring down the status of the privileged and elevate the status of the denigrated,\u201d Lindberg writes, those described by various markers of social identity\u2014race, sex, class, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc.\u2014must all be accorded full and equal regard.\n\nThe attainment of perfect political or economic equality is highly unlikely, but can be described intelligibly, even as it is possible for political and economic inequalities to be objectively assessed. By contrast, equal social status rests on subjective feelings of being included and affirmed, rendering it as nebulous in theory as it is elusive in practice. Although a perfectly homogenous society might achieve absolute equality of social status, the \u201cTocqueville effect\u201d argues that increasing equality always renders remaining inequalities all the more noticeable and suspect. As long as humans are not identical there will be differences among them, which will give rise to real or perceived inequalities.\n\nIn any case, the point of social equality is not to eliminate differences but to celebrate them. The psychological strength that follows from this achievement is the embrace, not the denial, of one\u2019s nature and heritage. Thus, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) demands abandoning \u201cWashington Redskins\u201d because, when exposed to \u201cIndian-based names, mascots, and logos in sports,\u201d\n\nthe self-esteem of Native youth is harmfully impacted, their self-confidence erodes, and their sense of identity is severely damaged. Specifically, these stereotypes affect how Native youth view the world and their place in society, while also affecting how society views Native peoples. This creates an inaccurate portrayal of Native peoples and their contributions to society. Creating positive images and role models is essential in helping Native youth more fully and fairly establish themselves in today\u2019s society.\n\nThe NCAI position paper, whose weakest claims echo the notorious \u201cdoll experiment\u201d argument of 1954\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision, moves directly from these premises to discuss how Indians are disproportionately likely to be victims of suicide and hate crimes. It does not even attempt to establish a causal relationship between these dire outcomes and the psychological changes it deplores. What\u2019s more, its social scientific argument for a cause-and-effect relationship between Indian mascots and Native youth\u2019s impaired self-esteem and confidence rests entirely on a single, ten-page conference paper by an assistant professor of psychology.\n\nBut whether the links in the empirical chain between team names and logos, on the one hand, and depression and suicide, on the other, are sturdy or flimsy is not really the point. Last December, Melissa Harris-Perry, a Tulane University political science professor, found herself attacked for a segment on the MSNBC television show she hosts. Two days after Harris-Perry and her panelists made derisive references to a Romney family photograph that included an adopted black grandchild sitting on the former governor\u2019s lap, she posted to her Twitter account, \u201cWithout reservation or qualification\u2026I want to immediately apologize to the Romney family for hurting them.\u201d She explained the basis for this apology in the compressed locution of Twitter: \u201cI work by guiding principle that those who offend do not have the right to tell those they hurt that they r wrong for hurting.\u201d\n\nThough explaining a great deal about life in 21st-century America, this guiding principle offers very little guidance for navigating the political and social terrain. Harris-Perry rules out the possibility of a false positive: if you r hurting, you were offended. By this illogic, claims to having been hurt and offended\u2014or at least ones put forward by groups formerly or presently victimized by discrimination\u2014are never dishonest, mistaken, or overwrought. There are no innocent explanations because the subjective experience of having been hurt necessarily means that the offenders are indeed guilty of inflicting a wound. For them to protest to the contrary only compounds the original offense, as it further denigrates the injured party by signaling that their hurt feelings are trivial, contrived, or spurious.\n\nAt a January 2014 news conference before the season premiere of the HBO series Girls, Tim Molloy, a television reporter and critic for The Wrap, a webzine covering show business exhaustively, posed a question to Lena Dunham, creator, executive producer, and star of the show. In the Associated Press summary of the event, Molloy asked Dunham \u201cwhy her character was so often naked and for no apparent reason.\u201d The question, which has occurred to many people who have watched and written about Girls, may or may not have had a subtext, but certainly had a context. The economic context is that premium cable channels, which derive all their revenue from subscribers because they show no commercials, offer nudity, sex, profanity, and violence unavailable on broadcast TV or basic cable. The obvious purpose is to remind viewers incessantly that their subscription dollars purchase a kind of raw entertainment they won\u2019t see elsewhere.\n\nThe political context is that the women shown in the nude on premium-cable are almost always exceptionally attractive rather than ones with average faces and figures. (Dunham is closer to the latter than to a swimsuit model.) \u201cIn a culture where only traditionally beautiful women are asked to disrobe on screen,\u201d Nico Lang wrote for the Los Angeles Times, \u201cDunham is forcing us to reconsider what bodies we value and why.\u201d By showing her character naked so frequently, \u201cDunham is sending female viewers an important message: You have value, no matter your body type.\u201d\n\nThis is an argument, echoed by several other feminist bloggers, one might accept or reject. The reaction to Molloy\u2019s question at the press conference, however, was that the topic was one only an odious cretin would even mention. The nudity on Girls, is \u201ca realistic expression of what it\u2019s like to be alive,\u201d Dunham told Molloy. \u201cIf you are not into me, that\u2019s your problem, and you are going to have to kind of work that out.\u201d Her co-producers were far less restrained. One, Jenni Konner, informed the journalists that she was in a \u201crage spiral\u201d at the thought that Molloy presumed to \u201ctalk to a woman\u201d that way. Another, film director Judd Apatow, told Molloy that his question was \u201coffensive on its face,\u201d both \u201csexist\u2026and misogynistic.\u201d The way he asked it, Apatow continued, \u201cshows a lack of depth in how you watch the show\u201d and \u201ccame out much darker, edgier, and negative than you realized.\u201d\n\nThe disproportion between Molloy\u2019s question and the fierce response to it demonstrates Harris-Perry\u2019s guiding principle at work. The Dunham/Kenner/Apatow position is: 1) Molloy crossed the line; 2) we\u2019re not going to say where the line is; 3) we\u2019re also not going to say why the line is where it is, rather than somewhere else, or who decided it should be drawn in that particular location; 4) it\u2019s also crossing the line to challenge Nos. 1, 2, or 3. If Molloy doesn\u2019t understand why his question was contemptible, then his inability or refusal to recognize the boundaries of decent discourse is one more reason to condemn him.\n\nTolerance, Old and New It\u2019s noteworthy that the Girls producers got nowhere near a rage spiral when the press conference turned, in the A.P. account, to questions \u201cabout the show\u2019s lack of a regular minority character, despite its setting in diverse New York City.\u201d Instead, switching immediately from playing offense to defense, they took a couple of practice spins at the top of a guilt spiral. \u201cIn the history of television, you could look at every show on TV and say, \u2018How come there\u2019s not an American Indian on this show?\u2019 \u2018How come there\u2019s not an Asian person on this show?\u2019\u201d Apatow said. \u201cWe need to talk about diversifying the world of television, and we are trying to continue to do it in ways that are genuine, natural, intelligent,\u201d Dunham added.\n\nIn short, although the rules governing the behavior of the privileged toward the denigrated are clear and exacting, the ones concerning conduct among those with some claim to having been denigrated are hazy and provisional. That disparity does not lend itself to sustaining a free and equal society. In November 2004 Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh was murdered on the streets of Amsterdam by a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim enraged by Van Gogh\u2019s movie, Submission, about Islam\u2019s oppression of women. Some weeks later, the New Yorker\u2019s Ian Buruma, analyzing the shocking assassination, reported wistfully that \u201cthe Dutch prided themselves on having built an oasis of tolerance, a kind of Berkeley writ large, where people were free to do their own thing.\u201d In films, writings, and speeches, Van Gogh had insisted pugnaciously that tolerance mandates intolerance of the intolerant. Thus, in Buruma\u2019s summary of his thinking, \u201cTo show respect for Islam without mentioning the Islamic oppression of women and homosexuals was an act of disgusting hypocrisy.\u201d At the time of Van Gogh\u2019s murder, one tenth of Holland\u2019s population consisted of immigrants, many of them Muslims. Tolerating their presence and tenets, while upholding the ideal of equal respect for all viewpoints and lifestyles, proved to be an exercise in squaring the circle.\n\nIt turns out life in places like Berkeley or Amsterdam, where modern tolerance is pervasive, makes citizens poor stewards and defenders of tolerance. To experience tolerance and nothing else makes tolerance seem so agreeable and natural as to render incredible the thought that it is, historically and anthropologically, exceptional rather than normal. Those habituated to tolerance find it impossible to take seriously the idea that some regard a society where all are free to do their own thing appalling rather than elevating. And when these opponents of tolerance reject it not just utterly but violently, tolerance becomes indistinguishable from cowardice\u2014not only the physical cowardice of those stalwart defenders of freedom prepared to repel crime and terrorism with seminars and editorials, but also the moral cowardice of good liberals who cannot bring themselves to deplore intolerance, even brutality, perpetrated by groups having any claim on victimhood, as opposed to transgressions committed by groups that can be reassuringly categorized as bigoted oppressors. After Van Gogh\u2019s murder, his collaborator on Submission, the Somali-born Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, went into hiding. When the government found it too expensive, difficult, and above all awkward to protect her, it eventually forced Hirsi Ali to emigrate to the United States.\n\nTolerance negates itself not only by tolerating too much, but too little. Classical, Lockean toleration was confined to \u201cmatters concerning property and the body,\u201d in the words of political scientist Peter Berkowitz, leaving to religion questions about \u201cthe heart and mind.\u201d Thus, \u201cProvided that they can be counted on to respect the laws that prohibit theft and violence, believers of diverse and conflicting religious persuasions should be free to worship as they see fit.\u201d Modern toleration is vastly more ambitious. It \u201cdemands not merely enduring but embracing the diverse.\u201d\n\nIn this view, it is not enough to reconcile oneself to living with those whose views and conduct rub the wrong way. Instead, citizens must learn to see a wide range of views and lifestyles that differ from their own as intrinsically worthy, deserving of admiration and even enthusiasm.\n\nCentral to modern toleration is a \u201ccommitment to the view that all cultures and peoples are good, but especially peoples and cultures that are minority and non-Western.\u201d As a result, writes Berkowitz, tolerance now\n\nputs the state in the invasive business of regulating and re-educating hearts and minds. It transforms disagreements about social policy concerning blacks, women and gays into issues of personal integrity and even mental health, diagnosing non-conforming utterances and thoughts as moral and intellectual pathology.\n\nIn the classical formulation, people with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds maintain a cohesive society by agreeing to obey a set of rules, a mutual non-aggression pact. As long as your beliefs and practices don\u2019t adversely affect me I won\u2019t interfere with them, even if I find them wicked or stupid. And you\u2019ll reciprocate by extending me the same terms.\n\nModern tolerance demands that we go beyond this narrow political understanding to a broad psychological, sociological one. The success of pluralism is not secured by obeying the rules of the game, that is, but depends heavily on the spirit in which we play it. People need and deserve not just the freedom to march to their own drummer, but to be honored, respected, affirmed, and validated. If they\u2019re not, the deprivation could generate \u201ca feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone,\u201d in the words of Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nSo, mutual non-aggression is not enough. We need mutual respect, support, and encouragement. One could imagine a feasible, admirable conception of this effort to build a communitarian dwelling on a contractarian foundation, one stipulating that precisely because a system that maximizes liberty makes social life a contact sport, it works best\u2014and perhaps only\u2014within an ethos of restraint and comity. William Kristol addressed that challenge in 1995 when he urged conservatives to attend to \u201cthe politics of liberty\u201d and \u201cthe sociology of virtue.\u201d\n\nModern tolerance, however, as understood and practiced by the Left, is not satisfied by encouraging kinder, gentler attitudes and behaviors. It mandates them, reversing the civics class bromide about rights entailing obligations. The moral obligation to extend respect and encouragement now engenders a right to receive them. Such a right renders any failure or refusal to offer respect and encouragement a transgression\u2014a rights violation. Those violations, in turn, justify social and even legal sanctions against the transgressors, who are not exonerated by insisting that their actions and attitudes, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, neither pick any pockets nor break any legs.\n\nWedding Cakes and Photographs The intolerance of modern tolerance was on display when a caterer, florist, and photographer were each subjected to civil and criminal legal actions, as well as social abuse, for refusing to sell their services to couples planning same-sex weddings. In Albuquerque, Elane Photography was fined by New Mexico\u2019s Human Rights Commission for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, a ruling upheld by the state supreme court. After an Oregon bakery made a similar decision, the couple it declined to serve filed a complaint with the state\u2019s Bureau of Labor and Industries. The official in charge of the investigation provided a re-education camp director\u2019s rationale for his Bureau\u2019s efforts: \u201cThe goal is to rehabilitate. For those who do violate the law, we want them to learn from that experience and have a good, successful business in Oregon.\u201d By the time the agency ruled the bakery had discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, the proprietors had already closed their shop and retreated to a custom business based in their home, after protests, boycotts, and death threats.\n\nSlate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern has helpfully spelled out the ideology that justifies these sanctions. A photographer or baker who declines the patronage of a gay couple seeking his services for a wedding, even if he would accept their business for any other occasion, is morally indistinguishable from segregationists Bull Connor and Lester Maddox: \u201cthe real victim isn\u2019t the business owner who acted on his hatred, but the customer who suffered from his discriminatory policies.\u201d That suffering might seem limited to being reminded that some Americans still oppose same-sex marriage, prior to enduring the trauma of dialing the phone number of the next photographer or baker listed in the Yellow Pages, but those who offend do not have the right to tell those they hurt that they are wrong for hurting. The merchants\u2019 refusal, according to Stern, can have no motive and explanation other than \u201ca hatred of gay people so vehement that they\u2019ll violate non-discrimination laws just to make sure they never, ever have to provide a gay person with a basic service.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Robin Abcarian of the Los Angeles Times declares that opposing or even having misgivings about gay marriage is no longer an option for decent and reasonable Americans: \u201cMarriage equality is at the very heart of gay civil rights. If you can\u2019t be married, you can\u2019t be equal.\u201d Getting on the right side of history requires \u201ccoming to terms with the reality of the social landscape. Gay marriage is out of the bag and it\u2019s not going back in.\u201d\n\nThis plausible assessment of the social landscape aligns with the one President Obama made in 2012 when he concluded that supporting gay marriage was, on balance, electorally advantageous. (He had decided in his 2008 campaign that opposing it was the better part of valor.) If gay marriage is out of the bag and not going back in, however, it\u2019s fair to inquire what other items have yet to be unpacked. Progressivism, Lindberg points out, \u201cimplies not only improvement over time, but a progression: Correct the perceived injustice most immediately at hand, then move on to the next one.\u201d Political calculations figure prominently in determining the sequence.\n\nSo, according to Boston College law professor Kent Greenfield, writing for the liberal American Prospect, the campaign to demolish the legal barriers to polygamy and incest is at hand. He argues that in the wake of the 2013 Supreme Court decisions upholding gay marriage, \u201cit\u2019s time for the political left to own up\u201d to the fact that, just as conservatives have often alleged, \u201cthere is indeed a slippery slope between recognizing same-sex marriages and allowing marriages among more than two people and between consenting adults who are related.\u201d Those who, like Greenfield, support same-sex marriage need to own up because, he contends, the arguments distinguishing their cause from legalizing polygamous and incestuous marriage are all notably weak. Claims that polygamy and incest are unnatural simply echo the arguments against gay rights and gay marriage, now in retreat on the political battlefield. As long as the laws regarding age-of-consent and divorce allow voluntary entrances and exits from marriage, polygamous and incestuous marriages are no more coercive than any other kind. Finally, Greenfield disputes the idea that \u201csexual orientation is hard wired, but polygamy and incest are choices.\u201d In fact, \u201carguments for marriage equality do not really depend on the claim that people have no choice about who they are.\u201d The case for gay marriage would not be weakened by the discovery that sexual orientation can be chosen rather than predetermined, he contends, even as the case for polygamous or incestuous marriage does not depend on whether the desire to enter into them is a choice or a biologically determined destiny.\n\nThe Business of Being Offended I raise these points not to weigh in on the gay marriage debate, but to see modern tolerance in full. For the moment, advocating polygamous and incestuous marriage appears premature\u2014not on the wrong side of history, exactly, but too far ahead of deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments to be on the right side\u2026yet. It follows that a business owner who declined to photograph the ceremony or cater the reception for five people getting married, or siblings getting married, or five siblings getting married, would probably be spared accusations that his reactionary refusal betrayed the kind of vicious hatred that denies others the dignity essential to their self-esteem and social equality.\n\nModern tolerance does not aspire to the reciprocity classical tolerance sought, under which the spirit of live-and-let-live was to operate in all directions with equal force, rather than just for the benefit of some and to the detriment of others. Nonetheless, it might acquire a measure of self-restraint by incorporating the notion that making the right side of history the ultimate arbiter of all disputes argues for judging those on the wrong side less rather than more severely. The incumbent and preceding Democratic presidents are fond of quoting Judge Learned Hand\u2019s maxim that the spirit of liberty is not too sure it is right. Many of their admirers pervert that rule\u2019s meaning, however, by using it to condemn opinions they oppose rather than to examine and moderate the ones they hold. To scorn everyone else\u2019s self-righteousness is the worst kind of self-righteousness.\n\nThere is another anomaly about modern tolerance. We live in a time when it is bad to be insensitive, but good\u2014as in frank, bold, and authentic\u2014to be \u201cprovocative.\u201d The easiest, most common way to be provocative, however, is to provoke the sensitive by being insensitive. And the easiest, most common way to leverage the moral authority of having been denigrated and marginalized is to insist there are no minor slights or innocent misunderstandings, only intolerable violations that cruelly inflict irreparable psychological damage on the victims. As a result of these contradictory imperatives, the national narrative is now punctuated every few weeks by the story of some media figure\u2014Paula Deen, Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty, Alec Baldwin, Martin Bashir, Jerry Seinfeld\u2014who gave offense, got denounced, expressed contrition, and was or was not rehabilitated before we all lost interest as the next drama unfolded.\n\nAmericans would enhance domestic tranquility by giving offense\u2014but also by taking it\u2014less readily. Those having, or claiming to have, porcelain egos may secure political victories by wielding the power to shame and silence, but do not deserve respect. As the whole world becomes a china shop, the only way to avoid being a bull, or a bully, is to stand perfectly still, endlessly.\n\nDemanding that people never say anything that might be taken as an affront creates perverse incentives, however. As it becomes clear that efforts not to offend are futile, being a bull becomes a way to rebuke the china shop\u2019s proliferating, arbitrary, asymmetrical rules. For his own safety and Holland\u2019s concord, it would have been better if Theo van Gogh had not routinely referred to that country\u2019s Muslim population as \u201cgoat f**kers.\u201d When, however, the governing pieties become utterly suffocating, being as offensive as possible comes to seem like the only way to raise questions ruled unfit for polite society\u2014like the status, rights, and duties of Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands\u2014as well as to protest the whole regime of discourse propriety. Twenty-first-century American conservatives may be tempted to emulate van Gogh by, for example, defending \u201cWashington Redskins\u201d unreservedly and campaigning to bring back Chief Noc-a-Homa in the bargain. If you\u2019re going to be denounced for insensitivity no matter how hard you try to play nice, in other words, you may as well go out of your way to play rough.\n\nEven if that path didn\u2019t lead to assassination attempts, however, pledging lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to the cause of gratuitous provocation amounts to a course of rebuking modern tolerance with impudent but futile gestures. A better approach would be to win what can be won, which does not appear to include the sociology of virtue as Kristol characterized it 19 years ago. The deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments on the question of gay marriage and marijuana legalization, for example, are moving steadily in directions most conservatives have opposed. The sociology of virtue, forging a consensus about what virtue requires and forbids, really will have to operate sociologically, from the bottom up, rather than politically from the top down.\n\nThe politics of liberty, however, still offers a basis on which to defend pluralism and classical tolerance. If there\u2019s a lot Americans can\u2019t agree on, in other words, they need to get better at agreeing to disagree by refocusing on the rules of the game instead of the spirit in which it\u2019s played. This gets politics back to upholding people\u2019s rights, and out of the business of sparing their feelings. Thus, by virtue of having purchased Washington\u2019s NFL franchise, Dan Snyder can call the team whatever he likes, calibrating as he sees fit the best response to the minority of American Indians offended by \u201cRedskins\u201d and the offsetting benefits of retaining an 80-year-old name. For all of the editorializing, then, it isn\u2019t really a political question. The same can be said for Elane Photography\u2019s decision not to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, or the Hobby Lobby\u2019s resistance to Affordable Care Act rules mandating employee health care benefits that include abortifacients.\n\n\u201cSome people are in the business of being offended,\u201d writes Thomas Sowell, \u201cjust as Campbell is in the business of making soup.\u201d But as Sowell, an economist, advises, enterprises flourish when they are profitable, and grievance manufacturing is a growth industry because its practitioners \u201ccan get political or financial mileage out of being offended.\u201d A diverse society cannot make tolerance work unless the government is vigilant about protecting our rights instead of our self-esteem. That retrenchment would help put America\u2019s grievance-industrial complex out of business.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 20 Jun 2014 07:18:13 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The fight over the Redskins' name is a fight not just about how we make decisions, but how we decide what needs to be decided, and who will do the deciding.", "title": "The Redskins and the Wrong Side of History", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/redskins.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-25T07:44:41+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/06/20/the-redskins-and-the-wrong-side-of-history/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The fight over the Redskins' name is a fight not just about how we make decisions, but how we decide what needs to be decided, and who will do the deciding.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/redskins.jpg"}, "title": "The Redskins and the Wrong Side of History", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Culture", "tag": "Bob Costas,Charles Krauthammer,Culture,language,marriage,Native Americans,NFL,Slate,sports media,The New Republic,Washington Redskins", "published_time": "2014-06-20T07:18:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T07:44:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The fight over the Redskins' name is a fight not just about how we make decisions, but how we decide what needs to be decided, and who will do the deciding."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c08\"", "article_summary": "The Right Side of History Krauthammer, Costas, and many other \u201cRedskins\u201d critics contend that because sensibilities change, terminology must follow.\nThe Redskins retain their team name and fight song, \u201cHail to the Redskins,\u201d but have changed the words.\nOthers applauded him for finally getting on the right side of history when, in May 2012, he declared himself a supporter of gay marriage.\nThose who now want the Washington Redskins to be called something newer and nicer are, it follows, \u201con the right side of history,\u201d a polemic wielded with increasing frequency.\nThe \u201cright side of history\u201d is a recent addition to the lexicon, but the idea behind it is quite old."}
