Peyton Manning on Saturday visited military personnel and Chattanooga, Tenn., police officers at the Naval Marine Corps Reserve Center on Amnicola Highway where four United States marines and a Navy sailor were killed by a gunman, WRCB reported.

The Chattanooga police posted a photo on Twitter of Manning’s visit and thanked for him stopping by to honor the fallen servicemen late Saturday.

A 24-year-old Kuwaiti-born gunman opened fire on the military recruiting station Thursday, before going to the reserve center where he killed four U.S. marines. A fifth victim, a 26-year-old Navy sailor, died Saturday from injuries he sustained in the attack. Two others, a marine and a Chattanooga police officer, remain hospitalized for injuries that have been described as non-life threatening.

That attack, considered a domestic act of terrorism, is being investigated by the FBI and local officials.
