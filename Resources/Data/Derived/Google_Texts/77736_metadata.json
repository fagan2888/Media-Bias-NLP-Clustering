But the price of a grande (medium in plain-speak) sized latte won\u2019t change at all. The cost of a tall brewed coffee and any sized frappuccino won\u2019t change either.\n\nThe company estimates that the orders of fewer than 20% of its customers will be affected. The price is only changing in U.S. stores, but it will change more in some markets than others.\n\nRELATED: Starbucks employees to get two years of free college\n\nStarbucks is also raising the price of its packaged coffee sold in grocery stores by about 8%, beginning July 21. While retailers ultimately set the price, customers can expect to pay about $1 more per 12 oz. bag.\n\nThe change will actually bring the price back up to what it cost in April 2013, when the company cut the cost, spokesman Zack Hutson said.\n\nHe would not specify why the price hike is going into effect, but said the company considers factors like \u201ccompetitive dynamics\u201d and its overall cost structure.\n\nHutson said the price hike is not a knee-jerk reaction to the recent rise in coffee prices, which have skyrocketed due to a severe drought in Brazil. Starbucks buys its coffee beans ahead of time and already has enough for the rest of the fiscal year, and some of the next, he said.\n\nThe price hike at Starbucks comes about two months after J.M.
