There\u2019s no better word to describe how we felt in the moment,\u201d Rosas said. However, Rosas admits he was doubtful at times.\n\n\u201cI was kind of shocked,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cWe expected some support, but we had hit so many obstacles. We really didn\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles they faced was finding a space, but according to Rosas, an office space will be made available before the end of the current spring semester, where he said will probably be situated in Santa Susana Hall.\n\nThe next step is to make it all happen, as several meetings must take place to get the center going, as well as garnering the funding for such a program.\n\nThe resource center will begin by opening an office prior to the end of this semester, yet there are plans for opening a center that caters specifically to the well-being of students who are undocumented.\n\nWhile the Equal Opportunity Program (EOP) on campus offers information regarding the California Dream Act, the California Assembly Bill (AB) 540, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the undocumented youth insist that this isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cWe have this opportunity to make this beneficial for students and we want to make this as good as possible,\u201d said Rosas.\n\nThe students aren\u2019t alone. The group, and the cause, has been supported by several different faculty from the Chicana/o Studies, journalism, Asian-American studies, Central American studies departments, and even staff from the EOP.\n\nAlthough DTBH is taking great part in the planning of the center, Rosas said that this shouldn\u2019t be the case. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be doing this. We\u2019re students. The administration needs to take care of us.\n\nThe university caters to a body of students that represents a vast abundance of ethnicities and cultures. As of 2013, over 70 percent of students identified with a race other than white, a CSU demographic study of 2013 reports.\n\nAccording to a report from the Immigration Policy Center, there are over 400,000 individuals that qualify as Dreamers in California and over 1,000,000 throughout the United States. California is home to the largest population of undocumented youth.\n\n\u201cBeing undocumented, you are invisible throughout your life\u2026 hopefully we can bring support and help each other out,\u201d Rosas said.\n\nMembers of DTBH estimate that close to 500 students at CSUN were denied when applying for the California Dream Act, as only 452 of the 931 applicants were awarded the scholarship.\n\nBecause of the lack of resources, Rosas said that this is the main reason why there are no accurate numbers on those who are undocumented. However, his main concerns\n\n\u201cWe want to provide that \u201cAB 540 Safe Zone,\u201d because we do understand that undocumented students go through stresses and emotions\u2026 but, we\u2019re not asking anyone to \u2018come out,\u2019\u201d Rosas said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nReddit\n\nPocket\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Joanna Jacobo", "og": {"site_name": "The Sundial", "description": "Dreamers at Cal State Northridge can rest easy, as their month-long pursuit for the campus to offer an undocumented student resource center was approved by the administration on March 4.
