Parliament then has one week to agree on a nominee for post of prime minister, to be appointed by the president.\n\nIvanishvili, who will be acting premier during that week, will hand over his functions on November 24 and a new cabinet proposed by his successor and approved by parliament.\n\nGaribashvili has a master's degree in international relations from Tbilisi and Sorbonne Universities.\n\nFluent in Russian, English and French, he held senior positions in Ivanishvili's Cartu Bank and his charity fund before joining the government as interior minister last year.\n\nGaribashvili will set economic as well as foreign policy.\n\nPoverty is a problem and, after years of robust growth, gross domestic product expanded just 1.5 percent in the second quarter this year, down from 8.2 percent in the same period a year ago.\n\n(Reporting by Margarita Antidze; Editing by John Stonestreet)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margarita Antidze",
