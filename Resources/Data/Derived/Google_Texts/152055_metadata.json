Andy Barr, Kentucky Republican and one of five RSC members to unveil the plan.\n\nTheir replacement, the American Health Care Reform Act, would eliminate Obamacare\u2019s coverage standards and wouldn\u2019t force people to buy insurance. Republicans would instead try to entice customers to sign up for plans by offering individuals the same tax deduction that businesses get for offering plans to their employees.\n\nThe bill would allow people to stash more money in tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts and set aside $15 billion to defeat Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases, reasoning that cures would result in massive savings over time.\n\nBut the RSC members said their plan is not the short-term \u201cfix\u201d that many say will be needed if the Supreme Court later this month strikes down Obamacare\u2019s subsidies in King v. Burwell. Justices are deciding whether the IRS has unlawfully paid subsidies to customers in 34 states that declined to set up their own health exchanges.\n\nWithout the subsidies, Obamacare customers would find their plans unaffordable, sending insurance markets into a tailspin as healthier customers drop coverage.\n\nCongressional Democrats have lambasted the GOP\u2019s alternatives as lackluster and unnecessary, pointing to 16 million Americans who\u2019ve gained coverage under Obamacare. They also say there is no need to forge a back-up plan for the King decision, arguing Congress never intended to treat the states differently and that the justices will see it the same way.\n\n\u201cThe partisan opponents of the Affordable Care Act have shown they will stop at nothing to undo the law and take away health coverage from millions of Americans,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said last week. \u201cNot only is King v. Burwell their last hope, but it\u2019s a miracle the Supreme Court took up the case to begin with.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hope to use the court\u2019s ruling as a bridge to 2017, when a GOP president and majorities in Congress would let them repeal and replace Mr. Obama\u2019s signature law. But they haven\u2019t decided whether to lock in Obamacare\u2019s subsidies for a short period \u2014 so affected Americans don\u2019t twist in the wind \u2014 or refuse quick fixes and make the administration deal with the mess, the result of poorly drafted language in its signature law.\n\n\u201cWe still have multiple opinions about how to deal with the issue,\u201d RSC Chairman Bill Flores, Texas Republican, said.\n\nRep. Austin Scott, Georgia Republican, said he would not extend the subsidies unless Mr. Obama acquiesced to some of the GOP\u2019s reforms. Mr. Barr, though, said he\u2019d be open to a temporary extension of the subsidies to minimize harm.\n\nMr. Flores said while the RSC didn\u2019t get \u201cinto the weeds\u201d on that issue, it feels any transition from the King decision should pay for the subsidies with existing Obamacare revenue instead of new taxes. It should also repeal the law\u2019s insurance mandates and coverage requirements, he said.\n\nWith its bill, the RSC joined House Budget Chairman Tom Price, Georgia Republican who filed an Obamacare replacement earlier this year, and Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Richard Burr of North Carolina and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton, who\u2019ve issued their own blueprint.\n\nBoth chambers, meanwhile, are trying to use a fast-track budget tool known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to take a swipe at President Obama\u2019s law.\n\nA Republican aide said Thursday they still think they can use the procedure to send a full repeal bill to the White House, even though Politico this week reported the Senate parliamentarian is unlikely to permit any attempt at full repeal, as reconciliation provisions must fit into strict budget rules.\n\nOther legislative aides told The Washington Times it is too soon to say how GOP-led committees will attack the law under reconciliation, citing the King decision\u2019s impact on their approach. No matter the outcome, Mr. Obama would veto any repeal bill that made it to his desk.\n\nThe administration, defending its signature law, urged holdout states Thursday to expand Obamacare\u2019s reach by extending Medicaid coverage to more poor Americans.\n\nTwenty-one states have declined the federal government\u2019s offer to pay for 100 percent of the expansion through 2016, a share that scales down to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond.\n\nThe White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers said more than 12 million people been covered under Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program since Obamacare launched in earnest in fall 2013, and that 5,200 deaths could be avoided each year if the rest of the states expanded Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House conservatives unveiled another alternative to Obamacare Thursday, insisting market-oriented changes are better than the 2010 law's mandates and subsidies as Republicans try to coalesce around a permanent replacement.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House conservatives unveiled another alternative to Obamacare Thursday, insisting market-oriented changes are better than the 2010 law\u2019s mandates and subsidies as Republicans try to coalesce around a permanent replacement.", "title": "GOP offers another Obamacare alternative", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/4/gop-offers-another-obamacare-alternative/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/30/bill_flores.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/30/bill_flores.jpg", "description": "House conservatives unveiled another alternative to Obamacare Thursday, insisting market-oriented changes are better than the 2010 law's mandates and subsidies as Republicans try to coalesce around a", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP offers another Obamacare alternative"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Obamacare, Republican Study Committee, Andy Barr, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f7a\"", "article_summary": "Without the subsidies, Obamacare customers would find their plans unaffordable, sending insurance markets into a tailspin as healthier customers drop coverage.\nCongressional Democrats have lambasted the GOP\u2019s alternatives as lackluster and unnecessary, pointing to 16 million Americans who\u2019ve gained coverage under Obamacare.\nHouse conservatives unveiled another alternative to Obamacare Thursday, insisting market-oriented changes are better than the 2010 law\u2019s mandates and subsidies as Republicans try to coalesce around a permanent replacement.\nWith its bill, the RSC joined House Budget Chairman Tom Price, Georgia Republican who filed an Obamacare replacement earlier this year, and Sens.\nTheir replacement, the American Health Care Reform Act, would eliminate Obamacare\u2019s coverage standards and wouldn\u2019t force people to buy insurance."}
