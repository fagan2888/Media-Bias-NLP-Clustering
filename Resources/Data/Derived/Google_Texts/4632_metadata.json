Here, we collect some of the most ridiculous and egregious violations of general normality, sensitivity, and basic intelligence.\n\nSusan Collins\n\nMaine\u2019s Republican Senator Susan Collins got some great press this year during the partial government shutdown. \u201cCollins Leads Senate Sisters in Shaping Deal,\u201d a USA Today headline read in October. Time Magazine called her \u201cThe Deal-Maker in DC.\u201d The Boston Globe reported, \u201cMaine\u2019s Collins is Suddenly the Moderate in the Middle.\u201d But taking those reports at face value is like digging into Tofurky expecting it to be the real thing \u2014 disappointing, to say the least. It\u2019s true that Collins, who has been in office since 1997 (despite saying she would only serve for two terms), did come forward with a bipartisan plan to help end the shutdown (a proposal that was ultimately rejected). It\u2019s true that before the shutdown even began, she criticized her colleagues in the House for linking Obamacare amendments to the budget, calling theirs a \u201cstrategy that cannot possibly work.\u201d But, as Bill Nemitz pointed out in his October 2 column for the Portland Press Herald, Collins was \u201chardly a profile in courage during the shutdown stalemate.\u201d A close look at Collins\u2019s votes during this time reveals that she actually voted along party lines when it came to measures that would have removed Obamacare provisions from the spending resolution.\n\nSpecifically, after voting for an up-down vote on a budget resolution that linked Obamacare to federal spending, she then voted not once, but twice against un-linking the Affordable Care Act to the budget. She may have rhetorically disagreed with the GOP strategy, but her actions failed to back up her words \u2014 all because she\u2019s attempting to appear centrist while still placating extreme right-wingers.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Collins\u2019s positions are moderate when compared with those of Tea Party hard-liners like Ted Cruz. But those who turn to Collins seeking truly visionary leadership are looking in the wrong direction. Let\u2019s not forget that our senior senator was an NSA apologist; when the spying news broke, she defended it by saying \u201cit has defeated and thwarted dozens and dozens of terror plots both here and overseas\u201d (this was later revealed to be untrue). She may be good on the issues of reproductive and gay rights, but she also voted against Obamacare, against attempts to ban so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and against a motion to end the sequester and replace it with an alternative deficit-reduction plan that combined both spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nOn second thought, maybe it\u2019s not Collins who\u2019s a turkey \u2014 maybe instead, that designation should go to Maine voters who care more about keeping a steady flow of pork coming into our state than about shifting course in Congress.\n\nPaul LePage\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start. The Vaseline remarks? How about when he talked about bombing the Press Herald building? Or remember when he claimed that almost half the people in the state \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d? Governor Paul LePage said a lot of turkey-ish stuff in 2013, but what\u2019s more infuriating than the words themselves is how LePage attempts to explain away his verbal gaffes. He blames the press. He blames his upbringing. He blames his bilingualism. Isn\u2019t personal responsibility a major conservative tenet?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes.
