The study predicted the Clean Power Plan to reduce CO2 emissions across the country would result in the average family paying more than $1,225 more for power and gas in 2030 than they paid in 2012.\n\nIt goes on to claim that EPA regulations would increase poverty among Hispanics by more than 26 percent and African-Americans by more than 23 percent, with the impact growing in the next 20 years:\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s apparent indifference to the plight of low-income and minority households is inexcusable,\u201d Alford said. \u201cWe should pursue policies that expand opportunity for the less fortunate, not ones that further disadvantage them. The only solution is for (the) EPA to withdraw its rule.\u201d\n\nBut the EPA says it \u201cconducted an unprecedented amount of outreach\u201d to people affected by the plan.\n\n\u201cThe proposed Clean Power Plan provides broad benefits to all communities across the nation,\u201d the agency said in a statement to Watchdog.org. \u201cReducing greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, is especially beneficial to low income communities, communities of color and indigenous populations, those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the Clean Power Plan defended the EPA, saying minority groups have large numbers of people who suffer from breathing disorders such as asthma, and the Clean Power Plan will go a long way toward alleviating those problems.\n\n\u201cPolluted air from dirty energy sources makes our communities sick, resulting in unfair economic burdens on families from hospital costs to missed work days,\u201d Dr. Jalonne L. White-Newsome, director of federal policy for WE ACT for Environmental Justice, said in a statement. \u201cThe solution is not for the EPA to withdraw the Clean Power Plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening that the dirty energy industry thinks our community can be that easily fooled by a sham study paid for by polluters and distributed by a tiny subset of minority business groups that don\u2019t represent our views,\u201d said Mark Maga\u00f1a, founder of GreenLatinos.\n\nBut the author of the 135-page study defended its conclusions.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that the proposed EPA regulation will significantly raise energy costs, especially electricity prices, and no one disputes that, not even EPA or (the Energy Information Administration),\u201d Roger Bezdek, president of Management Information Services, told Watchdog.org. \u201cOf course, it varies in different regions and different states.\u201d\n\nBezdek said his company has a history of working with the industry, as well as environmental organizations \u2014 from Greenpeace to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cMany of (our) studies have generated controversy from both sides,\u201d Bezdek said. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re attacked from people with all different points of view and both sides of the political spectrum, you can suspect you\u2019ve done something right.\u201d\n\nThe report says blacks and Hispanics spend 10 percent more on utilities than whites, and the expenses related to the Clean Power Plan will especially affect seven states with the highest concentrations of those ethnic groups: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Texas.\n\n\u201cLower income people have to spend more of their discretionary income on energy because they have no choice,\u201d Bezdek said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere are numerous studies documenting this. When the crunch comes, they can spend less on food, less on clothing, less on entertainment, less on education \u2014 but they can\u2019t spend less on energy. They have to pay the utility bills. They have to pay the gasoline to get them to and from their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe EPA counters the Clean Power Plan will save money in the long run.\n\n\u201cEPA projects the Clean Power Plant will build on longstanding efforts by states, cities, businesses and homeowners to increase energy efficiency and reduce growth in demand for electricity,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u201cThis means that in 2030, when the plan is fully implemented, we expect electricity bills to be roughly 8 percent lower \u2014 savings of about $8 a month on an average monthly residential bill \u2014 than they would have been without the actions in state plans.\u201d\n\nIntroduced in June 2014, the Clean Power Plan has received praise as well as criticism.\n\nPublic utility commissioners, environmental and energy agency leaders in 14 states have come out in support of the EPA.\n\n\u201cThis plan is a down payment on a more efficient, 21st century power system that cuts energy waste, cuts pollution and cuts costs,\u201d EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a speech unveiling the proposal, which would mark the first time the agency will regulate carbon dioxide emissions from the nation\u2019s existing power plants.\n\nThe EPA will require all 50 states to take part in the Clean Power Plan, although McCarthy insists the plan offers each state flexibility in putting together their CO2 reductions.\n\nRelated: Will the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan save you money or clean your clock?\n\nBut there are questions about how much the plan will cost.\n\nA study released earlier this year estimated 43 states will see their electricity prices increase by double-digits in the next decade, and 14 states will experience peak-year increases of more than 20 percent.\n\n\u201cCritics claim your energy bills will skyrocket,\u201d McCarthy said last June. \u201cThey\u2019re wrong. Any small, short-term change in electricity prices would be within normal fluctuations the power sector already deals with. And any small price increase \u2014 think about the price of a gallon of milk a month \u2014 is dwarfed by huge benefits.\u201d\n\nThe Clean Power Plan has drawn fire from critics who say the EPA is overreaching.\n\nLaurence Tribe, who was professor of constitutional law for Barack Obama at Harvard and a well-known figure in liberal policy circles, slammed the Clean Power Plan at a congressional hearing earlier this year.\n\n\u201cEPA is attempting an unconstitutional trifecta: usurping the prerogatives of the states, Congress and the federal courts all at once,\u201d Tribe told the House Energy and Power Subcommittee.\n\n\u201cBurning the Constitution should not become part of our national energy policy.\u201d\n\nTribe submitted comments criticizing the EPA plan last December on behalf of Peabody Energy, the largest private sector coal company in the world.\n\nThe Obama administration won a preliminary fight earlier this month when a federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit by coal companies and 14 coal-producing states trying to block the Clean Power Plan. The court ruled the suit was premature because the EPA hasn\u2019t finalized the plan.\n\nBut other suits are expected once the Clean Power Plan\u2019s details are put into final form, which is scheduled to happen in August.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A recent study claims that Hispanics and African-Americans will be disproportionately hurt by the economics of the proposed EPA Clean Power Plan.", "title": "Black business group blasts the EPA's Clean Power Plan - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/unemployment-line-in-pennsylvania-from-flickr-commons1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-16T16:50:23+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/224162/epa-clean-power-plan/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Arizona", "tag": "Clean Power Plan,Environmental Protection Agency,EPA,Green Latinos,Laurence Tribe,Management Information Services Inc,National Black Chamber of Commerce,regulations,Roger Bezdek,WE ACT for Environmental Justice", "published_time": "2015-06-17T04:00:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T16:50:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A recent study claims that Hispanics and African-Americans will be disproportionately hurt by the economics of the proposed EPA Clean Power Plan.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/unemployment-line-in-pennsylvania-from-flickr-commons1.jpg"}, "title": "Black business group blasts the EPA's Clean Power Plan - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A recent study claims that Hispanics and African-Americans will be disproportionately hurt by the economics of the proposed EPA Clean Power Plan."}, "article_summary": "Related: Will the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan save you money or clean your clock?\nBy Rob Nikolewski \u2502 Watchdog.orgThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency insists its proposed Clean Power Plan is a much-needed step forward, but the National Black Chamber of Commerce has attacked the plan.\n\u201cThe proposed Clean Power Plan provides broad benefits to all communities across the nation,\u201d the agency said in a statement to Watchdog.org.\nBut other suits are expected once the Clean Power Plan\u2019s details are put into final form, which is scheduled to happen in August.\nThey have to pay the gasoline to get them to and from their jobs.\u201dThe EPA counters the Clean Power Plan will save money in the long run."}
