The Fed unexpectedly decides not to slow its stimulus\n\nStock indexes surged to record highs late Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, in a surprise move, said it would continue buying $85 billion in bonds and other assets every month to stimulate the economy. Investors had expected the Fed to taper off, but Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the job market hadn't improved enough yet. With mortgage rates rising and Congress cutting spending, he said, the recovery could falter if the Fed cut back now.
