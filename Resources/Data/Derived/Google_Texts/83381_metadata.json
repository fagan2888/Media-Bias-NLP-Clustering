The US pharmaceutical outsourcing market is the largest market in terms of market value, followed by payer and provider outsourcing. The U.S. provider outsourcing market is the fastest-growing segment of the US healthcare BPO market, owing to the implementation of the ICD-10 conversion reform and the shortage of skilled personnel, particularly medical coders in the US.\n\n\n\nThe US healthcare payer, provider, and pharmaceutical outsourcing markets are valued at $11.1 billion, $6.8 billion and $65.6 billion, respectively, in the year 2013. The U.S. healthcare payer market has been greatly impacted by the introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). This market is particularly driven by claims processing services. As the act expanded insurance access to more than 30 million US citizens, the increased claims processing workload led to large-scale outsourcing of these services by payers. Medical billing dominates the US healthcare provider outsourcing market, while contract manufacturing organizations hold the largest share in the US pharmaceutical outsourcing market in the year 2013.\n\n\n\nThe overall healthcare BPO market is highly fragmented with various players trying to gain a competitive edge and increase their market share. The players in the payer and provider outsourcing market are Accenture (Ireland), Medusind (U.S.), GeBBS Healthcare (U.S.), and Genpact Limited (Bermuda). The players in the pharmaceutical outsourcing market space include Lonza (Switzerland), Catalent (U.S.), Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany), DSM Pharma (U.S.), Quintiles (U.S.), and Covance (U.S.), among others.\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\n\n\n2 Executive Summary\n\n\n\n3 Market Overview\n\n\n\n4 U.S. Healthcare Payer Outsourcing Market, By Services\n\n\n\n5 U.S. Healthcare Provider Outsourcing Market, By Services\n\n\n\n6 U.S. Pharmaceutical Outsourcing Market, By Type\n\n\n\n7 Geographic Analysis\n\n\n\n8 Competitive Landscape\n\n\n\n9 Company Profiles\n\n\n\nCompanies Mentioned:\n\nAccenture Plc\n\nAccretive Health, Inc\n\nAnthelio Healthcare Solutions, Inc\n\nBoehringer Ingelheim Gmbh\n\nCatalent Pharma Solutions, Inc\n\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nCovance, Inc\n\nGEBBS Healthcare Solutions, Inc\n\nGenpact Limited\n\nIBM Corporation\n\nICON Plc\n\nInfosys Bpo Limited\n\nLONZA Group Ltd\n\nParexel International Corporation\n\nQuintiles Transnational Holdings, Inc\n\nWNS (Holdings) Limited\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/r5vkr6/us_healthcare_bpo\n\n\n\nMedia Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n\nSOURCE Research and Markets", "article_metadata": {"contentUrl": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prn/20130307/600769", "geo.region": "united states of america, united kingdom, ireland", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "DUBLIN, April 3", "description": "DUBLIN, April 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- US Healthcare BPO Market by Payer, Provider and Pharmaceutical - Trends and Global Forecasts to 2018.", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Research and Markets", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-healthcare-bpo-market-by-payer-provider-and-pharmaceutical---trends-and-global-forecasts-to-2018-253752901.html", "image": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "type": "website", "description": "DUBLIN, April 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nResearch and Markets...", "title": "US Healthcare BPO Market by Payer, Provider and Pharmaceutical - Trends and Global Forecasts to 2018"}, "date": "2014-04-03T11:34:00Z", "Publisher": "PRNewswire", "cf_entity_title": "US Healthcare BPO Market by Payer, Provider and Pharmaceutical - Trends and Global Forecasts to 2018", "robots": "index, follow", "Height": 500, "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "URL": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-healthcare-bpo-market-by-payer-provider-and-pharmaceutical---trends-and-global-forecasts-to-2018-253752901.html", "keywords": "Research and Markets, united states of america, united kingdom, ireland, Surveys, Polls and Research, Health Care & Hospitals, Medical Pharmaceuticals", "Width": 500, "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "thumbnail": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769?max=400", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The US pharmaceutical outsourcing market is the largest market in terms of market value, followed by payer and provider outsourcing.\nMedical billing dominates the US healthcare provider outsourcing market, while contract manufacturing organizations hold the largest share in the US pharmaceutical outsourcing market in the year 2013.\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130307/600769 )The US healthcare BPO market is undergoing significant transformation with the changing landscape of the US healthcare system.\nThe U.S. healthcare payer market has been greatly impacted by the introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\nThe US healthcare payer, provider, and pharmaceutical outsourcing markets are valued at $11.1 billion, $6.8 billion and $65.6 billion, respectively, in the year 2013."}
