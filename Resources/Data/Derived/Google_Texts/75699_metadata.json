Or behind the wheel in a car in midtown Manhattan traffic. Or mingling with revelers at the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square.\n\nThey are the New York Police Department\u2019s plainclothes officers \u2014 a legion of law enforcers with a mandate to blend into everyday life and spring into action at the earliest signs of trouble. It\u2019s a less visible, proactive role that can run risks for police, as demonstrated by last weekend\u2019s shooting of Officer Brian Moore.\n\nPolice officials won\u2019t say exactly how many of the department\u2019s roughly 20,000-officer patrol force turn out each day wearing street clothes instead of the NYPD\u2019s dark blue uniform, though former officers and experts believe it\u2019s well into the hundreds.\n\nThe distinction goes beyond mere apparel. Unlike regular patrol officers whose job revolves around responding to 911 calls, the plainclothes officers are expected to catch criminals in the act \u2014 or even before they act.\n\nPart of the role is to target \u201cthe small segment of the population that commits most of the crime in New York City,\u201d Chief of Department James O\u2019Neill told The Associated Press. Another, he added, is \u201clooking for people who might have guns, and that\u2019s what happened to Brian.\u201d\n\nMoore, 25, and his partner were on patrol in an unmarked Ford Crown Victoria in Queens on the night of May 2 when police say they noticed Demetrius Blackwell on the street grabbing at his waistband. After the officers pulled up near the suspect and Moore identified himself as a police officer, he asked, \u201cDo you have something in your waistband?\u201d authorities said.\n\nBlackwell allegedly replied, \u201cYeah, I got something,\u201d pulled out a handgun and fired three times at the officers, striking Moore in the head and cheek.\n\nThe suspect, who has done prison time for robbery, was later caught and charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe killing follows the January shooting of two plainclothes officers in the Bronx while they were investigating an armed robbery at a grocery store. An intense manhunt ended in two arrests.\n\nAll three officers were part of roving anti-crime units housed in each of the city\u2019s 77 precincts. Similar units are deployed in the subways. The department also uses plainclothes officers when policing New Year\u2019s Eve, parades and protests such as Occupy Wall Street.\n\nThe department has also used the officers in decoy operations \u2014 pretending to be careless subway riders \u2014 in response to spikes in thefts of smartphones and other electronic devices on the subways. But that\u2019s as close as they come to actual undercover work, which involves assuming a false identity as part of an ongoing investigation.\n\nThose in the anti-crime units \u2014 considered a career path to getting a detective\u2019s gold shield \u2014 are selected because they\u2019ve displayed a greater willingness to put themselves in harm\u2019s way and an eye for identifying suspects, said former NYPD commander Kevin Perham.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No NYPD uniform, but big role for plainclothes cops", "author": "Tom Hays", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "No NYPD uniform, but big role for plainclothes cops", "title": "No NYPD uniform, but big role for plainclothes cops", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/no_nypd_uniform_but_big_role_for_plainclothes_cops/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aptopix-nypd-officer-shot-funeral.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No NYPD uniform, but big role for plainclothes cops", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aptopix-nypd-officer-shot-funeral.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "No NYPD uniform, but big role for plainclothes cops", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "No NYPD uniform, but big role for plainclothes cops", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Unlike regular patrol officers whose job revolves around responding to 911 calls, the plainclothes officers are expected to catch criminals in the act \u2014 or even before they act.\nThe killing follows the January shooting of two plainclothes officers in the Bronx while they were investigating an armed robbery at a grocery store.\nThe department also uses plainclothes officers when policing New Year\u2019s Eve, parades and protests such as Occupy Wall Street.\nThey are the New York Police Department\u2019s plainclothes officers \u2014 a legion of law enforcers with a mandate to blend into everyday life and spring into action at the earliest signs of trouble.\nIt\u2019s a less visible, proactive role that can run risks for police, as demonstrated by last weekend\u2019s shooting of Officer Brian Moore."}
