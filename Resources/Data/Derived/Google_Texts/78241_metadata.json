Oth\u00ader polls have shown stronger op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion to the law, however.\n\nBut des\u00adpite their over\u00adall am\u00adbi\u00adval\u00adence to\u00adward the law, voters op\u00adpose ef\u00adforts to de\u00adfund it. Just 34 per\u00adcent think Con\u00adgress should cut off fund\u00ading, and sup\u00adport is even lower when those de\u00adfund\u00ading ef\u00adforts are tied to a gov\u00adern\u00adment shut\u00addown (22 per\u00adcent) or rais\u00ading the debt lim\u00adit (27 per\u00adcent). A wide ma\u00adjor\u00adity, 72 per\u00adcent, op\u00adpose shut\u00adting down the gov\u00adern\u00adment to cut off fund\u00ading the health care law.\n\nThat is con\u00adsist\u00adent with oth\u00ader pub\u00adlic sur\u00adveys, in\u00adclud\u00ading our United Tech\u00adno\u00adlo\u00adgies/Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Con\u00adnec\u00adtion Poll, which have shown Amer\u00adic\u00adans op\u00adposed to the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan strategy of al\u00adlow\u00ading the gov\u00adern\u00adment to shut down if the health care law was not de\u00adfun\u00added or rolled back, even if they op\u00adpose the law it\u00adself.\n\nLook\u00ading ahead to the 2014 elec\u00adtions, Demo\u00adcrats lead Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans on the gen\u00ader\u00adic bal\u00adlot, the poll shows, 43 per\u00adcent to 34 per\u00adcent. Four per\u00adcent of re\u00adgistered voters say they prefer someone else, 2 per\u00adcent wouldn\u2019t vote, and 17 per\u00adcent are un\u00adde\u00adcided.\n\nThe 9-point ad\u00advant\u00adage is the largest Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac has meas\u00adured since the spring of 2009, in the first months of the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion. The yawn\u00ading lead isn\u2019t that in\u00adcon\u00adsist\u00adent with oth\u00ader Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac sur\u00adveys con\u00adduc\u00adted this year: In two Ju\u00adly sur\u00adveys, for ex\u00adample, Demo\u00adcrats held 4- and 5-point leads.\n\nDes\u00adpite the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic ad\u00advant\u00adage on this ques\u00adtion, GOP re\u00adten\u00adtion of the House seems likely at this stage. The gen\u00ader\u00adic bal\u00adlot has over\u00adstated Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic sup\u00adport in the past, and the Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac poll is a sur\u00advey of all re\u00adgistered voters, many of whom won\u2019t cast bal\u00adlots in a midterm elec\u00adtion.\n\nThe 2014 elec\u00adtions will also be con\u00adtested on a dif\u00adfer\u00adent play\u00ading field. Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans en\u00adjoy a struc\u00adtur\u00adal ad\u00advant\u00adage fol\u00adlow\u00ading the dec\u00adade\u2019s re\u00addis\u00adtrict\u00ading pro\u00adcesses, and, in the Sen\u00adate, Demo\u00adcrats have more vul\u00adner\u00adable mem\u00adbers up this cycle. And though the 1995-96 shut\u00addown is widely at\u00adtrib\u00aduted to then-Pres\u00adid\u00adent Bill Clin\u00adton\u2019s reelec\u00adtion, Demo\u00adcrats only picked up two seats in the House \u2014 and lost two Sen\u00adate seats \u2014 fol\u00adlow\u00ading the 1996 elec\u00adtions.\n\nOth\u00ader data show that Demo\u00adcrats\u2019 suc\u00adcess on the gen\u00ader\u00adic bal\u00adlot is more at\u00adtrib\u00adut\u00adable to a col\u00adlapsing GOP brand than im\u00adprov\u00ading im\u00adages of Demo\u00adcrats and their stand\u00adard-bear\u00ader, Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama. Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac finds Obama\u2019s ap\u00adprov\u00adal rat\u00ading is net-neg\u00adat\u00adive: 45 per\u00adcent ap\u00adprove, and 49 per\u00adcent dis\u00adap\u00adprove. And con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Demo\u00adcrats earn a 32-per\u00adcent ap\u00adprov\u00adal rat\u00ading, while three-in-five voters dis\u00adap\u00adprove.\n\nBut Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans in Con\u00adgress have hit a re\u00adcord low, the poll shows. Only 17 per\u00adcent of voters ap\u00adprove of the way GOP mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress are hand\u00adling their jobs, while a whop\u00adping 74 per\u00adcent dis\u00adap\u00adprove. Among in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adents, only 13 per\u00adcent ap\u00adprove, com\u00adpared to 76 per\u00adcent who dis\u00adap\u00adprove.\n\nThe Quin\u00adnipi\u00adac Uni\u00adversity poll was con\u00adduc\u00adted Sept. 23-29, sur\u00advey\u00ading 1,497 re\u00adgistered voters. The mar\u00adgin of er\u00adror is plus-or-minus 2.5 per\u00adcent\u00adage points.\n\nOth\u00ader polls re\u00adleased this week back up the col\u00adlapse of the GOP brand.
