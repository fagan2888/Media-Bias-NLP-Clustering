Work will continue Saturday to secure a 42-foot fishing vessel that sank Friday off the coast of Stonington with 700 gallons of fuel on board.



No one was on board the Marley Gabriella when it sank in 70 feet of water, according to the Coast Guard.



The Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment from Belfast was sent to the area to assess the situation and offer advice for salvaging the vessel.



Fuel appeared to be leaking from the boat's vents, causing a sheen on the water.







The boat's owner hired commercial divers who tried twice to secure the boat's vents to keep the fuel from leaking but weather and darkness hampered the operation, the Coast Guard said.



Divers are expected to return to the area Saturday morning to try again to close the boat's vents and bring the boat back to the surface.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection also responded and used pads to absorb some of the fuel.



The Coast Guard said it is broadcasting a safety message every four hours to alert mariners of the salvage operation.
