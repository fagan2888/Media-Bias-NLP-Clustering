A Hanahan man was arrested Saturday after police say he fired his gun at numerous houses in the Eagle Landing Subdivision.

Herbert Arthur Steerman, of Lark Lane, is charged with shooting under the influence, two counts of discharging a firearm into a dwelling and two counts of discharging a firearm in city limits. He is awaiting a bond hearing at the Berkeley County jail.

No one was injured during the incident, according to Hanahan Police Department Lt. Michael Fowler.

Officers were called to Steermanâ€™s home about 11 a.m. It was believed that he was possibly shooting at an animal, but then turned his weapon to a number of houses on Eagle Landing Boulevard, according to Fowler.

Officers were told that Steerman suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, but Fowler could not confirm whether or not that is true.
